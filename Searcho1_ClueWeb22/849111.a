As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or views. However, I can provide information on how Christians are viewed around the world based on various studies and reports.

First, I need to understand what is being asked. The question is about the global perception of Christians. This likely involves understanding attitudes, stereotypes, and opinions held by people from different cultures and religions towards Christianity and its followers.

To answer this accurately, I should consider diverse perspectives and sources. It's important to note that views can vary greatly depending on geographical location, cultural background, religious beliefs, and historical context.

I recall that Christianity is the world's largest religion, with billions of followers across the globe. However, the way Christians are perceived can differ significantly from one region to another.

For instance, in Western countries like the United States, Canada, and Europe, Christianity has historically played a major role in shaping culture and society. In these regions, Christians are often seen as part of the mainstream, and their beliefs and practices are widely accepted or at least tolerated.

However, in some parts of the world, particularly in countries where other religions dominate, such as the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, Christians may face discrimination, persecution, or be viewed with suspicion.

It's also worth considering that within Christian communities themselves, there is a wide range of beliefs and practices, from liberal to conservative, which can affect how they are perceived by others.

Moreover, the actions of Christian individuals and organizations can influence public perception. For example, charitable work and humanitarian efforts by Christian groups may enhance their image, while controversial stances on social issues could lead to negative views.

Media portrayal also plays a significant role in shaping public opinion. How Christians are represented in movies, news, and social media can impact how they are viewed by non-Christians.

Additionally, political factors can influence perceptions. In some countries, political leaders may align themselves with Christian values, which can affect how Christians are viewed in the context of politics.

It's essential to approach this topic with sensitivity, recognizing that views can be complex and multifaceted.

To get a more comprehensive understanding, I should look for data from reputable sources such as Pew Research Center, which conducts global studies on religion and public opinion.

Let me consider conducting a search to find recent data on this subject.

The Global Religious Landscape
Christians
Christians number 2.2 billion, or about one-in-three (32%) people worldwide. About half of all Christians are Catholic (50%). An estimated 37% of Christians belong to the Protestant tradition, broadly defined to include Anglicans as well as independent and nondenominational churches. The Orthodox Communion, including the Greek and Russian Orthodox, make up 12% of Christians. And people who belong to other traditions that view themselves as Christian (including Christian Scientists, Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses) make up about 1% of the global Christian population. 7
Christianity has spread far from its historical origins and is geographically widespread. Indeed, the vast majority of Christians (99%) live outside the Middle East-North Africa region where Christianity began. The greatest share of the global Christian population is in Europe (26%), followed closely by Latin America and the Caribbean (24%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%). Significant numbers of Christians also live in Asia and the Pacific (13%) and North America (12%). Less than 1% of the world’s Christians are found in the Middle East and North Africa.
Among the six regions analyzed in this study, four have Christian majorities: Latin America and the Caribbean (90%), North America (77%), Europe (75%) and sub-Saharan Africa (63%). Christians live as minorities in the Asia-Pacific region (7%) and the Middle East-North Africa region (4%).
The 10 countries with the largest number of Christians account for about half (48%) of the global Christian population. The largest share of all Christians live in the United States (11%), followed by Brazil (8%), Mexico (5%), Russia (5%), the Philippines (4%), Nigeria (4%), China (3%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3%), Germany (3%) and Ethiopia (2%).
Most Christians (87%) live in countries where Christians are in the majority. Of the 232 countries and territories included in this study, 157 have Christian majorities. However, most of the Christian-majority countries have relatively small populations: about seven-in-ten have fewer Christians than the Christian-minority country of Vietnam (7 million Christians).
Median Age
As a whole, Christians are older (median age of 30) than the overall global population (median age of 28). Among the six regions analyzed in this study, Christians are youngest in sub- Saharan Africa (median age of 19), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (27), Asia and the Pacific (28), the Middle East and North Africa (29) and North America (39). Europe has the oldest Christian population (42).
Christians are older than the general population in four regions: the Middle East and North Africa (where the Christian median is 29 years and the general population median is 24 years), North America (39 vs. 37), Europe (42 vs. 40), and sub-Saharan Africa (19 vs. 18). Christians have the same median age as the general population in Latin America and the Caribbean (27). Christians are younger than the general population in the Asia-Pacific region (28 vs. 29).
Footnotes:
7 As previously noted, this study is based on self-identification. The intent is sociological rather than theological, and no set of beliefs (such as adherence to a particular creed) or practices (such as regular church attendance) is used to define who is a Christian.

The World as 100 Christians
DR. GINA A. ZURLO
Co-Director, Center for the Study of Global Christianity
When the World as 100 People graphic went viral a few years ago, I knew this could be replicated with data on global Christianity. With the help of CSGC research assistant Amanda Perkins and designer Brad Coon, we developed the graphic above and published it on the first page of the World Christian Encyclopedia. There are 2.5 billion Christians in the world – that’s a big number. So big, it can be hard to conceptualize. But 100 is different. You’ve probably been in a room with 100 people. You can probably list 100 people by name. What if those 100 people represented all the beauty and diversity of World Christianity?
If 100 Christians represented all of global Christianity, 67 would live in Asia, Africa, Latin America or Oceania, while 33 would live in Europe or Northern America. Most would be found in urban areas (65) as opposed to rural (35). Linguistically, 16 would speak Spanish as their mother tongue, 10 English, 8 Portuguese, 5 Russian and 3 Mandarin Chinese. Most (64) would be between the ages of 15–64, while 26 would be under 15. Eleven Christians would be illiterate, and 35 would have little to no access to secondary education. Roughly half of Christians would have access to the internet. Fourteen would have no access to safe water, and five would have malaria. Most Christians (79) would live in countries with moderate to high corruption; 35 would live in countries with low development. A typical Christian today is a non-white woman living in the global South, with lower-than-average levels of societal safety and proper health care. This represents a vastly different typical Christian than that of 100 years ago, who was likely a white, affluent European.
The World Christian Encyclopedia describes the friction of Christian diversity with its divisive tendencies, as well as the harmonious balance when Christians work together across differences. There is indeed a “World Christianity” to speak of – as opposed to “Christianities” – and it is a portrait of a complicated yet united whole.
Learn more about the World Christian Encyclopedia and our upcoming conference here.
Technical notes: The World as 100 Christians graphic draws on a number of sources to depict the proportion of various of subjects if the world consisted of 100 Christians. The outer ring of continent, gender, density, age, tradition and language comes mainly from data found in the World Christian Database(WCD ). The inner ring of 12 global issues comes from the intersection of United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) with the WCD’s data on Christianity.

What Percentage of the World Is Christian?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 25, 2020
According to the Religion and Public Life Project at the Pew Research Center, there are 2.18 billion Christians worldwide, which is about 31.6 percent of the world population of 6.9 billion, as of 2010. About 50.1 percent of the total are Catholic, 36.7 percent Protestant and 11.9 percent Orthodox.
Although in the past 100 years the overall quantity of Christians has almost quadrupled, the percentage of Christians has remained roughly the same. However, there has been a demographic shift in the number of Christians from Europe and the Americas to the Asia-Pacific region and sub-Saharan Africa. Whereas in 1910, 93 percent of Christians lived in Europe and North and South America, in 2010 the figure was only 63 percent.
The country with the largest Christian population in 2010 is the United States with 246,780,000 Christians, which is 79.5 percent of its population and 11.3 percent of the world’s population of Christians. The countries ranking next in total number of Christians are Brazil, Mexico, Russia and the Philippines. The countries with the largest proportions of Christian populations are Vatican City and the Pitcairn Islands with 100 percent, followed by Samoa and Romania with 99 percent.
Christianity has by far the largest percentage of adherents of any religion on Earth. It is followed by Islam, with 1.6 billion, or 23.4 percent of the world’s population as of 2010.

Question
What is the percentage of Christians to non-Christians worldwide?
Answer
According to Pew Research Center, Christianity remains the world’s largest religious group at 31.2 percent of the earth’s 7.3 billion people. Next is Islam (24.1 percent), unaffiliated (16 percent), Hinduism (15.1 percent), Buddhism (6.9 percent), folk religions (5.7 percent), other (0.8 percent), and Judaism (0.2 percent).
Pew Research Center defines Christianity as a single religious group, and no set of beliefs or practices was used to define who is a Christian. The study simply used self-identification—if a person claimed to be a Christian, he or she was counted in the “Christian” group.
Within the label of “Christianity” are several subdivisions. Approximately 50 percent of the people labeled Christians identify as Catholic, while 37 percent labeled themselves as Protestant (including Anglicans ). Orthodox communities made up 12 percent of the Christians in the study. Other groups make up the final 1 percent: Mormons, Christian Scientists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What percentage of people in the world are truly Christian, i.e., what percentage of people in the world are trusting in Jesus as personal Savior, by grace alone through faith alone? There is no way to know the answer to that question. Considering Jesus said, “small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it” in Matthew 7:14, it is highly unlikely that the number of true Christ-followers is anywhere near 50% of the world’s population.

Overview
As of 2010, there were 2.2 billion Christians around the world, or about one-in-three (31%) people worldwide. This makes Christianity the world's largest religion. The world’s Christian population is expected to grow to 2.9 billion in 2050. Nearly one-in-three people worldwide (31%) are expected to be Christian at mid-century, the same share as in 2010.
About a quarter of the global Christian population as of 2010 was in Europe (26%), a quarter in Latin America and the Caribbean (25%) and a quarter in sub-Saharan Africa (24%). Significant numbers of Christians also live in Asia and the Pacific (13%) and North America (12%). Less than 1% live in the Middle East-North Africa region, where Christianity began. The regional distribution of Christians is forecast to change considerably by 2050. Europe is no longer projected to have a plurality of the world’s Christians; in fact, only about 16% of the world’s Christians are expected to be living in Europe as of 2050.
About half of all Christians were Catholic as of 2010. An estimated 37% of Christians belonged to the Protestant faith, broadly defined to include Anglicans as well as members of independent and nondenominational churches. The Orthodox Communion, including the Greek and Russian Orthodox, made up 12% of Christians. Other Christian groups, which made up the remaining 1%, include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Christian Scientists and Jehovah’s Witnesses.

So, from the search results, I've gathered some key points about the global perception of Christians. However, I realize that the information provided mostly deals with the demographics of Christians around the world rather than how they are viewed by others. Maybe I need to adjust my search query to focus more on public opinion and attitudes towards Christians.

Let me try another search.

What the World Thinks of Christians
Justin Young
30 Sep 2011
no comments
We’ve all encountered it at some point or another–rolling eyes, dirty looks, the snide comment or some incredulous statement along the lines of, “Oh, give me a break…you’re one of those Jesus freaks?!”  As most Christians who believe that we are doing our best to shine the light of Christ and to impact the world around us for Him, we’re often left scratching our heads, wondering how we got such a bad rap!  One needs to look no further than the nearest television to see the mainstream media’s stereotypical portrayal of Christians as narrow-minded idiots–take shows like Family Guy and The Simpsons, for example. The secular media loves to exploit Christians who fall in the public eye, such as disgraced Colorado Pastor Ted Haggard, and to sensationalize sordid stories involving those carry that the Christian name; take the murderous minister’s wife, Mary Winkler, for example.  Then we have so-called “Christian” groups like the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members picket the funerals of American soldiers, touting that God Himself has caused the deaths of these brave men and women as judgment for America’s acceptance of homosexuality. Lump all of the above in with the highly-publicized Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal or, more recently, polygamist child-molester Warren Jeffs who throws around the name of Jesus, and it’s no mystery how people end up with a skewed view of God, Jesus, Christianity and Christians.
So, what does the average person really think about us and our faith?  This month, I set out on a journey to find the answer.  Eager to hear from the people themselves, I tracked down about a dozen folks who do not claim to follow Christ, and asked them a few basic questions about God, Jesus and Christianity.  Below are those questions, as well as a cross-section of the responses given to each one.
Question 1: Who is God?
Responses to this question ranged from “creator of everything” and “immortality” to “a made-up supreme being”, “does not exist”, and “a delusion”.  My most thorough respondent to each of these questions, a thirty-something woman I will call “Samantha” said, “To me, God has always sort of represented the energy between all living things, from people to animals, to all of nature. Male, female, one or many, I just don’t know. I consider myself agnostic, meaning that I don’t have evidence enough to say whether God exists or doesn’t exist. It doesn’t mean I don’t believe in anything. It just means I can’t be sure and I like to have concrete facts before subscribing to anything. To me, God could be the Christian or Jewish God, or Allah, or a Hindu god, any of hundreds of tribal gods, even Zeus for all I know.”
Question 2: Do you believe in Jesus?
In response to this, I had several people give me an outright “no”, while the more common responses converged along the line of statements such as, “yes, he was a good teacher” and, “I believe that he existed but not that he was God.” One of the more outspoken responses to this question was, “Belief in Jesus Christ as God is leaning on a crutch and not accepting responsibility for your actions. You are a sheep – like the Bible says – a follower. You are being controlled by a system. True salvation is rejecting that system.”
Question 3: Do you think God can be just and loving?
To this question, I had some answer “yes”, some “no”, but most responded with, essentially, “I don’t see why not”.  One person fired off, “Also I read that Bible of yours and did not find many examples of love and justice. Slavery, rape, murder and of course ‘obey and worship me or suffer for eternity’… that’s not justice, that’s insanity.”
Question 4: Do you go to church?  Why or why not?
As I intentionally sought out those who do not claim to be Christians, most answered “no” to this question, giving a general response of “what’s the point?”  “Samantha” said this, “When I was in high school…just before 9/11 (and definitely after), a lot of Current Events started to take over the church’s culture. My parents (and I) both felt that the pastors were using their influence way too often to talk about their own political beliefs, which were by and large extremely conservative. This isn’t exactly fair, since polls will tell you that not all Christians are Republicans. My parents always taught me a message of Jesus’ love and compassion, so hearing about how wrong and awful immigrants were, among many other political opinions, felt way more like we were going to church to learn about the Republican platform cloaked in Christian words than anything actually biblical.”
Question 5: What do you think of Christians?
Here’s where the gloves came off, and not too many bare-knuckle punches were pulled.  Although I got a couple of more positive responses to this question such as, “honest, easy going, friendly, loving, law abiding citizens”, the negatives reigned supreme, with quips such as  “gullible”, “misled” “narrow-minded”, “hypocrites”, “ignorant”, and “full of themselves”.  “Samantha” had this to say, “This is a tough question, so I have a mixed answer. Some of the most incredibly warm, kind-hearted, compassionate and giving people I have ever known are devout Christians, and act as they do because of their faith…I think I speak for much of the non-Christian population when I say that I become a bit wary of someone when they tell me they’re a practicing Christian, in part because I worry they’ll be watching for the opportunity to minister to me or convert me. I have known incredible Christian examples who live their lives according to their faith, and never once tried to convert me; in fact, they’re the entire reason why I say I’m agnostic and not atheist–I think it’s possible that God exists, and I’ve seen the positive effects on these people. I see so many Christians judging me for being liberal politically, or my friends for being gay, lesbian, transgender, etc. or trying to change who we are…I don’t think it’s God or Christianity that is the problem; I think it’s that people, humans, calling themselves Christians have taken what could be a beautiful faith full of love and respect, and have turned it into a way to bully people into doing what a minority thinks is right for everyone.”
A Thoughtful Response
As I’m sure you can imagine, some of these answers were both heartbreaking and burdensome to me, the interviewer, although not surprising.  In John 15:18-19, Jesus Himself said “If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.  The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.” Some of what I heard was obviously coming from out of a hatred for Jesus and His followers, and in examining the above answers, we must consider the source.  We are called by God to be set apart, and to not compromise His truth to appease the world.  As Paul, the writer of Romans, says in Chapter 12, verse 2, “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God’s will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.”
So, what’s a Christian to do when faced with the confused, critical, and sometimes hostile world; a world who Jesus died for and so deeply desires to come to Him?  As we consider our responsibility to be Christ to the lost and dying masses, the scriptural truths found in I Peter 3:15 are ones that will serve us well to prayerfully consider:  “And if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it.  But do this in a gentle and respectful way.  Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ.”
Be Informed
“And if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it.”
Perhaps one of the world’s most valid criticisms of Christians today is that we simply don’t know our Bibles well enough to know what God has to say about things.  In a 2010 Pew Forum study, Mormons displayed a better knowledge of Christianity and the Bible than Evangelical Christians, and Athesists/Agnostics were not too far behind.  In Acts Chapter 17, we read of a group that Paul the Apostle encountered in the city of Berea who, “searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.”  A one-hour sermon, once-a-week is not going to prepare us to effectively share Jesus with others.  We need to dig in to the Bible ourselves to truly be prepared with applicable Bible-based answers to the real questions people have today.  No credibility comes with a response of, “I know it’s somewhere in the Bible”.  However, if we become those believers who know, specifically, where to find the answers in God’s Word, we become sharp tools in His hands to minister to others in a powerful way.
Be Humble
“But do this in a gentle and respectful way.”
We need to remember who we were and where we came from before God so mercifully reached down and rescued us.  Sometimes the very same attitudes and criticisms we now find ourselves surprised and pained to face in dealing with non-believers are the ones we ourselves once held tightly to before coming to Christ.  Being arrogant, being confrontational or becoming angry when trying to share Christ with someone contradicts not only our message, but the messenger Himself.  Even if we are 100 percent correct and “right” in what we are saying, we can simultaneously be completely wrong in how we are saying it.  People respond to empathy, humility and compassion, as well as to someone who takes the time to listen to their concern or point-of-view and to respond in a spirit of grace and peace.  As Ephesians 4:29 says, “Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.”
Practice What You Preach
“Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ.”
The “good news, bad news” about being vocal about our faith in Christ is the accountability that comes along with our public proclamation.  We do more harm than good when we start throwing around Jesus’ name or this-or-that Bible verse, but then turn around and regularly say or do things that completely contradict God and His Word.  Certainly, we are all imperfect people, but a life of hypocrisy is definitely not one that is attractive to a lost sinner.  However, the righteousness, servanthood and joy that overflow from a love relationship with Jesus will be the bright light to the world that our Lord speaks of in Matthew 5:14-15, “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.”
A final encouragement–be ready, be real and be right with God, and watch in amazement how He can use you to turn a critic into a Christ-follower right before your very eyes!

How Many Christians Are In the World? - WorldAtlas
How Many Christians Are In the World?
The cross is the most famous universal symbol of Christianity.
There are an estimated 2.2 billion Christians in the world, which makes Christianity the largest religion on the planet. It is a monotheistic faith where Roman Catholicism is the most prominent denomination. Christianity has its roots in the Middle East. From there, it spread throughout the world through missionaries and colonization. The Bible is considered to be the most sacred text in Christianity. The three largest Christian populations are found in the Americas as well as in Europe.
Countries With the Most Christians
The United States of America
The United States tops the list with an estimated 230 million Christians living in the country. Christianity is by far the most popular religion in the country, with the majority being Protestant Christians. Christianity in the US became firmly ingrained under British rule. Some states were exclusively established as Christian havens such as Pennsylvania. With political independence came religious independence as well. Religious independence saw the proliferation of Protestant Churches, which were keen to resist the influence of the Catholic Church in the US. Beliefs among the diverse denominations have only minor differences. God is revered as the super being across all Christian denominations, and the Bible is the Holy Christian book. The US has no official state religion and the constitution guarantees for the freedom of worship for all. The Christian adherents in the US have been steadily declining while the numbers of people not affiliated to any organized religion have been increasing.
Brazil
Brazil is home to the largest population of Christians in South America, as well as to the greatest number of Catholics of any nation in the world. The country has 180,770,000 Christian adherents. Prevalence of all forms of Christianity stands at 90%. Catholicism in Brazil has its origins with the European settlers, and the denomination was made the official religion of the state in the 19th Century. Catholicism became firmly intertwined with the political and social life of Brazilians. The results of the Catholic influence can be seen today in activities such as festivals based on Catholic doctrines. The constitution of Brazil guarantees for freedom of worship and there are numerous Protestant Churches in the country. Such churches include Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. Evangelical Protestantism has reduced drastically and has led to the dominance of the Roman Church in Brazil. Secularism has also been on the rise in the country.
Mexico
Mexico boasts over 100 million Christians who are primarily Roman Catholics. Prevalence of all forms of Christianity in Mexico stands at 92%. Christianity in Mexico has its roots on the Spanish during their conquest of the region. Protestantism first took root in Mexico in the 1800s and 1900s. Christianity in Mexico is generally tolerant, and different religions exist in harmony. The constitution of Mexico clearly provides for the separation of the church and the state. There is also freedom of religious worship in the country. Growing secularism in the nation has led to a decrease in the number of Christians. Evangelical Christianity has also been on a steady increase while Roman Catholicism has experienced a notable decline in the recent years.
Nigeria
Nigeria accounts for the most Christians of any nation on the African continent, with as many as 107 million adherents. Prevalence of all forms of the religion stands at around 49%, with the dominant type being Protestantism. Christianity in Nigeria is particularly prevalent in the Southern and Central areas of the country. Christianity in Nigeria, as in many African countries, was the result of missionaries and colonization. Christianity denominations in the country include Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, Baptist, Anglican, Church of Nigeria, and Assemblies of God Church. Protestants churches in Nigeria adhere to the foundations of Christianity as other Protestants in other countries but have also adopted different ways of expressing their faith.
Countries With Christian Populations Who Are Growing
Other countries with large Christian populations, and their respective numbers of adherents, include the Philippines with 86 million, Russia with between 66 million to 99 million Christians, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (63 million), Ethiopia (52 million), Italy (53 million), and Germany (47 million). Christianity is expected to increase in numbers, with the highest growth expected to be recorded in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Question
What is the percentage of Christians to non-Christians worldwide?
Answer
According to Pew Research Center, Christianity remains the world’s largest religious group at 31.2 percent of the earth’s 7.3 billion people. Next is Islam (24.1 percent), unaffiliated (16 percent), Hinduism (15.1 percent), Buddhism (6.9 percent), folk religions (5.7 percent), other (0.8 percent), and Judaism (0.2 percent).
Pew Research Center defines Christianity as a single religious group, and no set of beliefs or practices was used to define who is a Christian. The study simply used self-identification—if a person claimed to be a Christian, he or she was counted in the “Christian” group.
Within the label of “Christianity” are several subdivisions. Approximately 50 percent of the people labeled Christians identify as Catholic, while 37 percent labeled themselves as Protestant (including Anglicans ). Orthodox communities made up 12 percent of the Christians in the study. Other groups make up the final 1 percent: Mormons, Christian Scientists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses.
What percentage of people in the world are truly Christian, i.e., what percentage of people in the world are trusting in Jesus as personal Savior, by grace alone through faith alone? There is no way to know the answer to that question. Considering Jesus said, “small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it” in Matthew 7:14, it is highly unlikely that the number of true Christ-followers is anywhere near 50% of the world’s population.

China Has Highest Percentage of Atheists in the World, Gallup Survey Says

China is the country with the least number of people with belief in God while more than 70 percent of people in the world say they believe, according to a survey by Gallup International, which studied 68 countries across the world.
The study, which explored religious tendencies of 66,000 people in 68 countries across the world in 2017, has found that 67 percent of Chinese citizens do not believe in religion; only 9 percent identify as religious, according to The Inquirer.
China is followed by Japan, where 29 percent of the population doesn't believe in God; Slovenia with 28 percent; Czech Republic with 25 percent and South Korea with 23 percent.
Contrary to popular notions, European countries still have large numbers of believers. In Belgium and France only 21 percent do not believe in religion. In Sweden, it stands at 18 percent and in Iceland 17 percent, according to Gallup.
In Thailand — the world's most religious country, according to the survey — 98 percent of the people declare themselves to be religious.
The survey also found that 62 percent of the world's population say they are religious, and 74 percent believe humans have a soul. And 71 percent believe in God; 56 percent believe in heaven, 54 percent believe in life after death and 49 percent believe there's hell.
"Religion is a relevant aspect in the lives of individuals at a worldwide level, even though the history of each country and the levels of education have a considerable influence on the perception of these values," Vilma Scarpino, Gallup interim president, notes.
While the Chinese government routinely arrests and cracks down on Christians, house churches are growing.
ChinaAid President Bob Fu earlier told The Christian Post that "the top leadership is increasingly worried about the rapid growth of the Christian faith and their public presence, and their social influence. It is a political fear for the Communist Party, as the number of Christians in the country far outnumber the members of the party."
Underground churches have been raided, pastors have been arrested, rooftop crosses have been taken down, and human rights activists have been harassed and tortured under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, aimed at suppressing the rise of Christianity in the country.

Home Research Topics Religion Religious Demographics Size & Demographic Characteristics of Religious Groups
Report December 18, 2012
The Global Religious Landscape
Christians
Christians number 2.2 billion, or about one-in-three (32%) people worldwide. About half of all Christians are Catholic (50%). An estimated 37% of Christians belong to the Protestant tradition, broadly defined to include Anglicans as well as independent and nondenominational churches. The Orthodox Communion, including the Greek and Russian Orthodox, make up 12% of Christians. And people who belong to other traditions that view themselves as Christian (including Christian Scientists, Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses) make up about 1% of the global Christian population. 7
Christianity has spread far from its historical origins and is geographically widespread. Indeed, the vast majority of Christians (99%) live outside the Middle East-North Africa region where Christianity began. The greatest share of the global Christian population is in Europe (26%), followed closely by Latin America and the Caribbean (24%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%). Significant numbers of Christians also live in Asia and the Pacific (13%) and North America (12%). Less than 1% of the world’s Christians are found in the Middle East and North Africa.
Among the six regions analyzed in this study, four have Christian majorities: Latin America and the Caribbean (90%), North America (77%), Europe (75%) and sub-Saharan Africa (63%). Christians live as minorities in the Asia-Pacific region (7%) and the Middle East-North Africa region (4%).
The 10 countries with the largest number of Christians account for about half (48%) of the global Christian population. The largest share of all Christians live in the United States (11%), followed by Brazil (8%), Mexico (5%), Russia (5%), the Philippines (4%), Nigeria (4%), China (3%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3%), Germany (3%) and Ethiopia (2%).
Most Christians (87%) live in countries where Christians are in the majority. Of the 232 countries and territories included in this study, 157 have Christian majorities. However, most of the Christian-majority countries have relatively small populations: about seven-in-ten have fewer Christians than the Christian-minority country of Vietnam (7 million Christians).
Median Age
As a whole, Christians are older (median age of 30) than the overall global population (median age of 28). Among the six regions analyzed in this study, Christians are youngest in sub- Saharan Africa (median age of 19), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (27), Asia and the Pacific (28), the Middle East and North Africa (29) and North America (39). Europe has the oldest Christian population (42).
Christians are older than the general population in four regions: the Middle East and North Africa (where the Christian median is 29 years and the general population median is 24 years), North America (39 vs. 37), Europe (42 vs. 40), and sub-Saharan Africa (19 vs. 18). Christians have the same median age as the general population in Latin America and the Caribbean (27). Christians are younger than the general population in the Asia-Pacific region (28 vs. 29).
Footnotes:
7 As previously noted, this study is based on self-identification. The intent is sociological rather than theological, and no set of beliefs (such as adherence to a particular creed) or practices (such as regular church attendance) is used to define who is a Christian. For more information on Christian traditions, see the Pew Forum’s December 2011 report “ Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Christian Population .” (return to text)

While They See Jesus Christ Favorably, Millennials Seem Indifferent To Christianity: Survey
By Olivia Cavallaro Dec 09, 2021 11:32 AM EST
(Photo : Wyron A / Unsplash)
A new survey from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University shows that millennials feel some indifference to Christianity despite viewing Jesus Christ favorably.
The recent survey revealed that a majority or 65% of millennials profess to be Christian. Nationally, the average is 69%. The survey results showed that while 59% of millennials viewed Jesus Christ favorably, they also viewed Christianity as more of a "moral system for being a good person" instead of a "commitment to follow" Jesus Christ.
Christian Headlines reported that according to the report "Millennials in America: New Insights into the Generation of Growing Influence," millennials' indifference to Christianity is caused by several factors, including how they view the Bible and church. Research showed that only half of millennials or 51% viewed the Bible favorably, while only 50% viewed the Christian faith favorably.

Millennials' indifference and ambivalence view on Christianity is also caused by distrust of pastors and the notion that Christians are hypocrites, the report revealed. Another reason is the uncertainty over how the ancient faith could apply to a post-modern society. The report's findings reflect how millennials are slow to accept Christianity, reflecting the results of a previous survey that showed only 4% of millennials today hold a biblical worldview.
The Cultural Research Center's report found that millennials who are disengaged from Christianity were also least likely to engage in Christian practices. Meanwhile, most adults have attended a church service or worship (40%), spent at least an hour reading the Bible (40%), or donated money to a church, religious center or faith-based organization (40%). Conversely, 6 out 10 older adults had participated in religious practices in the last month.
Survey results found that most millennials, despite not being drawn to Christianity, do not consider themselves as atheists. Only one-fourth or 25% of young adults viewed atheism favorably versus 31% who viewed atheism negatively or offered no opinion about it.
Meanwhile, across all generations, millennials had the lowest level when it comes to having a traditional, biblical worldview of who God is with just 35%. Furthermore, a little over half or 56% of millennials believe that moral truth is subjective rather than objective.
The new findings by the Cultural Research Center reflect a similar research conducted earlier this year. The Independent reported in May that more than four out of 10 millennials do not know, believe, or care that God exists. The findings were also conducted by the same research center at Arizona Christian University. The survey on 2,000 American adults at the time found that 57% considered themselves to be Christian.
The Cultural Research Center's research director, Dr. George Barna commented on the fact that most or 24 out of 25 millennials are missing a biblical worldview, suggesting that Christians must "help them understand the role of worldview and then to embrace the biblical worldview."
Dr. Barna added, "Their current reliance upon syncretism-the patchwork perspective on life drawn from competing and sometimes contradictory ideas and often muddled and misguided viewpoints-is detrimental to their well-being."
The research director called upon Christians to "adopt proven biblical truths about life" because he believes that without this kind of decision-making reorientation, "stop-gap measures [are] doomed to fail."

From these search results, I'm getting a mix of demographic data and some insights into public perception. The Pew Research Center reports that Christianity is the world's largest religion, with about 31.2% of the global population identifying as Christian. However, when it comes to public perception, the data is less straightforward.

One article mentions that China has the highest percentage of atheists, with 67% of Chinese citizens not believing in religion, but it doesn't specify how they perceive Christians specifically. Another article discusses a survey where millennials view Jesus Christ favorably but seem indifferent to Christianity, possibly due to distrust in pastors and the perception that Christians are hypocrites.

I need more targeted information on how non-Christians view Christians around the world. Perhaps I should look for studies or surveys that directly ask non-Christians about their perceptions of Christians.

Let me try another search.

The Craziest Statistic You'll Read About North American Missions
An astonishing number of non-Christians in the U.S. and Canada don't know any Christians. Here's why.

										Anthony Behar / Sipa / AP
O ne out of five non-Christians in North America doesn't know any Christians.
That's not in the fake-Gandhi-quote "I would become a Christian, if I ever met one" sense.
It's new research in Gordon-Conwell's Center for the Study of Global Christianity's Christianity in its Global Context, 1970-2020. Missiologist Todd M. Johnson and his team found that 20 percent of non-Christians in North America really do not "personally know" any Christians.
That's 13,447,000 people—about the population of metropolitan Los Angeles or Istanbul—most of them in the United States.
And that number includes atheists and agnostics, many of whom are former Christians themselves and more likely to have close Christian contacts. Without that group, 60 percent of the non-Christian population has no relationships with Christians.
Worldwide, the numbers are much worse: more than 8 in 10 non-Christians do not personally know a Christian. But Christians only make up a third of the world's population. The United States, meanwhile, ranks in the top 10 Christian countries, with 80 percent of the population identifying as Christians.
The biggest factor in explaining why so many North American non-Christians don't know Christians is immigration, Johnson said. The U.S. attracts more Buddhist, atheist, and agnostic immigrants than any other country in the world. It ranks second for Hindu and Jewish immigrants, and seventh for Muslim immigrants.
But immigrants are also keeping the percentage of those who don't know a Christian from going higher. That's because the U.S. also attracts more Christian immigrants than any other country. And the region that sends the most immigrants ...

The Global Religious Landscape
Christians
Christians number 2.2 billion, or about one-in-three (32%) people worldwide. About half of all Christians are Catholic (50%). An estimated 37% of Christians belong to the Protestant tradition, broadly defined to include Anglicans as well as independent and nondenominational churches. The Orthodox Communion, including the Greek and Russian Orthodox, make up 12% of Christians. And people who belong to other traditions that view themselves as Christian (including Christian Scientists, Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses) make up about 1% of the global Christian population. 7
Christianity has spread far from its historical origins and is geographically widespread. Indeed, the vast majority of Christians (99%) live outside the Middle East-North Africa region where Christianity began. The greatest share of the global Christian population is in Europe (26%), followed closely by Latin America and the Caribbean (24%) and sub-Saharan Africa (24%). Significant numbers of Christians also live in Asia and the Pacific (13%) and North America (12%). Less than 1% of the world’s Christians are found in the Middle East and North Africa.
Among the six regions analyzed in this study, four have Christian majorities: Latin America and the Caribbean (90%), North America (77%), Europe (75%) and sub-Saharan Africa (63%). Christians live as minorities in the Asia-Pacific region (7%) and the Middle East-North Africa region (4%).
The 10 countries with the largest number of Christians account for about half (48%) of the global Christian population. The largest share of all Christians live in the United States (11%), followed by Brazil (8%), Mexico (5%), Russia (5%), the Philippines (4%), Nigeria (4%), China (3%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3%), Germany (3%) and Ethiopia (2%).
Most Christians (87%) live in countries where Christians are in the majority. Of the 232 countries and territories included in this study, 157 have Christian majorities. However, most of the Christian-majority countries have relatively small populations: about seven-in-ten have fewer Christians than the Christian-minority country of Vietnam (7 million Christians).
Median Age
As a whole, Christians are older (median age of 30) than the overall global population (median age of 28). Among the six regions analyzed in this study, Christians are youngest in sub- Saharan Africa (median age of 19), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (27), Asia and the Pacific (28), the Middle East and North Africa (29) and North America (39). Europe has the oldest Christian population (42).
Christians are older than the general population in four regions: the Middle East and North Africa (where the Christian median is 29 years and the general population median is 24 years), North America (39 vs. 37), Europe (42 vs. 40), and sub-Saharan Africa (19 vs. 18). Christians have the same median age as the general population in Latin America and the Caribbean (27). Christians are younger than the general population in the Asia-Pacific region (28 vs. 29).
Footnotes:
7 As previously noted, this study is based on self-identification. The intent is sociological rather than theological, and no set of beliefs (such as adherence to a particular creed) or practices (such as regular church attendance) is used to define who is a Christian.

While They See Jesus Christ Favorably, Millennials Seem Indifferent To Christianity: Survey : Mission : Christianity Daily
While They See Jesus Christ Favorably, Millennials Seem Indifferent To Christianity: Survey
By Olivia Cavallaro Dec 09, 2021 11:32 AM EST

A new survey from the Cultural Research Center at Arizona Christian University shows that millennials feel some indifference to Christianity despite viewing Jesus Christ favorably.
The recent survey revealed that a majority or 65% of millennials profess to be Christian. Nationally, the average is 69%. The survey results showed that while 59% of millennials viewed Jesus Christ favorably, they also viewed Christianity as more of a "moral system for being a good person" instead of a "commitment to follow" Jesus Christ.
Christian Headlines reported that according to the report "Millennials in America: New Insights into the Generation of Growing Influence," millennials' indifference to Christianity is caused by several factors, including how they view the Bible and church. Research showed that only half of millennials or 51% viewed the Bible favorably, while only 50% viewed the Christian faith favorably.

Millennials' indifference and ambivalence view on Christianity is also caused by distrust of pastors and the notion that Christians are hypocrites, the report revealed. Another reason is the uncertainty over how the ancient faith could apply to a post-modern society. The report's findings reflect how millennials are slow to accept Christianity, reflecting the results of a previous survey that showed only 4% of millennials today hold a biblical worldview.
The Cultural Research Center's report found that millennials who are disengaged from Christianity were also least likely to engage in Christian practices. Meanwhile, most adults have attended a church service or worship (40%), spent at least an hour reading the Bible (40%), or donated money to a church, religious center or faith-based organization (40%). Conversely, 6 out 10 older adults had participated in religious practices in the last month.
Survey results found that most millennials, despite not being drawn to Christianity, do not consider themselves as atheists. Only one-fourth or 25% of young adults viewed atheism favorably versus 31% who viewed atheism negatively or offered no opinion about it.
Meanwhile, across all generations, millennials had the lowest level when it comes to having a traditional, biblical worldview of who God is with just 35%. Furthermore, a little over half or 56% of millennials believe that moral truth is subjective rather than objective.
The new findings by the Cultural Research Center reflect a similar research conducted earlier this year. The Independent reported in May that more than four out of 10 millennials do not know, believe, or care that God exists. The findings were also conducted by the same research center at Arizona Christian University. The survey on 2,000 American adults at the time found that 57% considered themselves to be Christian.
The Cultural Research Center's research director, Dr. George Barna commented on the fact that most or 24 out of 25 millennials are missing a biblical worldview, suggesting that Christians must "help them understand the role of worldview and then to embrace the biblical worldview."
Dr. Barna added, "Their current reliance upon syncretism-the patchwork perspective on life drawn from competing and sometimes contradictory ideas and often muddled and misguided viewpoints-is detrimental to their well-being."
The research director called upon Christians to "adopt proven biblical truths about life" because he believes that without this kind of decision-making reorientation, "stop-gap measures [are] doomed to fail."

The World as 100 Christians
DR. GINA A. ZURLO
Co-Director, Center for the Study of Global Christianity
When the World as 100 People graphic went viral a few years ago, I knew this could be replicated with data on global Christianity. With the help of CSGC research assistant Amanda Perkins and designer Brad Coon, we developed the graphic above and published it on the first page of the World Christian Encyclopedia. There are 2.5 billion Christians in the world – that’s a big number. So big, it can be hard to conceptualize. But 100 is different. You’ve probably been in a room with 100 people. You can probably list 100 people by name. What if those 100 people represented all the beauty and diversity of World Christianity?
If 100 Christians represented all of global Christianity, 67 would live in Asia, Africa, Latin America or Oceania, while 33 would live in Europe or Northern America. Most would be found in urban areas (65) as opposed to rural (35). Linguistically, 16 would speak Spanish as their mother tongue, 10 English, 8 Portuguese, 5 Russian and 3 Mandarin Chinese. Most (64) would be between the ages of 15–64, while 26 would be under 15. Eleven Christians would be illiterate, and 35 would have little to no access to secondary education. Roughly half of Christians would have access to the internet. Fourteen would have no access to safe water, and five would have malaria. Most Christians (79) would live in countries with moderate to high corruption; 35 would live in countries with low development. A typical Christian today is a non-white woman living in the global South, with lower-than-average levels of societal safety and proper health care. This represents a vastly different typical Christian than that of 100 years ago, who was likely a white, affluent European.
The World Christian Encyclopedia describes the friction of Christian diversity with its divisive tendencies, as well as the harmonious balance when Christians work together across differences. There is indeed a “World Christianity” to speak of – as opposed to “Christianities” – and it is a portrait of a complicated yet united whole.
Learn more about the World Christian Encyclopedia and our upcoming conference here.
Technical notes: The World as 100 Christians graphic draws on a number of sources to depict the proportion of various of subjects if the world consisted of 100 Christians. The outer ring of continent, gender, density, age, tradition and language comes mainly from data found in the World Christian Database(WCD ). The inner ring of 12 global issues comes from the intersection of United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) with the WCD’s data on Christianity.

<|end_search_result|>

I'm starting to see a pattern here. Most of the search results are focusing on the demographic statistics of Christians rather than how they are perceived by non-Christians. It seems challenging to find direct data on non-Christian perceptions of Christians globally. Maybe I need to look for studies on religious tolerance or prejudice, which might include attitudes toward Christians.

Let me adjust my search query accordingly.

The World Value Survey’s Map of Worldwide Racial Intolerance
80 countries were surveyed.
Tod Perry
09.18.17
After the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, and Donald Trump’s xenophobic rise to the top of the Republican presidential race, it’s obvious that the United States still has a problem with race. But is the U.S. more or less tolerant than other countries? According to a 2013 study by the World Values Survey, Americans overall are much more tolerant than the citizens of most other places in the world.
The World Value Survey is a global network of scientists and researchers based in Sweden who study changing values and their impact on social and political life. The group’s researchers asked participants in more than 80 countries what kind of person they’d want as a neighbor. Those who responded that they wouldn’t want “people of a different race” were deemed racially intolerant. The map below was created by The Washington Post to depict how 80 countries responded to the question.

The takeaways:
– Countries in the Middle East and Asia were found to be the least racially tolerant.
– Latin and Anglo countries were the most racially tolerant.
– Jordan and India were the least racially tolerant.
– France was the least racially tolerant country in Europe.

No Matter Where You Are, Religious Freedom Is Getting Worse
A decade of analysis from Pew details what global faith leaders already know: From China to Europe, from the Middle East to the US, persecution is climbing.
Griffin Paul Jackson July 15, 2019  04:00 PM

Good Friday in New Delhi, India.
A head of a US State Department gathering being touted as “the biggest religious freedom event ever,” a new report showcases how persecution is getting worse—especially for Christians, the most-harassed religious group in the world—and becoming more widespread.
Hostility against religious minorities spans longstanding hotspots in the Middle East and North Africa to Western contexts in Europe and the Americas, according to a comprehensive analysis released today from the Pew Research Center.
Christians endured more pushback than any other religious group each year from 2007 to 2017, when they faced harassment in 143 countries (that’s one fewer than in 2016, but markedly higher than before), researchers found.
This week, Sam Brownback, the US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, has organized the second annual Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, a summit in Washington to strengthen international commitments to religious freedom.
“There is no common theology in this discussion, but it is towards a common human right,” Brownback said of the event, which is expected to draw up to 1,000 religious and civil society leaders from around the world. “And that human right is that everybody is entitled to be able to practice their faith peacefully and without fear.”
The recent Pew release builds on earlier reports that looked at year-over-year change and offers a decade-long picture of religious freedom’s global decline—and the need for greater political action to curb the trend.

Christians remain the largest and most harassed faith community, but Muslims are not far behind, with reports of political or social oppression in 140 countries in 2017. Jews, the third-most targeted group, were persecuted in 87 countries, despite having a disproportionately smaller population (14 million) than Christianity (2.3 billion) and Islam (1.8 billion).
The religiously unaffiliated actually saw the largest rise in harassment over the period of the study, hitting a 10-year high in 2017, the most recent year for which data were available.
“Over the decade from 2007 to 2017, government restrictions on religion—laws, policies and actions by state officials that restrict religious beliefs and practices—increased markedly around the world,” stated the researchers. “And social hostilities involving religion—including violence and harassment by private individuals, organizations or groups—also have risen since 2007.”
The most recent data indicate that 52 governments, more than 1 in 4, imposed “high” or “very high” levels of religious restrictions two years ago, up from 40 in 2007. The highest levels of social hostility involving religion were reported in 56 countries by the end of the study, up from 39 at the start.
Big countries like China, Indonesia, and Russia are some of the worst offenders. And Christians are the biggest target.
By the end of the study, China, for instance, had boosted efforts to detain and deport Christian missionaries. And in just the last year, reports from the State Department, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, and the World Watch List have called out China’s dimming record as a violator of religious freedom, citing everything from the shuttering of hundreds of churches and a ban on buying Bibles online to the detainment of up to 2 million Uighur Muslims.
Religious restrictions are rising everywhere, but fastest in Europe
The Pew report uses two 10-point indices to gauge levels of religious repression, one of which measures government restrictions and the other social hostilities. Both metrics are further divided into four categories for a total of eight measuring sticks for religious freedom.
Besides “interreligious tension and violence,” all other measures spiked between 2007 and 2017.
The biggest rise comes in the category of “hostilities related to religious norms,” which refers to harassment and antagonism around things like women not abiding by religious dress codes.
Religious freedom violations are most severe in the Middle East and North Africa, but restrictions and harassment are climbing everywhere. Europe saw the biggest jump in restrictions, with its score doubling over the decade of the study.
Legal limits on religious activities, like efforts to restrict proselytizing and male circumcision, are up dramatically in the continent. In 2007, five countries in Europe had restrictions on things like religious dress and religious symbols. Ten years later, 20 European countries had codified such restrictions.
China has some of the strongest limits on religious activity, and MENA has the worst government harassment, but social hostilities are increasing fastest in Europe, with its score in this category more than quadrupling from 2007 to 2017.
Government favoritism of religious groups increased in every region, including in the Americas. The Middle East and North Africa have significantly higher rates of government favoritism of specific religious groups—19 out of 20 countries in the Middle East have an openly favored religion—but rates are rising around the world.
Islam is the most common state religion: 27 of 43 countries with official religions are Islamic. Just a handful of countries (Greece, Iceland, the UK, and Samoa) make special concessions and offer perks to Christianity not offered to other faiths.
According to Pew’s findings, in only 26 countries (13%) are all religious groups “generally treated the same.”
While regional interreligious tension and violence decreased or stayed the same, it still grew in certain countries like Syria and Ukraine.
The State Department’s summit aims to combat this sort of interfaith feuding. “We want to see really a global grassroots movement around religious freedom,” said Brownback. “We want to get the various faiths to bind together and to stand for each other’s freedom of religion.”
Religious freedom is best in the Americas, but it’s slipping
In all categories, the Americas was the region with the fewest restrictions and hostilities. But even there, all measures point to rising levels of harassment and repression.
Over the period of the study, the number of countries in the Americas with noted government restrictions on religious activities increased from 16 to 28.
In the United States specifically, limits on religious activity and individual or social group hostilities based on religion increased dramatically between 2007 and 2017.
More than 8 in 10 (82%) Americans cite anti-Muslim discrimination in the US, according to a separate Pew study released earlier this year. Anti-Semitism is also up sharply in recent years, especially in the shadow of the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue that killed 11 late last year and a significant rise in hate crimes targeting Jews.
Even Christians are feeling the effect of threats to religious freedom, both social and political. A full half of Americans believe evangelical Christians are subject to discrimination in the US, up 8 percentage points from 2016.
Around the world, the share of countries with high levels of social hostility is ticking upward. Overall restrictions on and hostility toward religious groups remains a significant challenge as, in 2017, 83 countries (42%) reported “high” or “very high” scores in these categories, a figure that remained the same between 2016 and 2017 and falls just below the 10-year high of 43 percent in 2012.
Among the 25 most populous countries, home to more than three-quarters of the global population, China, Iran, Russia, Egypt, and Indonesia have the harshest government restrictions based on religion. The freest of these big countries in terms of religion are South Africa, Japan, the Philippines, Brazil, and South Korea. The United States falls closer to the middle of the group.

Christians are most persecuted group in the world, study says

Zelda Caldwell-published on 05/06/19 - updated on 05/06/19
A report commissioned by British foreign secretary concludes that anti-Christian persecution is nearing genocidal levels.
One third of the world suffers from religious persecution, and Christians as the most persecuted of religious groups, are at risk of disappearing. These are were among the grim conclusions of a report commissioned by British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on the extent of global anti-Christian persecution.
The Anglican Bishop of Truro, the Right Rev. Philip Mounstephen, who conducted the independent review at the request of the government, found that “evidence shows not only the geographic spread of anti-Christian persecution, but also its increasing severity. In some regions, the level and nature of persecution is arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of genocide, according to that adopted by the UN.”
Drawing on research conducted by Pew Research, and the NGOs Aid to the Church in Need and Open Doors, the report found that “the eradication of Christians and other minorities on pain of ‘the sword’ or other violent means was revealed to be the specific and stated objective of extremist groups in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, north-east Nigeria and the Philippines.“
In certain parts of the world, Christianity is at risk of disappearing altogether, the report stated, as the “main impact of such genocidal acts against Christians is exodus.”
Evidence of a dwindling Christian presence includes, is most evident in the Middle East, where the report noted that Christianity is in danger of being wiped out “where its roots go back furthest”:
In Palestine, Christian numbers are below 1.5 percent 33; in Syria the Christian population has declined from 1.7 million in 2011 to below 450,000 34 and in Iraq, Christian numbers have slumped from 1.5 million before 2003 to below 120,000 today. 35 Christianity is at risk of disappearing, representing a massive setback for plurality in the region.
Anti-Christian persecution is global in reach, as the report noted the following instances of persecution and discrimination against Christians around the world:
The bombing of churches in Egypt, Pakistan and Indonesia
State militaries attacking minority Christian communities in Myanmar and the Sudan
The torture of Christians in North Korean and Eritrean prisons and the beatings of Christians in policy custody in India
Mob violence against Christians in the states of Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Telangana
Social persecution and lack of freedom of religion in North Korea, Saudi Arabia, the Maldives, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and China.
Blasphemy legislation in Pakistan, Indonesia and Iran
Religious extremism involving the attack on Christian minorities in India, Myanmar, China, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan
“Given the scale of persecution of Christians today, indications that it is getting worse and that its impact involves the decimation of some of the faith group’s oldest and most enduring communities, the need for governments to give increasing priority and specific targeted support to this faith community is not only necessary but increasingly urgent,” read the initial report. A full report is expected to be presented by the end of June.

Pew and IDOP Agree: Religious Persecution Is Worsening Worldwide
The latest report on government restrictions and social hostilities in 198 nations follows the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church.
Jayson Casper November 10, 2020  11:55 AM

Sri Lankan churches closed in April 2019 following Easter Sunday attacks that killed more than 250 people at three churches and three luxury hotels.
D ictators are the worst persecutors of believers.
This perhaps uncontroversial finding was verified for the first time in the Pew Research Center’s 11th annual study surveying restrictions on freedom of religion in 198 nations.
The median level of government violations reached an all-time high in 2018, as 56 nations (28%) suffer “high” or “very high” levels of official restriction.
The number of nations suffering “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities toward religion dropped slightly to 53 (27%). However, the prior year the median level recorded an all-time high.
Considered together, 40 percent of the world faces significant hindrance in worshiping God freely.
And the trend continues to be negative.
Since 2007, when Pew began its groundbreaking survey, the median level of government restrictions has risen 65 percent. The level for social hostilities has doubled.
Over the past two weeks, Christians prayed for their persecuted brethren around the world.
Launched in 1996 by the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA), the International Day of Prayer (IDOP) for the Persecuted Church is held annually the first two Sundays in November.
This year’s campaign was called One With Them.
“Them” is the 260 million Christians worldwide who face persecution, according to Godfrey Yogarajah, executive director of the WEA Religious Liberty Commission. Eight Christians are martyred for their faith each day.
But Christians are not the only ones who suffer.
Ahmed Shaheed, UN special rapporteur for freedom of religion and belief, said that of the 178 nations that require religious groups to register, almost 40 percent apply it with bias.
“The failure to eliminate discrimination, combined with political marginalization and nationalist attacks on identities,” he said, “can propel trajectories of violence and even atrocity crimes.”
In addition, 21 nations criminalize apostasy.
“Faith has to be voluntary,” Shaheed told CT in an interview conducted in April. “There is no value in faith if it is not free.”
The worst offenders are familiar.
Among the world’s 25 largest nations, India, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Russia had the highest overall levels of both government restrictions and social hostilities.
But while not all of these are autocracies, Pew noted that authoritarian governments lead the way.
Using terminology from the Democracy Index, of the 26 nations ranked as “very high” in government restrictions, 65 percent are authoritarian. And of the 30 nations ranked as “high,” 40 percent are authoritarian, while 37 percent are a hybrid regime with some democratic tendencies.
Denmark was the only full democracy, after banning the Muslim face veil.
Social hostilities are not as straightforward.
Of the 10 nations ranked as “very high,” four are authoritarian, three are hybrid, and three are flawed democracies—India, Israel, and Sri Lanka. And in the 43 nations ranked as “high,” 21 percent are authoritarian, 14 percent are hybrid, 30 percent are flawed, and 12 percent are full democracies.
These included Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Some authoritarian states with high restrictions on religion were successful in tampering social hostilities, such as Eritrea and Kazakhstan. Others, like China, Iran, and Uzbekistan, still recorded moderate social hostilities.
“High levels of government control over religion may lead to fewer hostilities by nongovernment actors,” stated Pew researchers.
But it has not stopped the growth of the church.
The WEA noted that in China, the Protestant church has grown from 1.3 million members in 1949 to at least 81 million members today. The Catholic Church in China has grown from 3 million members to over 12 million during the same 50-year period.
Shaheed, meanwhile, highlighted the 1 million Uighur Muslims held in Chinese “reeducation camps,” as well as China’s restrictions on Falun Gong and Tibetan Buddhists.
But the region with the highest median rank in terms of government restrictions is the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): Eighteen of its 20 countries (90%) rank “high” or “very high.”
Shaheed said 4 are among the 12 nations that criminalize apostasy with the death penalty.
The WEA noted that persecution is better regarded as a consequence of church growth rather than its stimulant. Iraq and Syria are among the Middle East nations where the church has shrunk in size over past decades.
“While persecution brings disaster, it is nevertheless a phenomenon that lies within the sovereignty of God,” stated an IDOP study on Acts 8.
“Persecution does not define the destiny of the church. God does.”
After MENA, Asia-Pacific was the second-highest region in terms of government restrictions. Half of its 50 nations qualified, but it also represented the largest median increase. On Pew’s 10-point scale, China (9.3) and Iran (8.5) led the region, while Tajikistan, India, and Thailand recorded new highs.
Shaheed highlighted Thailand’s surveillance of Muslim groups, as well as Vietnam’s denial of citizenship to Hmong Christians.
There were no evangelical Christians among the Hmong in 1989, the WEA said. But today there are over 175,000, despite “brutal” oppression.
“Persecution does not thwart the purposes of God,” stated the IDOP study.
“Instead it can serve in establishing it, through the obedience and witness of the believing community.”
The Pew report noted that worldwide, social hostilities ticked downward in its most recent survey.
But as with the government rankings, MENA was highest with 55 percent of its nations suffering “high” or “very high” social hostilities. Europe was second with 36 percent, and Asia-Pacific was third with 28 percent.
The Americas ranked lowest in both categories.
And of the world’s 25 largest nations, Japan, South Africa, Italy, Brazil, and the United States had the lowest overall levels of both government restrictions and social hostilities.
Three nations were newly added to the “very high” government restriction list: Iraq, Western Sahara, and Yemen. Four nations were removed: Comoros, Laos, Pakistan, and Sudan, though all remained “high.”
Repeat members from 2017 include: Algeria, Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, among others.
Libya and Sri Lanka, meanwhile, were added to the “very high” social hostilities list, while Bangladesh and Yemen were removed yet remained “high.”
Repeat members from 2017 include: Central African Republic, Egypt, India, Iraq, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Syria, among others.
Meanwhile, Christianity and Islam remain the most harassed religions worldwide, in 145 and 139 nations, respectively. These numbers have risen from 107 and 96 nations, respectively, in 2007.
MENA is the worst region for both. Christians suffer government restrictions in 95 percent of its countries, and social hostilities in 75 percent. Muslims, including Muslim majorities, suffer restrictions in 100 percent of MENA nations and hostilities in 65 percent, respectively.
Jews, harassed in 88 nations, are the only religious group to face more societal hostilities than government restrictions.
Buddhists suffered the highest increase in global harassment, from 17 nations in last year’s report to 24 in this year’s report.
The unaffiliated, including atheists, agnostics, and humanists, had the largest decrease, from 23 nations last year to 18 this year.
Shaheed stressed that proper religious freedom advocacy needs to represent all belief systems. He was pleased with how US officials in the State Department and Ambassador-at-Large Sam Brownback made this a priority.
He also praised the WEA for being “very inclusive.”
“Beyond praying for Christians, IDOP has highlighted the plight of people who belong to other religious groups and of adherents to non-religious worldviews,” wrote Thomas Schirrmacher, newly elected secretary general of the WEA, for IDOP.
“So even though it is a Christian worship service, several governments have taken up the topic of religious freedom for all after years of IDOP in their country, as they know that the topic will not go away.”
Which is the same patience Shaheed shows through the UN.
“Human rights work is like dropping water on a stone,” he told CT. “Given enough time, it will eventually break it down.”

Christian and Muslim Persecution Most Widespread Globally
Insights| Faith & Culture | Jul 19, 2019
By Diana Chandler
Christians and Muslims are persecuted in more countries than any other religious group, Pew Research Center said in a decade-long study showing high levels of persecution in 42% of countries studied.
Christians and Muslims, the largest and most widespread globally of any group, experienced government and/or social religious persecution in 143 and 140 countries respectively, Pew said in the latest installment of its study on religious restrictions around the world. But persecution levels varied among countries.
Study results cover government restrictions and social hostilities based on religion from 2007–2017.
Christians and Muslims suffered the most harassment in the Middle East-North Africa region, the study confirms, while the Asia-Pacific region showed the second highest levels of Christian persecution. Europe came in second in persecution of Muslims.
Christians were persecuted in all 20 countries in the Middle East-North Africa region, in 73% of European countries, and in 60% of countries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas.
“The latest data shows that 52 governments—including some in very populous countries like China, Indonesia and Russia—impose either ‘high’ or ‘very high’ levels of restrictions on religion, up from 40 in 2007,” Pew said in a press release. “And the number of countries where people are experiencing the highest levels of social hostilities involving religion has risen from 39 to 56 over the course of the study.”
While persecution levels have varied within the course of the 10 years the annual report has been compiled, the 10th anniversary of the study allowed Pew to document trends among 198 countries in distinct categories of government restrictions, termed the Government Restrictions Index or GRI, and social restrictions, tracked on a Social Hostilities Index or SHI.
Comprising both the GRI and the SHI, 83 countries or 42% of those studied experienced high or very high levels of overall restrictions on religion, Pew said. The percentage is just below a 10-year peak of 43% in 2012.
“As in previous years, most countries continue to have low to moderate levels of overall religious restrictions in 2017,” Pew said in its press release.
In general, Christians were persecuted in 143 countries in 2017, compared to 107 in 2007. Muslims were persecuted in 140 countries in 2017, compared to 96 in 2007; Jews, 87 countries compared to 51; Others, encompassing such faiths as Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Baha’i, 50 compared to 33; folk religions, 38 up from 24; Hindus, 23 compared to 21; and Buddhists, 19 up from 10. The unaffiliated were persecuted in 23 countries in 2017, Pew said, compared to 3 in 2012, the earliest year the group was studied.
Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus experienced more widespread government harassment, while Jews were among those suffering more social harassment.

Government restrictions
In 2017, about a quarter of countries studied, 26%, showed “high” or “very high” levels of government restrictions including laws, policies and governmental actions restricting religious beliefs and practices, down from 28% in 2016 but up from 20 percent in 2007.
On a GRI index of 1-10, countries registering highest in persecution are China (8.9), Iran (8.4), Malaysia and Syria (8.3), Maldives (8.2), Russia (8.1), Algeria, Egypt and Uzbekistan (8.0), Indonesia and Turkmenistan (7.9), Saudi Arabia (7.8), Eritrea and Vietnam (7.6), and Tajikistan (7.5).
The GRI comprises 20 measures of restrictions including government favoritism of religious groups, highest in the Middle East; government laws and policies restricting religious freedom, which increased globally but remains highest in the Middle East; government limits on activities of religious groups and individuals, which has doubled in Europe but remains highest in the Middle East; and government harassment of religious groups, which has increased in every region since 2007.
Social hostilities
Countries with “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities involving religion, including acts of religious hostility by private individuals, organizations or societal groups, registered at 28% in 2017, short of a 10-year peak of 33% in 2012. Sixty-six countries in 2017 rose on the SHI scale, while 75 countries fell.
Countries ranking highest in 2017 on the SRI scale of 1-10 are India (9.5), Syria (9.0), Iraq (8.8), Egypt (8.5), Nigeria (8.1), Central African Republic and Pakistan (7.7), Israel (7.3), Bangladesh (7.2), Germany, Libya, Somalia and Ukraine (7.1), and Palestinian territories (7.0).
The SHI measures religiously hostile acts based on 13 parameters grouped into categories including hostilities related to religious norms, which rose more in the Americas, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa; interreligious tension and violence, which declined most in the Americas; religious violence by organized groups, highest in the Middle East; and individual and social group harassment, which rose most substantially in the Americas.
Pew terms harassment as an offense against a religious group or person due to their religious identity, and can include being physically coerced or singled out to make life or religious practice more difficult. Harassment ranges from verbal or written acts to physical violence and killings.

Alright, these search results are starting to give me some insight into the global landscape of religious persecution, with Christians being among the most persecuted groups worldwide. However, I'm still looking for information specifically on how non-Christians perceive Christians around the world. Maybe I need to consider that direct data on this may not be readily available, and instead, look for articles or studies that discuss the image of Christians in different societies or the stereotypes associated with Christianity.

Let me try a different approach.
