Alright, so I need to figure out why the 2000 U.S. presidential election was so controversial. I don't remember much about it since I was pretty young back then, so I'll need to do some research to get the details right.

First, I know that in the U.S., presidential elections are held every four years, and the winner becomes the President for that term. In 2000, the main candidates were George W. Bush, who was the Republican candidate, and Al Gore, who was the Democratic candidate.

I vaguely recall that the election was very close, especially in one particular state, and there were issues with the voting process. But I need to understand what exactly happened that made it so controversial.

Maybe I should start by looking up some basic facts about the 2000 election. I can search for something like "2000 US presidential election controversy" to get started.

Why is the 2000 Presidential election so controversial?
Neither the Republican George W. Bush nor the Democrat Al Gore won the 270 electoral votes necessary to outright win the election. The vote was close and came down to whomever won the swing-state Florida, and a certain amount of Florida's votes were in question due to sloppy measures, such as what came to be known as the "hanging chad." The Supreme Court ultimately sided with Bush in a 5-4 decision, which then drew controversy as many questioned the supposed non-partisan nature of the court. Overall, Bush won because of Florida, even though Gore had won the popular vote.

The 2000 election between George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, and Democratic candidate Al Gore remains controversial because the vote between the two candidates was so close. The election was so tight, and only about 500 votes separated the candidates in Florida, the state on which the outcome of the election rested. With so many Florida ballots questionable, the decision as to who actually won landed in the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court decided on Bush by a 5-4 vote, which some people felt divided on party lines, calling into question the supposedly non-partisan nature of the nation's highest court. If the vote had been 9-0 or 8-1, it would have been less controversial. The split vote, however, revealed the Supreme's Court uncertainty.
Further, the election was controversial because some methods of counting the ballots gave Florida to Gore and because Gore won the popular vote nationwide.
Finally, the impact of third party Green candidate Ralph Nader created controversy, with some contending that his campaign cost Gore the votes he needed to win Florida and others arguing that the election would not have been so close if Gore had not fumbled on his own.
Since elections have consequences, and since the U.S. has a strong ideological commitment to universal suffrage and democracy, the 2000 election left many people uneasy.

The 2000 election was between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore, as well as several independent candidates. The election was controversial in the sense that no candidate won the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election outright; this controversy was caused by a faulty Florida ballot. Some people who meant to vote for another candidate really had their votes counted for George W. Bush. There was also the question of the punch cards used in the balloting process; when the election was under review, the public saw the sloppy ballots; the term "hanging chad" entered popular vocabulary that fall. When the lower courts ruled that George W. Bush won Florida and thus the election, Al Gore's campaign team challenged the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, where he ultimately lost. While Al Gore won the popular vote, George W. Bush won the electoral vote due to the Florida ballot, and soon many election commissioners began to look into digital ballots.

Introduction
The US Presidential Election of 2000 featured George W. Bush and Al Gore.  It will go down in history as one of the most closest elections¡¦ in US history.  It also goes down as one of the most controversial.  The final decision was based on just a few hundred votes in Florida.  The controversy began when the media prematurely declared the winner twice based solely on exit polls.  They finally conceded that the Florida count was just too close to predict.  It would take a month before the election was ultimately certified after numerous court challenges and vote recounts.  Republican candidate George W. Bush was declared the winner of the Florida¡¦s 25 electoral votes.  This was a victory by a razor thin margin of popular …show more content…
As in the past, the media was covering the all important election.  They had always relied on exit polls as the polls closed across the nation.  In reality, the Florida results were just too close to call.  Nevertheless, that did not stop the media from doing so.  Not once, but twice, major news media outlets were erroneous in their report.  Around 8pm, it was declared that Al Gore was the projected winner of the electoral votes in the state of Florida.  However, a couple of hours later, the projection was retracted and restated as Florida as being too close to call.  Then, just after 2am on November 8, the mistake was made for a second time.  The major networks declared George W. as the winner.  This even led to Al Gore calling the Governor to concede.  However, as Gore prepared to address his supporters in Nashville, Tennessee, he was alert to the shrinking numbers in Bush¡¦s lead.  The final total was now less than one half of a percent lead in favor of Bush.  That immediately calls for a recount of votes under state law.  Subsequently, Gore called Bush and retracted his concession.  It wasn¡¦t over yet!  One thing was, Al Gore had prevailed in the popular vote but without Florida¡¦s tally, the electoral vote was up in the air.  The election wasn¡¦t over and the recounts began.

Hanging Chad Controversy in the U.S. Presidential Election of 2000 - Opinion Front
Hanging Chad Controversy in the U.S. Presidential Election of 2000
Home Uncategorized
The Presidential Elections of 2000 was a close race between Al Gore and George W. Bush. It was mired with controversy over the dispute of incompletely punched votes. This article tells you about the ‘hanging chad’ controversy related to this election.
Did You Know?
The ‘Hanging Chad’ controversy of 2000 was preceded by the elections in 1990 for a House of Representatives seat in Illinois. It resulted in the victory of Penny Pullen over Rosemary Mulligan, due to 8 dimpled chads that exhibited voter intent.
Presidential elections are known to be a tight race, with both candidates vying for the win. Both try every trick in the book to garner public support on their side, with the candidates visiting the states more often as the elections come to a close. But swing states are a special case, where the vote can go either way, and Florida was such a place which heated up the Presidential Election of 2000.
The contenders were George W. Bush, the former governor of Texas and son of former President George H. W. Bush – the Republican candidate, versus Al Gore, the then Vice President of the Clinton Administration and an advocate of the green revolution – the Democratic candidate. All the votes were counted via Votomatic machines after they were punched on a butterfly ballot. Butterfly ballots are papers with the names of the candidates on one side, and the issues on the other, with the essential vote being punched in the middle of the paper. The race was almost decided, except that many votes were considered a miscount due to them being half punched, which resulted in incomplete votes or hanging chads.
What Does Hanging Chad Mean?
Mainframe computers, in a time before any programming language was created, needed to be fed instructions using punch cards. These punch cards, after getting punched, would leave behind confetti or bits of paper, some of which would still be hanging onto the card. These are referred to as hanging chads. Chads that would still be stuck to all four corners of the card, even after being punched, were called dimpled chads, or pregnant chads.
The Controversy
The results of the presidential race of 2000 were close, ending in a tie of 242 – 242 between the two candidates. The presidency would be decided by the electoral votes in Florida. Many votes had gone in favor of Bush, and Gore was ready to concede, until Bush’s lead starting going down. Bush had a lead of only 1,700 votes, in a vote cast out of 6 million. In such a close call, Florida law dictates that a recount take place.
After the recount was concluded, Bush only had 300 additional votes from his previous tally, and more than 17,000 votes were discarded since the senior citizens in the county couldn’t understand the butterfly ballot, and voted for the wrong candidate instead. Some of the discarded votes still had hanging chads. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris was ordered by the Supreme Court to finish the counting of the votes by November 26.
This led Al Gore and his team to file a case in the Supreme Court demanding a manual recount of the votes, since the machines couldn’t be trusted with the job. While the Republican Party led by George W. Bush counter-sued that manual recounting would lead to human error and vote tampering, and stood against the decision. The Bush team also filed suits regarding overseas absentee ballots having partially poked holes that had voter intent, and shouldn’t be discarded. This was the hanging chad controversy, which loomed over the Presidential Elections of 2000.
The End
In order to meet the deadline, the Secretary of State’s office was open on 26th November. The final results of the Broward and Palm Beach counties were announced, with Bush getting a lead of 537 votes, and winning Florida’s 25 electoral votes. Al Gore, on the other hand, refused to concede defeat, and cited that some counties hadn’t counted thousands of votes due to the Republicans blocking the process.
The US Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides, and announced its decision on December 4. It rejected Gore’s argument, and set the date of the final appeal on December 8. But it was all to no avail, and the Florida House of Representatives voted 79 – 41 in favor of Bush.
Although Gore was the popular choice, the votes were in the favor of George W. Bush. On December 18, 2000, the Electoral College met and voted for their President. On January 6, 2001, Congress met in a joint session, and declared George W. Bush the 43rd President of the United States. Till date, Florida’s counting process is looked upon with suspicion.

Answers will vary but should include ideas such as these:
The 2000 election showed that the Electoral College does not always reflect the popular vote.
The person with the most votes might not win the election.
Certain states will get more attention from presidential candidates than others. For example, a state with a large population will have a greater impact on the election than a state with a small population.

Alright, so I've got some information here about the 2000 U.S. presidential election controversy. From what I can gather, the main issue was the closeness of the election, particularly in the state of Florida, which ended up being decisive. Let me try to piece this together step by step.

First, the candidates were George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, and Al Gore, the Democratic candidate. The election was very tight, and the outcome hinged on Florida's electoral votes. There was a problem with the voting process in Florida, involving something called "hanging chads" from punch-card ballots. It sounds like some votes weren't properly recorded because the holes weren't fully punched through, leaving bits of paper still attached, hence the term "hanging chads."

This led to disputes over how to count these incomplete votes and whether they should be considered votes for a particular candidate. Because the difference in votes was so slim, every vote mattered, especially in Florida. There were calls for recounts, and the whole thing got tied up in court battles.

I remember from one of the documents that the Supreme Court eventually got involved and made a decision that effectively ended the recount process, allowing George W. Bush to be declared the winner. This was controversial because some people felt that the Supreme Court interfered in what should have been a state matter, and there were questions about the fairness of the process.

Also, it's mentioned that Al Gore actually won the popular vote nationwide, meaning more individual voters cast their ballots for him than for Bush, but because of the way the Electoral College works, Bush ended up with more electoral votes and thus won the presidency. This discrepancy between the popular vote and the electoral vote added to the controversy.

Another point that came up was the influence of third-party candidates, like Ralph Nader, who some argue siphoned votes away from Gore, particularly in key states like Florida, which might have changed the outcome if those votes had gone to Gore instead.

So, to sum it up, the 2000 election was controversial because of:

1. The extremely narrow margin of victory in Florida, leading to disputes over vote counting and recounts.

2. The involvement of the Supreme Court in stopping the recount process.

3. The fact that the candidate who won the popular vote didn't win the electoral vote.

4. The potential influence of third-party candidates.

All of these factors combined to make the 2000 election one of the most contentious and controversial in U.S. history.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The 2000 U.S. presidential election was controversial due to the closeness of the vote in Florida, disputes over vote counting and recounts, Supreme Court intervention, the discrepancy between the popular and electoral votes, and the influence of third-party candidates.}} \]
