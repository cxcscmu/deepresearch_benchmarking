So I've come across this term "velocity of money" and I'm trying to understand why it has been declining. First off, I need to know what the velocity of money is. From what I recall, it's a measure of how quickly money circulates in an economy. It tells us how often one unit of currency is used to buy goods and services within a specific time period. So, if the velocity is high, it means that money is changing hands rapidly, which might indicate a thriving economy. Conversely, a low velocity could suggest that people are holding onto their money and not spending as much.

But why has it been declining? I need to look into this. Maybe there are some economic factors or changes in consumer behavior that are causing this trend. Let me think about possible reasons.

First, perhaps during economic downturns, people become more cautious and spend less, which could slow down the velocity of money. If there's uncertainty about the future, people might save more and spend less, keeping their money in banks or other savings vehicles.

Second, could interest rates play a role? If interest rates are low, the opportunity cost of holding money is lower, so people might be more willing to hold cash or liquid assets instead of investing or spending. On the other hand, if interest rates are high, people might be incentivized to lend or invest their money rather than hold onto it.

Third, maybe there are structural changes in the economy, such as increased inequality, which could mean that a larger portion of wealth is held by a smaller group of people who tend to save more. This could reduce overall spending and thus lower the velocity of money.

Fourth, the rise of digital payments and electronic money might be affecting how quickly money changes hands. With easier access to credit and faster transactions, perhaps the velocity should be increasing, but maybe other factors are outweighing this effect.

Fifth, demographic changes, such as an aging population, could lead to increased savings and reduced spending, thereby decreasing the velocity of money.

I need to verify these thoughts with some data and expert opinions. Maybe looking at some economic studies or articles on this topic would help. Let me try to find some reliable sources to get a better understanding.

In the United States, the velocity of both the M1 and M2 money supplies has been declining for over a decade.
The decline in the velocity of M1 could be explained by the shift away from cash to cards and online payments.
What are the causes and implications of the decline in the velocity of M2?
Does it signify that the money supply is growing faster than GDP? If so, is real GDP declining? Does it indicate some sort of lack of liquidity? How does this relate to interest rates?
Thanks!

The decline in money velocity is due to enormous monetary injections, which mostly sat in recipient bank accounts and had no effect on the real economy. Under the Keynesian and monetarist theories that central banks operate upon, an increase in money supply should ease liquidity constraints and allow the economy to resume growth. In reality not much further growth was possible, likely because of the stagnation in conventional oil production.
To answer your questions:
Yes
Not yet
No, it indicates a lack of viable uses for the cash
Interest rates fell because of the relatively small decrease in banks balance sheets coinciding with a sharply declining return on capital, and thus diminishing incentive for investors to leverage, causing increasing supply relative to demand for credit

The U.S. decline in money velocity - USC Economics Review
The U.S. decline in money velocity
By: Connor Demsher
On: April 15, 2021
In: Domestic politics, Theory, philosophy and history, United States
In the United States, the velocity of money has fallen into a 20-year downward spiral as the Federal Reserve has imposed a multitude of disinflationary policies. The decline has been constant, until the global COVID-19 pandemic hit which further propelled the downturn. This begs the question: what should America expect in the near future? As we approach the second quarter of the year, the velocity of money has only continued to plummet prompting people to wonder whether this may lead to a rise in inflation. Surges in inflation are not likely, the core inflation rate during peak COVID-19 lockdowns fell by 0.4 percent, and the US headline inflation rate remained a negative 1.1 percent. Money velocity rates decreasing serve as a function of the American consumer saving preferences versus spending during the pandemic. It’s important to note that money velocity is constantly changing, and should inflationary pressures start to rise to parallel an economic recovery, the Federal Reserve will taper its balance sheet to prevent excessive inflation.
Money velocity is calculated on a quarterly basis and is a function of calculating the ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to the domestic money supply: V=PQ/M. In simpler terms, it is a measure of the frequency in which one unit of currency, or “money”, is used in transactions or purchased domestically-made goods or services. Money velocity is constantly changing on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and changes to money velocity infer two main possibilities: how quickly the economy as a whole is growing or shrinking, and the rate at which money supply is increasing or decreasing. As a result, the velocity of money aids economists in predicting the overall strength of the economy, alongside the willingness for consumers to spend money. This year has also seen an increase in money supply; “dollar bills and coins” distributed via the Federal Reserve Bank and U.S. Treasury into the economy, making up the total money available in the U.S. economy at a point in time. This year’s increased money supply and decreased money velocity form an inverse relationship. Coronavirus economic relief efforts aided money supply growth, while fewer transactions were made throughout the economy due to consumer savings increasing from economic uncertainty, ultimately decreasing money velocity. With these changes in the circulation of money available in the U.S. economy, the level of commodity prices changes, according to the quantity theory of money.
Now that we understand the definition, we can begin to unpack what the decrease in money velocity indicates. The last 20 years’ steady decline in money velocity is indicative of a shrinking economy. Furthermore, the rapid drop off of money velocity in 2020 also results in several uncertainties: Will the economy have a further downturn? Is it likely inflation will surge as a function of increasing the money supply? How quickly will consumer spending levels bounce back? In response to the coronavirus pandemic, there have not only been changes in the monetary policy but also implementations of Federal stimulus spending. This has caused the U.S. money supply to grow exponentially amidst 2020, as much as 6.7 percent in April and 5.0 percent in May. This leaves the U.S, with an increase of over 23 percent year-on-year money supply from 2019, almost double the prior peak money supply growth rate. The surging of the money supply growing at a rate higher than an upward-facing economy is the direct result of declining money velocity. Yet, the inverse relationship between increasing money supply growth and declining money velocity is a large red flag for possible future inflationary issues.
Over $2 trillion of stimulus aid was inserted into the U.S. economy this year, which led many to think that inflation rates leading into 2021 will exceed the typical year-on-year inflationary growth. Looking at economic relief efforts, the Federal Reserve was very responsive. Reliefs included purchasing $3.5 trillion in treasuries, corporate bonds, alongside mortgage-backed securities.  However, the effects of the coronavirus relief funds are stagnant in regards to the inflation surge. With the United States going on quarantine lockdown, demand amidst many different sectors has decreased, alongside pricing. Spending rates have also decreased as Americans are scared for the unknown future of the economy due to rising rates of unemployment while saving rates have increased to as high as 13.1 percent in early 2020. With the quantity theory of money historically showing that a faster money supply growth than GDP growth leads to inflation, the coronavirus stimulus-response may lead many to think of the long-term implications of inflation (growth of money supply-growth of output).
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts GDP to grow 5.4 percent in 2021, which would help counteract the negative 3.5 percent loss in real GDP in 2020. A rise in 2021 GDP growth of this stature would lead to excess demand, thus causing high inflation, however with continual re-opening of the economy, the paralleled surge in spending to further stimulate the economy would put inflationary pressures at ease. A quick glance back into the 1957 influenza pandemic can reflect a certain level of correlation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Influenza took the world by storm and affected not only individual livelihoods but also the U.S. economy in a large way. A nine-month recession took place shortly after and inflation actually began to weaken, causing no large surge in long-term inflation levels.
Now, looking forward there is a chance measured inflation may ebb and flow, yet in moderation with supply chain distribution and pent-up demand .  However, the real indicator of what inflation will look like moving forward is going to come down to the American consumer’s spending and confidence levels. Further scientific research and the COVID-19 vaccine is a promising indicator to get Americans back out into the economy, increase spending levels, and ultimately juxtapose the long-term thought-to-be implications of money supply growth in 2020 leading to excessive-high inflation.

CHART OF THE DAY: The velocity of money and recession
Sep. 14, 2020 by Joseph Brusuelas
One long-held nostrum in economics is that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. For years, some economists focused on growth in the money supply and the velocity of money, which is the ratio at which money changes hands, to ascertain the direction of growth and risks to the outlook from inflation.
Over the past three decades, the velocity of money has generally declined as the Fed has imposed disinflationary policies.
Over the past three decades, the velocity of money has generally declined as the Federal Reserve has imposed disinflationary policies, so the measure has fallen out of favor as a useful way to predict the direction of the economy.
Today, the broad and deep shock unleashed by the pandemic has caused the velocity of money, which I define as the price level times the number of transactions divided by the money stock, to decline to a modern low of 1.1.
So the change in the velocity of money is generally a function of two things: the pace of growth in the economy and growth in the money supply. Despite strong M2 growt h, the velocity of money has declined sharply.
This would tend to suggest that growth will remain quite slow once the initial rebound of the economy reopening passes. Moreover, despite the robust increase in fiscal and monetary policy to prevent a greater economic catastrophe, that risk to the outlook remains skewed toward disinflation or outright deflation in the near to medium term.
Readings of velocity at these levels also imply generous fiscal space and room for further unorthodox monetary policy by the Fed to address the current shock and in the post-pandemic economy. Time passes; things change.

Summary
Money velocity is at a 60-year low, but it does not necessarily imply very sluggish real economic activity.
Money velocity has declined due to as robust increase in M1 and M2 relative to the real GDP.
There is ample liquidity in the financial system as indicated by banks excess reserves with the Fed and asset classes will continue to move higher on liquidity support.
There is no doubt in my mind the real economic activity has stabilized to a large extent even when the economic might still need the support of Fed's expansionary policies to continue growing. A deeper look into the employment report (beyond the headline unemployment) provides some insights on the point that there might still be some spots of concern in the economy.
However, on an overall basis, the economy looks resilient and has recovered well from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of 1929.
Even with economic recovery, there are few indicators that are at multi-year lows. One of the economic indicators that I have closely followed in the past is the money velocity. I am of the view that the money velocity is a good indicator of real economic activity as investors need to look beyond the headline numbers published by the government.
The first chart below gives the velocity of M1 money stock and it is clear that velocity of M1 money stock is at its lowest level since 1975.
The second chart below gives the velocity of M2 money stock and it is clear that the velocity of M2 money stock is at its lowest level since the data was first recorded in 1959.
Before talking about the factors and reasons, the statement below come from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis on the important of money velocity -
The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. The frequency of currency exchange can be used to determine the velocity of a given component of the money supply, providing some insight into whether consumers and businesses are saving or spending their money.
Given the above description, the general conclusion is that an increase in money velocity is indicative of a strong real economy and a decline in money velocity is an indication of a weak real economy where money is not changing hands at a robust pace.
However, the above statement and the charts would then imply that economic activity (as measured by M2) is weakest since 1959. This is certainly not the case and the reason is clear from the explanation below.
According to Investing Answers, the equation for GDP with money velocity is as follows -
GDP = Money Supply x Velocity of Money
In other words, the velocity of money would be GDP divided by the money supply.
In the above equation, if GDP growth is at a slower pace as compared to the money supply, the money velocity will decline even if GDP growth is stable.
The negative point here is that more of M1 and M2 are needed to fuel a smaller GDP growth while the positive point here is that the real economic activity is certainly not at levels indicated on first sight by the money velocity data.
To put things into perspective, the charts below provide the surge in M1 and M2 money stock after the financial crisis.
Both M1 and M2 have surged and this has translated into lower M1 and M2 money velocity even when the GDP growth has been robust in the recent past.
My point is further explained by the chart below that gives the excess reserves of depository institutions with the Fed.
In the last few years, the excess reserves of banks with the Fed have swelled and the conclusion is that banks have been conservative in difficult times. While the policymakers pursued expansionary monetary policies, the banks have been risk averse. Therefore, the liquidity flow into the real economy has been restricted by conservative banks. This links with the point that the growth in money supply does not reflect completely in terms of growth in economic activity.
Considering these points and charts, it is clear that the decline in money velocity is not directly related to "very low" economic activity. On the contrary, I believe that as confidence is restored in the economy, credit growth is likely to be robust and that will trigger further economic growth.
I would still remain cautious and watch for the impact of a potential interest rate hike on the liquidity and economic scenario. From an investment perspective, a high level of liquidity in the financial system is positive for equities (SPY ). A strong liquidity in the financial system is also good for gold (GLD) considering a medium to long-term investment horizon.

The Velocity of Money and Low Inflation in the Economy
What Is the Velocity of Money?
The velocity of money is an important concept linked to many central topics of macroeconomics like: the money supply, money demand, inflation, price levels, circulation, and gross domestic product (GDP). The velocity of money is the number of times a unit of money (e.g. a dollar) is spent in a period of time, usually a year. The velocity of money measures the speed of circulation of money in the economy.

Factors Affecting the Velocity of Money in Circulation
Money circulation is the use of money in exchanges for goods and services. Value that is tied up in assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate does not contribute to money circulation. Money, whether cash or digitally accessible through a bank, is needed in everyday life for purchases. The need to make such purchases determines the money demand. Money demand can be increased by an increase in price levels or by a decrease in interest rates, which makes savings, stocks, and bonds less appealing as financial assets. An increase in money demand causes an increase in money circulation and so an increase in the velocity of money. Correspondingly, an increase in interest rates or a decrease in price level (deflation) decreases money demand and the circulation of money.
The exchange of money in markets is what circulates money.
There are also non-monetary factors which can affect the circulation of money. The ease of use of the money (is cash usable, is a card?), the convenience and locations of financial institutions like banks (how easy is it to get your money?), the population density and overall level of economic activity (do people spend on leisure or only the necessities?) can all affect the circulation of money. Generally the growth of the economy through growths in the population and novel innovations and sectors are all associated with increases in the circulation of money. For example: the internet has greatly increased the ease of many kinds of transactions for goods and services, like books and education!
How To Calculate Velocity of Money Using the Equation of Exchange
We can understand the velocity of money by understanding its role in the quantity equation of exchange:
$$MV = PY $$
{eq}M {/eq} is the quantity of money in the economy. It is equivalent to the money supply and money demand, when they are in equilibrium. This equilibrium can be temporarily disturbed by changes in the money supply made by the government (in the U. S., this is the Federal Reserve). {eq}PY {/eq} is the nominal GDP (gross domestic product) and {eq}V {/eq} is the velocity of money. GDP measures the monetary value of all goods and services in an economy. If we divide the GDP by the quantity of money in the economy, then we calculate the velocity of money. Say the GDP is 8 trillion dollars and the quantity of money in the economy is 2 trillion dollars, then the velocity of money is 4. This means that the average dollar is used in 4 transactions per year.
The Velocity of Money Formula
If we rewrite the formula for the velocity of money, we can see how changes in the quantities on the right side of the equation affect the velocity of money:
$$V = \frac{PY}{M} $$
If we hold the quantity of money fixed, as the GDP increases then so does the velocity of money. There are more exchanges happening per quantity of money. On the other hand, if we hold the GDP fixed, as the quantity of money increases the velocity of money decreases. There is a greater quantity of money per exchange. Since GDP represents productivity, we can say that generally productivity increases the velocity of money. However, since we are dealing with nominal and not real GDP, increases in GDP can also be due to increases in the price level, also known as inflation. Inflation that occurs without an increase in the money supply increases the velocity of money: the average amount of money used in an exchange rises with the prices. Since the money supply determines the quantity of money, we can say the creation of more money by the central bank decreases the velocity of money.
Frequently Asked Questions
Why is the velocity of money so low?
Velocity of money becomes low when there are less exchanges for goods and services. This can be due to a reduction in the GDP or an increase in the money supply in a state of low inflation.
What happens if the velocity of money increases?
If the velocity of money increases and there is no change in the money supply, the increase in money demand will drive prices higher. This inflation increases the nominal GDP.
How do you calculate the velocity of money?
The velocity of money is calculated by dividing the nominal GDP by the quantity of money in the economy. The quantity of money in the economy is the money supply, which is determined by the central bank.
What is a velocity of money example?
A simple example of calculating the velocity of money: there is one transaction in the economy in a year, for a total of 4 trillion dollars. If the money supply that year is 100 billion, then the velocity of money is 40.
What is meant by the velocity of money?
The velocity of money is the rate of circulation of the money in an economy. It is the fraction of money that is used in a year.

Alright, so I've got some information here about the velocity of money and why it's declining. Let's try to make sense of it.

First, from Doc 1 on the Economics Stack Exchange, there's a question about the implications of declining money velocity in the U.S., specifically regarding M1 and M2. The answer provided suggests that the decline is due to enormous monetary injections that mostly stayed in bank accounts without affecting the real economy. It mentions that under Keynesian and monetarist theories, increasing money supply should ease liquidity constraints and promote growth, but in reality, growth wasn't possible because of stagnation in conventional oil production. The answer also addresses whether the decline in money velocity signifies that money supply is growing faster than GDP, which seems to be the case, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of liquidity; instead, it might suggest a lack of viable uses for the cash. Interest rates fell due to relatively small decreases in bank balance sheets and diminishing incentives for investors to leverage, leading to increased supply relative to demand for credit.

From Doc 2 on the USC Economics Review, it discusses the U.S. decline in money velocity over 20 years, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It explains that money velocity is calculated as GDP divided by the money supply (V = PQ/M) and is a measure of how frequently money is used in transactions. The article notes that money velocity has been decreasing steadily, and during the pandemic, it dropped further due to increased savings and reduced spending. Despite a significant increase in money supply due to stimulus efforts, inflation hasn't surged as some might have expected. The core inflation rate fell during peak lockdowns, and the headline inflation rate remained negative. The author suggests that the decrease in money velocity is due to consumers saving more during economic uncertainty. They also mention that as the economy recovers, if inflationary pressures rise, the Federal Reserve will adjust its balance sheet to prevent excessive inflation.

Doc 3 from The Real Economy Blog by RSMUS.com provides a chart showing the velocity of money at a modern low of 1.1, attributing this to the pandemic-induced slowdown. It explains that the velocity of money is the ratio of the price level times the number of transactions divided by the money stock. The article notes that despite strong M2 growth, the velocity of money has declined sharply, suggesting that growth will remain slow even after the economy reopens. The author implies that the risk to the outlook remains skewed toward disinflation or outright deflation in the near to medium term. Readings of velocity at these low levels indicate that there is still fiscal space and room for further unconventional monetary policy by the Fed to address the current shock and the post-pandemic economy.

Doc 4 on SeekingAlpha.com analyzes why money velocity continues to decline. The author points out that money velocity is at a 60-year low but argues that this doesn't necessarily imply very sluggish real economic activity. Instead, the decline in money velocity is attributed to a robust increase in M1 and M2 relative to real GDP. The author explains that if GDP growth is slower than money supply growth, money velocity will decline, even if GDP growth is stable. The article provides charts showing the surge in M1 and M2 money stock after the financial crisis and the excess reserves of depository institutions with the Fed, indicating that banks have been conservative in lending, restricting the flow of liquidity into the real economy. The author believes that as confidence returns, credit growth will pick up, stimulating further economic growth. However, they remain cautious about the impact of potential interest rate hikes on liquidity and the economy.

Finally, Doc 5 from Study.com offers a basic explanation of the velocity of money, its calculation using the equation of exchange (MV = PY), and how changes in money supply and GDP affect it. It explains that an increase in GDP with a constant money supply increases the velocity of money, while an increase in money supply with constant GDP decreases velocity.

Synthesizing these sources, it seems that the decline in money velocity is primarily due to a combination of factors:

1. **Increased Money Supply:** Central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, have significantly increased the money supply through quantitative easing and other monetary policies in response to economic crises like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. This influx of money hasn't been matched by a proportional increase in economic activity (GDP), leading to a decrease in velocity.

2. **Economic Uncertainty and Saving Behavior:** During times of economic uncertainty, such as recessions or pandemics, consumers and businesses tend to save more and spend less. This reduces the frequency with which money changes hands, thus decreasing velocity.

3. **Bank Lending Practices:** Banks, especially in the aftermath of crises, may become more risk-averse and hold onto excess reserves rather than lending them out. This limits the money multiplier effect and reduces the circulation of money in the economy.

4. **Structural Changes in the Economy:** Long-term trends such as increased income inequality, demographic changes, and shifts in consumer behavior can also influence money velocity. For example, an aging population might save more and spend less, lowering velocity.

5. **Interest Rates:** Low-interest-rate environments can discourage spending and encourage holding cash or liquid assets, which might contribute to lower velocity.

Regarding the implications, there seems to be a consensus that low money velocity doesn't necessarily portend high inflation, contrary to some expectations based on traditional monetary theory. Instead, the risk appears to be more towards disinflation or deflation, as seen during the pandemic when inflation rates fell despite massive monetary injections.

However, there's also recognition that as economic conditions improve and confidence returns, money velocity could pick up, potentially leading to higher inflation if not managed properly by monetary authorities. Therefore, the Federal Reserve and other central banks need to monitor money velocity and adjust their policies accordingly to maintain price stability and support economic growth.

In summary, the decline in money velocity is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including monetary policy, economic uncertainty, banking practices, and structural changes in the economy. Its implications for inflation and economic growth require careful monitoring and management by policymakers.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The decline in money velocity is primarily due to an increase in the money supply exceeding the growth in GDP, coupled with increased savings and reduced spending during economic uncertainty, and conservative lending practices by banks.}} \]
