So I have this question: "Does strategic management involve long-term or short-term activities?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact definition of strategic management, but I think it has something to do with planning in a business context. Maybe I should look it up to get a clearer understanding.

First, I need to understand what strategic management is. I think it's about how managers plan and execute strategies for a company. But I'm not sure if it focuses more on the long term or the short term. Perhaps it involves both, but I need to find out which one it primarily concerns.

I recall that strategies often involve big picture goals and future planning, so maybe it's more about long-term activities. But I also know that businesses have to manage day-to-day operations, which might be considered short-term activities. So, is strategic management about balancing both long-term and short-term activities?

Wait, maybe I should look for a definition of strategic management to get started. Let me see... I think it's the process of setting goals, analyzing opportunities and threats, and deciding on the best course of action for a company to achieve its goals. That sounds like it would involve both planning for the future and managing current activities.

But the question is specifically asking whether it involves long-term or short-term activities. Maybe I need to find out if strategic management is more focused on one over the other.

Let me consider some key aspects of strategic management. I think it includes things like mission statements, vision statements, SWOT analysis, setting objectives, and developing strategies to meet those objectives. These seem like they would be geared towards longer-term goals rather than immediate tasks.

On the other hand, once strategies are in place, there are tactics and operations that need to be managed on a day-to-day basis. Those would be short-term activities. But is that still considered part of strategic management, or is it more operational management?

I think there might be a distinction between strategic management and operational management. Operational management deals with the day-to-day functioning of a business, which would be short-term activities, while strategic management is more about guiding the overall direction and long-term goals of the organization.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look for some authoritative source to define strategic management and see whether it emphasizes long-term or short-term activities.

Let me try searching for "strategic management definition" to get a better understanding.

What Is Strategic Management?
Strategic management is the management of an organization’s resources to achieve its goals and objectives.
Strategic management involves setting objectives, analyzing the competitive environment, analyzing the internal organization, evaluating strategies, and ensuring that management rolls out the strategies across the organization .
Key Takeaways
Companies, universities, nonprofits, and other organizations can use strategic management as a way to make goals and meet objectives.
Flexible companies may find it easier to make changes to their structure and plans, while inflexible companies may chafe at a changing environment.
A strategic manager may oversee strategic management plans and devise ways for organizations to meet their benchmark goals.
Understanding Strategic Management
Strategic management is divided into several schools of thought. A prescriptive approach to strategic management outlines how strategies should be developed, while a descriptive approach focuses on how strategies should be put into practice. These schools differ on whether strategies are developed through an analytic process, in which all threats and opportunities are accounted for, or are more like general guiding principles to be applied.
Business culture, the skills and competencies of employees, and organizational structure are all important factors that influence how an organization can achieve its stated objectives. Inflexible companies may find it difficult to succeed in a changing business environment. Creating a barrier between the development of strategies and their implementation can make it difficult for managers to determine whether objectives have been efficiently met.
While an organization’s upper management is ultimately responsible for its strategy, the strategies themselves are often sparked by actions and ideas from lower-level managers and employees. An organization may have several employees devoted to strategy rather than relying solely on the chief executive officer (CEO) for guidance.
Because of this reality, organizational leaders focus on learning from past strategies and examining the environment at large. The collective knowledge is then used to develop future strategies and to guide the behavior of employees to ensure that the entire organization is moving forward. For these reasons, effective strategic management requires both an inward and outward perspective.
Strategic management extends to internal and external communication practices as well as to tracking, which ensures that the company meets goals as defined in its strategic management plan.
Example of Strategic Management
For example, a for-profit technical college wishes to increase new student enrollment and enrolled student graduation rates over the next three years. The purpose is to make the college known as the best buy for a student's money among five for-profit technical colleges in the region, with a goal of increasing revenue.
In that case, strategic management means ensuring the school has funds to create high-tech classrooms and hire the most qualified instructors. The college also invests in marketing and recruitment and implements student retention strategies. The college’s leadership assesses whether its goals have been achieved on a periodic basis.
Special Considerations
Helping their company find ways to be more competitive is the purpose of strategic management. To that end, putting strategic management plans into practice is the most important aspect of the planning itself. Plans in practice involve identifying benchmarks, realigning resources—financial and human—and putting leadership resources in place to oversee the creation, sale, and deployment of products and services.
What is strategic management?
Strategic management is the process of setting goals, procedures, and objectives in order to make a company or organization more competitive. Typically, strategic management looks at effectively deploying staff and resources to achieve these goals. Often, strategic management includes strategy evaluation, internal organization analysis, and strategy execution throughout the company.
Why is strategic management important?
In business, strategic management is important because it allows a company to analyze areas for operational improvement. In many cases, they can follow either an analytical process, which identifies potential threats and opportunities, or simply follow general guidelines. Given the structure of the organization, a company may choose to follow either a prescriptive or descriptive approach to strategic management. Under a prescriptive model, strategies are outlined for development and execution. By contrast, a descriptive approach describes how a company can develop these strategies.
What is an example of strategic management?
Consider a large company that wants to achieve more ambitious online sales rates. To meet these goals, the company will develop a strategy, communicate this strategy, apply it across various units and departments in the organization, integrate this with employee goals, and execute accordingly. If an effective strategy is applied, ideally, it will help the company achieve its targets through a single, coordinated process.

Strategic management is the planned use of a business' resources to reach company goals and objectives. Strategic management requires ongoing evaluation of the processes and procedures within an organization and external factors that may impact how the company functions. The process of strategic management should guide top-level programs and decisions. Companies of all sizes and in all industries can benefit from the practice of strategic management.
In this article, we explain the benefits of strategic management, explain how it works, discuss the types and stages of strategic management and provide an example of it in the workplace.
Benefits of strategic management
Achieving organizational goals takes planning and patience. Strategic management can help companies reach their goals. Strategic management ensures the steps necessary to reach a business goal are implemented company-wide.
Strategic management offers many benefits to companies that use it, including:
Competitive advantage: Strategic management gives businesses an advantage over competitors because its proactive nature means your company will always be aware of the changing market.
Achieving goals: Strategic management helps keep goals achievable by using a clear and dynamic process for formulating steps and implementation.
Sustainable growth: Strategic management has been shown to lead to more efficient organizational performance, which leads to manageable growth.
Cohesive organization: Strategic management necessitates communication and goal implementation company-wide. An organization that is working in unison towards a goal is more likely to achieve that goal.
Increased managerial awareness: Strategic management means looking toward the company's future. If managers do this consistently, they will be more aware of industry trends and challenges. By implementing strategic planning and thinking, they will be better prepared to face future challenges.
How does strategic management work?
Strategic management requires setting objectives for the company, analyzing the actions of competitors, reviewing the organization's internal structure, evaluating current strategies and confirming that strategies are implemented company-wide.
Strategic management can be either prescriptive or descriptive.
Prescriptive strategic management means developing strategies in advance of an organizational issue.
Descriptive strategic management means putting strategies into practice when needed. Both methods of strategic management employ management theory and practices.
While upper management is responsible for implementing strategies, ideas, goals or organizational challenges can come from any member of the company. Many companies employ strategists whose job it is to think and plan strategically to improve company function.
Types of strategic management
Strategic management as a concept can be approached in a variety of ways. Below are some popular types of strategic management:
SWOT analysis
SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This analysis allows you to investigate internal and external factors. Internal factors include positive (strengths) or negative (weaknesses) factors that exist within your organization and are able to be changed or affected in some way, while external factors include positive (opportunities) or negative (threats) factors that exist outside of the subject you are evaluating and cannot necessarily be changed or affected by you or your organization in any way.
Read more: SWOT Analysis Guide (With Examples)
Balanced scorecard
A balanced scorecard helps you find which facets of your business need improvements by breaking down the performance evaluation process into four areas known as legs. These legs are:
Learning and growth
Business processes
Customer perspectives
Financial data
The balanced scorecard method can generate timely reporting mechanisms that show all statistics related to the growth of the company.
Read more: What Is a Balanced Scorecard?
Five steps of strategic management
While there are different approaches and frameworks for strategic management, there are generally the same five steps in the process:
Identification
Analysis
Formation
Execution
Evaluation
1. Identification
The first step in strategic management is evaluating the company’s current direction. This often includes understanding the company’s goal, mission and overall strategic direction. Assessing where the company’s current process will help you achieve your goal.
2. Analysis
Once you understand the current process, you must analyze the details. What is working? What is not working? What input from organizational stakeholders can you gather? This is the time to answer any questions that will help solidify the necessary elements of the strategic plan. A SWOT analysis, or identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, is a useful tool.
3. Formation
Once you have the information you need, it is time to create an action plan for reaching the goal. Make sure the steps are clear, focused and directly related to the goal. Prepare easy-to-understand implementation guidelines if the process or procedure will impact many people within the organization.
4. Execution
Follow the steps outlined in your strategic plan. Make sure that all stakeholders are implementing the plan as designed for maximum efficiency.
5. Evaluation
Evaluate the final product. Did you achieve your goal? Was the process implemented appropriately company-wide? Based on your answers to these questions, you can reflect and revise as needed.
Example of strategic management
1. Identification
A furniture company named Wood's Fine Furnishings is preparing to introduce a new line of kitchen tables. They decide to implement strategic management to ensure that the product release goes smoothly, efficiently and consistently across all of their retail locations.
2. Analysis
In the past, Wood's Fine Furnishings has suffered from inconsistent marketing and incorrect shipping costs with the release of new products in their multiple retail locations. Before the release of their new kitchen table line, they have decided to run a SWOT analysis to see how they can improve the process.
Strengths:
Quality product
Several locations for the ease of purchase
Flat shipping rate
Weaknesses:
Poor communication between store managers and between store employees
Shipping rate applied multiple times at some stores
Inconsistent marketing strategy
Opportunities:
Unified marketing
Transparent fees
Threats:
Wood's Fine Furnishings' main competitor released a line of kitchen tables last quarter
3. Formation
Using their SWOT analysis, Wood's Fine Furnishings creates a strategic plan for the release of their kitchen tables. It includes providing consistent marketing collateral, both print and digital, to all retail locations. It also includes sending a representative to each retail location to explain how to correctly apply the shipping rate to all purchases. Lastly, the support team sets up an internal messaging system so store managers can communicate quickly and easily about challenges and successes in their stores.
4. Execution
One month before the release of the new kitchen tables, the marketing team provides the marketing collateral to all retail stores. Every store is given the same guidance on how to implement the marketing items effectively. Two weeks before the launch, store managers are trained as a group on the new messaging system. The trainers field questions and make sure every manager has the messaging service set up on their company cell phone and office computer to be accessible at all times.
One week before the launch, a representative from company headquarters trains every retail employee on how to appropriately apply shipping costs to a sale. Managers are also present to make sure this process is carried out correctly with customers.
5. Evaluation
Wood's Fine Furnishings reviews the data from their kitchen table release one month after the first day of sales. They find that the marketing plan drove consumers to the retail location closest to them to see the tables in person. The internal messaging system was under-utilized by most managers, many of whom did not like customers seeing them on their phones while out on the floor. There were no issues with shipping costs during this release. The strategic managers take this data and use it as they begin to plan for their next new product release.

Strategic Management & Strategic Planning
Last updated: November 11, 2021 by Ovidijus Jurevicius
Definition
Strategic management can be defined as the art and science of formulating, implementing and evaluating cross-functional decisions that enable an organization to achieve its objectives. [1]
What is that strategic management?
Various definitions are used to describe the subject, but few give a full and easy to understand answer. The combination of all 4 definitions used previously gives us a much clearer view of what the subject is:
Strategic management is a continuous process of strategic analysis, strategy creation, implementation and monitoring, used by organizations with the purpose to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage.
The general purpose of doing it is to combine the energy of organization’s functional areas into one focused effort to achieve superior performance. It is usually done through the many steps of the process.
In essence, it answers the following 3 questions:
Where the organization is at the moment?
Where does it want to go?
How it will get there?
Strategic management is not about predicting the future, but about preparing for it and knowing what exact steps the company will have to take to implement its strategic plan and achieve a competitive advantage.[5]
The difference between strategic management and strategic planning
Both strategic management and strategic planning terms mean the same! The difference is that the latter one is more used in the business world while the former is used in the academic environment.
According to David, [1] strategic planning is sometimes confused with strategy formulation, because strategic plan is constructed in this stage.
Importance of strategic planning
Requirement for sustained competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is what keeps great organizations ahead of their competitors. Rothaermel [2] pointed out that the company, which has a competitive advantage, performs financially much better than other companies in the industry or better than the industry average. Some companies may achieve it without thorough strategic plan but for the most players out there it is vital to plan strategically, i.e. analyze, create, implement and monitor, and do this continuously. It is not guaranteed that companies will ever achieve competitive advantage conducting strategic planning but it is an essential process if the company wants sustain it.
Views things from broader perspective. The other reason why the organizations don’t simply rely on their finances, marketing or operations functional areas to create competitive advantage is that managers of each area often view things only from their own specific angle [3], which is too narrow view for the whole organization to rely upon. Only the managers (e.g. CEOs or strategic planners) who see the whole picture of the company and its surrounding environments can make the decisions that bring the competitive advantage.
Facilitates collaboration. Nowadays, most companies involve middle managers of functional areas into the process of formulating strategic plan. Middle managers are the people who implement the strategies set out in a plan and if they aren’t involved in making the plan, then they aren’t so committed to support it.
Thus, strategic planning is used to achieve the competitive advantage and to integrate all the functional areas of the company by facilitating the communication between the managers of all levels.
Benefits
Defines a company’s vision, mission and future goals.
Identifies the suitable strategies to achieve the goals.
Improves awareness of the external and internal environments, and clearly identifies the competitive advantage.
Increases managers’ commitment to achieving the company’s objectives.
Improves coordination of the activities and more efficient allocation of company’s resources.
Better communication between managers of the different levels and functional areas.
Reduces resistance to change by informing the employees of the changes and the consequences of them.
Strengthens the firm’s performance.
On average, companies using strategic management are more successful than the companies that don’t.
Strategic planning allows the organization to become more proactive than reactive.
Limitations
Although strategic management brings many benefits to the company it also has its limitations:
The costs of engaging in it are huge.
The process is complex.
Success is not guaranteed.
Above are the reasons why small and medium enterprises are usually reluctant to have their own strategic departments.

Alright, so I've looked up some definitions and explanations of strategic management. From what I've gathered, strategic management is essentially about setting goals and figuring out how to achieve them in a way that gives the organization a competitive edge. It seems like it's more focused on long-term activities because it involves planning for the future and making decisions that will affect the company over an extended period.

For example, one source mentioned that strategic management includes setting objectives, analyzing the competitive environment, and evaluating strategies. These activities sound like they're geared towards looking ahead and preparing for what's to come, rather than dealing with immediate, day-to-day issues.

Another point that stood out is that strategic management isn't just about planning; it's also about implementing those plans and monitoring their effectiveness. So, it's a continuous process that involves not only thinking about the future but also taking action and adjusting strategies as needed.

I also noticed that some sources differentiate between strategic management and operational management. Operational management seems to handle the short-term, day-to-day functions of the business, while strategic management deals with the bigger picture and long-term direction.

But, to be thorough, I should consider whether strategic management could involve both long-term and short-term activities. Maybe it's about balancing immediate needs with future goals. For instance, a company might need to make short-term decisions that align with its long-term战略.

Let me think about a real-world example. Suppose a company decides to enter a new market. That would be a long-term strategic move, involving market research, planning, resource allocation, and implementation over several months or even years. During this process, there would be short-term activities like hiring new staff, launching marketing campaigns, and managing initial operations. However, these short-term activities are all in service of the larger, long-term strategic goal of entering the new market.

So, in this case, while there are short-term activities involved, they are part of a broader strategic plan that is fundamentally long-term.

Another example could be developing a new product. The development process might take years, involving research, design, testing, and production scaling. Again, this is a long-term endeavor with various short-term tasks along the way.

It seems like strategic management is primarily concerned with long-term activities, even though it may encompass or influence short-term operations.

But maybe there are aspects of strategic management that are more short-term in nature. For instance, crisis management might be considered a strategic activity that needs to be addressed immediately. However, crisis management could also be seen as part of the broader strategy, where the company has contingency plans in place for unexpected events.

Perhaps another way to look at it is that strategic management sets the overall direction and priorities, which then inform both short-term and long-term actions. So, while the core of strategic management is long-term, it does have implications for short-term decision-making.

I think it's important to consider the time horizons associated with different types of strategies. For example, a company might have a corporate-level strategy that spans many years, business-level strategies that are somewhat shorter, and functional-level strategies that are more immediate.

But even functional-level strategies, like marketing or operational strategies, are likely to have a longer-term focus, guiding the activities of those functions over a period of time.

Moreover, strategic management involves adapting to changes in the environment, which might require adjusting strategies over time. This adaptive aspect could involve both short-term responses and long-term adjustments.

Given all this, I believe that strategic management is mainly concerned with long-term activities, as it deals with the overarching goals and plans that shape the organization's future. Short-term activities are important, but they are subservient to the long-term strategic objectives.

To confirm this, perhaps I should look for specific examples or quotes from authoritative sources that explicitly state whether strategic management is long-term or short-term.

Let me check one of the sources again.

In Doc 1 from Investopedia, it says: "Strategic management is the process of setting goals, procedures, and objectives in order to make a company or organization more competitive. Typically, strategic management looks at effectively deploying staff and resources to achieve these goals."

This suggests that strategic management is about setting goals and deploying resources to achieve them, which sounds like a long-term activity.

Another source, Doc 2 from Quora, has multiple answers, but one of them says: "Strategic management is the management of an organization’s resources to achieve its goals and objectives. Strategic management involves setting objectives, analyzing the competitive environment, analyzing the internal organization, evaluating strategies, and ensuring that management rolls out the strategies across the organization."

Again, this emphasizes setting objectives and analyzing environments, which are typically long-term activities.

Doc 3 from Simplinotes defines strategic management as "the process of identifying, evaluating and implementing strategies in order to meet the organizational objectives." This is quite broad, but the focus is on achieving organizational objectives, which are usually long-term in nature.

Doc 4 from Indeed.com states: "Strategic management is the planned use of a business' resources to reach company goals and objectives. Strategic management requires ongoing evaluation of the processes and procedures within an organization and external factors that may impact how the company functions. The process of strategic management should guide top-level programs and decisions."

Here, the emphasis is on planning and guiding top-level decisions, which again points towards long-term activities.

Lastly, Doc 5 from Strategic Management Insight defines strategic management as "a continuous process of strategic analysis, strategy creation, implementation and monitoring, used by organizations with the purpose to achieve and maintain a competitive advantage."

This definition highlights the continuous nature of strategic management, involving analysis, creation, implementation, and monitoring of strategies to achieve a competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is generally a long-term goal.

Furthermore, the same source mentions that strategic management answers three key questions: Where the organization is now, where it wants to go, and how it will get there. These questions encompass both the current state and future aspirations of the organization, but the focus is clearly on moving towards future goals, which are long-term in nature.

Given all these definitions and explanations from various sources, it's evident that strategic management is primarily concerned with long-term activities. It involves planning for the future, setting long-term goals, and implementing strategies to achieve those goals.

While strategic management does involve short-term activities, such as implementing specific strategies and monitoring their effectiveness, these activities are part of a larger, long-term framework. In other words, the short-term activities are means to achieve the long-term objectives.

Therefore, to answer the question "Does strategic management involve long-term or short-term activities?", the answer is that it primarily involves long-term activities, with short-term activities being components of the overall strategic plan.

\boxed{\text{long-term activities}}
