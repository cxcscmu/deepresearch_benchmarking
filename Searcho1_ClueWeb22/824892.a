Alright, so I need to figure out how slavery impacted the Civil War. I know that the Civil War was between the Northern states and the Southern states in the US, back in the 1860s. I think slavery was a major issue, but I'm not exactly sure how it all connects. Maybe I should start by understanding what slavery was like in the US before the war.

I remember that slavery was legal in the Southern states, where they had plantations and needed a lot of labor for crops like cotton and tobacco. The Northern states, on the other hand, were more industrialized and didn't rely as much on slave labor. In fact, I think some Northern states had abolished slavery even before the Civil War.

So, perhaps the differences in economy and social structures between the North and South led to conflicts over slavery. I should look into what was happening politically at that time. I think there were debates in Congress about whether new states should be allowed to have slavery or not. There was something called the Missouri Compromise, right? That tried to balance the number of free states and slave states.

Later, there was the Dred Scott decision, which I think made things worse. Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom, and the Supreme Court ruled that he wasn't a citizen and couldn't sue in federal court. That decision seemed to protect slavery and angered a lot of people in the North.

Then there's Abraham Lincoln. He was elected president in 1860, and I think his opposition to the expansion of slavery was one of the reasons the Southern states seceded and formed their own government, the Confederacy.

So, it seems like slavery was a central issue leading up to the war. But once the war started, how did slavery continue to impact the conflict?

I recall that early in the war, Lincoln wasn't necessarily focusing on ending slavery; he said that his main goal was to preserve the Union. But as the war progressed, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that slaves in the Confederate states were to be set free.

Was that a turning point? Did it change the purpose of the war? I think it did, because now the Union was not just fighting to preserve the country but also to end slavery.

Also, by freeing the slaves, Lincoln was depriving the Confederacy of their labor force, which was crucial for their economy and war effort. So, it was a strategic move as well.

Moreover, after the Emancipation Proclamation, black soldiers were allowed to fight for the Union army. That must have strengthened the Union's military power.

On the other hand, the Confederacy was strongly committed to maintaining slavery. Their economy depended on it, and many white Southerners believed in white supremacy and saw slavery as a natural order.

So, the war was, in a way, a battle between these two conflicting visions: one that wanted to keep slavery and the way of life it supported, and another that was against the expansion and eventually the existence of slavery.

I should also consider international factors. European countries like Britain and France had abolished slavery, and public opinion there was against it. So, the Union's stance against slavery might have gained them sympathy abroad, which was important because the Confederacy was trying to get recognition and support from these countries.

In summary, slavery had a profound impact on the Civil War. It was a major cause of the war, a driving force behind the secession of the Southern states, and a central issue that shaped the policies and strategies of both sides during the conflict.
