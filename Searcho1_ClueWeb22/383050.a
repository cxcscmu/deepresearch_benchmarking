Alright, I need to figure out how the British monarchy changed during the Stuart period from 1603 to 1689. I don't remember a lot about this era off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I should probably start by understanding who the Stuart monarchs were during this period. I know that the Stuart dynasty began with James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England in 1603, uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. So, the Stuarts ruled both England and Scotland during this time.

Let me list out the monarchs during this period:

1. James I (1603-1625)

2. Charles I (1625-1649)

3. Interregnum (1649-1660), during which there was no monarch

4. Charles II (1660-1685)

5. James II (1685-1688)

6. William III and Mary II (joint monarchs from 1689 onwards, but since the question goes up to 1689, I might not need to consider them fully)

So, there were significant changes during this period, including civil wars and the interregnum, which must have impacted the monarchy greatly.

I need to think about how the role and power of the monarchy evolved during this time. Was there a shift in the balance of power between the monarchy and Parliament? Were there any key events or documents that changed the way the monarchy functioned?

Let me consider James I first. He was known for his belief in the divine right of kings, which means he thought his authority was granted by God and not subject to earthly challenges. This could have implications for how he governed and interacted with Parliament.

Then, his son Charles I inherited the throne and also held similar views about royal authority. His conflicts with Parliament led to the English Civil War, which ultimately resulted in his execution in 1649.

During the interregnum, there was no monarch, and the country was governed first by the Rump Parliament and then under Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate.

After Cromwell's death, there was a restoration of the monarchy with Charles II in 1660. How did this restoration affect the monarchy's powers and relationships with Parliament?

Finally, James II came to the throne in 1685 and his reign ended with the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which brought William III and Mary II to the throne. This event is crucial because it led to the establishment of parliamentary sovereignty and the beginning of modern constitutional monarchy.

So, perhaps the most significant change during the Stuart period was the transition from absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy, where the power of the king or queen is limited by law, particularly by Parliament.

Let me think about specific changes:

1. **Divine Right vs. Constitutional Limits**: The early Stuarts believed in divine right, but by the end of the period, the idea of limiting the monarch's power through laws and Parliament was established.

2. **Parliament's Role**: Parliament's role expanded significantly. It began to assert its authority over taxation, legislation, and even the succession of the throne.

3. **Legal and Political Documents**: Several important documents were produced during this time that shaped the monarchy:

   - **The Petition of Right (1628)**: This was a significant step towards limiting the king's powers, especially regarding taxation without consent and arbitrary imprisonment.

   - **The Triennial Act (1641)**: Required Parliament to be summoned at least every three years.

   - **The Habeas Corpus Act (1679)**: Protected individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

   - **The Bill of Rights (1689)**: Established the rights of Parliament and the rules for the succession of the throne, effectively creating a constitutional monarchy.

4. **Religious Issues**: Religion played a big role during this period, with conflicts between Protestants and Catholics affecting the monarchy. James II's attempts to promote Catholicism led to his overthrow.

5. **Glorious Revolution (1688)**: This peaceful revolution resulted in the deposition of James II and the invitation for William and Mary to rule, accepting parliamentary conditions.

So, overall, the Stuart period saw a profound transformation of the monarchy from an absolute ruler to a constitutional monarch whose powers are limited by law and subject to parliamentary oversight.

I should also consider the impact of these changes on the relationship between the monarchy and the people. Did public perception of the monarchy change over time? Were there shifts in popular support for the monarchy during this period?

Additionally, the union of the English and Scottish crowns under James I might have had implications for the monarchy's role in governing both nations. Was there any evolution in how the monarchy managed the dual realms?

Perhaps I should look into specific events or reigns to get a better understanding.

Starting with James I:

- He was the first Stuart king of England and continued as king of Scotland.

- Known for his promotion of peace and his writings on the divine right of kings.

- His marriage to Anne of Denmark helped secure an alliance with Denmark.

- He authorized the King James Bible.

- His policies sometimes led to conflicts with Parliament, setting a pattern for future Stuart monarchs.

Then Charles I:

- Inherited the throne in 1625.

- His marriage to Henrietta Maria of France, a Catholic, caused tensions.

- His attempts to rule without Parliament led to the Personal Rule period (1629-1640).

- This period saw increasing conflicts with Scotland and England, leading to the Bishops' Wars and eventually the English Civil War.

- His execution in 1649 marked the end of the monarchy for a time.

During the interregnum:

- The monarchy was abolished, and England became a republic known as the Commonwealth.

- Oliver Cromwell rose to power and later became Lord Protector.

- This period was characterized by Puritan influences and strict social norms.

- After Cromwell's death, his son Richard succeeded him but was not effective, leading to the Restoration of the monarchy.

Charles II:

- Restored to the throne in 1660.

- Known as the "Merry Monarch" for restoring cultural life after the Puritan era.

- His reign saw the Great Plague of London (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666).

- He had complex relations with Parliament but generally maintained a more cooperative approach than his father.

- His brother James, Duke of York, was known to be a Catholic, which caused concerns about the succession.

James II:

- Ascended the throne in 1685.

- His open Catholicism and attempts to grant religious tolerance to Catholics and Nonconformists alarmed Parliament and the Protestant majority.

- The birth of his son in 1688 threatened the Protestant succession.

- This led to the Glorious Revolution, where Parliament invited William of Orange and Mary to rule instead.

William III and Mary II:

- Took the throne in 1689, following the Glorious Revolution.

- Their rule was conditioned on accepting the Bill of Rights, which laid out limits on their powers and affirmed Parliamentary authority.

So, throughout the Stuart period, there was a clear trend towards reducing the monarch's power and increasing Parliament's role in governance.

I should also consider the long-term impacts of these changes. Did the Glorious Revolution completely settle the issue of parliamentary sovereignty, or were there further struggles in the centuries that followed?

Moreover, how did these changes affect the British Empire and its colonies? For example, the American colonies were affected by these developments, leading eventually to the American Revolution.

But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. For now, I need to focus on the period from 1603 to 1689 and how the monarchy changed during that time.

Let me try to summarize the key changes:

1. **Shift from Absolute to Constitutional Monarchy**: The monarchy moved from being an absolute ruler, claiming divine right, to a constitutional monarch bound by laws and parliamentary authority.

2. **Increased Parliamentary Power**: Parliament's role in legislation, taxation, and oversight of the monarchy grew significantly.

3. **Legal Limitations on Royal Power**: Through documents like the Petition of Right, Habeas Corpus Act, and the Bill of Rights, specific limitations were placed on the monarch's powers.

4. **Religious Tolerance and Conflict**: The Stuarts' religious policies, particularly regarding Catholicism, caused significant conflict and influenced the succession and stability of the monarchy.

5. **Political Stability and Instability**: The period saw both stability under monarchs like Charles II and extreme instability during the Civil War and interregnum.

6. **International Relations**: The monarchy's foreign policies and alliances also evolved, affecting Britain's position in Europe and beyond.

Given these points, I can see that the Stuart period was a time of great upheaval and transformation for the British monarchy, leading to the foundation of the modern constitutional monarchy.

I think that's a solid overview, but maybe I can be more concise in my final answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The British monarchy transitioned from an absolute monarchy based on divine right to a constitutional monarchy governed by parliamentary laws and constraints.}} \]
