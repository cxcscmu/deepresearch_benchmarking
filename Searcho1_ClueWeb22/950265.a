I'm trying to understand how society contributes to anorexia. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by an obsessive desire to lose weight, often leading to dangerous levels of under-eating. It's a serious mental health condition that can have severe consequences for those affected. I know that society plays a role in shaping our perceptions of beauty and body image, but I'm not sure exactly how these factors contribute to the development of anorexia.

First, I think about media influences. The media often promotes thinness as the ideal body type, especially for women. This can create unrealistic expectations and pressure individuals to attain a certain look, which may lead to disordered eating behaviors. I remember seeing lots of skinny models in magazines and on TV, and I wonder if this constant exposure affects people's self-image.

Maybe I should look into some statistics or studies that link media exposure to eating disorders. Perhaps there are cultures where this isn't an issue, or where different body types are considered attractive. That could help me understand the role of societal norms in anorexia.

Also, I think about the fashion industry and how it often favors extremely thin models. There have been debates about using healthier models or at least models of different sizes and shapes. Some countries have even taken regulatory measures to ensure that models meet certain body mass index (BMI) standards. This suggests that there's recognition of the influence that the fashion industry has on body image and eating disorders.

Moreover, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook play a huge role in shaping young people's perceptions. Filters and editing tools allow for perfecting one's appearance, which can lead to unrealistic comparisons and dissatisfaction with one's own body. Influencers often promote diet culture and extreme weight loss, which might normalize disordered eating behaviors.

I should also consider the role of peer pressure. In schools and among friends, there might be pressure to look a certain way, which could push individuals towards unhealthy eating habits. Bullying based on weight is also a significant issue and can have lasting psychological effects.

On the other hand, society's obsession with health and fitness could also contribute to anorexia. The constant emphasis on eating clean, working out, and achieving physical perfection can be taken to extremes. Sometimes, what starts as a desire to be healthy can turn into a compulsive need to control every aspect of one's diet and exercise routine.

It's important to note that anorexia is a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental elements. Society is just one piece of the puzzle, but it's a significant one.

I think I need to do some research to get a better understanding of this. Maybe look up some articles or studies on the subject.

Anorexia Nervosa Impact On Society
Anorexia Nervosa Impact On Society
By Ray Andrew | Submitted On January 16, 2008
Some statistics show that 1% of American women have anorexia nervosa, many people don't have idea on how dangerous this disorder is. Thousands of teenagers die each year due to anorexia and eating disorders. Society plays an important role to help solve this growing problem and make adolescents aware of the dangers.
If we want to see the anorexia nervosa impact on society, its enough to see the death statistics and emotional problems that they have to understand how severe it is. There are groups of people especially online that support anorexia nervosa as a lifestyle and they give tips and advice to them to hide their problem from their family and keep a rigorous diet.
I think we need to change the way society values people, there are testimonies of teenagers that were very happy, but when they started dieting due to an emotional problem they had caused by a critique of their weight, their life became miserable. Adolescents want to be loved and accepted in society, so when people critiques their body or physical appearance, sometimes the frustration is so big, that they do anything to be accepted be liked.
The consequence is that adolescents start dieting and exercising with obsession, to the point that they starve themselves and hurt their body. They also see all the celebrities in tv as perfect and they want to be like them, very thin.
Anorexia is an emotional problem and cannot be solved just with medications, the person needs to understand that what she is doing is wrong and is damaging her self. She needs to feel loved and accepted by her family to recover from this disorder, she needs to change her self image.
Society is causing a negative impact on teenagers, they are acquiring the wrong values from the media and take celebrities as their role model of success. Parents have to make their child aware of this problem and its consequences.

Abstract
Eating disorders are very common in today’s society and can cause death if an intervention isn’t performed. While working in the hospital and being part of the wrestling team in high school I’ve witness several people with this disorder. Anorexia and bulimia are the most prevalent and generally are accompanied by another psychological disorder. Many individuals suffer from more than one disorder and almost half of people who have anorexia develop bulimia or bulimic patterns. Although there is no specific cause we do know that women are more likely to suffer from anorexia or bulimia. The key to fighting anorexia and bulimia is to identify who is at risk, identify the symptoms, identify the warning signs, and seek treatment.
Eating Disorders and Its Impact on Society
An eating disorder is an illness some people suffer from due to an obsession with food, body image, or weight.  These people struggle to have control over their bodies even if it means making decision that affects their overall health. Having a severe disturbance in eating habits and related thoughts and emotions can lead to death. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness according to Eating Disorder Statistics. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are two of the most common types of eating disorders in the United

Counter Arguments - The Role of Society in Eating Disorders
The Role of Society in Eating Disorders
People have denied the likelihood of social factors causing eating disorders on the basis of several factors.
It is argued that the lack of proof makes it hard to accept that eating disorders are caused by the media (Psychiatric Quarterly).
However, comparisons of eating disorders in different time periods and societies offer concrete proof that social factors are indeed responsible for causing them.
The fact that the number of people affected by eating disorders has risen so sharply from the early and mid-twentieth century to now is because of how society transformed since then. As society began to appreciate and encourage slimmer and less curvaceous women, the number of individuals affected by eating disorders began to increase. In the early and mid-twentieth century, fuller and more curvaceous bodies were considered beautiful. Having a voluptuous body represented fertility and wholesomeness, qualities that were considered desirable. Now, however, we consider almost the exact opposite type of body beautiful. Skinny bodies are promoted and accepted as the ideal. This is why eating disorders have increased over the last few years. It is not that people changed biologically, genetically or psychologically and suddenly developed something to make them develop eating disorders (National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders).
Another convincing argument supporting my claim is a cross-comparison between two societies during the same time period. During and prior to the early 1990s, the ideal body for females in Fijian society was round, plump and soft. Curvaceous women were considered more attractive than skinny, non-curvaceous ones. In 1995, Western television series such as Melrose Place and Beverly Hills 90210 were introduced to Fijian television audiences. These series featured skinny, non-curvaceous women as the lead characters and promoted the Western skinny notion of female beauty. After 38 months of being exposed to them, there was a visible change in the audiences’ perception of the attractiveness of female bodies. Not only did they begin to prefer non-curvaceous women, but the cases of eating disorders among teenage girls also increased rapidly. Prior to 1995, there had only been one reported case of an eating disorder. By 1998, one in ten girls claimed she vomited to lose weight. This is sufficient to demonstrate the immense influence of society, and popular media in particular, on rates of eating disorders (National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders).
Some people believe that since the entire society is exposed to the same media influences but only a select few are affected by eating disorders, it is illogical to conclude that the media could cause eating disorders (Psychiatric Quarterly).
However, as I mentioned earlier, psychological, biological and genetic factors play an important role in creating conditions in which an individual becomes predisposed towards psychological disorders. It is these individuals who are affected by the media to the extent that they develop eating disorders. Thus, the media and society become the 'tipping points'. Those who are not predisposed towards psychological disorders also develop distorted ideals of body image, but they do not develop full-scale eating disorders.
Some people feel that the greater susceptibility of women to have eating disorders indicates that its causes are genetic and biological (Psychiatric Quarterly).
However, this can be explained by cultural factors. For example, successful women are portrayed by the media as skinny, while successful men are portrayed as well-built. It is natural to conclude that this would cause eating disorders in women more than men.

What Social Factors Contribute to Eating Disorders and Why?
By Caleb Lack • Apr 18, 2015 • No comments
This post is part of a series of guest posts on GPS by the graduate students in my Psychopathology course. As part of their work for the course, each student had to demonstrate mastery of the skill of “Educating the Public about Mental Health.” To that end, each student has to prepare two 1,000ish word posts on a particular class of mental disorders.

What Social Factors Contribute to Eating Disorders and Why? by Alexis Pendarvis
Eating Disorders such as Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Bulimia Nervosa (BN) often occur in Western societies where food is in abundance but attractiveness is associated with thinness. Western societies also value and possess more media than non-Western societies. Therefore, there are many social factors that can contribute to the development of Eating Disorders. However, not all individuals who are subjected to these factors develop Eating Disorders.
The western culture has a tendency to neutralize and possibly even idolize pathological behavior in pursuit of an ideal body. The thin ideal of the Western world has many women convinced that they must be extremely thin to be beautiful. Often, a woman’s self-esteem is dependent upon her perceived attractiveness to the opposite sex and body weight and shape can play a role in said attractiveness. Instead of feeling hatred or disgust for their own bodies, women often talk about their fantasy bodies. These fantasy body ideas are coming from actors and actresses in movies. The actors and actresses are the outliers who are deciding the norm for what body weight and size is acceptable. Obtaining these so-called fantasy bodies may be more difficult for some women than others. Therefore, some women may turn to Eating Disorder behavior to maintain the weight and body shape they desire. There has been a 24% increase in hospital stays due to Eating Disorders from 1999 to 2009. During this time there was an increase in hospital stays among all age groups, but the largest increase was from 45 to 65 year olds.
There are four industries that can be involved in the social development of Eating Disorders. The first is the American food industry. The American food industry promotes snacking so that people are eating more than three times a day, it also idealizes processed foods causing people to eat foods that are not healthy for them or their weight control. With this industry in place and acting as it does to push people into consuming more food and unhealthier food Americans are actually gaining weight in a time when weight loss is the social ideal.
Next, the diet and weight-loss industries are making billions on diet pills, creams and weight loss coaches or videos. This industry is trying to convince people that they can lose substantial amounts of weight without putting in any real effort. They want people to believe the weight will fall off without any change to their daily routine, but for a price.
The fitness industry is another industry that may be leading to the social development of Eating Disorders. The fitness and diet industries often work together claiming that individuals need both to achieve and maintain their ideal body weight. The fitness industry is made up of gym memberships, personal trainers and sports equipment for homes such as treadmills and ellipticals.
The final industry is the cosmetic surgery industry. The cosmetic surgery industry is making money off of people’s insecurities promising them a life of happiness after a liposuction or other procedures. There may be evidence that some hospitals wish to fill their empty beds so they place insecurities in their patients to allow them to want for an elective surgery. Cosmetic surgery allows for an easy way out for many people wishing to lose large amounts of weight.
Not all women however, will be affected by these industries or the idea of an ideal body. Each media consumer brings his or her own personal history and identity to the viewing of media. There are four major theories that are used to suggest why some individuals develop Eating Disorders based on mass media and why others do not. The first theory is Cultivation Theory, which states that the more media a person is exposed to, the more he or she will view the media images as realistic. Once these media images are realistic in a persons mind they may find themselves as inadequate and a possible failure for not being able to reach these unachievable goals they have set for themselves.
The second theory is the Uses and Gratification Theory. The Uses and Gratification Theory looks at individuals and how they choose to expose themselves to media and how they act upon their interpretations of the media. For example, those who are unhappy with their bodies may purposefully expose themselves to images of thinness in the media and as a result become unhappier with their own bodies.
The next theory is the Social Comparison Theory. The social comparison theory is three-fold, first individuals want to improve themselves. Second, individuals compare themselves to others and finally, individuals compare themselves to others with whom they are similar. Individuals wish for improvement of themselves is not merely associated with Eating Disorders. However, if this desire becomes drastic enough for the improvement of weight and body shape it may lead to Eating Disordered behavior. Individuals comparing themselves to others with whom they are similar can be a problem because no two people are alike in any way including weight and body size. Therefore, if young women are comparing themselves to other young actresses or women present in the media they are setting themselves up for unreachable standards.
The final theory is the Objectification Theory, which states that the sexual objectification of women functions to socialize them to treat themselves as objects that are to be evaluated based on appearance. Growing up, even young girls learn quickly that looks matter and can influence their futures.
As a society, we place too much emphasis on good looks and thinness. A process of re-visioning femininity can be a step in the right direction for developing solutions for society’s influence on Eating Disorders. Many people believe thin, petite women to be more feminine than heavier female figures. A first step in re-visioning femininity would be to replace this belief that somehow thinner women are more feminine. Another possible solution to media’s promotion of an “ideal” body is social activism. Social activism can include boycotting anorexic marketing or models that are below the healthy Body-Mass Index. Another example of social activism is Eating Disorders Awareness Week, which is a national program that is designed to bring awareness to the prevalence of Eating Disorders. A final solution to media’s promotion of an “ideal” body is media literacy. If people, mainly those affected by media messages, were to become media literate, they may be better able to critically analyze and question the images and messages that come from the media. Other possible solutions include addressing Eating Disorders and weight stigmatization in different aspects of life including school and sports. Also, the implementation of anti-bullying policies to prevent youth from being bullied based on their weight will lead to a possible solution for Eating Disorders and Eating Disordered behavior.

2). There has been a shift from the plumper body image seen in paintings dating back to the 19th century, to the ultra slim catwalk models of today. As there has been a shift in body image, there has also been a shift in eating habits (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.2). It is now less likely for families to sit down together and eat the more traditional three meals a day, with young people now more likely to favour energy dense fast food diets (NSHD) (n.

d.). The National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (n.d.) recommends that young people should take regular exercise and have a minimum of 3 thirty minute sessions of exercise per week and drink a minimum of 2 litres of water per day.
The pressure society places on young people to conform to the ideal body image has led to many adolescents developing stress-related eating disorders (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.4). There are three main eating disorders: Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and binge eating (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.6). Disordered eating is a mental illness in which the patient severely restricts their calorie intake. Although girls are mainly affected by anorexia a significant number of boys are also affected (the Open University, 2013). AN is quite different from BN giving sufferers of BN cause to overeat and then purge to make themselves sick, thereby controlling their weight (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.4). It could be argued that the media’s portrayal of the ideal body shape may lead to young people developing eating disorders. The evidence suggests the Press may be partly to blame, and that society is ignoring a cry for help.
Quoted in the Daily Telegraph (Jardine, 2013), Kate Moss said “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – comments like this add fuel to the argument. Worries about physical appearance lead to low self-esteem and a need to control weight, which may lead into a cycle of depression and a further loss of confidence (NIMH) (n.d.). Eating habits have changed significantly in the post war period (Young’s, 2004). Young’s points out that these changes in eating habits and the abundance of food now available, in part due to the role played by supermarkets, fast food outlets and the growth in international travel, could also be having a detrimental effect on body image. The World Health Organisation (WHO, 2004) reports 10% of children are overweight lending support to the argument that body image in the media may influence the young. Eating disorders such as AN and BN are attempts by young people to be in control of the way they look and are portrayed by society, which may influence their happiness.
The influence of our social roles within society, whether in our work or home lives, will affect our happiness in our individual roles (The Open University, 2013 p47). Influences on happiness and unhappiness may include factors such as being in employment, strong family support, a good network of friends and a sense of belonging (The Open University, 2013 p48). Being active and keeping one’s mind active is also an important part of being happy and having as many different sources of interest as possible may contribute to this. People who are less active and have fewer contacts may be unhappier than those who don’t (Layard, 2005). How one perceives happiness may vary with the socio-cultural environment in which they were brought up, with people in Western society being generally happier (White, 2006).
The influence of happiness on our everyday lives contributes greatly to the way we feel about ourselves. As a species we have evolved a mechanism by which we can make up almost anything. Gilbert describes a mechanism he defines as an “experience simulator”, which means we have the ability to imagine a situation before it actually happens (The Open University, 2013 p51). Another term introduced by Gilbert is “impact bias”, which broadly means that within 6-12 months following an apparently life-changing event, one will be as happy after the event as before. Gilbert explains “real happiness is what we get when we get what we want, as opposed to synthetic happiness which is what we get when we don’t get what we really want” (The Open University, 2013 pp50-51).
It could be argued that if we play a certain role we can synthesise a greater sense of happiness. The evidence suggests that whatever our role in society is, we have an ability to find the best in every situation. Layard (2005) points out that our societal roles play a major part in perceived happiness. Gilbert (The Open University, 2013) points to scientific data that would seem to confirm Layard’s view that a person’s sense of happiness can be influenced by how we live our lives. Gilbert presents two sets of experimental data as evidence that happiness can be synthesised. These sets of data were from only a small sample size and the results may not be representative of society, so further research should be undertaken. One’s individual sense of happiness, whether synthetic or real, will reflect on how society in general operates. In the author’s opinion, having a happy society can only be good in creating a happier world.
Conclusion
Society has shaped us to believe that body image is all too important, as we are constantly bombarded with a view of the perceived ideal. Looking good would appear to make us happy, possibly more so during our youth, but there are obviously many other factors that can contribute to happiness.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How does society contribute to anorexia?" I need to figure out how society plays a role in the development of anorexia nervosa. From what I know, anorexia is an eating disorder where people have an obsessive fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, often leading them to restrict their food intake to an unhealthy level.

First, I should probably understand what anorexia is a bit better. It's classified as a mental health disorder, and it's more common in certain groups, like young women, but it can affect anyone. There are physical and psychological consequences to it, and it can be really serious, even life-threatening in some cases.

Now, the question is about society's contribution to anorexia. So, I need to think about how societal factors might influence or contribute to someone developing this disorder. I think there are a few angles to approach this from.

One obvious aspect is the media and how it portrays body image. Nowadays, especially in Western societies, there's a lot of pressure to look a certain way, and that often means being thin. Movies, TV shows, magazines, and social media are filled with images of slender models and celebrities, which can set unrealistic standards for what is considered attractive.

I remember reading somewhere that the ideal body type for women has changed over time. Like, in the past, fuller figures were considered more attractive, but nowadays, thinner is often seen as better. This shift might be contributing to body dissatisfaction among women and girls, which is a known risk factor for anorexia.

Also, fashion industries often prefer very thin models, which can reinforce the idea that being underweight is desirable. There have been discussions and even some regulations in certain countries about the use of underweight models in fashion shows and advertisements.

But it's not just the media; there are also cultural and social norms that play a role. For example, in some cultures, being thin is associated with success, wealth, and higher social status, while being overweight might be stigmatized. This can create a lot of pressure for individuals to conform to these ideals, even if it means engaging in unhealthy behaviors.

Moreover, there's the issue of body shaming and bullying. If someone is teased or bullied about their weight, it can lead to negative feelings about their body and potentially drive them to extreme measures to lose weight.

Another factor could be the way society discusses and approaches food and dieting. There's a lot of emphasis on dieting and losing weight, with countless diets and fitness programs advertised everywhere. This constant focus on weight loss can create an environment where restrictive eating behaviors are normalized and even encouraged.

Additionally, success and self-worth are often linked to physical appearance in our society. People are judged based on how they look, and there's a belief that if you're thin, you're more successful, happier, and更有价值。这种观念可能会导致一些人为了达到这个标准而牺牲自己的健康。

还有，社交媒体的兴起也可能加剧了这个问题。在平台上，人们经常展示他们经过精心策划和编辑的照片，展现完美的生活和身体形象。这种比较文化可能导致他人感到不满足自己的外貌，并试图通过极端的手段来改变自己。

不过，我也意识到，虽然社会因素可能对某些人产生影响，但并不是每个人都会因为这些压力而发展出饮食失调。所以，可能还有其他个人的因素在起作用，比如遗传、心理状态和个人经历等。

也许我可以看看一些研究或统计数据，看看社会因素和anorexia之间的关系有多强。比如，有没有研究显示，在更注重体形的社会中，anorexia的发病率更高？或者，有没有案例研究表明，特定的文化或环境因素与anorexia的发展有关？

我需要找一些可靠的资源来支持我的观点。可能需要查找学术文章、医学研究报告或者权威机构发布的资料。

另外，我应该考虑不同文化背景下的情况，看看在不同的社会环境中，anorexia的发生率是否有差异，以及这些差异是否可以归因于社会态度和价值观的不同。

我也应该注意，虽然社会因素可能是一个重要的贡献者，但anorexia是一个复杂的疾病，涉及多种因素的相互作用。因此，不能单纯地将责任归咎于社会，而是需要综合看待。

总之，我认为社会通过塑造美的标准、强调体重和外貌的重要性，以及营造一种持续的压力来符合这些标准，从而在anorexia的发病中起着一定的作用。当然，这只是一个初步的想法，我需要更多的信息来完善这个观点。

Anorexia Nervosa Impact On Society
Anorexia Nervosa Impact On Society
By Ray Andrew | Submitted On January 16, 2008
Some statistics show that 1% of American women have anorexia nervosa, many people don't have idea on how dangerous this disorder is. Thousands of teenagers die each year due to anorexia and eating disorders. Society plays an important role to help solve this growing problem and make adolescents aware of the dangers.
If we want to see the anorexia nervosa impact on society, its enough to see the death statistics and emotional problems that they have to understand how severe it is. There are groups of people especially online that support anorexia nervosa as a lifestyle and they give tips and advice to them to hide their problem from their family and keep a rigorous diet.
I think we need to change the way society values people, there are testimonies of teenagers that were very happy, but when they started dieting due to an emotional problem they had caused by a critique of their weight, their life became miserable. Adolescents want to be loved and accepted in society, so when people critiques their body or physical appearance, sometimes the frustration is so big, that they do anything to be accepted be liked.
The consequence is that adolescents start dieting and exercising with obsession, to the point that they starve themselves and hurt their body. They also see all the celebrities in tv as perfect and they want to be like them, very thin.
Anorexia is an emotional problem and cannot be solved just with medications, the person needs to understand that what she is doing is wrong and is damaging her self. She needs to feel loved and accepted by her family to recover from this disorder, she needs to change her self image.
Society is causing a negative impact on teenagers, they are acquiring the wrong values from the media and take celebrities as their role model of success. Parents have to make their child aware of this problem and its consequences.

Abstract
Eating disorders are very common in today’s society and can cause death if an intervention isn’t performed. While working in the hospital and being part of the wrestling team in high school I’ve witness several people with this disorder. Anorexia and bulimia are the most prevalent and generally are accompanied by another psychological disorder. Many individuals suffer from more than one disorder and almost half of people who have anorexia develop bulimia or bulimic patterns. Although there is no specific cause we do know that women are more likely to suffer from anorexia or bulimia. The key to fighting anorexia and bulimia is to identify who is at risk, identify the symptoms, identify the warning signs, and seek treatment.
Eating Disorders and Its Impact on Society
An eating disorder is an illness some people suffer from due to an obsession with food, body image, or weight.  These people struggle to have control over their bodies even if it means making decision that affects their overall health. Having a severe disturbance in eating habits and related thoughts and emotions can lead to death. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness according to Eating Disorder Statistics. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are two of the most common types of eating disorders in the United

The aim of this essay is to explore how society shapes people’s lives. The meaning of the word “shaping” in this context means to “influence or affect” (The Open University, 2013, YO32 p 29). This essay will focus on Childhood: Body image and stress related eating disorders, from Block 4, Unit 3 and Psychology: Social influence, happiness and natural and synthetic happiness from Unit 5.
Society has shaped us to embrace a rather different body image to that of 100 years ago to the point where being slim is now considered the norm (The Open University, 2013 Unit 3, 3.

2). There has been a shift from the plumper body image seen in paintings dating back to the 19th century, to the ultra slim catwalk models of today. As there has been a shift in body image, there has also been a shift in eating habits (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.2). It is now less likely for families to sit down together and eat the more traditional three meals a day, with young people now more likely to favour energy dense fast food diets (NSHD) (n.

d.). The National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) (n.d.) recommends that young people should take regular exercise and have a minimum of 3 thirty minute sessions of exercise per week and drink a minimum of 2 litres of water per day.
The pressure society places on young people to conform to the ideal body image has led to many adolescents developing stress-related eating disorders (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.4). There are three main eating disorders: Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and binge eating (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.6). Disordered eating is a mental illness in which the patient severely restricts their calorie intake. Although girls are mainly affected by anorexia a significant number of boys are also affected (the Open University, 2013). AN is quite different from BN giving sufferers of BN cause to overeat and then purge to make themselves sick, thereby controlling their weight (The Open University, 2013, Unit 3, 3.4). It could be argued that the media’s portrayal of the ideal body shape may lead to young people developing eating disorders. The evidence suggests the Press may be partly to blame, and that society is ignoring a cry for help.
Quoted in the Daily Telegraph (Jardine, 2013), Kate Moss said “nothing tastes as good as skinny feels” – comments like this add fuel to the argument. Worries about physical appearance lead to low self-esteem and a need to control weight, which may lead into a cycle of depression and a further loss of confidence (NIMH) (n.d.). Eating habits have changed significantly in the post war period (Young’s, 2004). Young’s points out that these changes in eating habits and the abundance of food now available, in part due to the role played by supermarkets, fast food outlets and the growth in international travel, could also be having a detrimental effect on body image. The World Health Organisation (WHO, 2004) reports 10% of children are overweight lending support to the argument that body image in the media may influence the young. Eating disorders such as AN and BN are attempts by young people to be in control of the way they look and are portrayed by society, which may influence their happiness.
The influence of our social roles within society, whether in our work or home lives, will affect our happiness in our individual roles (The Open University, 2013 p47). Influences on happiness and unhappiness may include factors such as being in employment, strong family support, a good network of friends and a sense of belonging (The Open University, 2013 p48). Being active and keeping one’s mind active is also an important part of being happy and having as many different sources of interest as possible may contribute to this. People who are less active and have fewer contacts may be unhappier than those who don’t (Layard, 2005). How one perceives happiness may vary with the socio-cultural environment in which they were brought up, with people in Western society being generally happier (White, 2006).
The influence of happiness on our everyday lives contributes greatly to the way we feel about ourselves. As a species we have evolved a mechanism by which we can make up almost anything. Gilbert describes a mechanism he defines as an “experience simulator”, which means we have the ability to imagine a situation before it actually happens (The Open University, 2013 p51). Another term introduced by Gilbert is “impact bias”, which broadly means that within 6-12 months following an apparently life-changing event, one will be as happy after the event as before. Gilbert explains “real happiness is what we get when we get what we want, as opposed to synthetic happiness which is what we get when we don’t get what we really want” (The Open University, 2013 pp50-51).
It could be argued that if we play a certain role we can synthesise a greater sense of happiness. The evidence suggests that whatever our role in society is, we have an ability to find the best in every situation. Layard (2005) points out that our societal roles play a major part in perceived happiness. Gilbert (The Open University, 2013) points to scientific data that would seem to confirm Layard’s view that a person’s sense of happiness can be influenced by how we live our lives. Gilbert presents two sets of experimental data as evidence that happiness can be synthesised. These sets of data were from only a small sample size and the results may not be representative of society, so further research should be undertaken. One’s individual sense of happiness, whether synthetic or real, will reflect on how society in general operates. In the author’s opinion, having a happy society can only be good in creating a happier world.
Conclusion
Society has shaped us to believe that body image is all too important, as we are constantly bombarded with a view of the perceived ideal. Looking good would appear to make us happy, possibly more so during our youth, but there are obviously many other factors that can contribute to happiness.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder most commonly affecting adolescent women (Russell 1970, 132). The diagnostic criteria for anorexia is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association 4th ed (DSM-IV) as excessive dieting or exercise leading to extreme weight loss, a refusal to gain weight, disturbance in body shape perception and amenorrhea (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). It has been suggested that the psychopathologies behind AN arise from within a cultural framework, namely the Western culture (Bordo 1993, 141-145). The Western ideals of beauty and portrayal of a slim body type in relation to attractiveness and healthiness have perpetuated a ‘culture of thinness’ and ‘fat-phobia,’ from which AN manifests from extreme measures taken to achieve these conceptions (Bordo 1993, 146-149). Furthermore, in recent years AN has become a transcultural disorder, affecting non-Western cultures influenced by Western culture such as the Chinese, Fijians and African Americans. Mass media has enabled widespread access to Western culture, resulting in a global culture phenomenon that has increased the incidence of eating disorders such as AN worldwide (Simpson, 2002, 66-67). In addition, cultural assimilation as well as cultural clash in those who must balance their traditional culture with the modern Western culture has been shown to contribute to a predisposition towards AN, as a result of self-conflicts and unstable self-identity (Shuriquie, 1999, 355). Finally, some have advocated for a more culturally sensitive definition of AN, which currently is thought to be Western-centric in its definition. Proponents advocate the consideration of individual sociocultural factors, notably unrelated to the culture of thinness, contributing to the development of AN within the context of local biologies (Simpson, 2002, 68-69). Thus AN must be analyzed from within a transcultural framework, one which encompasses the influences of the Western culture on perceptions of the body as well as considers the specific cultural context, which sheds light on causes of AN.

Anorexia is considered a Western culture-bound phenomenon as a result of the current sociopolitical demands placed upon women in regards to the ideals of beauty, body shapes, and feminism (Derenne and Beresin 2006, 257). The term culture-bound denotes a restriction of a phenomenon within a particular cultural group due to specific social, political, culture and psychological factors from within that culture (Prince 1985, 197-198). As most American women are preoccupied with their weight, AN could simply be an extreme manifestation of the nation-wide preoccupation with weight and body image (Lake 1999, 83-84). Historically, the concept of the ideal female body was fluid, changing with the political and economic climate, which affected cultural values and thus attitudes toward female bodies. During the colonial era, strong, fertile, able-bodied women were favoured, as they would be capable of assisting with chores as well as bearing many children to increase family size. Times changed in the 19th century with the introduction of a more comfortable lifestyle, when the waifish look became popular and women sported short hair, pants and a slender, androgynous look that symbolized feminism and liberation. Since then, there has been a cultural trend towards thinness, with famous models such as Twiggy becoming household idols, culminating in today’s nation-wide obsession with ‘weight-watching,’ ‘calorie-counting’ and ‘dieting’ (Derenne and Beresin 2006, 258-259). It is the mass media portrayal of the ideal thin female body as attractive, desirable and healthy that has further perpetuated the ‘culture of thinness,’ targeting particularly vulnerable women – young adolescents and teenage girls. Coincidentally, pre-teens, teenagers and adolescent females have the highest incidence of AN (Borzekowski 2005, 289). Recently, the incidence of AN has increased in pre-teen and teenage girls, as they are often the main target audience for a variety of media, which present unrealistic expectations of their body shapes (Borzekowski 2005, 290-291). Fashion magazines often depict thin women as desirable and healthy, television ads promote the latest technological invention that helps a woman lose weight and the Internet offers countless websites with tips on ‘eating healthy,’ keeping off the ‘fat,’ appetite suppressants and ‘0 calorie’ dietary supplements. Particularly notable are the ‘pro-anorexia’ websites that proclaim AN to be a lifestyle choice, offer advice on weight management, effective dieting strategies and community support encouraging AN (Derenne and Beresin 2006, 258-259) . This bombardment of social and cultural expectations to be thin in order to be attractive has predominated Western culture since the 19th century and has not only grown, but crossed cultural boundaries through communication via mass media to affect other cultural groups (Shuriquie 1999, 356-357). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the psychiatric problems behind AN may be described as a set of particular symptoms that arise from within a cultural framework – the Western culture of thinness.
The origin of AN may have arisen from Western cultural values, but there have been an increasing number of reports of eating disorders such as AN in non-Western populations, challenging the notion that AN is a Western culture-bound syndrome. This trend is attributed to the exposure of non-Western cultures to Western culture via mass media. One study has shown that Hispanic and South African girls exhibit AN, influenced by their exposure to Western media, suggesting that AN transcends cultural and socioeconomic boundaries (Nasser 1994, 26-27). It was previously believed that the mentioned group of people were ‘protected’ from modern Western influences, due to their traditions of embracing larger, full-bodied women. Yet, a study conducted by Becker (Becker 2002, 509) found that the women of a group of islanders hailing from the South Pacific Ocean, the Fijians, have been heavily influenced by the Western culture of thinness. There were no reports of eating disorders in the Fijian population until 1995, when an international television station was broadcasted for the first time, depicting Western media. Three years later, reports of dissatisifation with body image, attempts to control weight such as dieting and self-induced vomiting were heard, suggesting that these Fijian women were significantly affected by the Western cultural ideals of the perfect body and perhaps could not distinguish between the idealism and concepts of perfection that television presented and reality. Despite a tradition of favourably viewing full-bodied women (Becker 1995, 27-29), a few years of exposure to Western cultural and perceptions of beauty have negatively impacted the Fijians. Anthropologists have studied the reasons behind the heavy influence of Western culture and have suggested that less developed, non-Western populations such as the Fijians regard the values portrayed by Western culture as symbols of socioeconomic progression, high social status and social acceptance (Shuriquie 1999, 358-360) and thus strive to emulate and assimilate Western culture values within their local cultures. Streigel-Moore points out that even African American groups within the United States have shown increasing incidence of AN, stemming from a desire to participate in the ‘white world’ (Striegel-Moore 2003, 1326-1328). Similarly, a study conducted by Nasser on the prevalence of AN in teenage Egyptian girls in Cairo indicated that traditional Egyptian values of larger, fertile women have not conferred protective effects from the assimilation of Western conceptions of the ideal body type via mass media in young Egyptian women (Nasser 1994, 28-30). These findings highlight a phenomenon known as global culture, where the world is connected via media, allowing cultural values to be readily accessible by other cultures across the globe (Banks 1992, 867). In this instance, global culture has contributed to the rising incidences of eating disorders such as AN, which has ultimately become a transcultural disorder that is not limited by cultural boundaries.
In addition to the global cultural phenomenon, some have argued that those immigrating to the West from non-Western cultures experience cultural clash, leading to greater risk of psychiatric disorders such as AN (Lee 1996, 21-23). Studies have indicated that those who are assimilated into Western culture are less impacted by media-driven concepts such as dieting and maintaining a slender frame than those who choose to maintain their own cultural values while living in a Western culture. Culture clash occurs when an individual adopts two cultural systems, which are often in conflict. Mumford and Whitehouse have shown that Asian girls in the United Kingdom that have not acculturated struggle to balance their beliefs and attitudes at home, where their traditional culture dominantes, and at school, where there is pressure to conform to the norms of the Western culture (Mumford and Whitehouse 1991, 222-225). Unfortunately, the unrealistic expectations of body shape is often taken as the norm in individuals affected by this cultural clash, leading to increased vulnerability to the negative influences of Western culture on body image and subsequently increased susceptibility to AN. These findings interestingly point to the influence of a non-Western culture within the context of Western culture not as protective, but exacerbative of eating disorders.
Although the phenomena of global culture and culture clash demonstrate the extensiveness and impact of Western cultural values on the rest of the world, it has been argued that attributing the cause and symptoms of AN solely to the sociocultural influence of the West may be inaccurate. The culture of thinness may be pervasive, but it is not the sole explanation for AN. Simpson claims that the prevailing biomedical definition of anorexia as a psychiatric disorder characterized by fat phobia and a distorted perspective on body image is itself a cultural construction within the confines of the Western culture (Simpson 2002, 66-70). This suggests a need to adopt a culturally-sensitive definition of AN, one which stems from within the context of local biologies rather a universal framework. Fat-phobia is currently the defining characteristic in AN, but there have been accounts of those with an eating disorder very similar to AN, except for the obvious lack of fat-phobia. Simpson presents reports of Chinese women suffering from AN who do not report fat-phobia. Rather, they attribute chronic epigastric bloating and a loss of appetite to their disinclination to eat (Simpson 2002, 68). In another case, a woman refuses to eat after being separated from her boyfriend, citing abdominal discomforts and a disinterest in food (Simpson 2002, 68). These psychosomatic symptoms are a result of somatization (Kleinman 1989, 57), where the illness symptoms of AN manifests from social problems, rather than any dissatisfaction of body shape. Psychosomatic symptoms are commonly reported in the Chinese population and contribute to the etiology of AN, although they are not included in the DSM-IV criteria. Furthermore, some women from conservative religious fundamentalist backgrounds have been cited to abstain from food, as a result of their beliefs about food, the body, femininity and spirituality (Simpson 2002, 68). Similarly, Mogul discusses a case where an anorexic patient refused food and fasted to the point of emaciation due to a religious belief that attainment of the highest spirituality and freedom from materialism came with a rejection of the temptations of food (Mogul 1980, 51). Thus, explaining AN within a Western cultural framework establishes a limited perspective of the disorder that does not take into account the personal, sociocultural factors within local biologies that contribute to various forms of AN.

Ultimately, AN is not a universal disorder, but a transcultural disorder. AN should not be viewed within the confines of any one culture, but rather understood to be a cross-cultural phenomenon. Essentially, AN is a psychiatric disorder with multi-factorial causes, requiring the incorporation of the Western cultural preoccupation with fat-phobia and unrealistic body shape expectations and the cross-cultural psychological and sociocultural reasons within local biologies to arrive at a holistic and culture-sensitive definition.

How Society Affects Eating Disorders
The media can impact people’s lives in many ways, whether it’s fashion, movies, literature, or hobbies. Society and the media tend to judge how someone looks based on their body composition . Eating disorders are rarely about food or wanting to be thin but instead people that suffer from eating disorder use food and unhealthy behaviors like dieting and starving themselves to cope with unpleasant and overwhelming emotions and stressful situations.( At least in the short term, these behaviors can relieve anxiety and stress). However , in the long term, they actually increase anxiety and stress and create other serious complications. Eating disorder are illnesses, not character flaws or choices because they can not be determined whether someone is diagnosed.
An eating disorder is an illness because it is not a character flaw or something someone chooses “Eating Disorders: Why do young adults develop eating disorders” ULifeline. It is not possible to tell if someone has an eating disorder because it is not based on the appearance . Certain individuals with eating disorders can be underweight, normal weight or overweight so it is impossible to diagnose anyone by just looking at their appearances. Extreme weight loss and having the belief that one is fat despite excessive thinness are key features of anorexia. As with most mental illnesses, eating disorders are not caused by just one factor but by a combination of sociocultural, psychological and biological factors.
The media brings pressure towards the their viewers because the viewers want to look like the individuals in the magazine but what they fail to realize is that the  models have touch ups and more. The individuals who fail to experience or have the lifestyle that the “perfect” models have are shown to be ugly and unpopular and some may even get bullied for not living up to those “perfect” standards. Even those individuals that tend to have healthy lifestyles by their appearance is not always what it seems because everyone’s body is different .  Society and the media’s standards has become oblivious to the viewers and the viewers are constantly concerned about their body which causes low self esteem and body dissatisfaction which causes them to go on diets which hardly ever are successful. Going on unhealthy diets lead to symptoms of eating disorders and before they know it they are starving themselves and more.
Eating disorders can lead to serious medical conditions and can cause the person to take higher more difficult challenges like counseling or even therapy groups. One of the main obsessions in the world is losing weight and has became an obsession. Many actors , movie stars, models, have been diagnosed with eating disorder because their agency wants them to be “healthy and fit” and makes them take extra measures to live up to the standards. However, some people think that just because the media or online the cause of eating disorders are about weight loss, which can reduce the seriousness that eating disorders have in the eye of the beholder and gives a fake impression which places blame on that individual. Eating disorders have become very difficult and troubling in our toxic society and media environment and it tends to reflect on conditions that have an extreme but yet common fair reaction.
Eating disorder are illnesses, not character flaws or choices because they can not be determined whether someone is diagnosed. Some individuals don’t live up to those critical principles and are not diagnosed  but they frequently duplicate their routine and then regain weight and repeatedly do their mistake over again. As a normal citizen , we think that the ideal image in what we think is “normal” will let us be treated fairly and get the attention we seek. Both of society and media eating disorders are centered around an intense concentration with weight and calories. America is a country that is filled with freedom but the media plays a part in our culture and each and every one of us are surfing the web each day and are filled with more fake knowledge and all the advertising affect us mentally. We need to learn to accept ourselves for the way that we are and open up to new relationships.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can gather from them.

First, there's an article from EzineArticles about anorexia nervosa's impact on society. It mentions that about 1% of American women have anorexia, and it's a serious disorder that can be fatal. The author talks about how society contributes to this problem, especially through the media promoting thinness as the ideal body type. There's also mention of online groups that support anorexia, which is concerning. The author suggests that society needs to change its values and help adolescents understand the dangers of such disorders.

Next, there's an essay from Bartleby about eating disorders and their impact on society. It discusses anorexia and bulimia as the most common types and notes that these disorders have a high mortality rate. The essay also touches on the rise in eating disorders over time and compares different societies to see how cultural factors influence the prevalence of these disorders. It uses the example of Fiji, where the introduction of Western television led to an increase in eating disorders among teenage girls. This suggests that media exposure can significantly impact body image and eating behaviors.

Another essay is from StudyMoose, focusing on how society shapes people's lives, particularly in relation to body image and eating disorders. It discusses how societal ideals of thinness have changed over time and how this has affected young people's perceptions of their bodies. The essay also mentions that while society pressures people to conform to certain body standards, not everyone develops eating disorders, implying that individual factors also play a role.

Then, there's an essay from UK Essays about cultural impacts on eating disorders, specifically anorexia nervosa. This essay argues that anorexia is a Western culture-bound phenomenon due to the cultural emphasis on thinness and beauty standards. However, it also notes that anorexia is no longer confined to Western cultures and has spread to other parts of the world through globalization and the influence of mass media. The essay suggests that a culturally sensitive approach is needed to understand and treat anorexia in different cultural contexts.

Lastly, there's a blog post from The Nina Cartel about how society affects eating disorders. It discusses the pressure from media and society to look a certain way and how this can lead to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy behaviors like dieting, which can escalate into eating disorders. The author emphasizes that eating disorders are illnesses, not choices, and that they cannot be diagnosed solely based on appearance.

From these sources, a few key points emerge:

1. **Media Influence:** The media plays a significant role in shaping body image ideals, particularly promoting thinness as the standard of beauty. This can lead to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy behaviors aimed at achieving an unrealistic body type.

2. **Cultural Factors:** Western culture's emphasis on thinness is a major contributor to eating disorders like anorexia. However, as Western media becomes more globally accessible, these disorders are spreading to non-Western cultures as well.

3. **Societal Pressure:** Society's valuation of appearance and the linking of thinness to success and happiness can create immense pressure, especially on young people, to conform to these ideals.

4. **Individual Vulnerability:** While societal factors contribute to eating disorders, not everyone is equally affected. Individual psychological, biological, and genetic factors also play a role in determining who develops these disorders.

5. **Need for Cultural Sensitivity:** Given that eating disorders manifest differently across cultures, there is a need for culturally sensitive definitions and treatments that consider local biologies and sociocultural factors.

Based on this information, it's clear that society contributes to anorexia through various channels, primarily via media influences and cultural ideals regarding body image. These factors create an environment where individuals feel pressured to achieve an unrealistic body standard, and for some, this pressure leads to disordered eating behaviors.

However, it's essential to recognize that anorexia is a complex disorder influenced by multiple factors, and societal influences are just one piece of the puzzle. Therefore, addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that includes education, raising awareness, promoting positive body image, and providing support for those who are vulnerable.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{Society contributes to anorexia through media influences, cultural ideals of thinness, and societal pressure to conform to certain body standards. These factors create an environment where individuals feel pressured to achieve unrealistic body standards, leading some to develop disordered eating behaviors.}} \]
