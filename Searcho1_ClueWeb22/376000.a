Alright, I need to list the advantages and disadvantages of colonialism. Now, colonialism is a pretty complex topic, and it's important to approach it thoughtfully. I know that colonialism involves one country taking control over another country or region and imposing its own political, economic, and cultural systems. This has happened throughout history, with examples like the British Empire, the Roman Empire, and many others.

First, I should probably define what colonialism is exactly. From what I remember, colonialism is when a more powerful country takes over a less powerful one, often for the purpose of exploiting its resources, labor, or strategic location. This usually involves settling colonies of people from the colonizing country in the new territory and establishing political control.

So, starting with the advantages—this might be a bit tricky because colonialism is generally viewed negatively today, but I recall that some people argue that it had some positive effects. For example, colonizers often brought infrastructure like roads, railways, and ports to the colonies, which could facilitate trade and economic development. They might also have introduced modern education systems and technologies that the colonies may not have had otherwise.

Moreover, colonialism sometimes led to the spread of ideas and cultures, fostering a kind of global exchange. For instance, the British colonial era saw the spread of the English language, which is now a global lingua franca. Similarly, the French colonial period left a lasting influence in areas like architecture and legal systems in many African and Asian countries.

On the other hand, there are numerous disadvantages associated with colonialism. One of the most significant is the exploitation and abuse of the colonized people. Colonizers often imposed harsh labor systems, such as slavery or indentured servitude, to extract resources from the colonies. This led to immense suffering and deprivation for the local populations.

Additionally, colonial powers frequently exploited the natural resources of the colonies without reinvesting in their development, leading to long-term economic disadvantages. Many colonies were reduced to producing single cash crops or raw materials, making them dependent on the colonizer and vulnerable to market fluctuations.

Colonialism also often involved the suppression of native cultures and languages, as the colonizers imposed their own ways of life. This cultural erosion can have lasting impacts on national identity and social cohesion.

Furthermore, the arbitrary drawing of borders by colonial powers without regard for ethnic or cultural divisions has led to ongoing conflicts in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa.

I think it's also important to consider the impact on the colonizing countries themselves. While they benefited economically from colonial exploitation, there were also costs, such as the need to maintain military forces to control the colonies and suppress uprisings.

Moreover, the legacy of colonialism continues to affect international relations today. Many former colonies still struggle with the economic and political structures imposed during the colonial period, and there are ongoing debates about reparations and how to address historical injustices.

I should probably look up some specific examples to illustrate these points. Maybe I can look at the British colonization of India or the Belgian rule in the Congo to see both the positive and negative impacts.

Let me try to structure this better. I'll make two lists: advantages and disadvantages of colonialism.

Advantages:

1. Infrastructure development: Colonizers built roads, railways, ports, etc., which could benefit the colony in the long run.

2. Introduction of modern education and technology: This could lead to long-term human capital development.

3. Spread of ideas and cultures: Colonialism facilitated global exchange and the dissemination of knowledge.

4. Political stability: In some cases, colonial rule brought stability to regions that were previously plagued by warfare and chaos.

Disadvantages:

1. Exploitation of resources and labor: Colonies were often exploited for their resources, leaving them impoverished.

2. Suppression of native cultures and languages: This cultural erosion can have lasting negative effects on national identity.

3. Imposition of foreign political systems: These may not be suitable for the local context and can lead to governance issues.

4. Creation of artificial borders: Leading to ethnic and political conflicts in post-colonial states.

5. Human rights abuses:包括奴隶制、强迫劳动和暴力镇压。

I think that covers the main points. But I should probably look into whether there are any other advantages or disadvantages that I might have missed.

Let me consider the economic perspective. Some argue that colonialism led to the integration of colonies into the global economy, which could have long-term benefits. However, others point out that this integration was often exploitative and designed to benefit the colonizer rather than the colony.

Also, from a social standpoint, colonialism often led to the mixing of different peoples and cultures, which could result in the creation of new cultural forms and societies. On the other hand, it could also lead to social stratification and conflict between different groups.

I should also think about the impact on indigenous populations. In many cases, colonization led to the displacement and even genocide of indigenous peoples, which is an unforgivable disadvantage.

Perhaps I should look up some academic sources to get a more nuanced understanding. Maybe there are scholars who have studied the long-term effects of colonialism on development.

Let me try to do a quick search to see if there are any prominent studies or viewpoints on this topic.

Essay Question: With reference to relevant theories and examples, critically analyse the social, political and economic consequences of colonialism on developing countries.
Word Count: 2310 words.
Introduction
One of the most important consequences of the World War II was the emergence of a new process of decolonization, which created a unique moment of opportunity for many developing states to achieve sustainable socio-economic development. In this context, it was widely expected that achievement of formal political independence for the former colonies would enable these states to advance an overall national progress with greater efficiency (Fieldhouse 1999, Krishna 2009, Reynolds 2000). In practice, however, the process of development has been highly uneven, sometimes leading to landmark achievements in some regions (Ricklefs et al. 2010), but more often accompanied with multiple economic problems and socio-ethnic tensions (Fieldhouse 1999, Rodney 1981, Reid 2009). This paper aims to examine complex social, political and economic consequences, which process of colonialism had on developing states.

Using a world systems theoretical approach, advanced in works of Wallerstein (1974, 1996), this essay argues that colonialism as a process had far reaching impact on developing states in several ways. Socially, the creation and imposition of new fixed identities and Western principles had reshaped the traditional social institutions of the colonial states, often resulting in growing tensions and conflicts between competing ethnical and religious groups. Politically, although in some cases the inherited from the colonial times had largely benefit newly independent states to enforce development programme at the national level, in most of the cases colonialism had negative consequences, often resulting in vacuum of power, civil disorder or abuse of state institutions by the new national elites. Economically, the trade structures originally designed by metropole empires were largely retained in post-colonial period, often leading to high financial dependence of the new independent states on their former colonial masters. Thus, a thorough examination of social, economic and political consequences of colonialism from a "world system approach" can explain the existing pattern of "underdevelopment", which is common for many developing states.
This paper is structured as follows. The introductory section explains the world system approach. The main body analyses the social, economic and political consequences of colonialism process, using the above mentioned theoretical perspective. The concluding section summarizes the main arguments.
World Systems Theory: An intellectual background.
World system approach (WSA) can be understood as a theoretical sociological perspective, initially articulated by Wallerstein (1974; 1996) and further developed by other thinkers (Fenelon 2016), which aims to explain why patterns of underdevelopment persist in developing states once the states were able to achieve political independence. WSA is founded on the principle that in order to understand a phenomenon of underdevelopment it is necessary to examine wider global economic and political dynamics, rather than focus exclusively on each individual region and state (Wallerstein 1974, Mishra 2013).
From this perspective, global history has been deeply affected by the emergence and decline of a specific world systems, which reflect to the existing form of production relations dominant at the global level within given time periodÂ  (Hobden and Wyn Jones 2017: 133; Wallerstein 1974).Â  The global capitalism as a contemporary world system with fixedÂ  "structures, member groups, rules of legitimation"(Wallerstein 2011:374)Â  is driven by the principle of persistent capital accumulation (Wallerstein 1983), founded on the existence of a global division of labour (Nau 2014), whereby international system is dominated by powerful "core" and "semi-periphery" states, whose stable political and economic structures allow them to systematically exploit less developed "periphery states" (Hobden and Wynn Jones 2017, Hall 2000, Mishra 2013, Wallerstein 2011). Although powerful core states no longer can exercise control over developing states by an exclusive reliance on military conquest due to global spread of democratic values and principle of self-determination (Reynolds 2000), they are willing to resort instead to a variety of cultural, political and economic mechanisms in order to maintain an overall stability of the capitalist world system (Hall 2000, Hobden and Wynn Jones 2017, Mishra 2013, Wallerstein 1974, Wallerstein 1996).
As a result, despite regular occurrences of certain crises and structural inconsistencies, the world system displays extraordinary capacity to expand and reproduce its continual dominance, as long as it is able to guarantee stable surplus extraction and domination of the capital over the working classes (Lee 2011, Wallerstein 1996).Having defined WSA, the next section of the essay will examine social, economic and political consequences of colonialism on developing states.
EconomicÂ  Consequences of colonialism
As noted earlier, the capitalist world system provided powerful core states with an opportunity to exploit less developed periphery countries through systematic through draining off the surplus production, often using raw materials and natural resources of the developing countries for personal capital accumulation at the expense indigenous population (Rodney 1981, Frank 1967, Headlee 2010:15, Wallerstein, 1983). In this context, the most immediate economic repercussion of the colonialism process was the need to radically transform the existing economic structures in order to allow greater national development once the colonizers left (Shillington 1989, Reid, 2009). The problem was compounded by the fact that basic economic and transport infrastructure in newly independent states was in a disastrous condition after decades of the prolonged use by colonizers (Shillington, 1995).
As a result, faced with strong electoral pressures and largely inefficient economic structures, national elites in the developing states were in effect forced to open their domestic markets to MNC'S in order to finance domestic financial reform programme (Shillington 1995, Rodney 1981, Frank 1967, Fieldhouse 1999).Â  Despite the fact that in some cases, like Hong Kong and Singapore, such policy was successful in creating sufficient structural conditions for these states to pursue sustainable economic growth (Ricklefs et. al. 2010, Manhubani 2009; HeldÂ  et. al. 1999, Mauze and Milne 2002), it is equally important to remember that in most cases it had multiple negative financial consequences, often reinforcing patterns of exploitation and dependence for the developing countries (Reid, 2009, Rodney 1981; Shillington, 1995; Frank, 1967).
For instance, once Ghana opened its economy to foreign capital, its key economic sectors were privatized by French and American corporations, making country politically and economically dependent on foreign investors. In this case, although formally independent, country's national economy, natural resources and commodities are still being exploited by the same powerful core states (Shillington 1995). The same patterns of exploitation affected the majority of former French colonies, where the France still was displayed the ability to have a decisive say on the direction of national economic development through mixture of French currency Union and the growing role of MNC'S in newly independent states (McWilliams and Piotrowski 2009, Young 2013, Shillington 1985). According to Frank 1967: 290, such policy also affected South American states, where national economies were heavily dependent on foreign capital, which took over the essential sectors of originally nationalised industry sectors. Furthermore, the former metropole states were able to exploit the national economies of newly independent states through policy of tariff and price imposition, which severely restricted national development opportunities for the periphery countries. Rothermund (2006:259) provides the example of postcolonial India, where the trade relations heavily benefit British firm and producers, often at the expense of weakening the influence of newly established Indian producers. The post-colonial states, which had refused to follow such policy, preferring instead an independent development path, were openly sanctioned, as in case of Vietnam, whose economic growth was restricted due to the sanctions imposed by the US following the Vietnam War (Kwon 2008). Thus, although nominally independent, the majority of post-colonial states were still exploited by powerful core states, which had negative repercussions for the developing countries, including the emergence of political crises, economic instability, heavy reliance on foreign capital and fragmentation of national economies, preventing newly independent states from achieving sustainable national development (Reid, 2009, Rothermund 2006, Shillington 1995, Meredith 2005, Frank 1967).
Political Consequences of colonialism.
If colonialism had important economic consequences on the developing countries, then undoubtedly long-lasting political impact of colonialism process should also be thoroughly examined. However, the repercussions of the colonialism process for the newly independent states had differed depending on the methods of political control exercised by colonial control.
For instance, in case of Southeast Asian region, the colonialism had important positive impact on the developing states, since these states had inherited well-established bureaucracy and efficient administrative structures from colonial times. The classic example in this respect is case of Singapore where the governing elitesÂ Â  had benefited from powerful state apparatus, efficient administrative machinery and rule of law, which allowed the ruling elites to promote and enforce a comprehensive programme of socio-economic reform, transforming the country from one of the poorest, most underdeveloped and economically unstable nations of the world into the global investment hub (Ricklefs et. al. 2010, Mauzy and Milne 2002).
In contrast, the process of colonialism had different consequences on African region. The political control over these states during colonial times was exercised by a reliance on indirect strategies of political co-optation with "regional and local powerholders without transforming their bases of powers whose fate depended on that of the crown" (Tilly, 1992: 24).Â  Such political system was seriously discredited after former colonies were able to win their independence. This gave rise to a power vacuum in most African states, whereby new national elites, often with limited political experience, popular support and inefficient political structures, were required to exercise comprehensive administrative control over large territorial boundariesÂ  with local populations "often mutually suspicious or antagonistic" (Deng 2008:65 as cited in George and Hilal 2013). As a result, it is possible to distinguish different political development dynamics within African states.Â  For instance, in countries like Egypt, Senegal and Tanzania, a generally peaceful economic transition and political stability was achieved, once charismatic and nationalist leaders were able to pursue a comprehensive programme of socio-economic reform often through a mixture of coercion restriction freedoms of political opponents groups (Reid, 2009; Osman, 2011; Hopwood, 1991; Shillington, 1989). In contrast,Â  the national elites in countries including Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea were unable to achieve sustainable political consensus, as their reform programmes was met by disobedience, fierce resistance and in some cases armed resistance from militant and guerrilla groups with an opposite ideological beliefs (Reid, 2009). In this context, political and social machinery of the state apparatus in generally is widely discredited in Africa, since political elites and existing institutions often are viewed as corrupt, inefficient and distant organizations with little interest in public affairs (Baker, 2009).
Socio-Cultural consequences of colonialism.
Having examined political and economic consequences of colonialism, it is now necessary to briefly outline the cultural repercussions of this process. During colonial times, metropole states had largely imposed their principles and traditions through policy of institutionalized racism, systematic violence and social exclusion (Cohen and Kennedy 2013) in order to convince local elites and populations that "their own well-being is wrapped up in the survival of the [capitalist] system as such" (Wallerstein 1974:404). For instance, Christian beliefs and ideals were imported to the African states to replace customary and tribal religion with an overall belief that "only the Christian-Catholic religion is capable of changing native mentality, of giving to our Africans a clear consciousness of their duties, of inspiring in them spirit of loyalty towards" colonial masters (Roelens 1930, as cited in Young, 2003: 419). Such policy had severely weakened the prospects of post-colonial unity or coalition building, as the parties and social movements originally developed in response to imposed identities. For instance, in case of Ghana, the political system was very unstable during first several decades after independence, since main political actors were organized around traditional social divisions and cleavages, imposed by British colonizers during colonial times, viewing their competitors with distrust and hatred (Reid 2009). Likewise, French colonizers had largely ignored fundamental cultural, historical and religious complexities in Algeria, advocating instead a simplified history of country's development as an ongoing battle between civilized and progressive Berber population against violent, chaotic, radical and uncivilized Arab ethnic groups, which severely restricted the possibility of a comprehensive national unity during the first decades after the achievement of political independence (Brandt 2014, PfostlÂ  2014). The most vivid example in this regards is the case of Rwanda where the German and Belgian colonizers in an effort to maintain control over country's political and economic development had created an unequitable power distribution with one ethnic group, Tutsi, enjoying extensive administrative, educational and political privileges by systematically violating the fundamental human rights of other ethnic communities (Melvern 2009, Prunier 1997). Such policy had long lasting impact on Rwandan society, resulting in an intensification of inter-ethnic tensions between competing ethnic communities, which culminated in mass genocide in 1994, when approximately 800, 000 Tutsi civilians were massacred in 100 days (Melvern 2006, Nichols 2008). These examples suggest that principles, stereotypes and identities imposed by colonizers had long-lasting impact on the social dynamics of newly independent society, often resulting in growing ethnic tensions, societal fragmentation and in some cases, organized violence against the members of particular ethnic or religious group.
Conclusion
To conclude, this paper relied on world-systems analysis, articulated by Wallerstein, in order to examine and distinguish several economic, political and socio-cultural consequences of colonialism process on the developing countries. Economically, the colonialism process had resulted in growing dependence and reliance of the developed countries on foreign capital and investment. Politically, although in some cases the inherited from the colonial times had largely benefit newly independent states to enforce development programme at the national level, in most of the cases colonialism had negative consequences, often resulting in vacuum of power, civil disorder or abuse of state institutions by the new national elites. Socially, the creation and imposition of new fixed identities and Western principles had reshaped the traditional social institutions of the colonial states, often resulting in growing tensions and conflicts between competing ethnical and religious groups. The combination of these factors suggests that although formally independent, many developing countries continue to experience problems in the above mentioned areas due to persistence and importance of negative repercussions of the colonialism process.

Colonialism, Inequality, and Long-Run Paths of Development

Issue Date January 2005
Over the last few years, colonialism, especially as pursued by Europeans, has enjoyed a revival in interest among both scholars and the general public. Although a number of new accounts cast colonial empires in a more favorable light than has generally been customary, others contend that colonial powers often leveraged their imbalance in power to impose institutional arrangements on the colonies that were adverse to long-term development. We argue here, however, that one of the most fundamental impacts of European colonization may have been in altering the composition of the populations in the areas colonized. The efforts of the Europeans often involved implanting ongoing communities who were greatly advantaged over natives in terms of human capital and legal status. Because the paths of institutional development were sensitive to the incidence of extreme inequality which resulted, their activity had long lingering effects. More study is needed to identify all of the mechanisms at work, but the evidence from the colonies in the Americas suggests that it was those that began with extreme inequality and population heterogeneity that came to exhibit persistence over time in evolving institutions that restricted access to economic opportunities and generated lower rates of public investment in schools and other infrastructure considered conducive to growth. These patterns may help to explain why a great many societies with legacies as colonies with extreme inequality have suffered from poor development experiences.

British Colonial Legacies and Political Development

1. Introduction
Over the past few years, numerous studies have investigated the potential impact of colonialism on long-term developmental trajectories (Brown, 2000; Grier, 1999; Kohli, 1994; Lange, 2003; Mahoney, 2003; Sokoloff & Engerman, 2000; Young, 1994 ). While most works analyze the long-term effects of colonialism on economic development, several others consider democratization, health, and education. Regardless of the outcome variable, however, nearly all of these scholars recognize that the colonial state was the primary extension of foreign domination and investigate how its form and persistence over time have shaped future development.
Two of the most influential works are crossnational, statistical analyses by Acemoglu et al., 2001, Acemoglu et al., 2002. Together, the papers provide evidence that colonialism transformed the developmental trajectories of nearly all regions of the world and that these reversals were colonial state legacies. They divide colonialism into two broad categories––settlement and extractive. Settlement colonies were created in areas with relatively benign disease environments yet without large indigenous populations. According to the authors, because settlers both demanded and helped to construct institutions that protected property rights, settlement colonies had relatively effective legal systems, institutions that persisted and thereby benefited postcolonial development. Alternatively, where large-scale European settlement did not occur, colonial state officials were not constrained by European settlers, focused simply on expropriating wealth from the colonized, and therefore failed to provide the same legal protection of property as in settlement colonies.
While providing evidence that colonialism shaped state institutions and thereby developmental trajectories, the intricacies of the authors' argument are somewhat underdeveloped. First, only a small proportion of the world's colonies experienced large-scale European settlement, and the present state institutions of former colonies with low levels of European settlement are characterized by great diversity. Other factors beside institutional transfer via settlement or extraction therefore appear to have affected state institutional quality. Second, although economic development requires the protection of property rights, state institutions are multifaceted and influence economic as well as more broad-based human development in several ways. A state-centered analysis of colonial legacies must therefore have a broader view of the state.
Recognizing these two critiques, this paper works within the general framework of Acemoglu et al., accepting their findings that the form of colonialism was shaped by the disease environment and precolonial population––among other things––yet drawing on the works of qualitative researchers to explore more elaborate explanations for the link between colonialism and development. Specifically, it tests whether the extent to which former colonies were ruled through either direct or indirect colonial institutions had long-term effects on postcolonial state governance among colonies with low levels of European settlement. To do so, the paper reviews qualitative works discussing the impact of direct and indirect colonial rule on political development and provides a statistical test through the analysis of 33 former British colonies whose populations at the end of colonialism were overwhelmingly non-European in origin. For the latter, it constructs an index measuring the extent to which British colonies were ruled through indirect––as opposed to direct––legal-administrative institutions and uses statistical methods to measure whether relationships exist between the indirect rule variable and numerous indicators of postcolonial state governance: political stability, bureaucratic effectiveness, state regulatory burden, rule of law, lack of government corruption, and democratization.
The paper finds that there is a negative and robust relationship between the extent of indirect rule and political stability, bureaucratic effectiveness, lack of state regulatory burden, rule of law, and lack of government corruption even controlling for other factors. The relationship between the form of colonialism and postcolonial democratization, however, is less robust, although still negative and marginally significant. Thus, while recognizing that the paper's findings are limited to former British colonies and that more research is needed for broader conclusions, it provides evidence that the qualitative works on indirect/direct colonial rule are generalizable and might provide new yet complementary insight into the findings of Acemoglu et al.
2. Variation in British colonialism: direct vs. indirect rule
Qualitative scholars who analyze colonial state legacies emphasize both positive and negative effects on development and suggest that direct rule promoted the former while indirect rule promoted the latter. Boone (1994), Mamdani (1996), Migdal (1988), and Reno (1995), for instance, describe how indirect rule in Africa impeded political development through institutional legacies. These works focus on how the institutional legacies of indirect rule left ineffective central administrations, empowered local chiefs, and thereby created a system of decentralized despotism that has left the state both ineffective and near collapse. Alternatively, Amsden (1985), Huff (1994), Kohli (1994), Lange (2003), and Wade (1990) suggest that direct and bureaucratic colonial rule left legacies that made possible effective states and thereby state-led development. They focus on the state's ability to provide a variety of public goods that enhance economic production (education, health care, sanitation, roads, law and order) and to steer the national economy.
Direct and indirect forms of rule are often defined based on who runs what positions within the colonial state. Doyle (1986) claims that direct rule occurs when only the lowest levels of the colonial administration are run by locals while the remaining positions are run by colonial officials. He writes that indirect rule, on the other hand, occurs when “the governance of extensive districts of the colony is entrusted to members of the native elite under the supervision of the imperial governors” (p. 38). Fisher (1991) disagrees, describing indirect rule as the incorporation of indigenous institutions––not simply individuals––into an overall structure of colonial domination. From this view, direct rule differs from indirect rule in that it involves the construction of a complete system of colonial domination that lacks any relatively autonomous indigenous component yet which might be staffed overwhelmingly by indigenous actors (pp. 6–7). Similar to the latter, this project uses “direct” and “indirect rule” as concepts describing different structures of domination, not terms used to designate who runs the state. It suggests that the state in directly ruled colonies approximated what Migdal (1994) calls “integrated domination”––or centralized state control of an entire territory––while its counterpart in indirectly ruled colonies was closer to “dispersed domination”––or a fragmented state unable to achieve countrywide domination over local power-holders (p. 9).
Direct rule provided an administrative structure based on formal rules, as opposed to individual decisions, and had a centralized legal-administrative structure with a formal chain of command that linked the diverse state actors throughout the colony to the central colonial administration and thereby back to governments in Europe or Japan. This centralized and rule-based organization was possible because state actors were employees whose positions could not be owned, were based on merit (and usually race), and were the only means of income for the office holders. Besides the organization of the colonial administration, the regulation of society was also guided by rules. Large police forces and courts based on European law were constructed in directly ruled colonies, 1 and both collaborated with one another in order to create a broad and centralized legal framework regulating societal and state–society relations.
The legal-administrative institutions of indirectly ruled colonies differed considerably from those of directly ruled colonies. Indirect rule was based on a tripartite chain of patron–client relations linking the colonial administration to the population via chiefs. According to Lugard (1922), the acclaimed theoretician and practitioner or indirect rule,
The essential feature of the system… is that the native chiefs are constituted as an integral part of the machinery of the administration. There are not two sets of rulers––the British and the native––working either separately or in co-operation, but a single Government in which the native chiefs have well-defined duties and an acknowledged status equally with British officers. Their duties should never conflict, and should overlap as little as possible. They should be complementary to each other, and the chief himself must understand that he has no right to place and power unless he renders his proper services to the State (p. 203).
Despite such doctrinaire claims of unification and complementarity, Mamdani (1996) recognizes that the reality of indirect rule was usually quite different. In particular, he finds that indirect rule created a “bifurcated state” in which two separate and incompatible forms of rule existed––one dominated by the colonial administration, the other by numerous chiefs.
While the members of the colonial administration were generally recruited and employed along bureaucratic lines, the position held by chiefs was based primarily on patrimonialism. Chiefs were selected to rule according to their lineage and––most importantly––their willingness to collaborate with colonial officials. Moreover, although often receiving a salary, chiefs earned most of their livelihood through the control of land and direct extraction from their subjects. The chiefs were given executive, legislative, and judicial powers to regulate social relations in their chiefdoms, vast authority which was supposed to be grounded in preexisting tradition or custom, not bureaucratic rules. Thus, indirect rule often took the form of numerous patrimonial kingdoms linked together only weakly by a foreign administration.
Much of the qualitative work on colonial state legacies focuses on three aspects of indirect rule that, in combination, promoted local despotism at the expense of centralized control. First, the central legal-administrative institution was miniscule, concentrated almost exclusively in the colonial capital, and had very little interaction with the colonial population, characteristics which endowed it with very little infrastructural power (Mann, 1984 ). As a result, the colonial state in indirectly ruled colonies lacked the capabilities to implement policy outside of the capital city and often had no option for pursuing policy other than coercion.
Next, indirect rule endowed chiefs with great institutional powers (Boone, 1994; Chanock, 1985; Mamdani, 1996; Merry, 1991; Migdal, 1988; Roberts & Mann, 1991 ). Chiefs were given control of `customary law' and, because it lacked formalization, were able to mold and wield it for personal benefit. Customary law also endowed chiefs with control over communal lands and chiefdom police, both of which could be coercively employed to dominate local inhabitants. Although most work focuses on the judiciary, chiefs also had executive and legislative powers, which further concentrated power in their hands.
Finally, the institutional powers of chiefs were augmented by their intermediary positions, which enabled them to control information and resource flows between the colonial administration and the local population and avoid colonial supervision (Clapham, 1982; Reno, 1995; Scott, 1972 ). Consequently, chiefs were able to play administrators and local subjects off against one another in order to maintain considerable autonomy from each. In addition, their intermediary position allowed chiefs to be rent-seekers extraordinaire whenever exchanges between the administration and local population occurred. Thus, when independence reforms failed to weaken chiefs, this system of “decentralized despotism” provided an effective impediment to state governance and broad-based development (Mamdani, 1996 ).
While the British––and particularly, Lord Lugard––have been credited with inventing indirect rule, the French, Portuguese, and Belgians all used indirect forms of rule (Bayart, 1993; Boone, 1992, Boone, 1994; Cruise O'Brien, 1975; Mamdani, 1996; Robinson, 1972 ). British colonialism was exceptional in at least one aspect, however––mainly the size and diversity of the British Empire, which caused Great Britain to rely much more extensively on both direct and indirect modes of domination than any other colonial power. For example, colonial Uganda and Nigeria were extreme cases of indirect rule, Kenya and Fiji had larger colonial legal-administrative orders yet were still heavily dependent on chiefs, and Singapore and Jamaica lacked chiefs completely. The British Empire therefore provides an opportunity to analyze the different institutional legacies of direct and indirect rule while controlling for the colonial power, the latter of which appears necessary given the numerous statistical analysis that find a positive and significant relationship between British colonialism and various development indicators (Bollen & Jackman, 1985; Brown, 2000; Grier, 1999; La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Schleifer, & Vishny, 1999 ).
Within the British Empire, direct or indirect colonialism was not a random event but instead was shaped by numerous factors, including those that Acemoglu et al. show are related to present state institutional quality. First, the form of rule was shaped by the presence or absence of large numbers of European settlers, with large-scale settlement colonies having very direct forms of rule and nonsettlement colonies having more indirect forms of rule. Second, strategic geopolitical importance affected the willingness of colonial powers to invest in direct forms of rule. In addition, since the extensiveness of the colonial administration depended on its ability to raise local resources and because settlers chose to migrate to lands with economic opportunities, the form of rule was shaped by the economic potential of the colony. Fourth, the extensiveness of colonial rule also depended on the disease environment of the colonies. Since much of Africa was a “white man's grave,” for example, neither settlement nor the use of numerous European officials was feasible even if great economic potential existed. Finally, the presence of local populations shaped the form of rule in two primary ways. First, large local populations limited settlement by obstructing access to land and greatly increasing the costs and risks of large-scale settlement. Second, as the Indian Mutiny of 1857 showed, indigenous peoples were more likely to revolt against invasive forms of colonialism and were therefore most effectively ruled through more “customary” and indirect forms of rule (Porter, 1996, pp. 29–48 ).
3. Statistical analysis
The paper uses statistical methods to test whether the direct or indirect form of British colonialism is related to postcolonial indicators of state governance. The cases used for the statistical analysis are limited to the 33 former British colonies 2 that (a) did not experience large-scale European settlement, (b) had over 100,000 inhabitants at independence, (c) did not merge with non-British colonies after independence, and (d) experienced more than 30 years of formal colonial rule. Although decreasing valuable degrees of freedom, such case restrictions are employed in an attempt to make the sample more homogeneous and thereby increase insight gained from cross-case comparison. 3
The first restriction is used in order to focus on colonies without large-scale European settlement and the variation of rule within this subset of colonialism. In particular, it is employed in order to investigate the determinants of different levels of state effectiveness among former colonies with only low levels of settlement. 4 Such a restriction is necessary because colonies with large-scale settlement were not comprised of subordinate populations; they were closer to extensions of Great Britain than to colonies of foreign peoples. As a result, settlers were not prone to the same levels of exclusion and exploitation as other colonial peoples and therefore experienced distinct forms of colonial domination. Second, small colonies such St. Kitts and Nevis and Gibraltar are excluded because they are micro-states that are analytically distinct from other national states in terms of size and population. Next, Somaliland and British Cameroon are excluded because they merged with non-British colonies at independence and therefore experienced hybrid colonial legacies. Finally, Britain's colonies in the Middle East are excluded from the analysis because they only experienced formal colonial rule for a relatively brief period of time.
Using this set of 33 former British colonies, the extent of indirect colonial rule is operationalized by dividing the number of colonially recognized customary court cases by the total number of court cases in 1955, 5 the latter of which includes both customary cases heard by chiefs and magistrate court cases presided over by colonial officials (see the Appendix). As such, it ranges from zero to 100 and measures the extent to which British colonial rule depended on customary legal institutions for the regulation of social relations. The variable also captures the size of the legal-administrative apparatus. Indirectly ruled colonies, for example, had significantly fewer police officers per capita: The correlation between the customary court variable and per capita police officers in 1955 is −0.82. The customary law variable therefore provides a direct measurement of the level of colonial dependence on customary courts and an indirect measurement of the lack of legal-administrative personnel under centralized administrative control. The data on British colonial legal systems were collected from the 1955 annual Colonial Report, Annual Judicial Report, and other colonial documents available at the Public Records Office in the United Kingdom.
Compatible data for the extent of indirect rule are not available for Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan, all of which were ruled as one colony through the Indian Civil Service until the 1930s and 1940s. 6 During British colonialism, approximately two-fifths of these territories were ruled indirectly through some 600 princely states, suggesting an indirect rule score somewhere around 20% or 30%. 7 Other factors suggest a higher score, however. As mentioned above, police officers per capita is highly correlated with the extent of indirect rule. In 1938, the four former South Asian colonies had 0.4 police officers per 1,000 people, a ratio that is less than all other former British colonies except Nigeria (0.3 per 1,000) (Griffiths, 1971, p. 422 ). 8 As such, the simple use of police officers per capita suggests a score of approximately 90%. Similarly, qualitative works describe how the minimal colonial state created local conditions in both the directly and indirectly ruled areas of colonial India that were quite similar to those in indirectly ruled Africa. 9 Noting these factors, this analysis scores the extent of indirect rule in between the two extremes at 60%.
The seven dependent variables are proxies for various types of political development, six of which are compiled by the World Bank for 1997–98, the other by Freedom House during 1972–2000. The World Bank indicators range from −2.5 to 2.5 and include variables for (i) state effectiveness, which measures the quality of the public service provision and the bureaucracy; (ii) state stability, which measures perceptions of the likelihood that the government in power will be destabilized or overthrown; (iii) lack of state corruption, which measures the extent to which public power is exercised for public gain; (iv) lack of regulatory burden, which measures freedom from excessive regulation; and (v) rule of law, which measures the incidence of crime, the effectiveness and predictability of the judiciary, and the enforceability of contracts (see Kaufmann, Kraay, & Zoido-Lobaton, 1999 ). In addition to testing these different state governance variables independently, the analysis also combines them in order to make an aggregate variable of state governance. Notably, because the World Bank data are only available for 1997–98, the state governance variables are limited to a single point in time.
The democracy variable combines the Freedom House indices of political rights and liberties, inverts the scores, and averages them between different time periods. As such, the democracy measurement is continuous and ranges from one (least democratic) to thirteen (most democratic). In order to see if the relationship between average level of democratization and the extent of indirect rule change over time, level of democratization is averaged over four different time periods: 1972–2000, 1972–82, 1982–92, 1992–2000. Unlike the World Bank indicators, the Freedom House scores therefore allow the analysis of one aspect of state governance at different times and over extended periods.
Five control variables are used for this paper's multivariate analysis. The first two attempt to control for the primary factors that Acemoglu et al., 2001, Acemoglu et al., 2002 find are related to state protection of property rights and postcolonial economic development: disease environment and indigenous population density at the onset of colonization. Because Acemoglu et al. (2002) find that indigenous population density at the onset of colonialism affected the quality of both colonial and postcolonial state institutions, the models include a control variable for population density at the beginning of colonial rule. The measurements of disease environment used by Acemoglu et al., however, are missing for several of the cases analyzed in this paper. 10 In its place, the models include a variable that measures the percentage of the total colonial population that was comprised of European residents in 1955. Although radically different from the disease environment variable, the substitution appears appropriate since European settlement is the intervening variable through which Acemoglu et al. hypothesize that the disease environment––as well as indigenous population density––affected colonial and thereby postcolonial state institutional quality (see the Appendix for the data).
While this study is primarily concerned with the settlement and precolonial population density controls, the models also control for three variables that potentially influenced state institutional quality among former British colonies. Because recent statistical analyses of economic and political development find a strong African regional effect (see Englebert, 2000 ), and because Herbst (2000) suggests that regional characteristics hinder state building in sub-Saharan Africa, an African control variable is employed (1=African, 0=non-African). The analysis also includes a control for the extent of ethnic fractionalization, which other analyses find is significantly related to and both economic performance and the quality of government (Easterly & Levine, 1997; La Porta et al., 1999 ). The variable is operationalized as the probability that two randomly selected co-nationals in 1960 spoke different languages, and the data come from La Porta et al. (1999). Finally, the paper uses a binomial variable to control for whether or not the socioeconomic system was dominated by plantations, a factor that often created ethnically based social hierarchies characterized by extreme inequality and economic systems with very low levels of diversification. To be categorized as a plantation colony, plantations must have been major social institutions that affected the daily lives of most individuals and shaped the overall economic, political, and social institutions of the colony. As such, the Solomon Islands and Malaysia are not categorized as having plantation institutions because, although present, the plantations were not anywhere close to as dominant as they were in Jamaica, Barbados, or Mauritius. Data on the presence and extent of plantations are from Beckford (1983).
Diagnostic exams have been performed to check for outliers and nonlinear relationships between the independent/control variables and the dependent variables. The European settler variable has curvilinear relationships with other variables so its logged value is used for the analysis. In all other cases, the data are consistent with the assumptions of linear multivariate analysis. Checks on collinearity uncovered modest relationships among independent variables, but nothing considered high enough to obscure the relationships. 11
Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 show the results of the multivariate models using the six World Bank governance indicators as dependent variables. For these tables and all subsequent tables, model 1 includes only the indirect rule variable, model 2 includes only the five control variables, model 3 includes the indirect rule as well as the five control variables, and model 4 uses the same variables as model 3 but excludes the four South Asian cases from the analysis. The last model is used to investigate whether the four South Asian cases with proxy scores for the extent of indirect rule conform to the remaining cases.

Considering model 1 in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, the extent of indirect rule is strongly and negatively related to all six governance indicators. As shown by the adjusted R -square values, the variable on average accounts for 40% of the variation of the six governance indicators. Model 2 in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 shows that the five control variables account for considerably less variation than the extent of indirect rule, having an adjusted R -square value that is only 0.16 on average. Moreover, while the extent of indirect rule is highly significant in model 1, few of the controls have any significance in model 2. The main exception is the logged measurement of European settlers, which is positively related to all six governance indicators and has at least a moderately significant relationship with five of the six dependent variables (lack of government corruption being the exception). Model 2 therefore supports the findings of Acemoglu et al., 2001, Acemoglu et al., 2002.
With the complete model in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, however, the European settler population variable loses its significance in all cases, and its coefficients are reduced considerably. Alternatively, the extent of indirect rule continues to be negatively and very strongly related to the governance indicators. The size of the variable's coefficients is also large. For example, the coefficient of the indirect rule variable in the model for aggregate state governance suggests that a rise in the extent of indirect rule from 0 to 50 is associated with a 0.9 increase in the governance score, a gap roughly equivalent to that separating Belgium (0.793) from the Dominican Republic (−0.113).
Comparison of models 3 and 4 within Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 shows that the general relationships continue when the four South Asian colonies with proxies for the extent of indirect rule are excluded, suggesting that the proxies generally conform to the overall analysis. In all six of the fourth models, the indirect rule variable coefficients are negative, and the overall predictive power of the models remain similar to those in the third models. The exclusion of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, and Pakistan, however, causes the coefficients of the indirect rule variable to decrease in three models––bureaucratic effectiveness, state regulatory burden, and government corruption––and therefore to lose their significance. This appears to be due to fewer degrees of freedom as well as greater collinearity with the African control variable, whose coefficients in model 4 increase at the expense of the extent of indirect rule. 12 Even with relatively high collinearity, however, the extent of indirect rule continues to have very robust relationships with the aggregate measurement of state governance as well as the indicators of state stability and rule of law.
While the above analysis shows that the extent of indirect colonial rule in 1955 is strongly and negatively related to the World Bank governance indicators in 1997–98, Table 4, Table 5 test its relationship with average levels of democratization from 1972–2000, 1972–82, 1982–92, and 1992–2000. Similar to the models with the World Bank governance indicators, the first model in Table 4, Table 5 shows that the extent of indirect rule is negatively and strongly related to the average level of democracy during all periods, although its strength decreases considerably during the 1992–2000 period. This decrease appears to have been caused by a wave of democratization within British Africa during the 1990s that did not conform to past forms of colonial rule: The bivariate correlation between the average level of democracy and the extent of indirect rule among the 14 former British colonies in sub-Saharan Africa decreased from −0.60 for the 1982–92 period to only −0.24 during the period 1992–2000.

The second model in Table 4, Table 5 includes only the control variables. Compared to the World Bank governance indicators, the control variables account for much more variation, with an adjusted R -square value of 0.44 for the overall 1972–2000 period. Of the control variables, the plantation variable is the only one that is strongly related to level of democracy. This positive relationship is somewhat surprising given the well-established literature stressing that plantation systems left legacies that negatively affected development (Beckford, 1983; Ferleger, 1985; Mandle, 1974 ). Notably, the positive relationship between plantation systems and postcolonial democratization is the opposite direction of the relationship between the presence of plantations and the World Bank governance indicators, although the extent of indirect rule is significantly related to only one of the World Bank indicators (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 ). It therefore appears that the class and ethnic dynamics caused by plantations might have promoted representative government by sparking lower class mobilization but that this mobilization might, in turn, have limited other aspects of state governance that depend on corporate state action. In addition, the absence of militaries in former plantation colonies likely promoted representative government.
The variable measuring the extent of indirect rule in model 3 of Table 4, Table 5 is negatively related to average level of democracy during all periods and at least marginally significant in three of the four periods: As with model 1, the extent of indirect rule is strongly and negatively related to average level of democratization during the entire 28-year period, the 1970s, and the 1980s but less so during the 1990s. The democracy models differ from those with the World Bank governance indicators in that the addition of the colonial rule variable has a more modest impact on the adjusted R -squared. The weaker relationship appears to be due primarily to several former colonies in Asia––Brunei, Malaysia, and Singapore in particular––with low levels of indirect colonial rule yet low levels of postcolonial democratization. As directly ruled nonplantation colonies, these cases also help to explain the positive relationship between plantations and democracy.
Model 4 of Table 4, Table 5 shows that the exclusion of the four South Asian colonies does not dramatically transform the relationships in model 2. Yet, similar to Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, the exclusion changes the coefficients of several of the control variables, especially the African control, causing the indirect rule variable to become insignificant even at the 0.10 level during all periods.
4. Conclusion and discussion
This paper investigates whether British colonialism left state institutions that have reinforced long-term trajectories of political development. To do so, it measures the extent to which colonies were ruled via indirect institutions for a set of 33 former British colonies and finds that indirect rule has a strong, negative relationship with postcolonial levels of political development. These relationships are strongest and most consistent with the variables measuring aggregate state governance, state stability, and rule of law and weakest and least consistent with average level of democratization, especially during the 1990s. The findings provide evidence that British colonialism left positive political legacies in some colonies but not others and that this legacy depended on the extent to which colonial rule was either direct or indirect.
While supporting the basic findings of Acemoglu et al., 2001, Acemoglu et al., 2002, this analysis provides evidence that the authors place too much emphasis on the impact of settlers and too little on the actual form of colonial rule, the latter of which affected numerous aspects of state governance. Yet, the findings of Acemoglu et al. must not be disregarded, as institutional transfer via settlement was undoubtedly a vital factor in the developmental success of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Moreover, the disease environment and the presence of precolonial populations not only influenced European settlement, as Acemoglu et al. point out, but also directly affected the extent of indirect rule and thereby indirectly shaped postcolonial state governance among nonsettler colonies as well. As such, this paper's analysis provides a bridge between large crossnational analyses which find that the form of colonialism depended on precolonial characteristics and qualitative case studies that have long emphasized the divergent effects of direct and indirect rule on political development.
Since the analysis is limited to former British colonies that did not experience large-scale European settlement, were not micro-colonies, and were colonized for more than three decades, further investigation is necessary if one attempts to generalize outside of the cases analyzed here. Previous work, however, suggests that the findings do help to provide general inference into other cases. Mamdani (1996), for example, notes that all of Africa was ruled through indirect colonial rule and that these legacies hindered postcolonial political development regardless of colonial power. Some disagree, however, suggesting that French colonialism, in particular, was more direct than British colonialism in Africa since chiefs were not cloaked in tradition and had a more formal character (Fisher, 1991 ). This is generally correct, yet formalization still placed chiefs in an intermediary position and gave them extreme power over local affairs while leaving the central administration incapacitated. Bayart (1993) finds that predatory and patrimonial states are present in postcolonial French Africa and are the legacies of colonialism, which organized state power relations in the form of a “rhizome,” not a central root system as direct rule was supposed to do. Moreover, Firmin-Sellers (2000) analyzes two neighboring regions––one in C o te D'Ivoire, the other in Ghana––and finds that the chiefs in the former French colony had greater control over land and fewer checks on their powers than those in the former British colony despite similar precolonial political institutions. Thus, although French colonies appear to have been ruled more directly, French colonialism had similar effects on state governance by creating a dispersed and despotic form of rule.
Spanish colonialism appears at first to oppose the basic findings of this paper in that those regions which were most intensively colonized––Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico––have generally had much lower levels of postcolonial development over the past 150 years than the former colonial backwaters––Chile, Costa Rica, and Argentina. Yet, intense Spanish colonialism created more dispersed forms of domination: In the areas with high levels of colonial influence, rule depended on extremely powerful local intermediaries of European origin. As Mahoney (2003) recognizes, these elites obstructed state and economic reforms, thereby leaving the backwaters, which lacked decentralized rule through Spanish elites, relatively advantaged.
As both the French and Spanish cases demonstrate, a simple analysis of indirect and direct rule is quite complicated, as many forms of colonial domination existed not only among the colonial powers but within each colonial empire as well. Together with the British colonies analyzed in this paper, however, they point to a simple generalization: Dispersed forms of domination hinder state governance when they create extremely powerful local intermediaries and limit state infrastructural power. This, in turn, not only limits the state's ability to act corporately to provide basic public goods but also impedes its ability to regulate social relations through law, thereby placing extreme constraints on the mere possibility of state governance and broad-based development. Such a generalization is not specific to colonialism or even the modern era. Tilly (1992), for example, recognizes that indirect rule has long been a form of domination over peripheral areas and describes how it was an obstacle that had to be overcome for the construction of bureaucratic national states in early modern Europe (pp. 103–117). With their construction, in turn, Europe was able to rapidly surpass China and India as the most developed region in the world and to colonize the latter.

Most data come from the Annual Colonial Reports and/or the various judicial reports located at the Public Records Office, UK (British Colonial Office, 1947, British Colonial Office, 1951, British Colonial Office., 1953, British Colonial Office, 1955, British Colonial Office, 1958; Colony of Fiji, 1955; Colony of Kenya, 1952; Colony of Nigeria, 1953; Colony of Northern Rhodesia, 1955; Colony of Sierra Leone, 1955; Colony of Southern Rhodesia, 1955; Colony of Sudan, 1949; Colony of Uganda, 1955 ). Data for several cases were not available in 1955, so data from other years are used for the statistics (Botswana 1957, Ghana 1953, Kenya 1951, Nigeria 1949, Sudan 1949). Data for Uganda were only available for three of the four districts, and an estimate based on the population sizes of the four districts as well as the customary court cases of the three districts with available data is therefore used.
b
Data are from British Colonial Office, 1947, British Colonial Office, 1951, British Colonial Office., 1953, British Colonial Office, 1955, British Colonial Office, 1958 and Kuczynski, 1939, Kuczynski, 1948, Kuczynski, 1949, Kuczynski, 1953.
c
Data for this variable are estimated from McEvedy and Jones (1978), Kuczynski, 1939, Kuczynski, 1948, Kuczynski, 1949, Kuczynski, 1953, British Colonial Office, 1947, British Colonial Office, 1951, British Colonial Office., 1953, British Colonial Office, 1955, British Colonial Office, 1958 and Roberts, Ngai Ling, and Bradshaw (1992). The indigenous population on most former British colonies in the Caribbean was completely or nearly wiped out by the time permanent colonial rule––usually Spanish––was first established. For example, the last of the Lucayans died in the Bahamas in 1520. More significant indigenous populations existed on Jamaica and Trinidad, but these too disappeared rapidly once contact with the Europeans was made (Cambell, 1988; Hurwitz & Hurwitz, 1971; Newson, 1976 ). Recognizing the quick demise of the indigenous population, this project uses the lower estimates of the population at the time of colonialism, as these figures appear to be a more accurate estimate of the indigenous population encountered by Europeans at the onset of formal colonialism.
d
The indirect rule variable for Malaysia combines the court cases of Malaya, Sarawak, and North Borneo. Because the number of court cases in Malaya was much higher than normal due to the ungoing civil war in 1955, data from 1947 are used instead.
e
The indirect rule statistic of Tanzania combines the court cases of Tanganyika and Zanzibar.

The colonies include the modern states of the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Brunei, Cyprus, Fiji, the Gambia, Ghana, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia (which combined the three British colonies Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak), Mauritius, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania (which combine the two British colonies Tanganyika and Zanzibar), Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

The limited number of cases undoubtedly compounds difficulties associated with statistical methods. Yet, in social science analysis, a sample size near 30 is often considered sufficient for the assumptions of the central limit theorem to hold true (Hays, 1994, p. 252 ).

This paper views Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States as having high levels of European settlement. South Africa, with approximately one-quarter of its population of European descent, is categorized as having mid-levels of European settlement and is therefore also excluded from the analysis. Alternatively, the remaining former British colonies, all of which had European populations at or below 11% of the total population during the late colonial period, are categorized as having low levels of European settlement.

The year 1955 is used because data for most colonies are not available earlier and because several colonies gained independence shortly thereafter.

Myanmar was given its own legal-administrative institutions in 1938, some 10 years before its independence. Alternatively, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan were ruled through the same central administration until the independence period, with Bangladesh and Pakistan breaking from India in the late 1940s and Bangladesh eventually splitting from Pakistan in the early 1970s.

Similar to British Africa, the problems of indirect rule affected state administrative and regulative capacities as well as state integration. Kulkarni (1964), for example, describes the princely states as a “wilderness of oppression and misrule” (p. 154). “By guaranteeing protection to its feudatories from internal rebellion and external attack, British paramountcy made it impossible for the ninety-three million people of the states to launch any such struggle for emancipating themselves from capricious and oppressive rule” (p. 153).

The 1938 total includes the police forces of present day Bangladesh, Indian, Myanmar, and Pakistan. Specific data are not available for the individual regions during the late colonial period. Alternative data for Myanmar in 1898 and Bangladesh in 1953 are slightly higher than the aggregate figure in 1938 (0.8 per 1,000 for both) (Doha, 1957, p. 5; Griffiths, 1971, p. 202 ).

In directly ruled areas of colonial India, officials employed village headmen for a number of activities: He was “a policeman while conveying reports of crimes, a judicial officer while disposing of petty cases, a revenue officer while assisting Government officers in making collections, and an administrative officer while discharging general administrative duties” (Gopal, 1963, p. 144 ). The concentration of these duties, in turn, made possible unbridled power and the hyper-exploitation of the peasants (Gopal, 1963; Kumar, 1989 ). Since colonial revenue was largely dependent on land taxes, colonial rule also transformed social relations by giving some individuals greater control of local lands (Edwardes, 1967, pp. 75–79; Kumar, 1989 ). In many directly ruled areas in colonial India, tax farmers and revenue collectors known as zamindars were given rights to large tracts of land and were thereby “made masters of village communities” who were “mere parasites, who fattened on the products of the cultivators” (Kumar, 1989, p. 35 ). Such local despotism appears to have had its legacies: Areas in which land rights were given to landlords during the colonial period have had much lower agricultural production and investment in public goods during the postcolonial period (Banerjee & Iyer, 2002 ). Thus, even in the more directly ruled areas, the tiny administration in colonial India appears to have created alternative forms of decentralized despotism at the local level that have hindered development.

The data are only available for 19 of the former British colonies analyzed in this paper. The bivariate relationship between the extent of indirect rule and the logged value of the European mortality rate is 0.60, suggesting that European mortality rate was an important factor that influenced the extent of indirect or direct colonial domination among British colonies. Ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis using all of the independent variables described below finds that the European mortality rate during the early colonial period does not have a strong effect on present indicators of state governance. The extent of indirect rule, on the other hand, does, suggesting that the extent of indirect rule is an intervening variable linking disease environment to present levels of political development.
11
The extent of indirect rule and ethnic fractionalization have the strongest relationship: r =0.62.
12
The Spearman correlation between the extent of indirect rule and the African control variable rises from 0.55 to 0.73 with the exclusion of the four South Asian cases. Without the South Asian colonies, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Malaysia are the only former British colonies outside of Africa with some level of indirect rule. Alternatively, Mauritius is the only former British colony in the sub-Saharan African region that was ruled directly.

The Effects of Colonization: How it Happened and How it Still Continues
Colonization is often considered as a concept or action of the far distant past that has little to do with the modern world today. However, this could not be further from the truth. Colonization, more specifically European colonization, has had and still has a great deal of impact on nations, more specifically those of the global south, even though quite a bit of time has passed since Columbus set sails. Because of the still lingering effects of colonization, nations have had to undergo domestic and international challenges to overcome the power relationships with former colonizers.
Before examining the remaining impacts of colonization in the current nation-state system, it is important to understand how colonization initially affected the nations of the global south. Europeans began colonizing these nations to obtain resources that directly boosted their own economies at the extent of the indigenous peoples. Colonialism proved to be very cruel towards the indigenous peoples, bringing about slavery, brutality, and death (Campbell, MacKinnon, & Stevens, 2010, p. 36). There is no mistaking that colonialism was unfavorable to the nations affected and severely limited any room for economic or culture growth. Campbell et al. (2010) further expands on the direct confrontations of colonialism by stating, “[T]he impacts of colonialism were similar, regardless of the specific colonizer: disease; destruction of indigenous social, political, and economic structures; repression; exploitation; land displacement; and land degradation” (p. 37). Needless to say, the atrocious effects of colonization on the colonized nations would not have been easily wiped clean even after the colonizer left or stepped out of the boundary lines of the nation. Colonialism has had lasting domestic and international consequences.
Once the nation gained independence it was then required to knit itself back together with a limited amount of string, so to speak, because of the state in which the colonizer left it. Colonialism, in addition to creating unstable “artificial states,” normally led to the nation’s entire infrastructure — roads, rail lines, and lines of communication — to be dedicated to the extraction of resources from the nation into the hands of the colonizer which then limited the formerly colonized nation’s ability to stabilize their own economy and feed their own population (Campbell, et al., 2010, p. 37). In addition to the direct physical effects of colonialism on the independent nations, there was a great deal of domestic political conflict that arose with the independence. During the stages of colonization, the native people of the nation had little to no influence on the way their own country was ran. The outcome of this was that the people of the newly independent nation had very inadequate knowledge on how to keep the nation-state going (Campbell et al, 2010, p. 37). This, of course, would be unfortunate for the struggling nations.
Even after the nation became independent, colonization still affected the nation’s correspondence and position with and within the international world. Ultimately, colonialism left the independent nation unprepared to function in the modern global nation-state system and vulnerable to outside influence and pressure. This in part can be attributed to neo-colonialism. According to Campbell et al. (2010), “Neo-colonialism refers to the involvement of more powerful states in the domestic affairs of less powerful ones” (p. 38). In the article “The Neo-Colonization of Central America” (2016), Jeff Abbott argues that neo-colonialism is in itself another form of colonization (p. 41). This concept suggests that the effects of colonization is still very present but just in a different way. To explain, as insinuated by Abbott (2016), “the force of neo-colonization is strengthened by free-trade agreements and development plans that guarantee a company’s right to investment above the rights of the citizenry. Meanwhile, the indigenous populations face renewed dispossession and eviction to make way for global capital’s conquest (p. 41). What this means is that the nation state is still abused because of outside meddling disguised as international policy.
To understand the effects of colonization on the real world, it is important to look at cases in which colonization deeply affected and still affect the development and growth of particular nations. The consequences of colonialism can be seen in the nations of now Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cuba. With both nations, colonialism has played and still plays an important contributor to how they function domestically and internationally.
Colonization of Congo by the hands of the Belgians has greatly characterized how they currently exist in the current global nation-state system. The people of Congo suffered immensely under the Belgians at the extent of the rubber trade in the late 19th century. For example, Congolese were expected to yield a certain amount of rubber a day and were severely punished or killed if the number wasn’t met, famine was an issue because the people no longer had time to grow crops or good land to do so, and death rates were high (Watson Institute for International Studies, 2005, p. 14). The atrocities that occurred in the DRC did not happen under every colonization to this extent, but it nonetheless is significant to the narrative of the Congo under colonization. In 1959, Congo was granted a hastily independence that did not prepare the nation for self-rule (Watson Institute for International Studies, 2005, p. 36). This, in turn, caused the DRC to struggle to initiate a stable domestic policy. This is proven by the Watson Institute (2005) when they state, “Because of Belgium’s refusal to allow Africans in government posts, Africans had little sense of the Congo as a unified, political entity. Most Africans thought of themselves as members of their ethnic group, not of the country of Congo” (p. 36). The chaos and disruption that ensued led to civil wars and political corruption that then brought in the engagement of the United States and the UN. The Congo, despite the attempt at a new image with the new name of the Democratic Republic of Congo, serves as example of the lasting effects of colonization on a nation.
Additionally, Cuba serves as an example of a nation living with the effects of colonization. In this case, the initial colonization by Spain and then the subsequent neo-colonization by the United States. Cuba was colonized by Spain after the initial finding by Columbus and became an important export of plantation crops. The United States came into play when they took Cuba from Spain in the late 19th century when they negotiated a so-called independence for Cuba that was tinged by the United States’ motivation and military inference (Daily Times, 2004). Neo-colonialism by the United States became prominent. The United States had control much of Cuba’s economy and political life, which led to Cuba being mostly reliant on the United States (Daily Times, 2004). Of course, American’s involvement with Cuba took a different direction after the seizing of power by Fidel Castro. However, with the recent events of the reopening of communication between the United States and Cuba, it will be interesting to examine how Cuba will handle its international policy.
In conclusion, colonialism still has a remaining impact on many nations of the world, including the DRC and Cuba. The effects of colonialism should not be brushed aside or dismissed as insignificance because it is still important to how many nations handle their domestic and international policy today. Additionally, it is part of the narratives of our nations — both those of colonizers and the colonized — and should be examined as to not cause similar consequences in the future.

The Effects of Colonialism Today
Colonialism permanently damaged the traditions, economy, and government in the countries it was established. Despite this, there is a common notion that Colonialism was a civilizing force, and brought economic development to the less developed world. This could not be further from the truth, as we are about to find out.
According to a recent poll, some 44 percent of British citizens say they are proud of their country’s colonial past [3]. The British believe that their Empire civilized the world, and they will argue that it brought economic development and modernization to the countries it conquered. It’s a nice story, but it isn’t the full truth. British colonial administration was efficient with its resources, and focused on maintaining law and order — not on development [1]. Throughout Britain’s occupation of India, India’s share of the global economy shrunk from 24% in 1700 to just 4% in 1950 [0]. Britain’s arrival in India meant changes, and these changes weren’t always for the better. Thriving Indian textile and handicraft industries were discarded, being replaced with modern factory industries [1]. These modern industries were not as lucrative for the Indian people, but one can assume that this is not something the British cared about, as the new factory industries produced more of what the British needed. Exploitation by the British would not be forgotten by India. After India gained its independence in 1950, it became a strong ally of the Soviet Union, spitting in the face of it’s former ruler.

The Continent of Africa saw the worst of what colonialism had to offer. One of the longest lasting effects of colonialism in Africa is the drawing of borders by the European powers. These borders were drawn in the 1884 Berlin Conference, a meeting between the great powers of Europe. During the conference, the great powers of Europe divided Africa up among themselves, drawing borders for new countries on the continent [2]. It goes without saying that African leaders did not have a seat at this conference. As a result, these new borders, intended to settle resource disputes between European powers, were not mindful of the geography of the areas or the composition of its people. The traditions of many African people were eroded by these new artificial borders. New borders divided up various ethnic groups, and conflicts between different ethnic groups were instigated by the European powers, seeking to weaken African resistance and strengthen their control. African countries, though independent today, still suffer from constant border disputes and civil war, as a direct result of these poorly drawn borders. Colonialism has had significant impact on the politics of Africa. Political figures like Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe are prominent in Africa, due to their nationalist, anti-colonialist and socialist politics.

The aim of colonial powers was not to develop the areas they occupied, but rather to take their wealth and keep them in line. As a result of this, there is still bitterness between European powers and their former colonies. It is in the best interest of European powers to maintain a friendly and trusting relationship with their former colonies, so that they may prosper together. A good way to say “sorry” for old crimes may be through reparations. If we are truly sorry for the deeds of the past, it only makes sense that we give back what was stolen from these countries.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can find.

First, there's an essay on the consequences of colonialism in developing countries. It seems to cover social, political, and economic aspects. That's pretty comprehensive. It mentions that colonialism led to infrastructure development and introduction of modern education and technology, which are advantages. On the downside, it caused exploitation of resources, suppression of native cultures, and created artificial borders that led to conflicts. It also talks about how former colonies are still economically dependent on their former colonizers. So, this seems like a good starting point.

Another article is from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) titled "Colonialism, Inequality, and Long-Run Paths of Development." This sounds more scholarly and might provide deeper insights into how colonialism has affected development over time. It seems to suggest that colonialism had lasting impacts on inequality and development paths, which aligns with what I've read so far.

There's also an article from ScienceDirect called "British Colonial Legacies and Political Development." This one focuses specifically on the British Empire and how their colonial legacies have influenced political development in former colonies. It seems to differentiate between direct and indirect rule and how these different approaches have led to varying degrees of political stability and governance.

Another Medium post discusses the effects of colonization, using examples like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cuba. It talks about how colonization has left lasting domestic and international consequences, including economic instability and political corruption. It also mentions neo-colonialism, which is a concept I've heard before but need to understand better.

Lastly, another Medium article emphasizes that colonialism damaged traditions, economies, and governments in colonized countries and counters the idea that colonialism was a civilizing force that brought economic development. It uses India as an example, showing how Britain's rule led to economic decline rather than development.

So, from these sources, I can see a pattern: colonialism had both positive and negative effects, but the negatives seem to outweigh the positives in the long run. Infrastructure and education are positives, but exploitation, cultural erosion, and artificial borders cause long-term problems.

I need to organize my thoughts. Maybe I should make a table or list to compare advantages and disadvantages.

Let me start with advantages:

1. Infrastructure development: Colonizers built roads, railways, ports, etc., which could benefit the colony in the long run.

2. Introduction of modern education and technology: This could lead to long-term human capital development.

3. Spread of ideas and cultures: Colonialism facilitated global exchange and the dissemination of knowledge.

4. Political stability: In some cases, colonial rule brought stability to regions that were previously plagued by warfare and chaos.

Now, for the disadvantages:

1. Exploitation of resources and labor: Colonies were often exploited for their resources, leaving them impoverished.

2. Suppression of native cultures and languages: This cultural erosion can have lasting negative effects on national identity.

3. Imposition of foreign political systems: These may not be suitable for the local context and can lead to governance issues.

4. Creation of artificial borders: Leading to ethnic and political conflicts in post-colonial states.

5. Human rights abuses: Including slavery, forced labor, and violent suppression.

I think that covers the main points. But I should probably look into whether there are any other advantages or disadvantages that I might have missed.

Let me consider the economic perspective. Some argue that colonialism led to the integration of colonies into the global economy, which could have long-term benefits. However, others point out that this integration was often exploitative and designed to benefit the colonizer rather than the colony.

Also, from a social standpoint, colonialism often led to the mixing of different peoples and cultures, which could result in the creation of new cultural forms and societies. On the other hand, it could also lead to social stratification and conflict between different groups.

I should also think about the impact on indigenous populations. In many cases, colonization led to the displacement and even genocide of indigenous peoples, which is an unforgivable disadvantage.

Perhaps I should look up some academic sources to get a more nuanced understanding. Maybe there are scholars who have studied the long-term effects of colonialism on development.

Wait, one of the search results is from NBER, which is
