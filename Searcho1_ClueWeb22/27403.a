Alright, I need to figure out what happened to Europe after World War I. I know that WWI was a really big conflict that involved a lot of European countries, so I imagine the aftermath must have been pretty significant. But to give a accurate answer, I should probably look up some information.

First, I should maybe recall when WWI ended. I think it was in 1918, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should confirm that. Also, I remember something about the Treaty of Versailles, which probably had a big impact on Europe. But I don't remember the details. So, I think I need to do some research.

Let me start by searching for " aftermath of WWI in Europe" or something like that. Maybe "<|begin_search_query|>what happened to Europe after WWI<|end_search_query|>

Post-war Europe
Post-war Europe
World War I and the treaties that brought it to a close had a profound effect on the European continent. Post-war Europe was a very different place to the Europe that gave rise to war in 1914.

Drastic changes
The war led to the abolition of three of the continent’s most powerful monarchies: the Hohenzollern dynasty in Germany, the Romanovs in Russia and the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in Austria-Hungary.
The map of post-war Europe was radically redrawn. Borders were redefined and new countries formed, carved from the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires. Some ethnic and nationalist groups, which had long dreamed of nationhood and self-government, were finally given the opportunity.
The reconstruction of post-war Europe did not satisfy everyone or eradicate old prejudices or presumptions about who should rule. The new Europe was an idealistic construct – but it would not be strong enough to withstand the extremism and fanatic nationalism that appeared a dozen years later.
Polish independence
One nation to emerge from the aftermath of World War I was Poland. Prior to 1914, the Polish people had been subjects of the Russian Empire, though they had long nurtured a desire for self-rule.
Because Poland was sandwiched between Germany and Russia, a good deal of fighting on the Eastern Front took place there. The situation changed in March 1918, when the Russians bowed out of the war, leaving most of Poland in German hands. The defeat of Germany in November that year meant that Poland, for the first time in centuries, no longer had an imperial master.
The second-to-last of Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points called for “an independent Polish state… inhabited by indisputably Polish populations … whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant.”
The signing of the Polish Minority Treaty (also called the Little Treaty of Versailles because it was signed on the same day, June 28th 1919) created the independent sovereign state of Poland.
Austro-Hungarian dissolution
Ten weeks later, the Allies finalised the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which dissolved the Austro-Hungarian Empire and reallocated much of its territory.
The kingdoms of Austria and Hungary were separated and established as independent nations, while three new nation-states were formed: Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
Austria felt itself the biggest loser from this reshuffling, with some justification. Legend has it that after negotiators had divided and allocated the best agricultural land and industrial resources of central Europe, French leader Georges Clemenceau scoffed “ Le reste, c’est l’Autriche ” (‘the rest is Austria’).
Austria a ‘remnant’
Once the beating heart of an empire of 30 million, Austria was now a landlocked remnant. It was reduced in population to around six million, losing three million of its German-speaking citizens in the Sudetenland (now part of Czechoslovakia) and South Tyrol (ceded to Italy).
Austria shrank in size to a mere 84,000 square kilometres, losing important farmland and industrial resources. Austria was forbidden from any future political unification with Germany, and the name it had adopted at the end of the war – Deutsch-Osterreich, or German Austria – was also outlawed.
The Austrian army was restricted to a maximum of 30,000 volunteers; its entire air force and most of its naval ships were surrendered to the Allies. Like Germany, Austria was compelled to pay reparations, though this was limited to 30 years.
The fate of eastern Europe
Subsequent treaties framed in Paris also resolved the fate of Bulgaria, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire:
The Treaty of Neuilly (signed November 27th 1919) forced Bulgaria to surrender its Mediterranean Sea coastline to Greece; to recognise the independence of Yugoslavia; to pay reparations of 100 million pounds; and to maintain an army no larger than 20,000 men. The Bulgarians were strongly aggrieved by the terms of this treaty, though it was lenient in comparison to the treatment meted out to Germany and Austria.
The Treaty of Trianon (June 4th 1920) finalised the fate of Hungary. Like Austria, Hungary lost more than half of its population, several major cities and large swathes of valuable territory. Most ended up with the newly formed Czechoslovakia, while some eastern territory passed to Romania. The Hungarian army was restricted to 35,000 men and prohibited from acquiring planes, tanks or heavy artillery.
The Treaty of Sevres (August 10th 1920) dealt with the Ottoman Empire. It reduced the former sultanate from 614,000 square kilometres down to 175,000. Some Ottoman territory was given to Greece and Armenia, while Allied powers Britain (Palestine and Iraq) and France (Lebanon and Syria) were allocated mandates in the Middle East. These terms were revised in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which was formed after the Turkish War of Independence.
Calls for a multilateral body
A cartoon depicting the fragile state of the newly formed League of Nations
The anti-war sentiment of 1919 saw many seek better ways to resolve international disputes and tensions. One suggestion was the creation of a multilateral organisation, where the delegates of sovereign nations could discuss, debate and arbitrate disputes between their member-states.
United States President Woodrow Wilson was the most prominent supporter of this idea, touching on it in a speech to the US Congress in January 1918. Wilson’s Fourteen Points called for a “general association of nations” for “affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity”. South Africa’s Jan Smuts also wrote extensively about a “league of nations” and how it might function.
At the Paris peace conference in June 1919, 44 countries ratified the Covenant of the League of Nations. The new body was called into being in January 1920.
The League of Nations
The first League of Nations assembly consisted of an assembly of all member-nations, along with an eight-nation executive council. Britain, France, the US, Italy and Japan were to sit as permanent members of the executive.
In total, the League had 42 founding members. None of the Central Powers received invitations for membership of the League, though they did not have wait long. Austria and Bulgaria both joined in December 1920, Hungary in September 1922 and Germany in September 1926.
American opposition
From the outset, the League of Nations was reliant on the support of the United States. When Woodrow Wilson returned to America in mid-1919, however, he found that attitudes toward the League were mixed.
Among American politicians, there was a lukewarm consensus that a multinational body was necessary, more for the peace and stability of Europe than any other reason – but there was also strong opposition to some aspects of the covenant.
Of particular concern to members of the Republican Party was Article X, which bound members of the League to “respect and preserve… the territorial integrity and political independence” of other members. They interpreted this as an open-ended treaty that might hamstring American foreign policy by binding it to protect other nations from aggression.
More conspiratorial Americans viewed the League of Nations as a globalist ‘new world order’, a form of supranational government that might override the sovereignty and national interests of the United States.
The US steps back
Despite Wilson’s vigorous campaigning in support of the League, he was unable to rally enough support in the US Senate, where a two-thirds majority was needed to ratify the covenant. A Republican faction, headed by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, refused to support the League unless the US Congress retained the power to engage in war.
As a consequence, the US never officially joined the League of Nations. Washington and its diplomats would work closely with the League, however, while numerous American groups and individuals were active contributors to the League and its various agencies.
With this American disengagement, the League came to rely on other victorious Allied nations, such as Britain and France. The League’s 25-year-old lifespan was marked by a number of successes and a handful of notable failures, most obviously the failure to avert World War II. Lacking any form of military force, and with member-states reluctant to deploy their own, the League’s only means of coercion was economic sanctions. These were effective in some situations but not others.
In October 1919, Woodrow Wilson was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in initiating the League of Nations. Almost immediately after, Wilson suffered two debilitating strokes that left him blind and paralysed on one side of his body. Wilson served the final 18 months of his presidency immobile and hidden from public view. He died in February 1924.
“In the end, Versailles proved a colossal failure for Woodrow Wilson, for the United States and for the future of a world that had hoped it might be governed by principles of freedom and self-determination. As Harold Nicolson observed, covenants of peace were not openly arrived at. Freedom of the seas was not secured. Free trade was not established in Europe; tariff walls wound up being erected, higher and more numerous than any yet known. National armaments were not reduced. German colonies and the lands of its allies were distributed among the victors as spoils, the interests of their populations flagrantly disregarded.”
David Andelman,historian
1. World War I brought about the end of the centuries-old monarchies and empires of Europe and the reorganisation of European borders and sovereignties.
2. Post-war treaties led to the formation of an independent nation-state of Poland, the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the formation of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
3. The Paris peace conferences also formed the League of Nations, a multilateral body for resolving international disputes and preventing war.
4. Despite President Woodrow Wilson’s concerted attempts, a political campaign saw the League of Nations rejected by the US Congress, which feared the impacts of the League on American sovereignty and independence.
5. The League of Nations first met in 1920 and lasted 25 years. Other than economic sanctions, it lacked any coercive power against nation-states. The League produced several successes but also some notable failures.

All tutors are evaluated by Course Hero as an expert in their subject area.
At the end of the First World War in 1918, the economic, social and political state of Europe was such that the potential rebuilding of the continent seemed a distant and unrealistic vision. The war had affected much of Western Europe, in particular France and Germany, not to mention Belgium, Italy and Austria. In addition vast regions of Eastern Europe also suffered deadly as Russia's bloody involvement in the war took its toll.
World War II had its roots in World War I:  the latter can be seen almost as a direct continuation and evolution of the former.
While the reasons are varied and numerous, I would point most distinctly to the nature of Germany's loss. The Versailles Treaty enforced objectively harsh and unfair terms on Germany, forcing it to accept blame for the entire war, crippling it with obscene fees and tariffs. The postwar economy was unable to recover under these circumstances. Secondly, the social perception of the armistice among Germans was far from positive. They had perceived that they had been betrayed by left-leaning ideological traitors, and the postwar nature of cities such as Berlin, which became inconceivably decadent and "degenerate" by traditional standards, were seen as a subversive attempt to distract the population while making Germany susceptible to anarchists and communists.
Germany's economy in the 1920s was, simple put, awful. It had no means of repaying its debts, and inflation virtually destroyed the value of its money. The American Depression, by virtue of its loans and trading ties with Germany, further cut into its recovery.
With the political machinations that allowed Hitler and the National Socialists to come to power, significant reforms took place. Hitler recognize the immediate need to change the economy, and the public desire for stronger, centralized leadership. I identify three significant factors that took Germany out of its postwar slump: the cutting-off of international trade and directing Germany toward self-sustenance, the rearmament of the military, and the remilitarization of the Rhineland.
Cutting off trade and instituting public works projects contributed to decreased economic problems, and rearmament suggested that Germany would no longer subject itself to the guilt-complex foisted upon it by the Allies. However, the Rhineland was what really revealed a path from recovery to war.
Step-by-step explanation
Following WW1, the League of Nations was intended to intervene in Future conflicts and prevent them from escalating into a similar war. However in practice, the league was practically useless, and this weakness was immediately recognized by aggressive powers of the time, and the League tended to be ignored. This led to most countries returning to foreign policies centered around their own self interests. When Germany reoccupied the Rhineland, this was a direct violation of the Versailles terms, but France felt it could not afford a war over this (keep in mind also that most countries were war-weary and didn't want to start another one). Britain was also more sympathetic to Germany and felt that Germans were entitled to militarize their own land. The policy commonly known as Appeasement, in which European powers appeared to be complicit in German aggression, was in fact the best option for their leaders at the time, without the public support or military power to act as they pleased.
Allowing Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland sent the message that Britain and France, at least, were extremely wary of showing aggression to Germany, which put Germany in a position of power. Additionally, the only state which really opposed Germany's policies was Russia, and most of Europe feared Russia more than Germany, weakening any possible union that might have stamped out German aggression earlier. This led to Germany's perception that it could execute the same thing in Czechoslovakia and Poland, which led to the outbreak of war.

The map of Europe changed in many ways after the end of World War I in 1918. These changes were noted in the Treaty of Versailles but were not caused by that treaty; instead, they were created by earlier treaties and treaties that followed the Treaty of Versailles. The largest change was the break-up of former empires, including the Ottoman Empire and Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was no longer connected to the Habsburg family. Out of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire came the Republic of German Austria and Hungary (as separate countries), Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia (then known as the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes and that was created by lands from other countries as well), Romania, and lands granted to Italy and Poland.
In addition, the countries of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent of Russia, though Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were later reoccupied by the Soviet Union during World War II. In addition, the German Kaiser abdicated, and Germany entered the period of the Weimar Republic. Germany lost some land, including the Rhineland to France and a great deal of territory to Poland (including the city-state of Danzig on the Baltic Sea). Germany's loss of land was one of the factors that helped give rise to the Nazi party and to World War II.

Originally Answered: How did Europe changed following World War 1?
The Austro-Hungarian Empire came to an end, along with the “Habsburg Dynasty”, as well as their ally the Ottoman Empire. The Bolsheviks ousted the Romanovs from Russia, Germany lost its monarchy in the person of Kaiser Wilhelm and was forced to bear the brunt of the cost of the war, leading to the secret re-militarization and coming to power of the Nazi party, and most of the European monarchies became either constitutionally democratic monarchies, or dropped their monarchs altogether. Basically, though the history books I grew up with didn’t say so, WWI left Europe in chaos, ripe for WWII.

Europe dramatically changed following the First World War.
Four empires collapsed. The German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire.
Before the start of WWI, Europe was dominated by six major powers, England, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia and Italy.
The collapse of Austria-Hungary and Russia led to the formation of multiple new states, the most important of which included Poland, Yugoslavia (basically Serbia + a lot of former Austrian territories like Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, etc) and Czechoslovakia.

Well, it is pretty straightforward.
The roping of the great neutrals-USSR and the USA-into World War Two by Germany had brought both countries to finally collide in a shared objective of expansion, one that had been prophesied of them for a very long time.
After World War Two, Europe became a distant background to world affairs. The USA and the USSR used it as a buffer zone for both of their important interests. More specifically, they used Germany as a buffer zone.

Changed compared to when? The war saw the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian Empires replaced by a series of smaller or reduced states in central and eastern Europe that were based largely on national identity. Many have since undergone changes of name and or changes in boundaries and some were for a while absorbed into the USSR before reemerging but the overall patchwork of nations seen today is still broadly similar.

Each war was horrible. For the soldier (at least on the Western front) the Second World War was probably easier on the men, though. I cannot claim to have fought then, but the fact is that there were no gas attacks.
The officers weren’t so incompetent as they were in the Great War.
And troops had the full support of aircraft and infantry. And they didn’t have to charge right into machine gun nests.

The German loss at Marne meant the Schiffen plan against France was not to be and the reality of the trenches was to dominate the next four years of the war.

It will be because of these tiny islands in the South China Sea.
The United Nations established the 200 nautical mile law of the seas, which states that a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores.
Now, the United Nations isn’t like a government, it cannot make every country follow these rules.

How did European boundaries change after World War 1?
The most significant border changes were when Germany lost 13% of its land and 10% of its population.
Poland was re-created mostly from the Central Powers for the first time since 1795. Much of the lost land had been settled in East Prussia by the Teutonic Knights in the 9th century. The area around Danzig (90% German) and surrounding countryside (owned by German landowners) went to Poland to give Poland a corridor to the sea. The Polish Corridor was from Wilson’s 14 Points. What did David Lloyd George think of the 14 Points? “14 Points of the most empty theory” and “"even God stopped at 10 Com

Why was the United States important to Europe after World War 1?
After WW1, the United States became the most powerful economy and thus the most powerful military force if necessary. The U.S. Navy was modern. America was at the forefront of science and technology. The U.S. was then comprised of 48 states. In terms of population, it had more people than the European nations (with the exclusion of the former Soviet Union, which was half in Europe and half in Asia). WW1 was fought in Europe, but not in the continental USA, proving the advantages of America’s ...

Does Germany recognise its guilt for starting World War One?
The nation that bears the greatest guilt for starting World War I was the Dual Monarchy. Their government was incompetent, decadent, irresponsible, and almost delusional. They decided to deal with Serbia “once and for all,” overlooking Serbia’s close ties with Russia and the net of alliances that would come into play if Russia and the DM went to war. The Dual Monarchy no longer exists. None of the descendant countries are direct survivors: Austria, Hungary, and the rest created new governments. Blaming Austria because the emperor was resident in Vienna for the acts of the DM would be like blam

Because it wasn’t just fought in Europe, while the Imperial Powers brought soldiers from all of their colonies.
Indeed the center of the fighting was Europe, but due to the colonies in Africa, there was fighting between british, french and portuguese troops and African locals vs German colonial troops in what is today Togo, Cameroon, Namibia and Tanzania/Mozambique.

How were the political relations between European countries before World War 1?
Political relations leading up to WW1 were a powder keg, about to go off. Ironically, the web of alliances between different groups of nations set off, rather than prevented, a continent-wide war.
The simplest view of it is Woody Allen’s quip about WW1: England had the world, and Germany wanted it. Simplistic, but not untrue.
There were two groups that together formed superpowers: one superpower was the alliance England-France-Russia. The other was Germany-Austria-Turkey.
Perhaps what held together England and France (who’d been such enemies in previous centuries) were their each having colonial

How did World War 1 affect the economy of Europe?
A very succinct answer would be: the economy of Europe was held back by about eight years. The historian Derek H. Aldcroft points out that if Europe had not gone to war, and if pre-war levels of growth had continued, they would have achieved 1929 output levels in the year 1921. [1]
Another measure of the effect on the European economies would be in terms of expenditures. Clearly, the massive amounts spent on armaments could not be spent on health, infrastructure and education, even if there we...

Originally Answered: When will World War 3 happen?
There are certain flash-points that may lead to World War 3
SOUTH CHINA & EAST CHINA SEA
The Chinese government claim that these regions rightfully belong to them. Why? Because there about 10 billion barrels of oil and 260 TCF of gas beneath the seas. About $5 trillion worth of container trade pass through the South China Sea. Neighbors like Japan, Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam are close allies of the United States. Therefore, the potential for conflict in the Asia Pacific region of two nuclear armed nations makes this issue a potential flash-point for a World War 3.

How much did the German uniform change between World War 1 and World War 2?
Well, it stayed the same colour (Feldgrau, or Field Grey). But if we’re talking standard Infantry rig, it basically became shorter (the Feldbluhse was tailored with a short skirt for riding in motor vehicles). The helmet design changed also: the Pickelhaub (with the spike on top) was discarded, replaced by the Stahlhelm, or Steel Helmet. This underwent a change after 1941, becoming smaller and closer-fitting. In 1944, supply shortages forced a drastic alteration in the uniform, which came to closely resemble the British BD or Battle Dress: short blouse jacket and short, ankle-height boots. And

It appears you already have your answer set as you use the possibly made up word “Europeanized”. Examine the facts not your agenda. The war was fought across the globe, in multiple non- European locations , and involved Chinese, Japanese, Americans, Canadians, Indians, Africans, Australians, New Zealanders, etc. It almost involved Mexico as a Central Power. Ironically, using this context the First World War may not be the “First”. The Seven Years War may be defined as the first “World” war.

First, it stabilized the borders for good (generally-speaking) this time, I believe there hasn't been that much noise regarding the divisions post-WWII other than from the IRA, Catalonians, probably some Scots and Ulster from northern Ireland and the recent spat between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea. Until 2014, we haven't seen a European leader reinforcing his/her country's territorial claims with bouts of harsh rhetoric and actually doing something about it (Vladimir Putin broke the 69 year streak when Russia moved in to Crimea).

The USA - I can’t say. But the UK learned from WW1, & modified its conscription system considerably.
Certain categories of workers were exempted. In some cases, this meant they couldn’t volunteer. Other workers might be conscripted, but only into military jobs which used their skills. We even conscripted some young men into civilian jobs - mostly coal mining, AFAIK.
Thus, unlike WW1, where at first all volunteers were welcomed, the system was intended from the start to prevent necessary industries losing workers to the armed forces, & to direct people to roles where their skills would be used mo

For Europe almost certainly more unrest and more revolutions. For the US probably not a lot of difference. There might have been be some unrest but the Zimmermann telegram and the Lusitania had made people pretty offended. Also probably the main difference between somewhere like Germany or France and the US is even with a masive military expansion the US still would not have faced anywhere near the same level of economic hardship.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can make of them.

First, there's a document from colors-newyork.com that talks about what happened to Europe after WW1. It mentions that the war led to the end of monarchies and empires in Europe and that there was a reorganization of borders and sovereignties. There was the formation of new nations like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, and the dissolution of others like Austria-Hungary. It also mentions that there was economic, political, and social instability after the war, partly due to the Treaty of Versailles.

Another document from Alpha History discusses the aftermath of WW1 in Europe. It talks about how the war led to the abolition of monarchies in Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. The map of Europe was radically redrawn, with new countries being formed from the remnants of the defeated empires. It also mentions that the reconstruction of post-war Europe didn't satisfy everyone and that the new order wasn't strong enough to prevent the rise of extremism and nationalism that led to WWII.

There's also a discussion from Course Hero about how the political, social, and economic events after WW1 set the stage for WWII. It talks about the harsh terms imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, which led to economic difficulties and social unrest in Germany. This, combined with the global economic crisis of the Great Depression, created conditions that allowed extremist movements like Nazism to gain popularity.

Another source from eNotes explains specific changes in the European map after WW1, such as the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the formation of new nations like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. It also mentions that countries like Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania became independent of Russia but were later reoccupied during WWII.

Lastly, there's a Quora thread discussing how Europe changed after WW1. Answers touch on the collapse of empires, the spread of new ideologies like Bolshevism in Russia, and the general chaos and instability that followed the war.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that after WW1, Europe underwent significant political, social, and economic changes. Monarchies fell, new nation-states were created, and there was a reorganization of borders. However, these changes were often contentious and led to instability, which, coupled with economic hardships, paved the way for the rise of extremist movements and ultimately contributed to the outbreak of WWII.

I think the key points are:

1. End of monarchies and empires: The war led to the collapse of several European empires, including those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.

2. Redrawing of the map: New countries were formed, and existing borders were significantly altered.

3. Treaty of Versailles: The terms imposed on Germany were harsh, leading to resentment and economic difficulties.

4. Rise of extremism: The post-war instability and economic crises facilitated the rise of extremist political movements, notably Nazism in Germany.

5. League of Nations: An international organization was formed to prevent future conflicts, but it proved ineffective.

These factors collectively set the stage for the even more devastating WWII.

So, to answer the question "What happened to Europe after WW1?"—Europe experienced profound political, social, and economic transformations, including the dissolution of empires, the creation of new nations, and increased internal strife, which ultimately led to the conditions that precipitated WWII.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{After World War I, Europe saw the end of several monarchies and empires, the redrawing of national borders with the formation of new countries, and significant political, social, and economic upheaval. These changes, compounded by the Treaty of Versailles' harsh terms on Germany and global economic crises, fostered an environment that eventually led to the rise of extremist movements and the outbreak of World War II.}} \]
