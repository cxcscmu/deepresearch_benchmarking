So I have this question: "How does culture influence deviance?" Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I think I can figure it out. First off, I need to understand what culture and deviance are.

I know that culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a particular group or society. It's like the way a group of people live and interact with each other. Deviance, on the other hand, is behavior that violates social norms and expectations. So, deviance is when someone does something that's considered unusual or unacceptable by society.

Now, the question is asking how culture influences deviance. I think culture must play a big role in determining what is considered deviant because what's deviant in one culture might be normal in another. For example, in some cultures, it's acceptable for women to wear revealing clothing, while in others, it's seen as inappropriate.

Maybe I should look into how social norms vary across different cultures and how these norms shape what is considered deviant behavior. Perhaps there are certain universal norms, but I suspect that most norms are culturally specific.

Let me try to think of some examples. In the United States, smoking marijuana is illegal at the federal level, so using it is considered deviant behavior. However, in some other countries like Canada and Uruguay, recreational marijuana use is legal, so it's not deviant there. This shows that what's considered deviant can differ based on cultural attitudes and laws.

Another example could be dietary habits. In some cultures, eating pork is normal, while in others, like Islamic and Jewish cultures, it's forbidden. So, eating pork would be deviant in those cultures but not in others.

Also, think about gender roles. In some societies, there are strict gender roles, and stepping outside those roles can be considered deviant. For example, in some cultures, women are expected to stay at home and not work outside, whereas in other cultures, it's common and accepted for women to have careers.

These examples suggest that culture heavily influences what is considered deviant because it shapes the norms and values that define acceptable behavior.

But maybe there are some universal forms of deviance. For instance, murder is generally considered wrong across most cultures. So, perhaps there are some behaviors that are universally deviant, while others are more culturally relative.

I should probably read up a bit on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe look into some sociology theories on deviance and culture.

Deviance and Crime: How Sociologists Study Them
Science, Tech, Math › Social Sciences
Sociology of Deviance and Crime
The Study of Cultural Norms and What Happens When They Are Broken
Daniel Allan/Getty Images
By Ashley Crossman
Updated on April 23, 2018
Sociologists who study deviance and crime examine cultural norms, how they change over time, how they are enforced, and what happens to individuals and societies when norms are broken. Deviance and social norms vary among societies, communities, and times, and often sociologists are interested in why these differences exist and how these differences impact the individuals and groups in those areas.
Overview
Sociologists define deviance as behavior that is recognized as violating expected rules and norms. It is simply more than nonconformity, however; it is behavior that departs significantly from social expectations. In the sociological perspective on deviance, there is a subtlety that distinguishes it from our commonsense understanding of the same behavior. Sociologists stress social context, not just individual behavior. That is, deviance is looked at in terms of group processes, definitions, and judgments, and not just as unusual individual acts. Sociologists also recognize that not all behaviors are judged similarly by all groups. What is deviant to one group may not be considered deviant to another. Further, sociologists recognize that established rules and norms are socially created, not just morally decided or individually imposed. That is, deviance lies not just in the behavior itself, but in the social responses of groups to behavior by others.

Why Can't I Remember What I Study?
Sociologists often use their understanding of deviance to help explain otherwise ordinary events, such as tattooing or body piercing, eating disorders, or drug and alcohol use. Many of the kinds of questions asked by sociologists who study deviance deal with the social context in which behaviors are committed. For example, are there conditions under which suicide is acceptable? Would one who commits suicide in the face of a terminal illness be judged differently from a despondent person who jumps from a window?
Four Theoretical Approaches
Within the sociology of deviance and crime, there are four key theoretical perspectives from which researchers study why people violate laws or norms, and how society reacts to such acts. We'll review them briefly here.
Structural strain theory was developed by American sociologist Robert K. Merton and suggests that deviant behavior is the result of strain an individual may experience when the community or society in which they live does not provide the necessary means to achieve culturally valued goals. Merton reasoned that when society fails people in this way, they engage in deviant or criminal acts in order to achieve those goals (like economic success, for example).
Some sociologists approach the study of deviance and crime from a structural functionalist standpoint. They would argue that deviance is a necessary part of the process by which social order is achieved and maintained. From this standpoint, deviant behavior serves to remind the majority of the socially agreed upon rules, norms, and taboos, which reinforces their value and thus social order.
Conflict theory is also used as a theoretical foundation for the sociological study of deviance and crime. This approach frames deviant behavior and crime as the result of social, political, economic, and material conflicts in society. It can be used to explain why some people resort to criminal trades simply in order to survive in an economically unequal society.
Finally, labeling theory serves as an important frame for those who study deviance and crime. Sociologists who follow this school of thought would argue that there is a process of labeling by which deviance comes to be recognized as such. From this standpoint, the societal reaction to deviant behavior suggests that social groups actually create deviance by making the rules whose infraction constitutes deviance, and by applying those rules to particular people and labeling them as outsiders. This theory further suggests that people engage in deviant acts because they have been labeled as deviant by society, because of their race, or class, or the intersection of the two, for example.

Cultural categorization: how deviance enforces normality
When conducting fieldwork in anthropology, it is the duty of the anthropologists to form or portray a complete understanding of the subject that he or she is researching. In the study of deviance and abnormality, one cannot fully comprehend what it means to be abnormal in a society without studying stigma. This paper will pinpoint the role of this stigmatization as well as the most beneficial method an anthropologist can use in order to study these responses to abnormality.
The purpose of having a normal and abnormal has been highly debated among anthropologists and psychologists alike. Anthropologist Ruth Benedict states that normality is the general way a culture lives and abnormality is simply a deviance from these patterns (Benedict: 1934 1). An instance of this would be the controversial topic of homosexuality, Benedict studied many cultures who had differing viewpoints on homosexuality, with one giving homosexuals a higher ranking and another viewing them as deplorable, research such as these, verify the anthropologists notion that a universal code of ethics is wrong, what is considered abnormal in one society can often be praised in another. That being said, the cause for such inconsistencies in belief systems often lies with the cultures history. Every community creates a set of social rules or etiquette for itself based on what is viewed as normal and abnormal, these rules are often enforced by the people

When confronted with the topic of psychological abnormality, typically one will think that it is fairly simple to explain and define.  However, nailing down an explicit definition is not as easy as one may think.  Saying that it is an action or persistent pattern of thought that is outside of the norm is far too vague to have any impact on the field of psychology, or help anyone who may be struggling with a disorder.  Furthermore, when introducing a broader scope of understanding abnormal psychology
Crime and deviance constitute a classic pathology within societies which has led to a variety of responses at political and societal level. This essay will explore crime the cause of crime and deviance with two theories, the labelling theory and biological theory.
As Melossi notes, ‘the struggle around the definition of crime and deviance is located within the field of action that is constituted by plural and even conflicting efforts at producing control’ (1994) p.205
Every culture has unique norms
Robert Merton’s study of deviance have some similarities with the work of Durkheim in Suicide. Merton developed Strain Theory; its first version was written 1940s. According to him, deviance varies in different societies. Deviance pertains to actions or behaviors that do not follow the social norms. It is affected by social structural and cultural elements. Deviance is not only about faulty communication between the difference in cultural values and/or individual socialization (Dillon 2014:177).
these differences there can’t be a universally accepted definition to describe abnormal behavior. Instead there is a set of criteria that is used in defining abnormalities. It is made up by five characteristics that are condensed in the acronym HIDES. The first is help seeking, which implies that a person that seeks help has an abnormality. This is not always accurate as there are many people who “Seek psychotherapy for help with “normal” life stresses” (Hansell, J &amp; Damour, L., 2009, p.10).
constructing the concise understandings of sociology. The concept of deviance configures into the sociological outlook through the emancipation of social control. Hence, the factors associated with deviant objectives immerse among the ways in which sociology is conducted. The enormity of sociological concepts happens to be broken down into three definite approaches, which allows the fundamentals to be processed via perspective. Deviance, then can be explained within these methods to procure the effects
Howard Becker is an American social scientist who has made real commitments to the human science of aberrance, humanism of workmanship, and human science of music.

Cultural Deviance and Gangs
9/20/2014
Society and the attitudes and actions of individuals are governed in large part by social norms.  Norms, defined by psychologists, are “[t]he implicit (not spoken of …) or explicit (openly talked about) rules of a group concerning the appropriateness or inappropriateness of certain values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors” (Fournier ).  In this framework, the group institutes its own “laws” which define and govern a person’s behaviors and dictates what punishments might be inflicted on someone who fails to follow the rules of the group. Researchers from the University of Minnesota Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition describe culture as the “shared patterns of behaviors and interactions, cognitive constructs, and affective understanding … learned through a process of socialization” (CARLA ).  Within society, different cultures and subcultures (“subdivision[s] within the dominant culture that [have their] own norms, beliefs and values” (Adler 92)) tend to have their own unique or varying set of norms thatmust be followed. In some subcultures, a system or acceptance of cultural deviance can be commonly present and accepted, even encouraged.
Cultural Deviance and Social Disorganization Contributing to Delinquency
Various behaviors, even illegal ones, might be condoned or expected in certain subcultures, even as they deviate from the dominant culture’s accepted norms. Noted criminologist Ruth Rosner Kornhauser challenged the common view of the time that cultural norms and values are all relative, and introduced the concept of cultural deviance to the field and study of criminal justice (Maahs 515).  In her theory, Kornhauser states that humans’ “actions, motivations, wants, and needs are learned from their culture” and that the socialization of individuals within a culturally deviant group is the proximate cause of an individual’s deviant behavior (Maahs 516).  She also furtherexplains that social disorganization contributes to the equation.  Culturally deviant behavior has a direct correlation to the frame of reference of the individual committing the act and the situations that arise that might compel them to act.
Frame of reference is defined as “a set of ideas, conditions, or assumptions that determine how something will be approached, perceived, or understood” (M-W 1 ).  Accordingly, if an individual is taught repeatedly, either by word or action, that the means to a certain end, regardless of the illegality of the act, is the accepted and prescribed way to achieve an end result, then the individual does not think otherwise of committing the act (according to the rules of the subculture).  If a situation arises in which a need must be met, an individual will pursue the most natural, and taught, way of meeting that need.  For instance, if a person seeks to gain financially, and it is acceptable and known to that person that committing a crime, like robbing a liquor store, is the way to get the money they seek, then they will commit the act without thinking of the consequences, in spite of the knowledge that what they are about to do or have done is considered a crime and could land them in jail or prison if they are caught.  This view, commonly accepted in many “gang” subcultures, is largely responsible for the rise of juvenile delinquencies in our modern American culture in many poor, urban settings.
Criminologist Edwin Sutherland suggests that “high-crime areas … associated with poverty, rapid industrialization, increased immigration, and the growth of cities[ and d]ecaying urban centers” are the places where delinquent behavior, antisocial values and attitudes are learned and transmitted from generation to the next (Adler et al. 93).  One subculture environment where this concept is evident is within a gang community.
A gang is, simply put, is “a group of people who are friends and who do things together”; however, in the criminal justice arena, a gang is also considered “a group of criminals [or] a group of young people who do illegal things together and who often fight against other gangs” (M-W 2 ).  Adult gangs and juvenile gangs differ primarily in the ages of their members, yet studies are showing that “age-graded and geographically based youth and adult gangs have become less common” (Howell ).  The motivations for joining each, conversely, are pretty much the same: the need for community, seeking prestige or status within the community, or other social, economic, and cultural forces.  And in some instances, individuals “seemingly have no choice. A few are virtually born into gangs as a result of neighborhood traditions and their parents’ earlier (and perhaps continuing) gang participation or involvement in criminal activity” (Howell ).  In these instances, the line between who joins gangs and why are certainly blurred, but the violence that each are capable of committing does not necessarily differ.
Thinking Critically: Street Gangs and the Source of Violence
In early July 2014, street-gang violence raged in the streets of Providence, Rhode Island, leaving nearby neighbors and residents fearful and rattled.  A drive-by shooting in the area of Chad Brown, a low-income housing project, as a result of over 40 years of rivalry between two opposing local street gangs, left five people shot and injured (Malinowski ).  While violence in the area is not new to most who have lived in the neighborhoodduring that time, many attribute the recent increase in violence to increasing economic troubles stemming from joblessness and lack of alternate resources.  Community leaders and law enforcement officials cite “a proliferation of guns, lack of jobs and the closing or cuts in funding for recreation centers [as having] contributed to the problem” (Malinowski ).  However, residents are aware that the youth are involved with these local gangs due to long-time family and community necessity, just as much as due to these other stated factors.
Conclusion: A Natural Connection
In any normal community, youth would not typically brandish an automatic weapon, let alone have access to one, and use it to settle an argument with another person.  In the instance in the Chad Brown incident in Rhode Island, it is evident that the 40-plus years of the presence of rivaling street-gangs and the inherent acceptance of deviant behaviors within those gang subcultures largely contributed to the recent violence.  Cultural deviance theory connects poverty, social disorganization and accepted deviant norms to criminal acts. These acts (and the insights of community leaders, law enforcement officials and residents of this area) are evidence of the truth of this theory in this instance.  Cultural deviance and gang violence is not limited to the streets.  Gang members, caught and convicted of their violent acts, end up in prison, and naturally morph their connections to their street gang into prison gangs.
And while most people would think that a prison gang would be more dangerous, it could be said that a street gang is more so.  In a prison, the incarcerated community is made up of criminals whose reach is limited within the confines of the prison walls, while on the street, gangs and their activities affect innocent bystanders and cause damage to neighbors and harm a larger community.  This larger pool of people who could be injured naturally makes street gangs more dangerous.  Additionally, in a prison, recruitment into a gang is limited to the population of the institution whilst, on the street, gangs have much larger population to procure resources and much greater access to the tools (i.e., guns) with which to commit violent acts.

Why are some successful? Why do some commit crimes? Society has general laws, offenders who break those laws are known as being deviants. Society views robbery, assault, and murder, as deviant acts. Cultural Deviance Theory is a, “branch of social structure theory that sees strain and social disorganization together resulting in a unique lower-class culture that conflicts with conventional social norms” (Siegel, 2018, P. 581). Acts that are viewed as deviant vary between social orders. Deviance can be said to be socially built; the general public chooses what is degenerate, individuals or an individual can be named as aberrance because of their societal position, race, ethnicity …show more content…
Documentation proves that social values make a commitment to criminal behavior, but that the presence of a genuine elective culture in out society has not been found. In any case, a few subcultural pockets, especially with respect to inner-city gangs, certainly exist and gives a few legitimacy for this point of view of deviance. With respect to social disorganization, we’ve established that neighborhood crime-fighting organizations are the hardest to set up in high-crime neighborhoods and the easiest to construct in low rate crime. With all that being said, there have been a few victories. Looking into intervention and outreach programs based on the cultural and subcultural perspectives might be a way to help lower-class, middle-class, or even inner-city …show more content…
I believe lower-class communities are not offered the same opportunities as upper-class. However, there are certain opportunities that are offered in these communities and individuals choose not to take advantage of it, because it is easier to get the money than to work for the money, i.e. welfare. I think it affects the younger population the most because they don’t have encouragement all around. For instance, they might have great programs in the community, counselors who believe in them, teachers who are supportive, but if they go home to a parent who is mentally abusing them and badgering them, then they will feel worthless because that person whom they believe and have trusted their whole life is right, they will never amount to nothing. So ultimately they feel worthless. Another example would be upholding a generational reputation.  Some children feel or think they have to uphold a reputation because their dad was the man in the streets. Nonetheless, another great example would be a 6 foot 5 inches black male in a predominantly Black/Hispanic school, poor neighborhood, inner-city, plays basketball, he has the talent but does not apply himself, turns to drugs, dies at 19. Statistics and theories will show that it was inevitable or it was expected. However, same example, but the kid applies himself and focuses on sports, makes it and gets drafted by the NBA, gets out of the ghetto and has everything he

Sociologists investigate the effects of society on criminal and deviant behaviour and seek to understand individuals and their situations. They do this by gathering and utilizing information on age, gender, social class, race and ethnicity.
Crime is specifically associated with behaviors that break the formal written laws of any given society; for example, British law states that seatbelts must be worn whilst driving a car. Deviance describes behaviors which infringe cultural norms and values but do not violate any written law; for instance, lying is considered by most individuals as wrong but is not against the law, unless while under oath in a court of law. As individuals – even if we disagree with them – we are required to abide by societies’ norms, values and laws. It is useful to think of deviance as a wide category of which crime is smaller part (sociology in perspective, p583)

Individuals construct and learn how to fit into society through ‘socialization’ within our cultures. ‘Correct’ behavior, or norms and values, are learned through interaction with our family, peers and institutions, such as the education system. Norms are socially acceptable ways of behaving in any given situation, such as knowing we should be quiet in libraries. Values are the fundamental beliefs which underpin a community or society and provide the general principles for human behavior, such as the belief that stealing is wrong; as in the case of stealing, values often become laws.
These norms and values – and therefore behaviours considered deviant – vary widely throughout history, societies, communities and cultures. For example, while one family may overlook belching at the dinner table another may be disgusted by such behavior. Moreover in Chinese culture belching during dinner is considered good manners and a sign of appreciation of the meal, Kwintessential [online]. Therefore, how behavior is regarded depends on the perspective of the people concerned. According to Becker from the perspective of Labelling Theory, no actions are by nature criminal or deviant but instead depends on the ‘norms’ created by any given society. Therefore, deviance is only deviance if labelled as such through the process of interaction in which meaning is established (Sociology in perspective, pg 604). An example of this idea of labeling is public nudity; overall it is not wrong to be nude but society imposes strict rules on nudity in public places. If brave enough to go nude in public you can be certain that the reactions of others would support this theory. In contrast some tribal communities such as those found in South America and Africa still dress in very little and would react little to public nudity.
The idea that killing is wrong, as a fundamental human value, is a good example of how relative our belief systems are. Throughout history cultures such as the Aztecs carried out human sacrifice for their religious beliefs mnsu.edu [on line] and the religious sacrifice of animals still happens in some tribal communities today.
Norms and values can become distorted and individuals may resort to stealing or even killing if there is a breakdown of norms, values or regulations. This breakdown of values shows in such cases as mercy killings and assisted suicides; individuals experience feelings of turmoil over their fundamental values and beliefs. There is much debate on the subject of assisted suicide being made legal in Britain, as is the case in countries such as Switzerland and the Netherlands, ask.com [online].
Also stealing is considered wrong by most individuals but again these values are easily distorted, as in the case of hurricane Katrina, Wikipedia [online]. Individuals, who had never stolen, were doing so because they were not able to attain essentials such as food and water, and it was not clear if the ‘normal rules’ applied. Emile Durkheim, the Emile Durkheim Archive [online] investigated this breakdown and lack of social and moral norms and defined the term anomie.
Individuals can deviate involuntarily as well as deliberately; for instance, those suffering from disorders such as Tourettes syndrome have little control over what might be considered deviant language. Whereas someone that steals a car attains their label of deviant through their own deliberate actions
Subcultures are often regarded as deviant, for example, Mormon communities live relatively peacefully within wider society yet are often assigned as deviants. In contrast, subcultures such as criminal gangs are less compatible with wider society and cause social disharmony, therefore they attain their deviant label through deliberate actions. These subcultures have their own sets of norms and values to which they abide, these may not conform to the views of wider society but they are perfectly acceptable within their own cultures.
Furthermore, individuals may be considered deviant because of their beliefs or sexuality. It could be argued than most religions consider their own beliefs as right and others as wrong. Homosexuality is considered to be deviant by some religions, cultures and individuals but not by others. Until the early 20th century the Siwans of North America expected all ‘normal’ males to engage in homosexual intercourse, moreover they considered those that refused to be peculiar. In contrast the Rwalar Bedouins considered homosexuality as so ‘abnormal’ that they put the participants to death.

Functionalists argue that we need deviance to bring about social change; for example, suffragettes of the late 19th Century went to prison for their beliefs and helped to bring about woman’s right to vote. In some societies today such as Saudi Arabia women still do not have voting rights, wiki answers [online]. The plight of the suffragettes could also be used to emphasize a fundamental issue raised by Marxists which is, crime is the product of inadequate social conditions (Sociology in Perspective pg 608)
The study of crime and sociology together seeks to understand why some individuals turn to crime and how society as a whole can prevent it. There are many types of crime which fall under three broad categories. The more physical crimes such as mugging and assault fall under Blue-collar crimes. Evidence shows that these types of crimes are most likely to be carried out by the lower or working classes; whereas white-collar crimes such as fraud and embezzlement are most likely to be carried out by the more affluent. Lastly, victimless crimes are crimes that are against the law, but no victim is seen to exist, such as Prostitution.
Sociologist use statistics to obtain evidence that enables them to determine social trends such as those discussed above. Statistics can help to identify high crime areas which in turn may be used to help authorities such as the police service to reduce such crime. Lastly statistics are used to compile information for the public, such as advice on taking precautions against crime.
However it is generally agreed that crime statistics are seriously flawed and it has been argued that they reveal more about the process and recording of crime than the extent of crime itself; the way police record incidents sometimes changes and so distorts information. The main difficulty is that statistics are derived from only reported crimes, British Crime Surveys show that only around 30% of crime is reported to the police (Sociology pg 181) – therefore most crime goes unreported giving a unrealistic view of crime rates. There are many reasons that these crimes may go unreported, for example, people may not report crimes that they deem private or shameful such as domestic abuse. Sometimes a lack of faith in the police may prevent individuals from reporting crime. Also, some crimes go unnoticed, such as stealing from the workplace or drug dealing. Some crimes are more likely to be reported than others, which further distorts crime figures. Lastly, it has been argued that the police’s own discretion on where to police, who to arrest and which category a crime fits can distort crime statistics.
Consequently, statistics are difficult to interpret and questions should always be asked as to what they tell us and what other information should be considered when trying to extract valid information. Subsequently sociologists use other information to analyse the amount of crime in society. Self report studies involve confidential questionnaires that invite a sample of respondents to voluntarily record whether or not they have committed any of a list of offences in a particular time period. Those in favor of self-report studies would argue that they are a good method of determining the social characteristics of criminals but critics suggest they may be unreliable due to the participants exaggerating their answers or not admitting to committing criminal acts. Also the data may be biased as criminals may be less likely to answer questionnaires which may distort the information.
It is argued that Crime Surveys or Victim Surveys provide a more accurate measurement of the level of crime in society, because they include hidden crime such as crimes that have not been reported to, or recorded by the police. Also their method of gathering data is consistent and is unaffected by changes in reporting or recording practices that can often hinder police statistics. Critics argue that Crime surveys still underestimate crime levels do to arbitrarily capping the number of crimes one can be victimized by in a given year; this capping can produce an unrealistic measurement in such cases as repeated domestic abuse. Crime surveys are also criticized for excluding under sixteen’s and those that live in communal establishments, such as nursing homes and university halls of residence. Lastly crime surveys fail to record crimes against ‘victimless’ crimes such as drug trafficking, crimes against commercial premises or vehicles and because they are victim surveys murder and manslaughter.
Understanding crime and deviance is important as lower crime rates have positive effects on society; for example property values improve and money saved in the police or prison services could be made available for other social projects such as the education system.

Alright, I have some information now. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, from the ThoughtCo article, it seems that sociologists define deviance as behavior that violates social norms. It emphasizes that deviance is not just about individual behavior but also about the social context and how groups respond to certain actions. The article mentions that what is deviant in one culture might not be in another, which aligns with my initial thoughts.

The article also talks about four theoretical approaches to understanding deviance and crime:

1. **Structural Strain Theory** by Robert K. Merton suggests that deviance occurs when society doesn't provide the means to achieve culturally valued goals, leading some individuals to resort to deviant behaviors.

2. **Structural Functionalism** views deviance as necessary for social order because it helps reinforce norms by showing what behaviors are unacceptable.

3. **Conflict Theory** attributes deviance to social, political, and economic inequalities, suggesting that deviance is a response to oppression and lack of opportunities.

4. **Labeling Theory** focuses on how society labels certain behaviors as deviant, and once labeled, individuals may embrace that label and continue engaging in deviant behavior.

These theories provide different angles to understand how culture influences deviance. For instance, Structural Strain Theory highlights how cultural goals and social structures can lead to deviance, while Labeling Theory shows how cultural perceptions and reactions can create deviants.

Moving on to the second source from Bartleby, it discusses the role of stigma in understanding deviance and abnormality. It suggests that stigmatization is a key aspect of how societies respond to deviance, and that understanding this process is crucial for comprehending deviance. This ties back to Labeling Theory, where the act of labeling someone as deviant can lead to them internalizing that label and continuing the deviant behavior.

The third source is from Audrey Saxton's website, discussing cultural deviance and gangs. It provides a more specific example of how cultural deviance can manifest in gang behavior, particularly in impoverished urban areas. The author argues that in these environments, deviant behavior is not only accepted but sometimes expected, and that this is passed down through generations. This seems to align with Structural Strain Theory, where lack of opportunities leads to deviant behaviors becoming normalized within a subculture.

The fourth source is from UK Essays and provides an overview of sociological theories on crime and deviance. It reiterates some of the points already mentioned, such as the difference between crime and deviance and how societal norms shape what is considered deviant. It also discusses the challenges in measuring crime through statistics and the use of other methods like self-report studies and victim surveys.

From all this information, it's clear that culture plays a significant role in defining what is considered deviant. Different cultures have different norms and values, which means that behavior that is deviant in one culture may be acceptable in another. Additionally, within the same culture, different subgroups may have their own norms, leading to variations in what is considered deviant.

Moreover, cultural influences extend beyond just defining deviance; they also shape the reasons behind deviant behavior. For example, Structural Strain Theory suggests that when society doesn't offer legitimate opportunities to achieve success, some individuals may turn to deviant means to attain their goals. This implies that cultural emphasis on certain achievements, combined with unequal access to resources, can lead to deviance.

Labeling Theory, on the other hand, shows how cultural reactions to deviance can perpetuate it. When a person is labeled as deviant, they may be stigmatized and excluded from mainstream society, which can lead them to identify more with deviant subcultures and continue engaging in deviant behavior.

Furthermore, the example of gangs in the third source illustrates how cultural deviance can become embedded in certain communities, creating a cycle of deviant behavior that is passed down through generations. This suggests that cultural influences can have lasting impacts on behavior and that interventions to reduce deviance need to address these cultural factors.

In summary, culture influences deviance in several ways:

1. **Defining Deviance**: Culture establishes norms and values, and deviance is behavior that violates these norms.

2. **Shaping Motivations**: Cultural emphasis on certain goals can lead to strain if legitimate means to achieve them are lacking, prompting individuals to engage in deviant behavior.

3. **Reacting to Deviance**: Cultural responses, such as labeling and stigmatization, can reinforce deviant identities and behaviors.

4. **Subcultural Norms**: Within a larger culture, subcultures may have their own norms that accept or encourage behaviors considered deviant by the dominant culture.

Given this analysis, it's evident that culture plays a multifaceted role in influencing deviance, affecting both the definition of what is deviant and the reasons behind why people engage in deviant behavior.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Culture influences deviance by defining social norms, shaping motivations through cultural goals, reacting to deviant behavior through labeling, and maintaining subcultural norms that may accept or encourage behaviors considered deviant by the dominant culture.}} \]
