I'm trying to understand why some groups are underrepresented in Congress. This is a complex issue, and I need to consider various factors that might contribute to this phenomenon. Let me start by thinking about what Congress represents and how members are elected.

First off, Congress is the legislative branch of the U.S. government, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. It's designed to represent the people of the United States, with representatives elected from different districts and states. The idea is that Congress should mirror the demographics of the country, but in reality, some groups are not represented proportionally.

So, why might that be? One possible reason is voting patterns and election outcomes. Maybe certain groups don't vote for candidates from their own group, or perhaps those groups have lower voter turnout. But I need to look into actual data to see if that's the case.

Another factor could be candidate recruitment and nomination processes. Maybe some groups aren't being encouraged to run for office or aren't getting the support they need to get nominated by major parties. I should look into how candidates are selected and supported.

Also, there might be barriers to entry, such as financial constraints or existing political structures that favor certain groups over others. For example, incumbents often have an advantage in re-election, which could make it harder for new groups to break into Congress.

I should also consider historical and social factors. Some groups may have faced discrimination or systemic barriers in the past that have led to underrepresentation, and the effects of that history might still be felt today.

Let me try to organize my thoughts. I'll consider four main areas: voter behavior, candidate recruitment, structural barriers, and historical/social factors.

First, voter behavior. Do members of underrepresented groups vote differently than other groups? Is there a difference in voter turnout between groups? Maybe some groups are less likely to vote for candidates from their own group, or perhaps there's a perception that certain groups aren't electable.

I need to find data on voter turnout and voting patterns across different demographic groups. Perhaps there are studies that show correlations between voter demographics and election outcomes.

Next, candidate recruitment. How do candidates get nominated to run for Congress? Are there efforts to recruit candidates from underrepresented groups? Maybe political parties aren't doing enough to encourage diversity among their candidates.

I should look into party nomination processes and see if there are any biases or obstacles that prevent certain groups from being nominated.

Then, structural barriers. Are there aspects of the political system that disadvantage certain groups? For example, gerrymandering could affect the representation of minority groups. Also, the cost of running a campaign might be prohibitive for some potential candidates.

I need to research whether the current electoral system has any built-in biases that could lead to underrepresentation.

Lastly, historical and social factors. Has there been a history of discrimination or exclusion that has led to the current state of underrepresentation? Maybe cultural attitudes or stereotypes play a role in elections.

I should consider the long-term impacts of past injustices and how they might still influence contemporary politics.

Okay, now I need to gather some evidence to support or refute these potential reasons. I think starting with some background information on the current composition of Congress would be helpful.

Let me search for the current demographics of Congress.

The changing face of Congress in 7 charts
By Katherine Schaeffer
The 117th U.S. Congress took office in January, with Democrats holding narrow majorities in the House and Senate.
Apart from its political makeup, the new Congress differs from prior ones in other ways, including its demographics. Here are seven charts that show how the demographic profile of Congress has changed over time, using historical data from CQ Roll Call, the Congressional Research Service and other sources.
How we did this
The current Congress is the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Overall, 124 lawmakers identify as Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander or Native American – making up 23% of Congress, including 26% of the House of Representatives and 11% of the Senate. By comparison, when the 79th Congress took office in 1945, non-White lawmakers represented just 1% of the House and Senate.
Despite this growing racial and ethnic diversity, Congress remains less diverse than the nation as a whole: Non-Hispanic White Americans account for 77% of voting members in the new Congress, considerably more than their 60% share of the U.S. population.
The number of women in Congress is at an all-time high. About a century after Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman elected to Congress, there are 144 women in the national legislature, accounting for a record 27% of all members across both chambers. (This includes six nonvoting House members who represent the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, four of whom are women.)
A record 120 women are currently serving in the House, accounting for 27% of the chamber’s total. There are 24 women in the Senate, one fewer than the record number of seats they held in the last Congress. In four states – Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire and Washington – both senators are women, down from six states in the previous Senate.
The House has seen slow but steady growth in the number of women members since the 1920s. Growth in the Senate has been slower: The Senate did not have more than three women serving at any point until the 102nd Congress, which began in 1991. And the share of women in Congress remains far below their share in the country as a whole (27% vs. 51%).
The number of Millennials and Gen Xers in Congress has risen slightly in recent years. In the current Congress, 7% of House members, or 31 lawmakers, are Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996 ), up from 1% in the 115th Congress. A third of House lawmakers, or 144 members, are Gen X (born from 1965 to 1980), up from 27% two Congresses earlier.
This year saw the swearing-in of the first Millennial senator: Democrat Jon Ossoff of Georgia. The number of Gen X senators has gradually ticked up from 16 in the 115th Congress to 20 this year.
While younger generations have increased their representation in Congress in recent years, older generations still account for the majority of lawmakers across both chambers. Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) make up 53% of the House’s voting membership, in addition to 68 of the 100 senators.
The ranks of the Silent Generation (born between 1928 and 1945) have decreased in recent years, from 10%, or 42 members, at the start of the 115th Congress to 6%, or 27 members, in the current Congress.
The share of immigrants in Congress has ticked up but remains well below historical highs. There are 18 foreign-born lawmakers in the 117th Congress, including 17 in the House and just one in the Senate: Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who was born in Japan.
These lawmakers account for 3% of legislators, slightly higher than the share in other recent Congresses but below the shares in much earlier Congresses. In the 50th Congress of 1887-89, for example, 8% of members were born abroad. The current share of foreign-born lawmakers in Congress is also far below the foreign-born share of the U.S. as a whole, which was 13.6% as of 2019.
While the number of foreign-born lawmakers in the current Congress is small, more members have at least one parent who was born in another country. Together, immigrants and the children of immigrants account for at least 14% of the new Congress, a slightly higher share than in the last Congress (13%).
Far fewer members of Congress now have direct military experience than in the past. In the current Congress, 91 members served in the military at some point in their lives – the lowest number since at least World War II, according to Military Times. There are more than twice as many Republican veterans (63) in the new Congress as Democrats (28). Equal shares of senators and representatives (17%) have served in the military.
While the number and share of veterans in Congress overall have decreased, the newly elected freshman class includes 15 such lawmakers.
Looking at the longer term, there has been a dramatic decrease in members of Congress with military experience since the late 20th century. Between 1965 and 1975, at least 70% of lawmakers in each legislative chamber had military experience. The share of members with military experience peaked at 75% in 1967 for the House and at 81% in 1975 for the Senate.
While relatively few members of Congress today have military experience, an even smaller share of Americans do. In 2018, about 7% of U.S. adults had military experience, down from 18% in 1980, not long after the end of the military draft era.
The vast majority of members of Congress have college degrees. The share of representatives and senators with a college degree has steadily increased over time. In the 117th Congress, 94% of House members and all senators have a bachelor’s degree or more education. Two-thirds of representatives and three-quarters of senators have at least one graduate degree, too. In the 79th Congress (1945-47), by comparison, 56% of House members and 75% of senators had bachelor’s degrees.
The educational attainment of Congress far outpaces that of the overall U.S. population. In 2019, around a third (36%) of American adults ages 25 and older said they had completed a bachelor’s degree or more education, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Congress has become slightly more religiously diverse over time. The current Congress includes the first two Muslim women ever to serve in the House and has the fewest Christians (468) in 12 Congresses analyzed by Pew Research Center dating back to 1961. Despite this decline, Christians are still overrepresented in Congress in proportion to their share of the public: Nearly nine-in-ten congressional members are Christian (88%), compared with 65% of U.S. adults overall.
By contrast, religious “nones” are underrepresented in Congress in comparison with the U.S. population. While 26% of Americans say they are atheist, agnostic or “nothing in particular,” just one lawmaker – Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. – says she is religiously unaffiliated.

Compared to the US
Every 10 years, the United States conducts a census on its population, and we get a better idea on the makeup of the American people. With this newly-elected Congress, some groups see their first representation on Capitol Hill ever, while others continue to have a strong presence in the legislative branch.
GenderCis male Cis female Trans + non-binary
Despite seeing a record number of women elected, Congress is disproportionally dominated by men in comparison to the US. If Congress was a true reflection of the US population we would have three transgender members of Congress, instead though, we're still waiting for the first.

There are age restrictions for who can serve – Senators have to be at least 30 while a representative of the House has to be over 25 – and historically 90% of incumbents hold on to their seat at elections. However, there are signs that the tides are starting to turn with newly elected Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer becoming the youngest women to serve in the House at just 29.

Methodology
(Updated June 7th 2019) The House and Senate demographic data were collected from CivilServiceUSA.
Gender: Gender was divided into cis male, cis female, and trans + non binary in order to highlight the lack of congressional representation of those under the transgender identity. Congresspeople are considered Trans + non binary if their gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth (definition retrieved from GLAAD. ). Source
Sexual Orientation: Congresspeople are considered LGB if they are lesbian, gay, or bisexual and have stated so publicly. Source
Ethnicity: Ethnicity groups were defined by the United States Census Bureau's racial data guidelines are White, Black, Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islanders, and two or more races. The US Census Bureau does not include Hispanic Americans or Middle Eastern Americans as racial subgroups, so national data for these two groups were retrieved from other sources. Because of the inclusion and exclusion of certain groups, the total percentages for racial breakdown might not equal 100%. Congresspeople are considered multiracial if they identify with two or more races. Definition retrieved from the 2010 Census Briefs. All race categories ("white", "black", etc.) should be interpreted as non-hispanic.
Religion: The Church of Latter-Day Saints has affirmed themselves to be under the umbrella of Christianity; they were intentioanally excluded from the group to show prominence of representation.
Source: Data collected for confirmed candidates used the AP Elections API. Demographic data was confirmed via US Census, 2010; Pew Research; Votesmart.org; Ballotpedia.org; CivilServiceUSA; UCLA Williams Institute; American Factfinder; and campaign websites

Congress is responsible for creating laws that apply to the U.S. population, which is made up of a complex array of demographics and backgrounds. Learn the many distinctions in age, gender, race, education, religion, and political alignment that compose the United States' population. Updated: 03/18/2022
The Makeup of Congress
As of 2022, the United States of America has a population of 332,403,650 people. This includes individuals from each of the 50 states and territories. This number does not include those that have immigrated illegally to the country. Representatives are elected from the United States citizenry to represent the people in Congress.
The United States Congress is the national federal legislative body of the United States of America. The main job of Congress is to make the laws for the United States that affect our everyday lives and protect our rights. There are 535 individuals in Congress that come from each of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the District of Columbia.
Let's look at the general makeup of Congress based on different characteristics.

Age, Gender and Race
The United States Census defines white people as those having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe and parts of North Africa. Whites are the majority of the U.S. population - about 61%. The growing segment who consider themselves Hispanic or Latinx is now 18.5%. African-Americans make up approximately 13% of the population, followed by 5.9% Asian-American and 1% American Indian.
There is a disparity in these population numbers when compared with those elected to the U.S. Congress. As of the 2020 election, about 23% of the house and senate are minority, compared to about 40% of the population. There are 59 members who are African American, about 11%. 46 are Hispanic, about 9% and 17 who are Asian-American or 3%.
The disparity in numbers holds true with gender and age, as well. The US population is about 50.8% female according to the 2020 US Census. There are 144 members of the 2022 congress who are female, only about 27%. But that is a 50% increase from a decade before. The median age of the citizens in the United States is 38.31 years old in the 2020 census. The average age of the members of the 117th Congress was 59 years old, the median age is 60. It is the oldest Senate in US history.
Party Makeup
According to Gallup in Feb, 2022, 26% of the population considers itself aligned with the Republican Party. Forty-two percent of the citizens consider themselves Independent and twenty-nine percent Democratic. Statistics show that those that consider themselves Independent split down the middle with half leaning more Republican and the other half leaning more Democratic. In the House of Representatives, there are 211 Republicans and 222 Democrats with two vacancies. In the Senate, there are 50 caucusing with Democrats and 50 with Republicans, an even split. Therefore, we can see that the representation of the American people generally aligns as far as the political party makeup of congress is concerned.

117th Congress Demographics: Race, Gender & More
by Veronica Magan, FiscalNote
The 117th Congress is the most diverse in U.S. history. Read the complete demographics of Congress including age, racial makeup, religion & more!
Back to resources listing
The 117th Congress that took office in 2021 is the most diverse in U.S. history. For government relations and advocacy professionals, this can potentially open new doors for building those all-important relationships on the Hill to push your issues forward.
From better aligning your issues with the demographics of members of Congress to tailoring your messages, or finding personal connections, knowing what is the demographic makeup of Congress is a key part of the government affairs professionals’ toolkit.
With the aid of CQ and FiscalNote’s data, we took a closer look in our Demographics of the 117th Congress report, to examine their racial makeup, religious diversity, alma mater, prior occupations, and more. Here are some highlights from the report:
Race
The demographics of the 117th Congress make it the closest one yet to a true racial representation of our country. While it is still predominantly white, other races and ethnicities have been steadily increasing over the past two decades.
One of the groups with the highest increases between the 116th Congress and the 117th is Asians with an increase of 23 percent. Though overall representation is still small at 3.18 percent.
“Policymaking is not objective, which is why it's essential that all communities are represented in the halls of Congress, federal agencies, and K street because diverse opinions and perspectives produce better solutions, period,” says Eliza Ramirez, legislative director for Congressman Tom Malinowski and vice president of the Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute.
For more details on the racial makeup of the 177th Congress, download the report.
Gender
Since the early 2000s women have been steadily making ground in Congress. However, the demographic breakdown of congress still shows a big gender gap with women accounting for only 26 percent of the 117th Congress versus 50.5 percent overall in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
More women in public office can help more women get a seat at the table in other areas like the government relations industry. “For a long time in government relations work, the biggest challenge is that most elected officials were not women. I hate to say, but there still is the boys club. And it's a hard nut to crack when the elected officials you're going to work with are mostly men,” says Anne Valentine, vice president of government relations at United Way of Central Indiana.
For a detailed view of women in Congress over the years, download the report.
Age
Despite high-profile newcomers such as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was 29 when first elected in 2019, Congress has gotten older over the past several decades. The median age of members of the 117th Congress is 60 years old, which is much higher than the country’s median age of 38, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Different generations see certain issues differently so the overall demographic of Congress can aid or deter your efforts. Knowing the overall age of members of Congress can help you better address a larger grassroots advocacy campaign, for example.
Religion
Besides racial diversity, the religious makeup of Congress also became more varied in 2021. While Catholics are still the majority, the demographics of Congress show Methodists and Presbyterians saw the biggest gains.
Education
Members of the 117th Congress are highly educated with 68 percent boasting advanced degrees, compared to the 13 percent of Americans who have them, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
When it comes to alma mater, D.C.-based universities take the lead but there’s also a good representation outside of the beltway that can help you break the ice and connect with key lawmakers.
For a detailed view of the alma maters of the members of Congress, download the report.
Military Service
One area that has significantly decreased over the years is military service in the demographic breakdown of Congress. Only about 16 percent of the members of the 117th Congress have served in the military, which is a big decline when compared to the early ‘70s.
For a historical view of military service in Congress, download the report.

Learn how
Years in Congress
Forty percent of the 117th Congress has been at the job for more than 11 years and, while most members have had a career in public service, politics, and law, scientists and aeronautics professionals have seen gains in recent years.
Building new relationships with members of Congress is an art form, especially ones who’ve been in their jobs for so long. The upside is that the majority of Congress members haven’t reached a decade yet so you have plenty of time to consolidate your relationships. Leveraging their previous occupations can also be a ticket to connecting with key lawmakers, and don’t forget the importance of building a local government affairs strategy that can help you create advocates for your policy agenda and build good faith across the aisle to advance your legislative portfolio.
Check out the full breakdown of prior occupations of the members of the 177th Congress in our report.
Marital Status
About 83 percent of Congress members are married, which is quite high compared to the average marriage rate in the U.S. of, 52 percent. They also have more children than the average U.S. family.
Knowing the marital status and family composition of key lawmakers is a helpful way to better tailor your messages and time your outreach so, for example, it doesn’t collide with regular school activities if they have children.

Get Access to all the Data on the Demographics of Congress
Our Deep Dive into the Demographics of the 117th Congress report leverages data from our FiscalNote and CQ platforms to bring you a comprehensive look at one of the most important government bodies for public affairs and advocacy professionals like yourself.  This report includes data on where representatives went to college, where they were born, their professions prior to serving, and family composition, as well as more details on the demographics outlined in this article.
Identifying constituents of members with similar biographies lets you make stronger personal connections and build relationships with specific legislators or groups of legislators. FiscalNote’s stakeholder and people datasets as well as CQ’s immense full member bios that include, contracts, grants, and companies in their district/state, as well as even average interest groups ratings, lets you take things to the next level when building a report on the likely members most aligned with your issues.
Once you’re ready to start your outreach, FiscalNote’s legislator and staffer directory, Knowlegis, has the most up to date contact information for Congress as the best deliverability rate to the Hill, and the option of building mailing lists by issue area, party, role, caucus, voting record, committee, delegation, and so on.

Congress is more diverse, but it still lags behind the US population - Vox
This is the most diverse Congress ever. But it’s still pretty white.
About 22 percent of the House and Senate is nonwhite. But that’s still much less than the overall US population.

The current Congress is the most racially diverse in history, but it’s still much whiter than the country overall, according to a new analysis by the Pew Research Center.
First, the good news: About 22 percent of members of the House and Senate, or 116 lawmakers, are racial or ethnic minorities — the most diverse Congress ever.
“This represents an 84% increase over the 107th Congress of 2001-03, which had 63 minority members,” Kristen Bialik wrote for Pew. The current Congress is also the fifth in a row that has been more racially or ethnically diverse than the last.
As this chart from Pew shows, the current Congress’s boost in diversity reflects an increase in every major racial and ethnic group — black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American.
The changes have made some parts of Congress match the general US population, Bialik explained: “For example, 12% of House members are black, about equal to the share of Americans who are black. And Native Americans now make up 1% of the House, equal to their 1% of the population.”
The shifts are also lopsided by political party: Of the 22 nonwhite first-term representatives, only one is a Republican, Bialik wrote.
Still, Congress remains pretty white overall compared to the rest of the US population. About 78 percent of Congress is white, versus 61 percent of the overall population. The overall gap has widened over time, according to Pew, which means the US population is becoming less white more quickly than Congress is becoming less white.
Pew Research Center
“The share of Hispanics in the U.S. population (18%) is twice as high as it is in the House (9%),” Bialki wrote. “Asians account for 6% of the national population but 3% of House members.”
One caveat: Some members of Congress are counted twice in Pew’s analysis. Presidential candidate and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), for example, is black and South Asian, and counted in both categories.
Beyond making Congress look a bit more like the people it’s supposed to represent, this kind of diversity matters because people’s backgrounds and life experiences can influence what issues they think are most important.
For example, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is black, and he’s spoken several times about how he’s been racially profiled by police. In 2016, he said that he had been stopped seven times by police officers in the course of one year, even as an elected official. “Was I speeding sometimes? Sure,” he acknowledged. “But the vast majority of the time, I was pulled over for nothing more than driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as trivial.”
These experiences have helped shape Scott’s views on policies regarding police and the criminal justice system, leading him to support — and introduce — certain reform efforts.
Similarly, the election of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) led Congress to end a 181-year-old ban on headwear on the House floor, allowing Omar to wear a hijab as she does her job. “No one puts a scarf on my head but me,” Omar tweeted last year. “It’s my choice—one protected by the first amendment.”
The same applies to gender diversity and equality. Studies show, for example, that electing more women has a noticeable effect on how governments work, with research indicating that women legislators sponsor more bills, pass more laws, and get more money sent back to their districts.
So the new Congress doesn’t just look a bit more like the people it represents now. It also may be somewhat more representative, in terms of concerns and policy, for the rest of the country.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that the current Congress is the most diverse in history, but it still doesn't fully represent the demographics of the United States. For instance, about 22% of Congress members are non-white, whereas the US population is around 40% non-white. Similarly, women make up about 27% of Congress, but they comprise 51% of the US population.

So, this shows that certain groups are indeed underrepresented in Congress. Now, I need to understand why that is the case.

Let me first consider voter behavior. Maybe voters aren't electing candidates from these underrepresented groups. But according to the articles, there has been an increase in diversity in Congress, which suggests that voters are electing more diverse candidates over time. However, it's still not proportional to the population.

Perhaps there are barriers in the candidate recruitment process. Maybe political parties aren't recruiting enough candidates from underrepresented groups, or these groups aren't being encouraged to run for office. I should look into that.

Also, maybe there are structural barriers, like the cost of running a campaign or the incumbent advantage, that make it harder for new candidates from underrepresented groups to get elected.

Additionally, historical and social factors could play a role. Past discrimination and systemic barriers might have led to underrepresentation that persists today.

I need to explore these possibilities further.

Let me start by looking into candidate recruitment and nomination processes.

The recruitment of political candidates is a basic function of political parties: a party that cannot attract and then nominate candidates surrenders its elemental opportunity for power. Two stages may conveniently be distinguished in the process of recruitment. Certification includes the social screening and political channeling that results in eligibility for candidacy, while selection includes the actual choice of candidates to represent parties in the general election. Selection is at the focus of the contest for power within parties, and is my focus here.
Considering its importance we know too little about the dynamics of the nominating process. Most of what we do know derives from the analysis of two modal institutional types of political selection: the convention system and the primary system. Experience indicates that despite their manifest purposes, these contrasting institutional types have not necessarily resulted in widely different internal party structures. A variety of party patterns in one-party states—from the tightly controlled machines in Virginia to the transient and multiple factionalism of Florida—flourish in the framework of the direct primary system. Patterns of diffusing factionalism on the one hand, and of disciplined party organizations on the other are also found in states without primaries. Perhaps a closer look at the active participants in the processes of selection, and their interrelationships, may shed some further light on significant factorsin party structure. By interviewing candidates in party primaries we hoped to disclose the steps in nomination and the precise political relationships involved.

In the machine-convention type, candidates are chosen by the party elite, using several criteria: (1) readiness for nomination as demonstrated by long service in party positions at graduated levels of party organization; (2) strong acceptability to the party's potential electoral support; (3) loyalty to party organization leadership; (4) conformity to an organizational code; (5) representativeness of an ethnic, religious group, or geographic area. More democratic entry is expressed in the idealized model of the direct primary. In a general way, the primary may be characterized as follows: (1) The party electorate chooses the candidates. (2) All candidates may freely enter into the selection contest. (3) No group or individual controls access to the party electorate. (4) The party officials and organization are formally neutral in the selection process.

Some of the questions follow: (1) With whom did you first discuss your candidacy? (2) What was the response of these people?

Looked at in another light, however, there may be a virtue in free wheeling recruitment groups. A prevailing ideology extols party “integration” and “responsibility,” while political entrepreneurship is dismissed as unprogrammatic and irresponsible. What may be overlooked is that in contexts of considerable social and economic change, a political environment conducive to political entrepreneurship may be highly functional. Individuals and small groups that can respond to new social and political opportunity may be catalytic agents of political change. By not having resistant and cohesive organizations, parties may thus develop greater responsiveness to such social changes.

Candidate Selection within Political Parties
Candidate selection is the process by which political parties
decide who will be on the ballot paper as their recommended candidate(s). The
way in which they make that choice is mainly determined by their own internal
rules and procedures. Nomination is the legal process by which
election authorities screen the candidates recommended by the party, approve
their candidacy, and print their names on the ballot paper.
In each election, thousands
of persons could potentially stand for election, but it would be impossible for
voters to make an informed choice among them. Political parties therefore act
as useful and necessary gate-keepers narrowing down the list of candidates to a
small enough pool.
Parties can select their
candidates in many different ways. In numerous cases, the existing legal
framework establishes that political parties should “democratically” elect
their candidates, but this concept is very vague, and there are few if any
applicable legal provisions. Only in a few cases does legislation lay down the
process by which candidates should be selected, and the selection process can
have a direct impact on the depth and breadth of the democratic
process—particularly if a given party’s candidate selection process is
non-transparent [1]
There are two concepts that
are central to the issue of party selection of candidates. One is centralisation ,
that is, what level in the party – local, regional or national –controls the
candidate selection. The second is participation, meaning who –
ordinary members or top leadership – controls the process at the level where the
decision is taken.
Centralisation
In an extremely centralised
system, a national party agency would decide on the candidate selection without
any involvement by the more local branches of the party. At the other end of
the scale would be a system where the most local branches of the party would
decide on candidates without any approval or participation from the national
level. As in so many other fields, the actual practice is usually somewhere
between the two extremes.
In most political parties,
candidates are chosen at the local level even though the national level of the
party has a varying degree of influence. The influence can be pro-active by
encouraging, recommending, or forcing the local branch to chose a particular
candidate – or negative by the national level party reserving the right to veto
candidates. In both cases, the party has to strike a difficult balance between
national level strategies and local sensitivities.
Participation
A situation with extremely
low participation would be if the party leader alone would decide on the
candidates. The other extreme would be if the ordinary members of the party
would decide without any participation or involvement of the party leaders.
The latter can be
illustrated with the case of the United States, where members (or in some
states, all registered voters) can elect the party candidate(s) through direct
votes in primary elections. The election is between all candidates that present
themselves, and the process takes place under the supervision of the government
– largely outside the control by the party organisation. The government also
ensures that the person who won the primary election is the one who will be on
the ballot paper representing the party.
Other parties in different
countries have chosen to have varying degrees of member participation in the
selection process, from party-run primary elections to indirect elections where
party branches send delegates to a national congress.
What determines the
selection process?
Factors such as electoral system,
party ideology, political culture, and the organisation of government have been
thought to have an influence on the centralization and participation in the
candidate selection process. However, there is no evidence that any of them is
decisive.
It would be natural for
national party agencies to be more influential in multi-member district systems
(where more than one person is elected to the legislature from each
constituency), while single-member constituencies would give more power to
local branches.
In the same logic, federal
systems would tend to favour decentralized candidate selection, parties with an
inclusive political ideology would favour participatory selection procedures,
and parties in countries with a hierarchical political culture would foster
non-participatory processes.
However, all these (and
more) criteria are mixed in all political parties, and conclusions are
therefore hard to draw. Not even in cases where legislation stipulates a
particular selection process is it always possible to say if the law has
determined the processes, or if they simply reflect practice.

Criteria to stand as a candidate
In addition to the qualifications that each political party may expect of the persons that will be their candidates, the legal framework can place qualification requirements on individual candidates.
The basic legal qualifications to stand as a candidate are those that apply to voters: citizenship, being of age, and in full possession of civil and political rights. If any other requirements are imposed, it is good practice to ensure that they are rational, reasonable, and objective. In order to avoid the nomination procedure being used in a discriminatory way, countries should make sure that it is clearly stated in the law what the qualifications are.
Legal qualifications to become a candidate can aim at any of the following:
Support from a strong network or organisation by requiring candidates to be endorsed by a political party. (Such a requirement would make it impossible for an independent candidate to stand for election).
A certain level of maturity by requiring a higher age than that required to vote. It is common for the minimum age to vary according to the importance of the office – the more important the office, the higher the minimum age for candidacy.
Neutrality or commitment to the country by requiring the candidate to be a “natural born citizen”, not be a citizen of any other country, and/or having resided in the country (or in some countries, the relevant constituency for local or legislative elections) for a certain period before the election. Candidates may be disqualified if they have been convicted of treason or treachery. In some cases, a proof of commitment could also include having completed the military service (especially for men) and/or being a registered voter. (In countries with compulsory voting, the person may be required to have voted in the last elections.)
Personal competence by requiring a certain level of education, that the candidate has a working level of the official language(s), and that the person is physically and (more commonly) mentally sound.
Precluding conflicts of interest by stipulating that candidates may not hold a position in a company that is a government contractor.
Moral aptitude by disqualifying persons that have been convicted of certain categories of crime such as crimes related to the election process, or corruption, or persons who are bankrupt.
Ability to assume office by disqualifying persons who are under current criminal incarceration (though generally not simply under arrest prior to trial).
Allegiance to certain societal norms like democracy, support for peaceful ethnic co-existence, non-violent competition, etc.
Any qualification, especially those based on criteria of competence, moral aptitude, and allegiance to societal norms, can be used in a discriminatory manner. If opposition politicians are subject to quasi-legal persecution, court cases could be used to stop them from contesting an election. In other cases, the requirements may not have the desired effect. Where a certain level of education is required, that often discriminates against women who have not had the same access to formal education as their male counterparts.
In general, the imposition of too many requirements always carries with it the risk of creating legislatures or other elected bodies that are dominated by an unrepresentative elite.

Registration for Election and Nomination of Candidates
The registration for election (registration to gain ballot access) confirms a political party’s or candidate’s intention to contest a specific election and is often linked to the process of nominating candidates. The registration of a political party as an organisation or association is sometimes different from the registration to gain ballot access.
Even if the registration of political parties as organisations is different from the registration of parties to gain ballot access, the legal framework could be structured in a way as to make it easier, or sometimes even automatic, for registered parties to gain access to the ballot.
It is good practise to ensure that the legal framework clearly specifies when, how, and where registration procedures must be undertaken, what the requirements for registration are, and how the verification of registration will take place. The legal framework should provide for uniformity in the registration process so that the same registration process applies to all political parties and candidates at all levels. To ensure fairness, the grounds for rejection of a registration application have to be based on objective criteria and have to be clearly stated in the legal framework for elections, along with avenues of appeal against such rejection. Correctly applied, this would protect political parties against arbitrary discrimination. In order to make sure that the registration procedure, including possible appeals, is finalized well in time for the EMB to print and distribute ballot papers, it is advisable to have a clear and transparent schedule with deadlines by which appeals have to be submitted, etc.
Criteria for registration
The criteria for registering a political party or candidate for election are often the same or similar as for registering a political party as an organisation, (see Registration of political parties), such as proof of popular support or adherence, proof of geographical presence, often in the form supporting signatures from a certain number of regions or districts, and proof of economic viability.
Nomination of candidates
The nomination of candidates (to gain ballot access) is the formal procedure by which political parties and/or individuals put candidates forward for election, and the acceptance of the EMB of that nomination. In list systems, parties put forward a list of candidates selected within the political party. In constituency systems, candidates are nominated individually (not as part of party lists). Depending on the country, they can be nominated either by a political party or by an individual.
Legal frameworks can place requirements on the composition of party lists. In some cases, there are requirements aimed at increasing the representativity of the list by, for example, asking or requiring the party to have a certain number of women (or members of other traditionally under-represented groups) on its list. In some cases, not only the number but the placement on the list is specified.

From these search results, I can see that candidate selection processes vary widely across political parties and countries. In the US context, political parties have their own internal rules and procedures for selecting candidates, and these processes can range from highly centralized decision-making by party elites to more participatory methods involving rank-and-file members.

In some cases, parties use primary elections where party members vote to choose their preferred candidate. This can be a more democratic way to select candidates, as it allows party members to have a direct say in who represents them. However, even primary elections can have limitations, such as low voter turnout or being influenced by special interest groups.

On the other hand, some parties may rely on party conventions or caucuses where delegates choose the candidate. These processes can be more controlled by party leadership and may not reflect the preferences of the broader party membership.

Moreover, there's the issue of candidate recruitment. Even if a party has a democratic process for selecting candidates, if certain groups are not being recruited to run in the first place, they may still be underrepresented. This could be due to a lack of encouragement, lack of resources, or perceived barriers to entry.

I also came across information about voluntary party candidate quotas, particularly for women and other disadvantaged groups. Some parties have implemented these quotas to ensure that a certain percentage of their candidates come from underrepresented groups. This can be an effective way to increase diversity in candidate slates and, ultimately, in elected offices.

However, the effectiveness of these quotas can depend on various factors, such as the party's commitment to enforcing them and the broader social and cultural attitudes towards representation.

Given this information, it seems that one reason for underrepresentation in Congress could be the candidate selection processes themselves. If certain groups are not being recruited or are facing barriers in the nomination process, they may not have the same opportunities to become candidates and, consequently, to get elected.

I need to dig deeper into how candidate selection works in the major US political parties, particularly in the context of congressional elections, to understand if and how these processes might contribute to underrepresentation.

Let me look for more specific information on candidate selection in the Democratic and Republican parties.

The Process of Electing Members of Congress
The Process of Electing Members of Congress
On every even-numbered year, registered voters elect their congressional representatives. Members of the House of Representatives serve two-year terms. Although the U.S. Constitution doesn't limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, they must run for office again and be re-elected.

1 Primary Elections
The Republican and Democratic parties dominate the first stage of the election process. In this the U.S. differs from most other representative democracies because party candidates for general election are chosen by voters rather than by party leaders. Each state determines its own procedures for these preliminary contests. In some states the primary election operates like the general election, except that voters only choose among candidates within a single party. Other states hold nominating conventions or caucuses to choose candidates. Voters select their party's candidate to run against the other party's candidate and any independent candidates in the general election.
2 General Elections
The general election decides which candidates will represent their states or districts in the upcoming term. Unlike the primary elections, voters select among all candidates for office. This includes candidates fielded by the two major parties as well as any independent candidates who have made the ballot. Only the Republican and Democratic parties have primaries, but candidates from other parties can get on the ballot if a state-specified number of registered voters sign a petition to have the candidate's name added. Whichever candidate receives the most votes wins the election.
3 Direct Election of Senators
According to Article 1, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution, each state legislature selects that state's two senators. The purpose of this process was to forge stronger ties between federal and state legislatures. This process led to problems, including frequent vacancies resulting in states not being represented in the Senate. In 1913, the 17th Amendment was passed, providing each state's senators would be elected directly by that state's citizens. Candidates for senator must be legal residents of the state who are at least 30 years old and have been U.S. citizens for nine years.
4 Apportionment of House Seats
The 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided among the states according to population distribution. Any legal resident of a state who is at least 25 years old and has been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years is eligible to run for a seat in the House. While the Constitution guarantees each state at least one representative, densely populated states have several districts so representatives can be better attuned to the particular needs of constituents in defined geographic areas. Every 10 years, a census is held to assess the country's population. After each new census, the number of representatives each state is allotted is recalculated to reflect any change in state population since the previous count. States then redraw district lines to ensure each representative serves equivalent numbers of people.

This Is How US Political Parties Select Their Presidential Candidate
World Reuters Updated: March 01, 2016 11:41 pm IST
The key to winning the nomination for Democratic and Republican party is ultimately not about the popular vote. (AFP Photo)
Washington: The nominating contests that will determine the Democratic and Republican nominees for the November 8 US presidential election are about to enter a critical phase. On March 1, known as Super Tuesday, primaries or caucuses are being held in about a dozen states, and they could be turning points in both parties.
But the key to winning the nomination for each party is ultimately not about the popular vote. It is about securing the number of delegates needed to win the nomination at each party's convention - July 18-21 in Cleveland for the Republicans and July 25-28 in Philadelphia for the Democrats.
Like so many things in politics, there are twists and turns in how the popular vote is used to select each party's candidate.
The following is a guide to the nominating process:
Q: Is the delegate selection process the same for the Republican and Democratic parties?
A: No. The parties set their own rules. One thing that is the same is that at each party convention, a candidate needs to reach only a simple majority of the delegate votes to win the nomination.
Q: How many delegates are there?
A: The Democratic convention will be attended by about 4,763 delegates, with 2,382 delegates needed to win the nomination. The Republican convention will be attended by 2,472 delegates, with 1,237 delegates needed to win.
Q: I keep hearing about "superdelegates." Are they different from other delegates? Do both the Republicans and Democrats have superdelegates?
A: Superdelegates, officially known as unpledged delegates, are a sort of wild card in the nominating process, but only the Democrats have them.
The category was created for the 1984 Democratic convention, and according to political scientists, they are a legacy of the 1980 convention when there was a fight for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter, who was seeking a second term in the White House, and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Members of Congress were frustrated by their lack of influence, because delegates elected to support one candidate could not switch to support another. So Democratic members of the House of Representatives led an effort to win a role for themselves. That resulted in the creation of superdelegates. Unlike other delegates, superdelegates may change what candidate they are supporting right up to the convention.
There is no fixed number of superdelegates because the group is defined by various categories whose members change from one election cycle to another. Here is who gets to be a superdelegate:
All Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; the Democratic governors; the Democratic president and vice president of the United States; former Democratic presidents and vice presidents; former Democratic leaders of the US Senate; former Democratic speakers of the House and former Democratic minority leaders. Throw in the members of the Democratic National Committee and the former chairs of the DNC and you finally have the whole pool of superdelegates.
Q: What about the other delegates? Do they get to choose which candidate to support?
A: Both the Democratic and Republican parties send delegates to their conventions based on the popular vote in the primary elections and caucuses held in each of the 50 states. But the parties have different rules on how delegates are allotted to a candidate.
The Democratic Party applies uniform rules to all states. In each state, delegates are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary or caucus vote in each district. But a candidate must win at least 15 per cent of the vote to be allocated any delegates.
The Republican Party lets states determine their own rules, although it does dictate some things. Some states award delegates proportionate to the popular vote, although most such states have a minimum percentage that a candidate must reach to win any delegates. Some other states use the winner-take-all method, in which the candidate with the highest percentage of the popular vote is awarded all the delegates. Other states use a combination of the two methods.
States that use the proportionate method may instead use the winner-take-all method if one candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the popular vote.
In addition, the Republican Party requires that all states with nominating contests held between March 1 and March 14 use the proportional method, meaning that all the states holding votes on Super Tuesday will have to award delegates proportionally.
Q: What happens to delegates if a candidate drops out of the race?
A: Another good question, because we have certainly seen that happen this year.
For the Democratic Party, in every state, delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.
For the Republican Party, it varies by state. In some states, delegates are required to stick with their original candidate at least through the first ballot at the Republican National Convention. In some other states, if a candidate drops out, his or her delegates may immediately pledge to another candidate. There is also a middle ground in which those delegates are reallocated to the remaining candidates.

Both parties officially nominate their candidates for presidency at their conventions. The Republican Party selects its presidential candidate by means of delegates chosen in individual states through caucuses and primary elections. While the Democratic Party uses a proportional method of choosing delegates.

There are requirements that people need to qualify for in order to run for Congress as a candidate. Learn the eligibility requirements for running for Congress and the process for becoming an official candidate. Updated: 10/01/2021
Prerequisite
Before an individual can become a candidate to run for Congress, this person must first make sure that they meet the minimum requirements to run for Congress. A candidate for the United States Senate must be 30 years of age, a citizen of the United States for 9 years and an inhabitant of the state that he is elected from at the time of the election. A candidate for the House of Representatives must be 25 years of age, a citizen of the United States for 7 years and an inhabitant of the state that he is elected from at the time of the election. If that person meets these minimum requirements, then let's see how he goes about becoming a candidate!

File for Office
There are a couple ways an individual can become an official candidate for Congress. The individual can file his paperwork by himself. Or, the individual can be nominated by his political party to run.
In the case where an individual is seeking the nomination of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party to become a candidate for Congress, the process depends on which state they live in.
In most cases, the individual must submit some sort of affidavit indicating their desire along with a petition signed by a certain minimum number of voters in that state. The voters must be members of whichever party the individual is wishing to align with. Then, that individual will appear as a candidate on the ballot for the primary in that state.
In some states, the major political parties use candidate selection to choose their candidate for Congress. Candidate selection is the process by which a candidate is selected by a political party to run for Congress. This is usually done at a party convention where the members vote to select one candidate.
In the case where an individual is seeking to run as an independent candidate or as a candidate without political party affiliation, then this candidate also must file an affidavit with the state indicating their desire to become a candidate on the ballot. Even in the case of someone without political affiliation, they must also submit a petition with a certain number of signatures of registered voters with their affidavit. After doing these things, this individual will be a candidate on the ballot for that office.

Candidate Selection within Political Parties
Candidate selection is the process by which political parties
decide who will be on the ballot paper as their recommended candidate(s). The
way in which they make that choice is mainly determined by their own internal
rules and procedures. Nomination is the legal process by which
election authorities screen the candidates recommended by the party, approve
their candidacy, and print their names on the ballot paper.
In each election, thousands
of persons could potentially stand for election, but it would be impossible for
voters to make an informed choice among them. Political parties therefore act
as useful and necessary gate-keepers narrowing down the list of candidates to a
small enough pool.
Parties can select their
candidates in many different ways. In numerous cases, the existing legal
framework establishes that political parties should “democratically” elect
their candidates, but this concept is very vague, and there are few if any
applicable legal provisions. Only in a few cases does legislation lay down the
process by which candidates should be selected, and the selection process can
have a direct impact on the depth and breadth of the democratic
process—particularly if a given party’s candidate selection process is
non-transparent [1]
There are two concepts that
are central to the issue of party selection of candidates. One is centralisation ,
that is, what level in the party – local, regional or national –controls the
candidate selection. The second is participation, meaning who –
ordinary members or top leadership – controls the process at the level where the
decision is taken.
Centralisation
In an extremely centralised
system, a national party agency would decide on the candidate selection without
any involvement by the more local branches of the party. At the other end of
the scale would be a system where the most local branches of the party would
decide on candidates without any approval or participation from the national
level. As in so many other fields, the actual practice is usually somewhere
between the two extremes.
In most political parties,
candidates are chosen at the local level even though the national level of the
party has a varying degree of influence. The influence can be pro-active by
encouraging, recommending, or forcing the local branch to chose a particular
candidate – or negative by the national level party reserving the right to veto
candidates. In both cases, the party has to strike a difficult balance between
national level strategies and local sensitivities.
Participation
A situation with extremely
low participation would be if the party leader alone would decide on the
candidates. The other extreme would be if the ordinary members of the party
would decide without any participation or involvement of the party leaders.
The latter can be
illustrated with the case of the United States, where members (or in some
states, all registered voters) can elect the party candidate(s) through direct
votes in primary elections. The election is between all candidates that present
themselves, and the process takes place under the supervision of the government
– largely outside the control by the party organisation. The government also
ensures that the person who won the primary election is the one who will be on
the ballot paper representing the party.
Other parties in different
countries have chosen to have varying degrees of member participation in the
selection process, from party-run primary elections to indirect elections where
party branches send delegates to a national congress.
What determines the
selection process?
Factors such as electoral system,
party ideology, political culture, and the organisation of government have been
thought to have an influence on the centralization and participation in the
candidate selection process. However, there is no evidence that any of them is
decisive.
It would be natural for
national party agencies to be more influential in multi-member district systems
(where more than one person is elected to the legislature from each
constituency), while single-member constituencies would give more power to
local branches.
In the same logic, federal
systems would tend to favour decentralized candidate selection, parties with an
inclusive political ideology would favour participatory selection procedures,
and parties in countries with a hierarchical political culture would foster
non-participatory processes.
However, all these (and
more) criteria are mixed in all political parties, and conclusions are
therefore hard to draw. Not even in cases where legislation stipulates a
particular selection process is it always possible to say if the law has
determined the processes, or if they simply reflect practice.

From these search results, I can see that the process for selecting candidates in the Democratic and Republican parties involves a combination of primaries, caucuses, and conventions. Each state has its own rules for how candidates are chosen, but generally, it's a multi-step process.

First, candidates declare their intention to run for office and file the necessary paperwork, including petitions with a certain number of signatures from registered voters in their party.

Then, there are primary elections or caucuses in each state where party members vote for their preferred candidate. The results of these primaries and caucuses determine how many delegates each candidate gets.

Delegates are representatives who pledge to support a particular candidate at the party's national convention. The candidate who gets the majority of delegates becomes the party's nominee for president.

In some states, delegates are bound to vote for a particular candidate based on the primary or caucus results, while in others, delegates can vote for anyone they choose at the convention.

There's also the concept of superdelegates in the Democratic Party, which are high-ranking party officials who can vote for any candidate they choose, regardless of the primary or caucus results in their state.

Once the delegates are chosen through the primaries and caucuses, they gather at the national convention to officially nominate their party's candidate.

So, in summary, the process involves:

1. Candidates declaring their candidacy and filing paperwork.

2. Primaries and caucuses in each state to determine delegates.

3. Delegates gathering at the national convention to nominate the party's candidate.

Now, considering underrepresentation in Congress, perhaps certain groups are not being encouraged or supported to run for office by the parties, or they may face barriers in the nomination process.

Maybe the party establishment favors certain types of candidates, leading to a lack of diversity in the pool of nominees.

Alternatively, perhaps some groups are less likely to participate in primaries and caucuses, which could affect the candidates who get nominated.

I need to look into whether there are differences in how the Democratic and Republican parties select their candidates and if that affects representation.

Also, I should consider if there are any reforms or proposals to make the candidate selection process more inclusive.

Let me search for information on reforms to increase diversity in candidate selection.

Diversity in Congress: Three Key Takeaways on the Current Makeup - Congress That Works
Jun 29, 2020
Diversity in Congress: Three Key Takeaways on the Current Makeup
By Praveena Javvadi
As Americans look to legislative reform to address systemic racism across the country, one important thing to consider is the impact of diversity within Congress. The 116 th Congress is the most racially diverse Congress to date, with record numbers of Black, Asian American/Pacific Islanders, Native American, and Hispanic representatives. However, it is important to note that despite this increase, Congress is still lagging, and not just among members.
Congressional staff, the advisors to our representatives, are not reflective of the racial diversity of the country either. These staff are often the boots on the ground working behind the scenes to create and pass legislation that impacts the day to day lives of Americans, and therefore, it is critical that they better reflect the diversity of experiences and backgrounds of Americans as a whole.
Last year, the Bipartisan Policy Center hosted an event, “How is Congress Doing? Evaluating the Legislative Branch,” where panelists—including Modernization Committee Chairman Derek Kilmer (D-WA)—analyzed and discussed the legislative branch through multiple lenses, one of which being diversity. Here are some key takeaways from the event regarding diversity in Congress: congressional staff needs to be more diverse, representatives can play a large role in improving diversity amongst staff, and systemic changes to recruitment and retention are essential to improving diversity.
Diversity A mong C ongressional S taff
During the panel, Dr. Elsie Scott, interim president of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, discussed a report from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that highlighted the lack of diversity amongst congressional staff. The report focused on racial diversity amongst the top three staffers in each congressional office, which they identified as the chief of staff, communications director, and policy director.
According to the report, only 13.7% of senior House staff are people of color even though they make up 38% of the U.S. population at large. Importantly, diversity among House staff is most present in offices of nonwhite members of Congress, with the highest being amongst members of the Congressional Black Caucus. On the other hand, white Republican and Democrat representatives all had nearly the same percentage of people of color in their offices’ top staff positions.
Diversity among the top House staffers matters because these staffers have a large impact on the policy being made. In districts where the majority of the population is comprised of people of color, having congressional staff that represent their interests is important.
While a lot of representatives responded to the report by stating that their district staff included people of color, district staff are often less directly connected to the policymaking process in Washington. This is why having diversity in the top three staff positions that the Joint Center’s report highlighted is particularly important.
Diversity A mongst M embers of Congress
As previously mentioned, the 116 th Congress marked the most racially diverse House yet in terms of members. This representation is important for many reasons, but most importantly, one panelist remarked that representatives tend to be more active on issues related to the demographic groups they represent. Even though Democrats are a more racially diverse cohort than Republicans in Congress, emphasizing the need for having diversity across party lines is essential to making an impact on the lives of all Americans, but especially people of color.
Inclusion, Equity, and Retention
Many factors go into building and maintaining a diverse staff on Capitol Hill, and it can be a long climb up the ladder for staff to reach these senior positions. Therefore, offices need to consider how to recruit and retain people of color among the legislative branch workforce. While competitive pay is a factor, as it is in any occupation, success and job satisfaction are also key.
Ensuring that staffers earn a livable wage in DC may be necessary to recruiting a more diverse congressional staff, but this isn’t always easy to achieve. Congress generally pays lower salaries for staff compared to other parts of government, making recruitment and retention of employees who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds even more difficult.   As one panelist recalled, one Senator paid their staff comparable to their home state’s wages instead of DC’s, so as to not appear frivolous to voters. Staff leaving the Hill after short stints for more lucrative jobs in the executive branch or the private sector is just one challenge.  Panelists remarked on how, in their experience, the ways younger staff define success may be a part of the reason for low retention rate. What staff seek may not match up well with the rhythms and cycles of Congress: legislation stalls, members lose reelection, committee chairs get swapped. Minority representation among staff will only be hindered if offices cannot find ways for staff of color to also experience high job satisfaction.
Diversity and inclusion must be a greater priority if Congress is to change the current trends around staff. The report released by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies made congressional offices more aware of their lack of representation, which is necessary when developing intentional efforts aimed at diversity and inclusion. Now it is up to representatives to institute practices in their own offices that ensures diversity among their staff. Building a Congress that works for Americans, requires that congressional offices work to represent all Americans.

Racial and gender diversity in the 117th Congress • OpenSecrets
An OpenSecrets Report
— Sarah Bryner, June 30, 2020
The group of candidates running for Congress in 2020 is the most diverse in recent memory.
However, early OpenSecrets analysis suggests that the 117th Congress will be only slightly more diverse than the 116th. Congress is already less diverse than the U.S. population, with 78 percent of members identifying as white, a much higher percentage than the 60 percent of white Americans. Women hold 24 percent of all congressional seats. Despite the relatively small number of women in Congress, especially women of color, and the underrepresentation of people of color as a whole, the 116th Congress is the most diverse in history.
If candidate recruitment, helped in no small part by organizations working to build a diverse field of candidates 1, is producing a much more diverse field, why are we not seeing those gains translate into a much more diverse — and representative — Congress?
Three major issues explain the disconnect.
First, incumbency reelection rates are high and since the current body of representatives is largely white and largely male, we would expect the following Congress to be the same. Second, when incumbents do retire, creating open seats, voters tend to select candidates who “look like” the member they are replacing. Finally, candidates of color — particularly women of color — face hurdles in fundraising.
Simply put? Congressional elections are not that competitive
OpenSecrets has long documented the sky-high reelection rate of members of Congress — usually over 90 percent. Many factors contribute to these rates, including that incumbents generally have a much easier time raising the millions of dollars necessary to run a successful campaign and that districts have historically been drawn in such a way as to favor incumbents. Additionally, many incumbents run unopposed. But, increasingly, more and more challengers to incumbents are entering the political arena, furthering opportunities to diversify Congress. The 2018 cycle saw a record-setting crop of viable challengers, although few of those challengers were successful — in 2018, as in most election years, the major changes to the racial and gender makeup of Congress came from incumbents retiring, not losing.
The 2020 cycle looks to continue that pattern with a large, and diverse, set of viable challengers from both parties — but the number of challengers is only one part of a much larger story.
As of June 22, or midway through the 2020 primary season, just under half of all states have held primaries. Those states will send 280 lawmakers to the 117th Congress 2, and although the general election has not yet taken place, we already know a great deal about what the 117th Congress will look like based on the racial and gender makeup of the nominees chosen in these primaries. After all, 38 incumbents are running unopposed and some of them faced no primary opposition, either. This is higher than the number of open seats — 25 — where the incumbent is retiring. Additionally, 27 senators represent these states and will be returning because they are not up for reelection.

Type of General Election Contest as of June 22nd, 2020 Congressional Elections
Data from OpenSecrets.org
Number of Races
0 100 80 60 40 20 140 120 Open Seat No Challenger Competitive Safe hold
A Flourish chart
Of the remaining contests, where an incumbent is facing a challenger, only 49 are even mildly competitive, defined here as races where both candidates have raised significant money or the district is marked as competitive by the Cook Political Report. This means that only 30 percent of general election races for those 253 seats will feature a viable challenger. This is only slightly higher than the number of races where incumbents face no challenger at all, guaranteeing their reelection in November.
When combined, the number of open and competitive seats leads to 74 opportunities to realistically increase diversity in Congress. There are certainly cases where a candidate might upset an incumbent in a district that isn’t traditionally competitive but this kind of outcome is rare. One recent example is Rep. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk nation, who unseated the white incumbent Rep. Kevin Yoder in 2018 in a traditionally Republican Kansas district.
If these 74 competitive elections all resulted in a new member of Congress taking office, which they almost certainly will not, that change could indeed be significant for representation. We already know that in 41 of those 74 races regardless of who wins, the member will be white. This won’t result in Congress getting more white, because every one of those 41 seats is currently held by a white person.
Of the 280 districts that have already had their primary, only 31 — 11 percent — could potentially send a member of Congress to the 117th who is a different race than the member serving in the 116th, and in 12 of those districts a member of color could lose to a white person. The main takeaway? In mid-June, around half of all states have held their primaries and in only 19 races (7 percent) is it possible that a BIPOC3 candidate will win a seat currently held by a white person. There is only one contest where it is highly likely that a Latino man (Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM)) will win a seat formerly held by a white person (Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), who is retiring) should Democrats win the general election, as expected.
Increasing representation of women appears to be slightly more plausible. Voters from six of the districts will almost certainly elect a woman to a seat currently held by a man, either because the two candidates chosen in the primary are both women or because the race is not competitive and the candidate from the safe party is a woman. However, it is also possible in another seven races that a woman could lose to a man.
Open seats have always been the best opportunity for representation to change because Congress is generally less diverse than the candidate pool. And, indeed, in nine of the 25 open seats, we know that either the race or the gender of the incoming member will be different than the current member (in all cases, either a woman winning a seat held by a man or a person of color winning a seat held by a white person). In six open seats, we are not certain what will happen due to the primaries headed to runoffs, or the challengers have different racial and gender identities from the retiring incumbent (e.g. a white man retiring and the candidates running to take the seat are a man of color and a white woman). In one case a white woman will take a seat held by a white woman, and in the eight remaining seats, a white man will take a seat currently held by a white man.
Given that so many congressional seats are safe and so many members face little to no opposition, all signs point to the 117th Congress being more diverse than the 116th, but only slightly, despite major gains in representation within the candidate pool. Congress is currently about 78 percent white, and 73 percent of the districts that have already essentially selected their member of Congress will be sending a white person — a percentage likely to increase as runoffs are settled.

Do the parties differ?
Currently, Democrats have a much more diverse group of congressional members than Republicans on both racial and gender measures. Will this change in the 117th Congress?
At first glance, it seems that it is likely that the makeup of the 117th Republican class will be more diverse than its 116th class. The party may even make more gains than Democrats. The 116th class of Republicans currently has 22 women, all of whom are white women apart from Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) who identifies as Latina, as well as six men of color. As of June 18, Republicans have nominated more people of color (30), and women of color (15), than Democrats (25 and 14 respectively) as challengers and in open seats. This could dramatically increase representation within the Republican party in Congress.

Numbers in parentheses are the total number of candidates, including incumbents
However, despite these numbers, it is likely that Democrats actually will likely make more gains for representation than Republicans because their candidates are running in more competitive districts. Roughly 63 percent of these Republican nominees are running in safe Democratic seats, defined here as districts where the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) favors Democrats by a 10-point margin or more 4. Of the remaining nominees, only three (Wesley Hunt (Texas-07 ), Michelle Steele (CA-48 ), and Darrell Issa (CA-50 )) are running in districts where the PVI favors Republicans by more than 1 point.
The Democrats, while fielding fewer people of color as challengers or in open seats so far, see those candidates running in districts they actually have a chance of winning. Only seven (28 percent) are running in districts with the PVI favoring Republicans by 10 points or more, and seven are running in seats where the Democrat is favored by at least a point. Some of this is explained, certainly, by the fact that Democrats tend to perform better than Republicans in districts with fewer white voters. Therefore, Republican BIPOC (Black, Indiginous, and people of color) candidates may come from districts that are unlikely to favor Republicans whereas the opposite is true for Democrats.
How does race affect campaign fundraising and primary outcomes?
What role might campaign finances play in the process of electing more candidates of color to Congress? This is complicated primarily by the fact that different elections cost different amounts of money (due to a variety of factors, including competitiveness of the district, the cost of media buys, whether the candidate is trying to defeat an incumbent, etc.).
In past research, OpenSecrets has shown that candidate race does play a role, although not necessarily a straightforward one, in candidate fundraising success. Lived experiences of candidates also document the difficulties in fundraising for candidates who are not white, who are not male, and who do not have access to wealthy funders and institutions. While we intend to replicate that research this year, an analysis taking into account district-level factors is not yet possible given the limited number of states that have held primaries. However, campaign fundraising totals do tell us something about how race and gender influence a candidate’s electability.
Generally, hundreds of candidates run for federal office, but many of these candidates never get off the ground. Of the 857 candidates running for House and Senate this cycle who raised any money at all, 521 raised more than $100,000, which is not generally enough to win; the average amount raised by primary winners prior to their victory was $1.4 million.
However, despite being a generally insufficient amount to win a primary, $100,000 does indicate that the candidate is legitimate, as opposed to one of the hundreds of people who run but raise little or no money. Of course, a candidate can raise hundreds of thousands of dollars and still have a miniscule chance of winning, but $100,000 is a reasonable threshold to show legitimacy.
To dive into this a little more, we look at woman candidates who lost their primary. A similar proportion of BIPOC and white women won (around 60 percent) their primary contests, although we have already established that many of those candidates are in districts where they are highly unlikely to win the general election. Fifteen BIPOC women and 22 white women raised more than $100,000 but lost in the primary. Of those who lost to non-incumbents, eight of the BIPOC women lost to white candidates, with three of those losing candidates raising more than the winner. This is a different breakdown from the white women who lost in the primary — of the 19 who lost to non-incumbents, only three lost to candidates of color. These numbers suggest that women of color are less likely to beat white candidates than vice versa, although this data is also very preliminary as many primaries have not yet taken place and most fundraising has not yet been completed.
Overall fundraising totals paint an even messier picture. Although we do not like to classify people into only two racial categories (White and BIPOC) due to differences within and among different racial categories and other identity factors, we do so here to account for the advantages white candidates have in congressional contests versus other racial groups. These pre-primary fundraising totals, broken up by whether the candidate was an incumbent, challenger or running in an open seat as well as by gender and race, point to multifaceted trends.
Generally, winning male candidates of color — aside from incumbents — tend to raise more money than winning white candidates in the same type of contests. This does not hold for women, at least so far this cycle. This could be because a successful campaign in districts where a person of color can win might cost more, or because candidates of color need to raise more money than their white counterparts to be successful. In other words, women, especially women of color, may have a harder time raising the money necessary to win a primary.

When it comes to fundraising from political action committees, a more consistent pattern develops. When excluding challengers and open seat candidates, who historically raise little from PACs, incumbent white women raise more from PACs than incumbents from any other racial group. This could be explained by the fact that nearly all incumbent women running as Republicans are white (and many Democrats this cycle have avowed not to take PAC money, although not as many incumbents). However, when looking at Democratic incumbents only, white female candidates still raise more from PACs than do their fellow incumbents of color. Although this is preliminary data, this may be a place where even established politicians of color have a harder time raising money than white incumbents.

What comes next?
Primary season is only half over, and at the time this report was published it appears likely that at least one incumbent, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), is likely to lose his primary to Jamaal Bowman, a Black man. While change in congressional demographics is usually a slow process, surprises do still happen. The challenges to diversifying Congress can seem intractable but change does happen — albeit slowly, as we show here.
Those surprises have some things in common. First, successful challengers are often successful fundraisers. Two of the three successful primary challengers outspent their opponent. Should Bowman defeat Engel, Bowman was outspent, but did raise more money from small donors (donors giving less than $200). The candidate raising more money from small donors does not always win, by any means, but small donations can serve as a proxy for enthusiasm from individual voters — as long as those donors are in the candidate’s district.
Bowman also received a higher proportion of his campaign funds from New York than did Engel, as did the two other candidates who defeated incumbents in the primary so far this cycle (Marie Newman (IL-03 ), and Randy Feenstra (IA-04 )). As former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp ’s ultimately unsuccessful campaign showed in 2018, a candidate can be flooded with money from out of state, but those dollars do not ultimately show that the candidate has support from their own district.
But, in order to win a congressional seat, a candidate must run for that seat. While the number, and diversity, of the challenger classes of 2018 and 2020 is higher, many of these challengers of color are running for seats they are unlikely to win no matter how much money they raise. To ultimately change the demographic makeup of Congress, challengers of color need to be well-funded when they run in close contests — because as it stands now, those are the contests where we may ultimately see change.

3 In this report we chose to use the term BIPOC, meaning Black, Indiginous & People of Color as opposed to POC, meaning People of Color. We do so to highlight the different relationship Black and Indiginious people have to white Americans as informed by current discussions in these communities. In our 2018 paper on race and campaign fundraising, we did find significant differences in fundraising between racial groups and so we believe that BIPOC is a more accurate term for the purposes of this work. We recognize that the terminology on this is evolving.
4 Pennsylvania, which recently redrew its districts, is excluded from all analysis referencing PVI because we cannot find updated PVI assessments for the new districts.
Methodological Notes:
All data in this report are current through the pre-primary filing deadline for the candidate’s race. Racial identification data is collected by Center staff and relies on self-reported race information. More information about this process can be found here. This report reviews data for primaries that occurred before June 22. Races that resulted in runoffs are excluded from most of the analysis unless the runoff will make no difference to the ultimate gender and race of the member of Congress.

“Democrats have crafted a package of unprecedented, bold reforms, which will make the House more accountable, transparent and effective in our work to meet the needs of the American people.  These future-focused proposals reflect our priorities as a Caucus and as a Country – including crushing the coronavirus, addressing economic disparity, combating the climate crisis, advancing inclusion, and promoting integrity in government,” said Pelosi, who was reelected this past Sunday, in a statement .
In addition to permanently establishing an Office of Diversity and Inclusion and other diversity measures, the proposed package would “honor all gender identities by changing pronouns and familial relationships in the House rules to be gender neutral.” Previously, Congress operated under a binary rule that “words importing one gender include the other as well.”
With a record number of LGBTQ+ lawmakers joining the new Congress, the latest rules acknowledge a spectrum of gender identities as well as same-sex relationships. Still, there are no nonbinary representatives in either the House or the Senate, and the nation’s first openly nonbinary lawmaker was elected just last year.

It would also make steps towards diversifying witness panels at committee hearings and framing legislation through the lens of inequity.

In one of the most diverse nations in the world, there was a pressing need in America for a government full of officials that could represent the manifold people of this country without excluding any race, gender or class. We are finally taking steps towards a more diversely representative government after the recent election.
On Nov 6 the most diverse candidates of our generation were elected for various government situations, including: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, Sharice Davids the first openly lesbian Native American woman elected to Congress, Rashida Tlaib one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress and Jared Polis the first openly gay Governor.
This new and diversified group should be considered a welcomed shakeup to the historically stagnant American government as these individuals can bring new ideas and skills to the playing field.
According to a study by the Reflective Democracy Campaign, based off of data from the 2012 and 2014 November elections, the majority of elected government officials, no matter the position, are white men. In further detail, this study reports that 97 percent of all Republican elected officials are white and 76 percent are male and that 79 percent of all Democrats are white and 65 percent are male.
Due to majority of these government officials failing underneath the white male demographic, they sometimes lack the perspectives of others.
A perfect example of this lack of understanding can be seen in a 2012 interview with Todd Atkins, an American politician who is a former Representative for Missouri’s 2nd congressional district, discussing his view on abortion. In his interview Atkins stated that it’s “really rare” for women to become pregnant from rape and that “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”
Our democracy can now be a more appropriate and understanding voice for the people of the United States that are much more than just one type of race, class or gender.
When more demographics are represented in our government, different perspectives, beliefs and ideas can be shared, and later included in new laws, amendments and propositions.
Classroom.synonym.com reports that diversity in government brings forth a multitude of benefits, including: a broader frame of reference, better politicians, enhanced service to constituents and varied skills and passions.
Sciencenordic.com also reports on the benefits of diversity, as they share that diversity leads to nurtures social coherence, increases mutual team help and support, gives individuals the chance to learn and experience more and lead to heightened communication.
Due to the diversity that is entering politics, there is a wider perspective from all of these diverse people to come together collaborate. These qualified individuals all come from very different backgrounds, have different experiences and therefore can provide a different approach that our nation needs.
One other benefit of a more diverse government in the better representation of our diverse nation.
There are eight different races, two different population characteristics and three different age brackets are recognized by the United States Census. There are 135 different nations represented in the U.S. according to 2017 American FactFinder. There are 24 genders according to The PBHS Closet.
With a nation that is more accepting than ever before, these figures are finally stepping forward in government, and the change can be nothing other than progressive and beneficial. This is what it means to be an American.
These statistics truly represent the diverse nature of the United States and arguable showcase the need for a diverse government that can accurately represent us.
