I've been hearing a lot about Extended Reality, or XR, lately, especially in the context of business. It seems like more and more companies are starting to use it, but I'm not entirely sure why. So, I need to figure out why XR has become more common in the business world recently.

First off, I should probably understand what XR is. I know that VR stands for Virtual Reality, AR is Augmented Reality, and MR is Mixed Reality. So, XR is like an umbrella term that covers all these technologies. But why would businesses be interested in using any of these?

Let me think about some possible reasons. One thing that comes to mind is that XR can provide new ways for businesses to interact with their customers. For example, maybe companies are using AR to let customers visualize products before buying them. Like, trying on clothes or seeing how furniture would look in their home before making a purchase. That could enhance the shopping experience and lead to more sales.

Another possibility is that XR is being used for training purposes. I've heard that some industries, like aviation or healthcare, use VR simulations to train their employees in a safe and controlled environment. This can be especially useful for high-risk scenarios where real-world training might be too dangerous or expensive.

Also, perhaps XR is being utilized for remote work and collaboration. With the rise of remote work, companies are looking for ways to bring their teams together virtually. Maybe XR platforms allow for more immersive and interactive virtual meetings, making remote collaboration more effective.

Moreover, XR might be used for marketing and advertising. Immersive experiences can capture people's attention and create memorable brand interactions. For instance, creating a VR campaign that lets users explore a product or service in a unique way.

I should also consider whether there have been recent technological advancements that have made XR more accessible and affordable for businesses. Maybe the hardware has become cheaper, or the software development tools have improved, making it easier for companies to implement XR solutions.

Additionally, the pandemic might have played a role in accelerating the adoption of XR technologies. With many people working from home, there may have been an increased need for virtual solutions to maintain business operations and customer engagement.

Let me try to organize these thoughts. It seems like there are several factors contributing to the increased prevalence of XR in business:

1. Enhanced customer experiences through visualization and interaction.

2. Effective training solutions in safe, simulated environments.

3. Improved remote work and collaboration capabilities.

4. Innovative marketing and advertising opportunities.

5. Advancements in technology making XR more accessible and affordable.

6. The impact of the pandemic accelerating the adoption of virtual solutions.

I should probably look into each of these areas a bit more to see which ones are most significant and backed by evidence.

First, let's consider customer experience. I recall seeing examples of AR apps that allow users to see how furniture would look in their room before buying it. Companies like IKEA have been using this technology for a while now. Similarly, there are beauty brands that offer virtual try-on features for makeup products. So, it's clear that XR is being used to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

Next, training and education. Industries like aviation and healthcare have indeed been using VR for simulations. For example, pilots can train in VR cockpits, and medical students can practice surgeries in a virtual environment. This not only saves costs but also allows for repeated practice without real-world risks.

Regarding remote work, with the shift to remote environments, tools like virtual meeting platforms have become essential. Some companies are experimenting with XR to create more immersive meeting spaces where participants can interact in a virtual office or boardroom. This could potentially improve communication and teamwork among remote employees.

In terms of marketing, XR offers a way to create unique and engaging experiences that can set a brand apart. For instance, car manufacturers might create VR experiences that allow users to "test drive" a vehicle virtually. This can be a powerful tool for capturing audience attention and building brand loyalty.

Now, considering technological advancements, it's likely that improvements in hardware and software have made XR more feasible for businesses. For example, the development of lightweight VR headsets and more powerful smartphones has made XR more accessible. Additionally, advances in AI and machine learning might be enhancing the capabilities of XR applications.

Lastly, the pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated the adoption of virtual technologies across various sectors. With social distancing measures in place, businesses had to find new ways to operate remotely, and XR provided some solutions in this regard.

To get a better understanding, maybe I should look up some statistics or industry reports on XR adoption in business. That could give me some concrete data to support these points.

Top VR Stats for Your Virtual Reality Strategy
June 1, 2021
Strategy
The days of clunky, complicated VR headsets are long gone. Today’s customers are increasingly gaining access to sleeker, more immersive VR experiences. Over the last couple of years, VR potential has grown so dramatically that we’re beginning to see the technology in all areas of life. Today, you can shop for kitchens in VR, go on a VR vacation, or interact with colleagues through a headset in your home office.
In 2020, the VR market had a value of around $17.25 billion according to Mordor Intelligence. By 2026, the experts believe it will be worth around $184.66 billion, representing a CAGR of 48.7%.
VR opportunities are now bigger and more exciting than ever. We believe in VR to enhance our interactions with consumers, strengthen collaboration and build new ideas.
The following virtual reality statistics should give you an insight into the potential of VR for the future of the enterprise.
Building a Business Case for Virtual Reality
VR isn’t just a sci-fi concept or a strategy for gaming hardware anymore. Though a significant portion of the virtual reality market still belongs to the consumer space, demand for this kind of content is growing. Currently, research suggests that around 58.9 million people will be using VR at least once per month by the end of this year.

Digital transformation, as the term implies, relies on the use of new tech to modify key business processes and even existing services. There are a variety of technologies that companies are currently using in coming up with digital strategies. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are at the forefront of the push for digitalization. You need only to see artificial intelligence stats to affirm this. Meanwhile, check out the digital transformation technologies statistics listed below to learn more about these techs.
58% of companies with high digital maturity offer digitally connected products, while only 17% of lower-maturity companies said the same (Deloitte, 2020).
The implementation of digital technologies can help accelerate progress towards enterprise goals such as financial returns, workforce diversity, and environmental targets by 22% (Deloitte, 2020).
In fact, 69% of higher maturity companies are using digital technologies to cut carbon emissions, while 58% of lower-maturity companies are using them to lower consumption of natural resources (Deloitte, 2020).
The most successful organizations that dealt with the pandemic reported a variety of technology-related capabilities. 75% said they had the ability to fill tech jobs during the crisis, 67% said they were more advanced in using technology than their peers before the crisis, and 56% said they were the first movers in experimenting with digital technologies during the crisis (McKinsey, 2020).

Seventy percent of such initiatives have been found to fail to reach their goals. The problem is seen to lie in the management of such strategies. Of course, digital asset management software benefits can help address these complications. But then again, tech managers often overlook factors such as business strategy, employee concerns, and customer experience, resulting in less than ideal outcomes. Proper management leads to excellent results; just take a look at the following stats that prove this point.

Workforce and Digital Transformation Statistics
Digital transformation is known to impact employees directly. This influence can either be positive or negative, depending on one’s standpoint. On the lighter side, digital transformation cannot occur without employees, which also entails the acquisition of highly-coveted digital skills. On the other hand, digitization is also seen to affect the existing job market adversely. Digitization has also paved the way for the creation of corporate roles that call for a different type of skillset. For example, the career path of digital project managers veers away from conventional project management roles.
71% of executives say the workforce is either very or essential to their digital transformation strategy (Industry Week, 2018).
Meanwhile, in recent years, 89% of heads of IT said they increasingly need to rely on advisors in order to navigate new technologies, processes, and methodologies (CIO, 2020).

Technology Adoption Statistics
Digital transformation will not be possible without technology adoption. Slow technology adoption could prove to be a problem as many businesses have admitted to being slow in technology adoption. However, many companies claim to be comfortable with digital transformation and technology use, which sets the ideal condition for digitization. Check out the statistics below to know more.
15% of enterprises are using AI as of 2018 (CMO, 2018).
31% of enterprises are seen to adopt AI in 2019 (CMO, 2018).
76.6% of businesses say their relationship with technology and digital transformation is generally average or above average (Futurum, 2018).
IT, customer care, and marketing departments have been excelling in technology adoption (Futurum, 2018).
HR, manufacturing, and legal are considered most likely to adapt to technological change (Futurum, 2018).
However, as of 2020, 30% of companies are still considered laggards in technology adoption and innovation. (Accenture, 2020).
It’s estimated that companies accelerated their adoption of digital technologies for customer and supply-chain interactions by 3 to 4 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic (McKinsey, 2020).
When the pandemic hit, North America took the largest leap in digitization with 60% of its products and services now fully or partially digitized (McKinsey, 2020).
72% of companies who were first in their industries to experiment with digital technologies during the pandemic reported having very effective responses to COVID-19 (McKinsey, 2020).
25% of organizations worldwide have adopted cloud-distributed technology on a large scale (KPMG, 2020).
Respondents said their companies acted 20-25 times faster than expected to a range of COVID-19 related changes. In the case of remote working, companies acted 40 times faster to put digital tools in place for remote work (McKinsey, 2020).
No Stopping Digital Transformation
Based on the data and statistics we’ve seen, there is no stopping the transformation of business and work to digital platforms. It was even expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic and many of the changes on how we work and how businesses conduct operations will likely remain even after governments are able to contain the health crisis.
The use of digital technology has also resulted in the creation of new corporate roles that require digital skills. Given these developments, practicality dictates that adoption be immediate.
The statistics we have presented are not only meant to inform. These can likewise be used in coming up with your digital business strategy or beef up your existing one.
In this case, investing in new technologies like artificial intelligence, business intelligence, and the best digital asset management software solutions is highly recommended. It can also help to have an agile project management software to help you oversee tasks.
But before you go around shopping for a new platform for your business, consider your digital strategy and what you want the tool to accomplish.
Also, get to know its features, pricing, and overall value for money. Observe these practices and you’ll be on your way to having a robust digital business strategy.

Takeaway
Has VR reached maturity? The short answer is no.
Although there is no evidence that this immersive technology has gone mainstream, the statistics above point to a changing landscape. Currently, some businesses are at the fore of VR experimentation, but many are still hesitant to commit fully.
However, all is not gloom and doom, and businesses should endeavor to break the barriers of VR adoption to keep pace with consumer interests. For example, there is a need to imbue VR technology with control and convenience, implement sound user experience design, and counter the rising smartphone competition. Until then, leveraging the massive opportunities of this technology will remain elusive.
Virtual Reality User Statistics
As mentioned earlier, when VR technology first came, some overhyped it. On the other hand, many underestimated the emerging technology, and it’s no surprise, then, that VR growth stalled. That said, since its inception, the technology has created a digital imprint that has had a lasting impression on the consumer.
Until recently, consumers were dying with the hope that the technology will soon change the way they shop in-store and do things online. Finally, the dawn seems to be at hand, and the roller coaster-like hype series has giving birth to real VR experiences. It’s only the beginning, but the real-world usefulness of VR has prompted an increasing user base.
General User Statistics
According to eMarketer, the number of VR users in the US is 57.4 million while the number of AR users is 90.9 million (eMarketer, 2020).

Advertising is the leading segment for AR revenues, raking in $1.4 billion in 2020 (ARtillery Intelligence, 2020).
Takeaway
Virtual reality has taken off from the novelty phase, and it’s starting to show strong signs of going mainstream. However, this immersive technology has a long way to go before its transformative power can effectively bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping, as many anticipated. As it stands, there is evidence of the use of VR for furniture and room design shopping.
Do VR benefits outweigh the risks? It’s still early to speculate.
However, it’s time businesses trashed the fear they have about implementing this technology. It’s true that, for a long time, consumers have been hesitant about embracing VR technology. But that seems to be changing, and fast. Do not wait to jump the bandwagon when VR goes mainstream. Do it now. IKEA, Wayfair, and Lowe’s have implemented the VR experience, and the benefits are there for everyone to see.
Virtual Reality Usage Statistics
The growing virtual reality user base is partly attributed to the use of VR outside the entertainment and gaming industry. The technology is beginning to catch on in both the enterprise and commercial environments. The statistics below affirm its growing influence.

Retail
The online retail space has been crippled by the inability to try on new technologies like VR.
On the other hand, as online retail grapples with the skepticism, the brick-and-mortar retailers, especially those in the fashion and apparel industries, have gone all out to implement the VR experience. Mainly, in-store retailers are determined to use VR technology to repress the home-try-on effect, which has been a vexing problem. The use of VR, coupled with a robust apparel management software, has been a revelation for retailers in this space.
Retail is seen to deliver the biggest commercial investment in AR/VR technology in 2024 at $7.3 billion (IDC, 2020).

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why has extended reality (XR) recently become more common in the business world?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what XR is. From what I recall, XR is an umbrella term that includes virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). So, when we talk about XR in business, we're probably talking about how companies are using these technologies to enhance their operations, customer experiences, or maybe even internal processes.

I think the best way to approach this is to think about the benefits that XR can bring to businesses. Let me brainstorm some ideas. For starters, XR can provide immersive experiences for customers, which can be really engaging and memorable. For example, imagine being able to try on clothes or see how furniture would look in your home before actually buying them, all through an AR app on your smartphone. That sounds pretty convenient and could lead to higher customer satisfaction and potentially more sales.

Another area where XR is being used is in training and education. I've heard that some industries, like aviation and healthcare, use VR simulations to train their employees in a safe and controlled environment. This can be especially useful for high-risk scenarios where real-world training might be too dangerous or expensive. So, XR can help businesses save costs and time in training while ensuring that their employees are well-prepared.

Also, with the rise of remote work, especially due to the pandemic, companies are looking for ways to bring their teams together virtually. Maybe XR is being used to create more immersive and interactive virtual meeting spaces. That could help improve communication and collaboration among remote team members.

Moreover, XR can be a powerful tool for marketing and advertising. Immersive experiences can capture people's attention and create memorable brand interactions. For instance, creating a VR campaign that allows users to explore a product or service in a unique way could differentiate a brand from its competitors.

Now, I should consider whether there have been recent technological advancements that have made XR more accessible and affordable for businesses. Maybe the hardware has become cheaper, or the software development tools have improved, making it easier for companies to implement XR solutions.

Additionally, the pandemic might have played a role in accelerating the adoption of XR technologies. With many people working from home, there may have been an increased need for virtual solutions to maintain business operations and customer engagement.

Let me try to organize these thoughts. It seems like there are several factors contributing to the increased prevalence of XR in business:

1. Enhanced customer experiences through visualization and interaction.

2. Effective training solutions in safe, simulated environments.

3. Improved remote work and collaboration capabilities.

4. Innovative marketing and advertising opportunities.

5. Advancements in technology making XR more accessible and affordable.

6. The impact of the pandemic accelerating the adoption of virtual solutions.

I should probably look into each of these areas a bit more to see which ones are most significant and backed by evidence.

First, customer experience. I recall seeing examples of AR apps that allow users to see how furniture would look in their room before buying it. Companies like IKEA have been using this technology for a while now. Similarly, there are beauty brands that offer virtual try-on features for makeup products. So, it's clear that XR is being used to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

Next, training and education. Industries like aviation and healthcare have indeed been using VR for simulations. For example, pilots can train in VR cockpits, and medical students can practice surgeries in a virtual environment. This not only saves costs but also allows for repeated practice without real-world risks.

Regarding remote work, with the shift to remote environments, tools like virtual meeting platforms have become essential. Some companies are experimenting with XR to create more immersive meeting spaces where participants can interact in a virtual office or boardroom. This could potentially improve communication and teamwork among remote employees.

In terms of marketing, XR offers a way to create unique and engaging experiences that can set a brand apart. For instance, car manufacturers might create VR experiences that allow users to "test drive" a vehicle virtually. This can be a powerful tool for capturing audience attention and building brand loyalty.

Now, considering technological advancements, it's likely that improvements in hardware and software have made XR more feasible for businesses. For example, the development of lightweight VR headsets and more powerful smartphones has made XR more accessible. Additionally, advances in AI and machine learning might be enhancing the capabilities of XR applications.

Lastly, the pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated the adoption of virtual technologies across various sectors. With social distancing measures in place, businesses had to find new ways to operate remotely, and XR provided some solutions in this regard.

To get a better understanding, maybe I should look up some statistics or industry reports on XR adoption in business. That could give me some concrete data to support these points.

So, I'll do a search for "XR adoption in business statistics."

[Search query: XR adoption in business statistics]

Okay, I've got some search results here. Let's see what's relevant.

First, there's an article from XR Today titled "Virtual Reality Statistics to Know in 2021." That seems promising. Let's check it out.

According to this article, the VR market had a value of around $17.25 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $184.66 billion by 2026, with a CAGR of 48.7%. That's a huge growth projection, which suggests that businesses are increasingly seeing the value in VR technology.

The article also mentions that over 58.9 million people are expected to use VR at least once a month by the end of 2021. That's a significant user base, which can attract more businesses to invest in VR experiences.

Moreover, the number of VR startups has increased by more than 14% in less than a year, and this growth is expected to continue. The pandemic seems to have played a role in this acceleration, as businesses looked for ways to connect and operate remotely.

Another interesting point is that between 2020 and 2027, the CAGR of the VR market is expected to be around 21.6%, with growth across various industries like retail and healthcare.

The article also states that currently, 26 million VR and AR headsets are owned by private consumers, and demand for VR headsets is预计在接下来的五年内（到2025年）增加近八倍。这可能是因为疫情的影响，人们更倾向于在家中寻求娱乐和连接。

此外，有数据显示，2020年，五分之一的美国公民表示他们已经使用过VR头显，这一比例比2019年提高了3个百分点。其中，55%的用户对体验表示中等或极度满意。这表明用户对VR技术的接受度和满意度正在提高。

经济学家认为，VR和AR技术将创造新的经济机会，仅在这个十年内，预计将出现2300万个与VR相关的工作岗位。这显示了该行业的发展潜力和对劳动力市场的影响。

然而，高-end VR应用用户的硬件成本是限制VR更快普及的主要因素。这可能意味着，随着硬件成本的下降，更多企业可能会采用XR技术。

从全球范围来看，中国在2020年的VR/AR支出最高，达到58亿美元，其次是美国（51亿美元）、西欧（33亿美元）和日本（18亿美元）。这表明亚洲市场，特别是中国市场，对XR技术的接受度和投资力度较大。

另外，到2025年，预计有1.71亿人将以某种方式使用VR，这个数字来自2019年的VR头显出货数据。

有趣的是，53%的AR和VR用户认为AR更有可能首先进入主流市场。尽管在尝试头显之前，人们曾认为VR会更快发展，但实际体验后，看法发生了变化。

根据普华永道（PwC）的研究，VR/AR的预期经济影响到2030年可能达到1.5万亿美元。这是一个巨大的数字，表明XR技术对全球经济的潜在贡献。

最后，福布斯世界最有价值品牌榜单中有75%的品牌已经以某种形式投资了AR/VR体验。这说明领先的跨国公司已经认识到XR技术的重要性，并将其纳入其营销和业务策略中。

除了这些统计数据，我还想了解具体行业如何利用XR技术。比如，在制造业中，XR可以用于培训、维护和设计；在房地产领域，可以用于虚拟看房；在教育领域，可以提供沉浸式学习环境等。

我再找一篇关于XR在不同行业的应用的文章。

[搜索查询：XR industry applications]

有一篇来自Statista的研究报告，题目是“Extended Reality (XR): AR, VR, and MR”。这份报告提供了关于XR市场的详细信息，包括市场大小、设备发货量、关键公司以及消费趋势等。

根据Statista的数据，全球XR市场在2021年至2028年间预计将以显著的速度增长。报告中还列出了各个行业的XR应用，如医疗保健、教育、制造业和智慧城市等。
