I'm trying to figure out why a community might not be involved in the research process. So, first off, I need to understand what is meant by "community involvement in research." I think it refers to including members of a specific group or community in the planning, conducting, or dissemination of research that affects them. It's like making sure that the people who are going to be impacted by the research have a say in how it's done.

But why might they not be involved? There could be several reasons. Let me try to brainstorm some possibilities.

First, maybe the researchers don't realize the importance of community involvement. They might be so focused on their hypotheses and methods that they don't see why they should bring in community members. They might think that it's enough for them to decide what's best without consulting others.

Second, there could be logistical challenges. Involving a community might require more time and resources. For example, holding meetings in the community, translating materials into different languages, or providing accommodations for participants with disabilities. If the research team is short on time or funds, they might skip this step.

Third, perhaps there's a power imbalance. The researchers might come from a more privileged background and feel that they know what's best for the community, without really listening to the community's perspectives. This can lead to paternalistic attitudes where they don't see the need to involve the community in decision-making.

Fourth, language barriers could be a issue. If the researchers and the community speak different languages, communication might be difficult, making involvement challenging.

Fifth, maybe the community itself isn't interested or doesn't see the value in participating. They might be skeptical of research or feel that their input won't make a difference.

Sixth, there could be trust issues. If the community has been exploited or mistreated in the past by researchers, they might be reluctant to get involved again.

Seventh, sometimes research topics might be sensitive or controversial, and communities might not want to engage with them for various reasons, such as cultural taboos or fear of stigma.

Eighth, perhaps the research design doesn't allow for community involvement. For example, in some experimental studies, it's crucial to maintain objectivity, and involving the community might introduce biases.

Ninth, there might be legal or ethical restrictions that prevent community involvement in certain types of research.

Tenth, researchers might lack the skills or training to effectively involve communities in their work. They might not know how to facilitate community engagement or how to incorporate community feedback into their research.

These are just some initial thoughts. I need to think deeper and maybe look for some references to support these ideas.

Wait, maybe I should start by understanding the benefits of community involvement in research. If I know why it's important, then I can better understand why it might be missing.

So, why is community involvement in research important?

Well, for one, it can lead to more relevant and culturally appropriate research questions and methods. Communities can provide insights that researchers might not be aware of, especially if they're outsiders.

Second, involving the community can increase the acceptance and uptake of research findings. If people feel that they had a part in the research, they might be more likely to trust and use the results.

Third, community involvement can help ensure that the research is conducted ethically, respecting the rights and dignity of the community members.

Fourth, it can build capacity within the community by training members in research methods and empowering them to take charge of their own development.

Given these benefits, why might researchers still avoid community involvement?

Perhaps they don't see these benefits or don't prioritize them. Maybe they are more focused on achieving their academic goals or getting publications out quickly.

Alternatively, maybe there are institutional barriers. Funding agencies might not require or encourage community involvement, so researchers don't bother with it.

Also, there could be methodological concerns. Some research designs might not lend themselves well to community participation, especially in areas like basic science or theoretical research.

Moreover, there might be philosophical differences. Some researchers might believe in objectivity and see community involvement as introducing subjectivity into the research process.

I should also consider the perspective of the community. Maybe they are busy with their own lives and don't have the time or resources to participate in research projects.

Or perhaps they have had negative experiences with researchers in the past, leading to mistrust and reluctance to engage.

Additionally, there might be language or cultural barriers that make communication difficult, deterring both parties from attempting involvement.

I think it's also possible that researchers simply don't know how to involve communities effectively. They might not have been trained in community-based research methods or participatory approaches.

Furthermore, there could be power dynamics at play. Researchers might hold more power due to their expertise and funding, which could discourage community members from asserting their input or opinions.

Another factor could be the perception of ownership. Researchers might view the research project as their own, and including the community could be seen as diluting their control or authorship.

Moreover, there might be confidentiality or privacy concerns that limit community involvement, especially in sensitive research areas.

I should also think about the stage of research. Maybe community involvement is more likely in certain phases, like during needs assessment or intervention development, but less so in data collection or analysis.

Additionally, the nature of the research question might influence whether community involvement is sought. For example, in applied research aimed at solving community problems, involvement is probably more common than in purely theoretical or foundational research.

I need to organize my thoughts better. Let me categorize the possible reasons into researcher-related factors, community-related factors, and systemic or structural factors.

Starting with researcher-related factors:

1. Lack of awareness about the importance of community involvement.

2. Perceived difficulties or barriers, such as time, resources, or logistical challenges.

3. Philosophical or methodological objections to involving the community in research.

4. Lack of training or skills in community engagement methods.

5. Desire to maintain control over the research process and findings.

6. Belief that community input could bias the research.

7. Pressure to publish quickly, leaving no room for community consultation.

Next, community-related factors:

1. Lack of interest or perceived relevance of the research to the community.

2. Past negative experiences with researchers, leading to mistrust.

3. Language or cultural barriers that make participation difficult.

4. Time constraints or competing priorities for community members.

5. Sensitivity or controversy around the research topic.

Finally, systemic or structural factors:

1. Funding agencies not requiring or incentivizing community involvement.

2. Institutional policies or cultures that do not support participatory research.

3. Legal or ethical restrictions that limit community involvement in certain research areas.

4. Limited recognition or reward for community-engaged research in academia.

I think this is a pretty comprehensive list, but I should check if there's any literature on this topic to see what experts have to say.

Maybe I should look up some articles on community involvement in research, particularly focusing on barriers or challenges to implementation.

Let me try formulating a search query for this.

I could search for something like "barriers to community involvement in research" or "challenges in implementing community-based research."

Let me try that.

Difficulties and barriers to involvement
There are many reasons why people may find it difficult or challenging to get involved in health research. These may include personal difficulties (physical and/or emotional), organisational barriers (such as timing and location of meetings), language barriers, and the way researchers think or act sometimes. Solutions to some of these problems are explored in ‘ Factors which make it easier to get involved ’.
Finding out about opportunities
An important issue is raising awareness of health research and making sure that learning about involvement opportunities isn’t just a matter of chance or accident, as it often seems to be. (See also ‘ Path to involvement – how did people find out about it? ’ and ‘ Raising awareness of opportunities for involvement and finding new volunteers ’). For example, Francesco wanted to see opportunities being advertised to recruit a more diverse range of people (see also ‘ Representing a range of views and experiences: diversity ’).
There is a lack of understanding among the public about health research and little awareness of opportunities for involvement.

On the other hand, more formal recruitment processes could be a barrier to some people. Beryl was put off applying for something because ‘you had to fill in this really complicated CV and get references and I thought, “Well, I don’t know. I’m doing this all voluntary”, so I didn’t bother.’
Once people are involved, early experiences can be daunting. Roger A said it could be off-putting to some people but he saw it as a challenge; he said, ‘Perhaps I’m a congenital anarchist, I don’t know.’ But challenging is not always easy. As Derek pointed out, ‘If you’re troublesome, the doors can easily close.’
Entering a room full of senior academics can be intimidating, but they may not mean to exclude you. Derek offers advice on how to break the ice and ask questions.

Training, support and feedback
There was general agreement that it was unreasonable to get people along to a meeting or invite them to review or comment on a document without any training in how to do it, or at least clear guidance about what was expected (see also ‘ What activities and task are involved ’). Kath thought that lack of clear guidance also created problems for researchers. She said, ‘If people have a very clear idea of what would be really useful for them to do, they will cooperate with that and do it. I think the danger of the hobby horse riding is most apparent where there is not a clear guide to what is wanted from people and what they can usefully contribute, and then they tend to fall back on what they always say.’ Jennifer, Catherine and Helen all commented on how demotivating it can be not to get feedback on what you have contributed and whether it’s been useful.
Helen doesn’t know if her involvement has made a difference. If people don’t get feedback on how they’ve contributed they may not feel motivated to continue.

Jargon and feeling excluded
A common problem when people first start getting involved is the use of technical language and jargon, acronyms and abbreviations (shortened versions of organisations names, drug names or even surgical procedures). Sometimes this is to be expected; as Charles said, ‘You have to accept that a lot of this jargon is shorthand and if we're going to have a discussion on a research proposal and not die of malnutrition, we need some kind of shorthand.’ But people complained that a lack of explanation of terms used could leave them feeling left out of the discussion; providing a ‘jargon buster’ glossary and banning the use of acronyms in meetings can help. As Andrew suggests, this sense of isolation can be made worse if you are the only lay person present in a meeting, or if the meeting is badly chaired so people don’t get a chance to speak or ask questions.
It can be difficult to contribute effectively to a scientific meeting if it is not well chaired.

Trying to take part remotely (by phone or in writing) can be even more isolating, even if for some people it’s physically more convenient. Andrew commented that if allowing people to feel ‘isolated and threatened’ was ‘a sure way of losing people’. Common problems with telephone conferences included background noise, technology problems, being unable to follow the conversation and finding it hard to contribute. Good chairing is essential to overcome some of these problems. Of course they will affect anyone joining by telephone, including other researchers, but they may feel more confident to chip in.
Teleconferences can be really hard to take part in. Hazel once couldn’t hear anything because someone was eating a packet of crisps near the phone.

I think there is an effort made to respect, and there is a lot of lip service paid to it… I mean I'm paid to attend meetings and kind of paid quite well and, as I said, I don't think I'm good value for money because those aren't particularly good meetings for me, and not for them either, they don't benefit particularly from me, but we have parents who ring in to those meetings, who live in other parts of the country, don't say a word all the way through and occasionally somebody will say, "Oh is that person still on the phone?" because they've forgotten and they'd all gone off to have lunch and left this person without actually saying. Or what's happened to me – I was on the phone to a meeting in Liverpool for a steering group, and somebody sat next to the telephone and ate a bag of crisps and I couldn't hear a thing that was going on [laughs], there was terrible loud crackles. And there's a limit to how much your dignity will allow you to sit at home saying, "Is somebody eating crisps there?" …Let alone say which page of the papers that you're on.    Or rustle the papers very loudly near the telephone so you couldn't hear it even if they did tell you.

Living with illness and caring responsibilities
The nature of health research is that many of the people who want to get involved may have continuing health problems or caring responsibilities which affect what they are able to do. Talking about research into serious illness can also stir up strong emotions. Elsewhere we explore in more detail some of the personal costs of involvement. The need for preparation and support for dealing with any emotional situations which may arise is discussed in ‘ Training and learning ’, though many people won’t find this a problem.
As a single parent, Catherine’s caring responsibilities limit what she can take on.

Relationship with researchers and practical organisational issues
Many people had developed strong partnerships with researchers and really enjoyed the relationship. They felt valued and listened to, and loved hearing about the latest research. However, if involvement is done badly, there is a risk that people will be put off and give up. Kath encouraged researchers to be more thoughtful about the needs of the people they ask to get involved, and to ask for feedback on what their experience has been. Marney said it was frustrating, irritating and rude when people didn’t acknowledge her input. In ‘ The costs of being involved and payment ’ we look at what people said about their financial needs, but researchers also need to think about other organisational issues such as how travel is arranged; timing and location of meetings; accessible venues; catering; timing of deadlines for comments on documents; how and when to get documents to people (by post, by email); making sure people don’t have to wait a long time for expenses to be paid back. (See also ‘ Representing a range of views and experiences: diversity ’). Having the support of an effective involvement coordinator can be a real help, and it was often pointed out that organisations need to set aside a proper budget, so they can fund involvement early on, before a study has been funded.
Researchers need to think about how to include a wider range of people. Payment is one way to support people with different needs.

I've seen several people who are very good and who left because they weren't actually involved. They thought that being on the committee they were going to get kind of research projects to look at and be involved in and quite reasonably they weren't, probably because there weren't any that anybody thought were suitable, and they have gone and I think it's, you know it's really bad for them in lots of ways to, to feel that they're not, that they're not being useful especially after doing training and going through various conferences and things. I, as I say, I just think there is an afterthought, a very worthy afterthought but an afterthought nonetheless and it's… and people are kind of quite easily disappointed if they feel that they aren't actually participating in the way that they hoped to.

One of the things I find very difficult is that in some ways if you're being the patient in this kind of situation then you're almost there to be stroppy. You're there to be challenging and if you're not being challenging you're kind of not doing your job. And that’s not of course entirely true.
But compared with my previous life when I was, didn’t even talk about my condition at work, it's tougher. It's a more; it's confrontation in a weird way because you still don’t want to be confrontational. You don’t want to be an arse, but you are – you know that if you let something slide you're not doing your job. So there's times when I've had to use quite personal examples to get my point across and that’s really exhausting.
Occasionally people felt researchers’ behaviour was not just thoughtless but actively hostile or dismissive, or arrogant. Dave G suspected some researchers were more hostile than they felt able to say; ‘Let's face it, I mean, who's going to put their hand up and say, "We don't want patients"? You know, they're not going to do that, are they?’ Feeling that researchers saw involvement as a tick-box exercise they didn’t really believe in was frustrating and at times upsetting.
These days Tom feels his views are actively asked for and it’s not a tick-box exercise, but ‘there’s still dinosaurs out there’.

Most people felt this was becoming less of a problem over time (see ‘ Changing attitudes to involvement over the years ’), but there was also some worry that pressure from funding organisations could be making the situation worse. As Andrew said, when researchers fill in a grant application form, ‘You've got to tick the box because you won't get the money at all if you don't… And that's the real worry because then my experience has been that researchers are rushing around finding, retrospectively, some engagement with patients, and that's not terribly helpful.’
There were mixed views on whether the younger generation of researchers or more senior investigators understood involvement better; either way, people felt the attitude of individual researchers was crucial in promoting or resisting involvement. Dave G suspected some patients had been less supportive and encouraging towards academic partners than he had, and were ‘frightened of putting the wrong foot forward.’ Marney added that people might be reluctant to say anything critical while they or a family member were still having treatment.
Derek reflects on levels of hostility, reluctance or support among different researchers – and on unrealistic expectations from patients.

It's so difficult for any professional group no matter which profession. They, build round them a set of morals, cultures, language, attitude and values, that are often exclusively to that group, they form unions and associations. They have to develop their own ways of doing things and qualifications they maintain. So anybody who tries to come in from the outside is obviously met with a sort of barrier of going through. So there are two barriers – would we be able to break through and into that community? I've got to say, in hand on heart, that, yes, we met some individuals who were sort of slightly cynical, but I would say the majority – no - a strong minority were for us, a large majority were, "Well we'll give it time because if it goes, it goes and, you know, tough," but weren’t anti it. A few were highly sceptical and would voice their concerns and worries because, rightfully, if you've got one or two loud patients saying something, how representative, how can they represent others? So that's a good point that was made. And then there were a few that you just went, "Well actually, you just don't like me". But actually, I think they probably just didn't like me rather than like involvement. But actually they were, they were the minority.
The other barrier I would talk about is that the barrier of some patients who came in with unrealistic expectations. They either wanted one particular thing changed or they'd had a bad experience and they wanted a - So, but actually, what was interesting was once we explained what we were trying to achieve, how we were going about it, and the methods we were using, those people just, they just all went, "Well actually now we're part of the camp, we'll sign up to that," as most people do. You don't find that – things are not going to change tomorrow, but if you can see the possibility that things are going to change in the future, you’d come along with it. So, even people I was told were difficult and troublesome, they were just, they were great, they were smart. And they'd only be troublesome because they couldn't go through the door. So, they just found that they were battering against a, with a ram against the door. Because when we said, "Come in," they went, "Oh what, what?" And so, so those two were the main two barriers. But the other thing I would say is that in this, if you want to create change, you need not just the group who are coming in from the outside to create change. You've got to push – you need people in the inside who are pulling.

However, many people suggested the problems were often unintentional and that researchers just didn’t really know how to involve people effectively or were even afraid to try it. This prompted some people to suggest they might need training. People could sympathise with how difficult it might be for researchers. A particular concern was that involvement was more likely to make a real difference earlier in the process, but often it was left far too late. The National Institute for Health Research can provide support for earlier involvement through regional Research Design Service teams.

Researchers may find it harder to see how or why they should involve people in some projects more than others, particularly those where the research is quite technical or where the focus is not on illnesses or specific conditions. Beryl commented, for example, that it would be difficult to see how some laboratory-based research would lend itself to involvement. Some studies are largely about economic analysis, or secondary analysis of existing datasets (where data has already been collected and then it gets re-analysed for another purpose). Studies about public health (where the focus is on whole populations and interventions rather than individual patients, such as road safety or healthy eating) can also be more challenging. But people argued that there should still be a focus on real people and how they might benefit from the research, however technical. Charles felt that ‘there would be a role for PPI actually in every possible field’. Roger B talked about illness prevention research as a place where general members of the public could usefully be involved: ‘You've got to have people who may one day be affected by whatever – this disease, or that disease, or that group of diseases – if you're going to reach out to that same group of people with a message which is about prevention’.
Asking the right questions
As Derek noted above, sometimes difficulties came from patients’ own expectations or behaviour, and several people had examples of times where lay people came along with their own agenda, which could be disruptive – ‘hobby horse riding’, as Kath called it. Of course researchers may also come with their own agenda, and sometimes challenging researchers’ assumptions is exactly what’s needed; whether this is interpreted as disruptive or appropriate may depend on your perspective. Again, Derek argued training could help direct people’s energy, ‘but it's not about training them in a sense of training them to be an awkward squad, but actually training to ask fundamental questions’.
People who ‘have one angle to push’ can be frustrating for everyone.

Identifying the Challenges in Community-Based Participatory Research Collaboration
Timothy Hotze
Ross LF, Loup A, Nelson RM, et al. The challenges of collaboration for academic and community partners in a research partnership: points to consider. J Empir Res Hum Res Ethics. 2010;5(1):19-31.
The modern framework for consent and research is, like much of western philosophy, based upon the individual [1]. Individuals must be informed about the risks and potential benefits of involving themselves in research, and they must consent, individually, to participating in such research. As John Donne wrote, however, “no man is an island” [2], and, in many cases, it is communities as much as individuals that share the risks and benefits of research.
In recent years, an understanding of the importance of engaging communities in research has grown. A widely discussed model for engaging communities is community-based participatory research (CBPR) [3]. This model pairs academic researchers and community members; both partners should have active roles in shaping the research’s aims, design, and implementation.
In theory, CBPR offers benefits to academic researchers, the community involved in the research, and individuals in the community. Researchers may benefit from a better understanding of the community, allowing for better research design. The community can help shape research design and ensure that the actual needs of the community are taken into account. Individuals may have the opportunity to participate in research they would not have known about except through a community organization, and the community may empower individuals to share their ideas and concerns about the research. In many cases, the community may receive direct benefits during the study (e.g., through greater access to health care) and afterward, from greater understanding of cause-effect relationships the study has uncovered, increased attention to preventing or managing problems affecting the community, and so on.
In practice, however, CBPR often differs from this ideal: the demands of academic research, such as including a control group in many study designs, may not be liked or tolerated by some communities, and researchers may not be able (or willing) to accommodate all the needs of the communities they wish to study. Misunderstandings about the goals, benefits, or process of research can strain—or even sever—the relationship between communities and researchers.
Careful planning, with discussions and shared decision making, is therefore essential before engaging in community based research. In “The Challenges of Collaboration for Academic and Community Partners in a Research Partnership,” Ross et al. provide a useful guide to ensuring that the partnership is successful. The authors helpfully organize the article along the lines of an actual research project, from finding a community partner or researcher, developing and conducting the research, and disseminating findings. They have produced a document that is easy both to read and to browse, and it is clear they endeavored to make their discussion useful for both professional academics and prospective community partners.
Ross et al.’s primary advice is that, because trust is essential for a successful partnership, open communication and planning in advance of the start of work is crucial. Their “points to consider” in each section ask important questions that serve as starting points for important discussions between researchers and community partners. Although some of these ideas seem relatively intuitive and straightforward, others might not be at all obvious to researchers or communities embarking on their first CBPR project. For example, in addition to describing the risks to individuals and communities who choose to participate in the research, Ross et al. also ask readers to consider the risks to “non-participating community members” [4].
This highlights an important difference between community-based research and traditional research. It is possible to imagine situations in which individuals who are not eligible or who elect not to participate in the research find their ties to the community weakened or their voice in the community marginalized. Risks such as these, which occur only in community-based research, may be easy to overlook for researchers trained in the more traditional, individual-based human subjects research.
The shift from screening individuals to participate in research to evaluating whether a community is suitable for participation requires a number of additional steps. Ross et al. differentiate between structured communities (they give the example of a church group) and unstructured communities that may need to be structured to some extent prior to conducting research (they give the example of evaluating health care needs of abused women) [5], noting that there may be concerns of legitimacy and agency when a community is fundamentally unstructured.
What Ross and her coauthors do not provide, however, is advice on overcoming many of the challenges they identify. Although an issue can be identified in a bullet point, fully understanding it is more difficult, and crafting a solution can prove to be even more difficult. After reading much of Ross et al.’s advice, the reader is left asking the question “how?”
For example, one of the authors’ points for community consideration in finding an academic research partner is “Does the academic researcher have the skills, experience, and resources necessary for the specific research project?” By definition, community partners lack the academic skills, credentials, and experience to conduct the research themselves. Research on jurists’ interpretation of expert testimony shows that nontrained members of the public are not able to determine the qualifications of an expert effectively [6]. In this light, it is unclear how the community is supposed to evaluate the credibility of researchers. There is evidence that in such situations, people rely on simple heuristic clues: does the person look, sound, and act the way one would expect a creditable expert to look, sound, and act [7]?
Questions like this highlight the larger issues of power imbalance that may occur between researchers and members of the community. While an equal partnership between researchers and the community is a goal of CBPR [8], it is unclear whether such a goal is actually attainable and whether communities ultimately benefit as much as possible from such research [9]. As Ross et al. note, in many cases, only the researchers are eligible to be principal investigators, given the demands of the grant award process [10]. Even if money is supplied to community organizations, as the authors suggest may be possible, this may understandably be viewed by community participants as money from the researcher-partners given to the community-partner, a “handout” instead of an equal share.
Of the solutions that Ross et al. do propose, some seem made to contain legal liability rather than to foster trust and active partnerships. They propose, for example, documenting agreed-upon terms in a memorandum of understanding or other written document “delimitating the expectations of both parties and documenting the terms of agreement” [11]. Given that researchers are almost certainly more able to envision what activities will actually need to occur through the course of the research, such a document may well conform more to the desires and expectations of the researchers than of the community, which will probably be experiencing the research process for the first time.
In conclusion, although the promise of partnership in CBPR is tantalizing, careful consideration and work are required. Ross and her coauthors helpfully outline many of the concerns that must be addressed, but many of the questions they pose do not have easy answers, and it is unclear how well communities will be able to answer the questions themselves if called upon to become research partners. Even with the careful planning that Ross et al. advocate, CBPR may still fall well short of being a truly equally empowered partnership.

“African Americans and Clinical Research..." article
This study examined barriers and facilitators to clinical research participation among African Americans. Researchers conducted 8 focus groups consisting of community members and community leaders (64 total), including clergy, community healthcare providers, and service providers who may influence people’s decision to participate in research. The most common barriers to participation included fear and mistrust of research due to such factors as lack of information about research and prevailing knowledge of historical occurrences. Facilitators to participation included intrinsic factors, such as a desire to help others, and extrinsic factors, such as familiarity with the research recruiter. Strategies discussed that might improve recruitment included the importance of providing personal stories that enable community members to understand the potential benefits of research.

Many communities distrust the motives and techniques of research. Some know of the history of exploitation and abuse in medical research in the U.S., and others may be “burned out” from participation in studies. Some may have immediate needs that make research seem irrelevant, and some may merely lack an understanding of the research enterprise.
Thus, when research is involved, the challenges of community engagement may be particularly profound. The vignettes that follow address some of the most common dilemmas in engaging a community in research and maintaining the relationship over time. The take-home messages offered at the end of each vignette are grounded in the principles of community engagement, as they demonstrate the importance of understanding communities; establishing trusting, respectful, equitable, and committed relationships; and working with the community to identify the best ways to translate knowledge into improved health.
A. How do you engage a community in a randomized clinical trial or a drug trial?
Sally Davis, PhD
Challenge
Community-based research does not always allow for full participation of the community from start to finish, as is envisioned in the classic CBPR model. In CBPR, the community often comes up with the research question or issue of interest based on personal experience, but in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the funding agency or investigator generally develops the question based on pressing health issues identified from surveillance or other data sources. A community-based RCT is often an efficacy trial and may include many schools or communities across a large geographic area.
For example, the PRC at the University of New Mexico conducted an RCT on obesity prevention with 16 rural Head Start centers across the state. An RCT conducted in the traditional way is done in an artificial “laboratory” setting within an academic health center or practice setting; an RCT in the community setting can be just as rigorous but with more flexibility and community participation. The challenge has been to develop strategies to engage the community in the research process within a short period of time and with clear communication and agreement.
Action Steps
Although the study was conducted in 16 communities and there was little time to establish relationships, researchers were able to engage the communities by inviting key partners to participate. For example, local grocery stores, health care providers, families, Head Start teachers, teaching assistants, and food-service providers were all included. This inclusive approach ensured participation from a broad array of community members from the beginning of the study. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) was developed that included input from community leaders and provided an opportunity for the researchers and the community to discuss and agree on roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Key members of the community (e.g., governing officials, school administration, and parent groups) and the university researchers signed the agreement. The MOA includes a clear statement of the purpose of the research, burden to the school or individual (the amount of time required to participate), benefits to the school (money, equipment, in-kind service), benefits to the academic institution and researchers (the opportunity to answer important questions and test interventions), needs (space, parental consent, special events, identification of other key individuals), and communication issues (regarding scheduling, staff turnover, complaints). The MOA is being used as a guidance document for the study. Having this agreement in writing is especially helpful when there is turnover of key participants, such as school staff or governing officials, or when there are new participants who may not be aware of the history or purpose of the study or of the roles, relationships, and responsibilities agreed upon at the beginning of the research.
Take-Home Messages
Engaging the community in RCTs is challenging but possible.
Engaging and seeking input from multiple key stakeholders (e.g., grocery store owners, health care providers, and families) is an important strategy.
Collaboratively developing an MOA can enhance communication and build new partnerships in studies that are restricted by time and are predefined.
An MOA can serve as a valuable guidance document and useful tool throughout a study as an agreed-upon point of reference for researchers and community members (Davis et al., 1999; Davis et al., 2003).

B. How do you overcome historical exploitation?
Sally Davis, PhD, Janet Page-Reeves, PhD, Theresa Cruz, PhD
Challenge
A history of exploitation in rural communities may be manifested in a number of ways. In many such communities, structural inequality is evident in residents’ geographic isolation, great distance from commercial centers, lack of access to services, lack of availability of healthful foods, and poverty, as well as frequent turnover of staff in local institutions such as schools and health care facilities. This reality presents everyday challenges to the researchers at institutions that work in these communities. For example, distance, weather, and lack of infrastructure pose logistical challenges, and a lack of road maintenance, limited communication capacity, and uncertain access to food and lodging (necessities that urban residents may take for granted) are often problems in rural areas. These issues, combined with the problem of scheduling around competing priorities in the lives of both researchers and community members, are challenges for those living in or working with rural communities.
These challenges do not compare, however, with those created by the historical exploitation of residents in some of these communities. In the Southwest, where research has too often been conducted in an exploitative manner without the consent and participation of the community, it is extremely difficult to develop partnerships between rural communities and researchers. Many American Indian and Hispanic communities throughout the Southwest have been the subjects of research conducted by persons living outside the community who did not engage residents and their communities in the research. In one multi-site study with tribal groups across the United States that began in the 1990s, researchers at the University of New Mexico PRC and at four other universities were confronted with the challenge of overcoming the mistrust of seven tribal communities that had either experienced exploitation or heard of examples.
Action Steps
Despite the history of violated trust, the PRC was able to develop appropriate and meaningful partnerships between researchers and tribal communities. Together, the partners established and maintained the bidirectional trust necessary to develop and implement a successful intervention. They used a variety of participation strategies to achieve trust. For example, local customs and cultural constructs were considered in formulating the intervention, local advisory councils were formed, elders were included as advisors, local community members were hired, formative assessment was conducted to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed prevention strategies in local terms, approval was sought from tribal and local review boards, and local priorities were determined. Participation, feedback, and collaborative relationships were crucial to engaging these underrepresented communities with a history of exploitation. And yet, perhaps the most important and most basic strategy was to demonstrate respect and inclusion to the fullest extent possible.
Take-Home Messages
Recognize that there may be a history of exploitation in the community and therefore a distrust of research and researchers.
Employ a variety of participation strategies.
Allow extra time for building relationships and trust.
Seek approval from tribal or other local review groups.
Include local customs in interventions.
Demonstrate respect and inclusion to the fullest extent possible (Davis et al., 1999; Gittelsohn et al., 2003).

C. How do you maintain community engagement throughout the research?
Deborah Bowen, PhD
Challenge
The comedian Woody Allen once said, “Eighty percent of life is showing up.” That is true in community engagement as well as in life. Add to that formula the idea of showing up for the right events — those that are important to community priorities — and engagement takes place. For example, the author’s research group was funded to conduct a feasibility study of using rural farm granges as health promotion sites in ranching country. Granges are rural community organizations that support learning, information exchange, social events, and political action for farming and ranching communities. The feasibility study progressed from initial discussions to collection of formative data. These data collection efforts were by telephone, and, at first, response rates from the actual membership were relatively poor. The research group halted its efforts to collect data and conducted some qualitative research to better understand the issues.
Action Steps
The researchers found that lack of familiarity with the author’s research institute and the people involved might be one barrier to full participation of the rural residents and grange members. Over the next six months, the research institute staff began to attend community and farming events, getting to know residents and families and learning what the community’s important issues were. Research institute staff asked about these issues and attended events or supported efforts in the farming communities that were not necessarily related to health promotion but were key to the farm families in the granges. Several farm family members became part of the project’s community advisory board, giving both advice and direction to the new plans for surveys. After six months, the research group, together with the community advisory board, reinstated the telephone data collection efforts, which then achieved a much higher response rate. This kind of community engagement continued for the three-year project. These same connections with farm families in granges are still fueling health promotion efforts in this area.
Take-Home Messages
Engagement needs to occur as the ideas for research are being formed and the procedures are being identified.
Taking the community’s priorities into account increases the opportunity for engagement.
Being a regular presence in the community may enhance research efforts.

D. How do you engage a community organization as a partner in exploratory health research?
Lori Carter-Edwards, PhD, Ashley Johnson, Lesley Williams, Janelle Armstrong-Brown, MPH
Challenge
The John Avery Boys and Girls Club (JABGC), located in the heart of a low-to-lower-middle-income community in Durham, North Carolina, primarily serves African American children and their families by providing a variety of after-school programs and activities. The organization is partnering with the Duke Center for Community Research (DCCR) to conduct a qualitative exploratory research study to understand children’s influences on the food purchasing behaviors of caregivers in the context of food marketing. African American children have a much higher prevalence of obesity than children of other ethnic groups (Skelton et al., 2009) and are more likely than other children to receive targeted marketing messages for products associated with intake of excess calories (Grier et al., 2010; Kumanyika et al., 2006). The intent of this study is to gain information on the local food environment to help inform and ultimately to modify policy. JABGC had a previous relationship with DCCR personnel in the area of program and policy development, but this was its first experience serving as a full partner with the DCCR in research.
Action Steps
The DCCR and the JABGC have met regularly since the development and funding of the study, which is sponsored by the African-American Collaborative Obesity Research Network, a national research network based at the University of Pennsylvania through a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The executive director of the JABGC identified an administrative lead from the club to serve as its point person. The DCCR faculty lead for the study and other researchers frequently visit the JABGC and have established a rapport with its entire administrative and programmatic staff. The core partners hold weekly telephone meetings to address issues related to execution of the study. During some calls, partners have discussed the data that needed to be collected and why, and these discussions helped to dramatically improve documentation. Regular telephone meetings also helped to clarify job priorities. It was important that the DCCR partners understood the work priorities of the JABGC staff and the limitations of what could and could not be accomplished during the study.
Some of the JABGC administrative staff has changed since the research began, but because of the rapport built through the partnership and the existing mechanisms for communication, the changes have not adversely affected the team’s ability to conduct the research. Continued communications between the DCCR and the JABGC administrative and programmatic staff have been key to sustaining organizational relationships.
Take-Home Messages
Establishing a collaborative research relationship may involve a different level of engagement than a collaborative outreach relationship.
Organizations have their own responsibilities that have to be met independently of any research.
Communicating regularly and often to keep all partners aware of priorities within the respective institutions is important.
Working collectively to proactively create relationships and put procedures in place can help sustain the research when the community organization staff changes.
It should be understood that, despite the time limits for research, partnerships must be flexible.

Abstract
People with serious mental illnesses, particularly members of racial and ethnic minority groups, are rarely included in prioritizing research topics or developing the tools and measures important for improving their care. Community-based participatory research holds promise toward reducing mental health disparities. However, initiating research partnerships with community stakeholders is challenging and does not always lead to sustainable community health improvements. Using lessons learned from a project to improve understanding of patients' preferences and discrimination in depression and diabetes treatment, we describe barriers and facilitators to initiating a meaningful partnership with disenfranchised groups. Barriers fell within four domains: trepidation of community stakeholders, complex research methods, uncertainty among academic partners, and unclear partnership decision-making protocols. Primary facilitators included the meaningfulness of the research topic to the community, the presence of a well-established community-based organization, academic financial investment, co-learning activities, and flexibility. Successful initiation of these partnerships holds significant potential for addressing health care disparities.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can find.

First, there's a document from healthtalk.org about difficulties and barriers to involvement in health research. It seems like it's focused on patient and public involvement in health research. There are several points mentioned, such as difficulties in finding out about opportunities, issues with recruitment processes, training and support, feeling excluded due to jargon, and personal challenges like dealing with illness or caring responsibilities.

Another document is from the AMA's Journal of Ethics, discussing identifying challenges in community-based participatory research collaboration. It talks about the theoretical benefits of CBPR but acknowledges that in practice, there can be misunderstandings and strains between communities and researchers. The article provides a guide with points to consider at different stages of research, emphasizing the importance of open communication and planning to build trust.

Then, there's a resource from the National Institute on Aging about barriers and facilitators to participation in clinical research among African Americans. It mentions fear and mistrust due to historical events and lack of information as common barriers, while facilitators include a desire to help others and familiarity with the recruiter. The article suggests that personal stories and understanding the benefits of research can improve recruitment.

Another resource is from ATSDR, discussing challenges in engaging and maintaining community involvement in research, particularly in the context of randomized controlled trials and overcoming historical exploitation. It provides examples of how to build trust and engagement through memorandums of agreement, inclusive participation, and respecting local customs.

Lastly, there's an article from Health Affairs about barriers and facilitators to community-based participatory mental health care research for racial and ethnic minorities. It highlights challenges in initiating partnerships but also identifies facilitators like the relevance of the research topic, established community organizations, and flexibility in the partnership.

From these sources, I can see several themes emerging regarding why a community might not be involved in the research process.

First, there's a lack of awareness or difficulty in finding out about research opportunities. Communities may not know that research is happening or how they can get involved. This could be due to poor communication from researchers or a general lack of outreach to diverse communities.

Second, there are logistical challenges, such as time constraints, language barriers, or physical accessibility. These can make it hard for community members to participate in research activities, especially if they require significant commitments or are not tailored to the community's needs.

Third, there's the issue of mistrust and historical exploitation. Many communities, particularly minority communities, have been subjected to unethical research practices in the past, leading to a justified skepticism towards researchers. Overcoming this mistrust requires building genuine relationships based on transparency and respect.

Fourth, there may be a lack of relevance or perceived benefit to the community. If the research doesn't address issues that are important to the community or if the benefits aren't clearly communicated, community members may see little reason to get involved.

Fifth, there could be power imbalances between researchers and the community. Researchers may come from different socioeconomic backgrounds or hold more institutional authority, which can make community members feel undervalued or unheard.

Sixth, there might be methodological constraints in certain types of research that don't lend themselves well to community involvement. For example, in highly controlled experimental studies, there may be limited opportunities for community input without compromising the scientific integrity of the research.

Seventh, researchers themselves may lack the skills or training to effectively engage communities in their work. This could result in half-hearted attempts at community involvement or superficial partnerships that don't genuinely include community voices.

Eighth, there may be systemic barriers, such as funding structures that don't prioritize community engagement or institutional cultures that don't value participatory research approaches.

Finally, there could be practical challenges in maintaining ongoing engagement, especially in long-term research projects. Community interests and priorities can shift over time, and keeping community members invested requires持续的努力和沟通。

综上所述，社区不参与研究过程的原因是多方面的，涉及到了解、物流、信任、相关性、权力动态、方法论限制、研究人员的能力以及系统性障碍等多个方面。要提高社区参与度，研究人员需要采取综合策略来解决这些挑战，并致力于建立真正平等和相互尊重的合作伙伴关系。

\boxed{\text{社区可能不参与研究过程的原因包括缺乏意识、物流挑战、历史上的剥削导致的不信任、感知到的相关性不足、权力不平衡、方法论限制、研究人员能力的局限以及系统性障碍。}}
