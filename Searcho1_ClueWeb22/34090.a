Alright, so I've been thinking about this question: "How have COVID shutdowns, virtual school, and remote work changed our relationship to technology?" It's a pretty big topic, and there's a lot to consider here. I guess the first thing is to understand what aspects of our relationship with technology might have changed because of these factors.

First off, let's consider what was happening before the pandemic. Technology was already a big part of our lives, but maybe not to the extent that it became during lockdowns. People were using smartphones, computers, and various apps for communication, entertainment, work, and education, but there was still a lot of in-person interaction that didn't involve technology.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, and with it, shutdowns, virtual schools, and remote work became the norm in many parts of the world. This forced a lot of people to rely more heavily on technology for just about everything. So, I think one major change is the increased dependency on technology for daily activities.

Let me try to break this down. For remote work, people had to use video conferencing tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet regularly. Before, maybe only a small percentage of the workforce worked from home, but during the pandemic, it skyrocketed. This means that communication and collaboration now happen primarily through digital platforms.

Similarly, virtual schools required students to use laptops or tablets and educational software to attend classes and complete assignments. This was a huge shift for many students and teachers who were used to traditional in-person learning. It must have been challenging to adapt, but it also opened up new possibilities for online learning.

Now, thinking about how this has changed our relationship with technology, I think it's made technology more integrated into our lives than ever before. It's not just something we use for fun or occasional work tasks; it's become essential for functioning in daily life.

Another aspect is that technology has enabled us to maintain some sense of normalcy during times when physical interactions were limited. For example, video calls allowed us to stay connected with family and friends even when we couldn't see them in person. Social media and messaging apps also played a big role in keeping us connected.

But there are also negative impacts. Increased screen time can lead to eye strain, poor posture, and other health issues. Additionally, the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life due to remote work can lead to burnout. Kids might also face challenges with focus and socialization in virtual school settings.

Moreover, the digital divide has become more apparent. Not everyone has equal access to reliable internet and devices needed for remote work or virtual schooling. This has exacerbated inequalities, with some people being left behind because they couldn't participate fully in online activities.

I also think that the way we perceive technology has changed. Before, it might have been seen as optional or supplementary, but now it's recognized as crucial for many aspects of society. There's probably more investment and development in tech solutions because of the increased reliance on them during the pandemic.

Looking ahead, I suspect that even after the pandemic subsides, many of these changes will persist. Hybrid work models combining in-office and remote work are becoming more common, and online learning options are likely to remain popular. So, our relationship with technology is probably here to stay, and possibly continue evolving.

In summary, COVID shutdowns, virtual school, and remote work have significantly increased our dependence on technology, integrating it more deeply into various aspects of our lives. While this has brought about convenience and connectivity, it also presents challenges such as health issues, blurred work-life boundaries, and exacerbation of the digital divide.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Increased dependency on technology for communication, work, and education, leading to both enhanced connectivity and new challenges such as health issues and digital inequality.}} \]
