Alright, so I need to think about how pandemics affect students. I guess the most recent and relevant pandemic is COVID-19, so maybe I should focus on that. But I should probably consider other pandemics as well to get a broader perspective.

First, I should think about the immediate impacts. With COVID-19, schools and universities around the world were shut down to prevent the spread of the virus. So, one major effect is disruption to education. Students had to switch to online learning, which isn't the same as being in a physical classroom. Some students might not have access to reliable internet or devices for online learning, which could create inequalities.

Speaking of inequalities, I recall that during the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the "digital divide." That must be related. Maybe I should look into that more.

Also, mental health is a big issue. Being isolated at home, missing friends, and dealing with uncertainty can really take a toll on students' well-being. There might be increased anxiety and depression rates among students during pandemics.

Moreover, for older students, like those in high school or college, there might be disruptions to their extracurricular activities, sports, and social lives. Graduating seniors might have missed out on important milestones like prom or graduation ceremonies.

On a longer term perspective, the educational disruption could lead to learning losses and wider achievement gaps. Students might fall behind in their studies, which could affect their future academic and career prospects.

I should also consider the economic impacts. With many families facing financial hardships during a pandemic, students might have to take on more responsibilities at home, like caring for siblings or even working to support their family. This could further interfere with their studies.

Additionally, for international students, pandemics can pose unique challenges, such as travel restrictions, visa issues, and cultural isolation.

I think it's also important to note that not all students are affected in the same way. Factors like age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and pre-existing health conditions can all influence how much impact a pandemic has on an individual student.

Maybe I should try to categorize these effects to make it clearer. Like, short-term effects versus long-term effects, or effects on academics versus effects on mental and emotional well-being.

Let me see. Short-term effects could include:

1. Disruption to regular schooling and switch to online learning.

2. Cancelation of exams, competitions, and other academic evaluations.

3. Isolation and reduced social interaction.

4. Increased screen time and potential eye strain or other health issues.

5. Challenges in maintaining a routine and staying motivated.

Long-term effects might involve:

1. Learning losses and delayed educational progress.

2. Long-lasting impacts on mental health.

3. Difficulty in transitioning back to in-person learning.

4. Potential changes in educational systems and learning methods post-pandemic.

As for academic effects, besides the switch to online learning, there might be changes in curriculum, teaching methods, and assessment strategies. Some students might struggle to adapt to these changes, while others might thrive in the new environment.

Mental and emotional well-being is another critical area. The stress and uncertainty brought about by a pandemic can be overwhelming for students. They might experience fear about getting sick, anxiety about the future, and grief over lost experiences or loved ones.

Furthermore, for students who rely on schools for meals, shelter, or other support services, the closure of schools could exacerbate their vulnerabilities.

I should also consider the impact on special needs students. Those who require specialized assistance or accommodations might face particular challenges in an online learning environment.

Another aspect is the pressure to maintain grades and meet academic expectations despite the chaotic circumstances. This could lead to increased stress and burnout among students.

Moreover, the pandemic might affect students' ability to participate in internships, research opportunities, or other experiential learning activities that are crucial for their resumes and future prospects.

For college students, there might be concerns about tuition fees, especially if their families are facing financial difficulties. Some students might have to take loans or consider dropping out altogether.

International students, as I mentioned earlier, might face additional hurdles, such as difficulty in returning to their home countries or challenges in adjusting to studying remotely in a foreign language.

I should also think about the impact on students' sense of community and belonging. Schools often serve as a support system and a source of friendship and camaraderie. Being cut off from that can be isolating and detrimental to students' overall well-being.

Moreover, the pandemic might lead to an increase in domestic violence or other forms of abuse within households, which could directly affect students' safety and ability to focus on their studies.

Looking beyond the negative impacts, there might be some positive effects as well. For instance, students might develop greater resilience, adaptability, and independence through navigating these challenging times. They may also become more empathetic and appreciative of the importance of public health measures.

Additionally, the shift to online learning could expose students to new technologies and teaching methods that they might not have encountered otherwise. This could potentially enhance their digital literacy skills.

However, these positive aspects shouldn't overshadow the significant challenges that many students are facing. It's essential to acknowledge both sides to get a comprehensive understanding.

I think it would be helpful to look for some statistics or research studies that quantify these impacts. For example, studies showing the extent of learning loss during school closures or surveys indicating the prevalence of mental health issues among students during the pandemic.

Let me consider conducting a search to find some relevant data or reports on this topic.

Study shows impact of pandemic on students' education

NWEA, a non-profit research organization that focuses on student performance, released a preliminary study on the impact the pandemic has had on students across the country so far.
The report shows that reading performance among students this fall is around the same as it was one year ago, before students were forced to adapt to learning from home and hybrid structures. Math performance, however, is down about five to 10 percentage points, the study shows.
"Some takeaways from the data that supposedly reflect positive outcomes or ideas that COVID has not had such a negative impact, I think we have to be very careful about that," said Dr. Ginni Fair, dean of the college of education at Northern Kentucky University.
Fair cautions against taking the findings as pure evidence there hasn't been any backsliding in education. Researchers involved in the study acknowledge they're missing a significant portion of students they normally test.
"Likely reasons behind why those students were not included in this data set are that they don't have the access to the technology, that they aren't engaging in their classrooms," said Fair.
Those students, Fair said, are likely the ones struggling to keep up, so the study could be skewed due to a lack of data from that demographic of students. The data also suggest Black, Hispanic and poor students were hurt the most, but researchers said it's too early to draw definite conclusions along racial or economic lines.
The study included 4.4 million public school students in grades 3-8 across 46 states overall.
Fair said the response from school districts in the Tri-State has been good, and she pointed out that many have programs and services intended to support students' emotional needs as well as their academic ones, as they struggle with isolation through the pandemic.
"In some ways, I think it has been a shining example of the commitment, the flexibility, the preparation, the professionalism," Fair said.
Fair added that the role of school districts goes far beyond just academics: How schools meet social and emotional needs during the pandemic is crucial and also needs to be taken into account toward their success overall, something the NWEA study doesn't examine conclusively.

A sweeping new review of national test data suggests the pandemic-driven jump to online learning has had little impact on children's reading growth and has only somewhat slowed gains in math. That positive news comes from the testing nonprofit NWEA and covers nearly 4.4 million U.S. students in grades three through eight. But the report also includes a worrying caveat: Many of the nation's most vulnerable students are missing from the data.
"Preliminary fall data suggests that, on average, students are faring better than we had feared," says Beth Tarasawa, head of research at NWEA, in a news release accompanying the report.
"While there's some good news here, we want to stress that not all students are represented in the data, especially from our most marginalized communities."
Until now, estimates of learning loss have been just that — estimates or projections, based on the kind of academic backsliding schools see after a long summer. This report offers the clearest picture yet of the impact that the past eight months of disruption have had on student learning.
The MAP Growth test
The data at the heart of NWEA's report come from what's known to teachers and children alike as the MAP Growth test — a check-in assessment used to measure kids' math and reading skills that's generally given three times a year, in fall, winter and spring.
While millions of students took these MAP tests in the winter of 2020, few took them again in the spring as schools raced (and many struggled) to provide learning online. But this fall, nearly 4.4 million children did take the test, either from home or back in a classroom. And the results give researchers a vital new data point: a measure of where students are right now.
Coronavirus Updates
COVID-19 Has Robbed The World's Poorest Children Of Nearly 4 Months Of Schooling
Tarasawa and her research team studied the data a few different ways. First, they compared students' performance this fall — in, say, third-grade reading — with the performance of a different group of students who took third-grade reading in the fall of 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic.
Tarasawa tells NPR that with this method of comparison, the results in reading were "relatively optimistic" because "kids on average are performing similarly to how [other children] did pre-pandemic." In math, the current pandemic class of students performed about 5 to 10 percentile points lower than the pre-pandemic comparison group — what Tarasawa describes as a "moderate" drop.
In addition to comparing two different groups of students, researchers also studied students' individual growth over time, looking at where they were when they took the MAP test in the winter of 2020 and comparing it with where they are now, in the fall of 2020.
"We saw, on average, students showed growth in both math and reading across the grade levels in almost all grades," says Tarasawa. "Most students made some learning gains in both reading and math since COVID started."
In short, students kept learning when schools shifted online; they just didn't learn quite as much in math as they likely would have if there had never been a pandemic.
Mitigating the learning loss that is happening will still require patience and a thoughtful approach, says Aaliyah Samuel, NWEA's executive vice president of government affairs and partnerships.
"Addressing the unfinished learning is going to be a matter of time. We really need to be thinking about the supports and interventions for kids over at least a two- or three-year runway."
Depending on the depth of learning lost, school districts could consider a range of options, including extending the school year or even enlisting a volunteer tutoring corps.
Roughly a quarter of students missing
The "good" news (and the not-so-good news) in this report also comes with an important and worrying red flag.
In an effort to be sure their 4.4 million-student sample, albeit large, was also representative of America's classrooms, NWEA researchers dug into the demographics of this new data set and compared it with the earlier fall 2019 test data — a sample of nearly 5.2 million children.
What they found, Tarasawa says, is that roughly a quarter of students were missing — meaning they didn't take the MAP test this fall — and that these children are "more likely to be black and brown, more likely to be from high-poverty schools and more likely to have lower performance in the first place."
The researchers cite a host of possible reasons these students weren't able to take the latest test, including a lack of technology or Internet access at home as well as the possibility that some children have disengaged from school more broadly.
"This is screaming that we have to be very cautious," says Tarasawa, about interpreting the relatively optimistic results in reading and even math as evidence that the kids are all right.
"It's just like any time you get a new puzzle," Samuel says. "The first thing you do is ... you start to look for the corners because those are usually the easiest to put together first."
That's where we're at now, she explains: building the edges of the puzzle.

1. Main points
The proportion of students who reported reducing the number of people they met with, always or most of the time, in the last 7 days statistically significantly decreased from 94% in March 2021 to 56% in April 2021; as lockdown restrictions had been eased in England.
More students left their accommodation to go to the shops for something other than groceries or the pharmacy (61%), to spend time outdoors for recreational purposes or exercise (81%), to travel to different areas (34%) and to study indoors (27%) compared with previous months
Average life satisfaction scores among students continued to improve, increasing from 5.2 (out of 10) in March 2021 to 5.8 in April 2021; however average scores still remained statistically significantly lower than the adult population in Great Britain (6.9 out of 10).
The proportion of students reporting a worsening in their mental health and well-being since the start of the autumn term 2020 continued to fall, decreasing from 63% in March 2021 to just over half (53%) in April 2021.
The proportion of students reporting feeling lonely often or always decreased to 22% in April 2021; however, this is still far greater than the 6% of the adult population in Great Britain reporting the same over a similar period.
Almost half of students (48%) reported they had met up with family or friends they don’t live with indoors; this was more than double who reported the same in March 2021 (21%).
The proportion of students who were living at the same address as they were at the start of the autumn term 2020 increased from 76% in March 2021 to 82% in April 2021; the number of students who said they were currently living with their parents dropped between March 2021 (41%) and April 2021 (36%).

The statistics presented are experimental statistics, so care needs to be taken when interpreting them. This survey has a relatively small sample size and low response rate. While this has been weighted and is comparable with previous findings, this has an impact on the level of certainty of this research.

3. Measuring the data
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is conducting a survey analysing student behaviour during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. This survey is called the Student COVID-19 Insights Survey (SCIS). University students included are those that are studying on Foundation to Postgraduate level programmes at universities in England.
The survey was conducted between 15 and 22 April 2021, using an online survey tool and all answers were self-reported. Some universities were on Easter break while the survey was conducted. A total of 100,000 students in English universities were invited to take part via their email address held by National Union of Students (NUS) with an email sent from the NUS, with a response rate of 1.5%. We would like to thank and acknowledge the important role the NUS had in conducting this survey.
From 12 April 2021, England entered step 2 of the government roadmap out of lockdown which advised the reopening of some businesses and activities such as non-essential retail, indoor leisure facilities and most outdoor attractions as well as limited reopening of hospitality venues (more information can be found here ).
Weighting
Estimates in this report are based on weighted counts that are representative of the population of students studying at universities in England, population totals are taken from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) 2019/20 estimates. Estimates are weighted to adjust for sex, age and region of university provider.
Uncertainty in the data
The experimental statistics presented in this bulletin contain uncertainty. As with all survey data based on a sample, there is an element of uncertainty as they are susceptible to respondent error and bias.
Adult population in Great Britain
Where possible, comparisons have been drawn with the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) to compare the experiences and behaviours of students with the adult population in Great Britain. The comparisons are used to give a broad idea of the different experiences of each group but the statistics measure data from different timeframes, slightly different questions and different sampling methods so are not directly comparable. The period of the OPN used for comparison was 14 to 18 April 2021.
Statistical significance
The statistical significance of differences has been determined by non-overlapping confidence intervals. A confidence interval gives an indication of the degree of uncertainty of an estimate, showing the precision of a sample estimate. The 95% confidence intervals are calculated so that if we repeated the study many times, 95% of the time the true unknown value would lie between the lower and upper confidence limits. A wider interval indicates more uncertainty in the estimate.

After one harrowing year in isolation, the pandemic has become both a nightmare and reality for everyone around the world, but many university students have faced tight restrictions due to COVID-19. Around the world, quarantine has caused stress, fear, or frustration to those who are worried about catching the disease.
This stress can manifest itself in many different forms and varies between individuals. While no one can deny that students have had an abnormal school year, the extent to which America’s student body has been affected by the quarantine has recently been studied across various campuses. Furthermore, experts have also given their opinion on how COVID-19 may have changed the social aspects of UW Platteville and how this virus could affect students worldwide.
The article “Psychological Impacts From COVID-19 Among University Students: Risk Factors Across Seven States in the United States” compiles all its findings, showing the emotions felt by the students, and provides some insight that could help regulate some of the emotional effects related to COVID-19. Much of the data found in the research shows that the pandemic has had a negative effect on students. The authors state, “The most common changes in how students felt compared to before the pandemic were increased lack of motivation, anxiety, stress, and isolation.” The tables elaborate on this statement and show that lack of motivation (felt by 21.5% of students), anxiety (17.4%), stress (14.6%), and isolation (13.3%) were some of the most common changes students have experienced since the beginning of quarantine.
These outcomes are troublesome; students are already one of the most stressed demographics. In another study, 40% of students lost their jobs and 29% of them expect to earn less when they are 35. This information is compared to the students’ future had there not been a COVID-19 pandemic. These changes can weigh heavily on students as their already uncertain future loses even more stability. Stress and other negative feelings can diminish the quality of their schoolwork, which can also affect their future income.
With all the information provided, the article does illuminate some ways that one could reduce the “symptoms” that have affected the student population. The article states, “Both outdoor recreation and nature exposure can improve psychosocial and eudaimonic well-being,” and later continues, “Select programs that have promoted mental health … include virtual group exercise and meditation/mindfulness sessions, accountability buddies and exercise challenges.” Both of these methods provide both the student and university a way to decrease the isolation or anxiety felt by the student.
While the pandemic continues to spread among communities, many people, including Paul Erickson, Chief Communication Officer at UW-Platteville, and Anne Anderson, a PAC in the Milwaukee area, continue to work to combat the viruses and the changes that it has caused. While many students on the UW-Platteville campus are a little frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them due to the pandemic, officials on the COVID-19 operation teamwork to try and return the college back to normal.
Erickson, also a member of the COVID-19 operation team, talked with the Exponent about his experience with dealing with COVID-19. In the beginning, the emergency response team, the team that first dealt with creating COVID-19 guidelines, did not know how long that the COVID-19 pandemic would last and there was much uncertainty there. Paul Erickson stated that “one of the most important takeaways from his experience with the pandemic was the reflection it provided for the school.” This experience allowed him to reflect on how big of a role communication paid to help deal with important matters across campus. In which case, he talked about how the connection between students and teachers evolved. While the pandemic drove students away from in-person classes, nearly 93% of teachers took courses to help them create comprehensive online classes for better learning opportunities. Overall, the way that the university is trying to handle the pandemic is beneficial for all students and most university officials do have the students’ interests in mind.
Anderson has had plenty of experience with the pandemic first-hand and has dealt with many patients and administered vaccines. Her main concern is similar to the campus’ in that she knows that there are many unknowns that surround the COVID-19. Although she is unsure of how long the pandemic will last, she is sure that its effects will be semi-permanent and leave lasting effects on communities like UW-Platteville.
For instance, Anderson believes that university freshmen will eventually be able to return to in-person classes, but their studying habits may not be as developed compared to others who began with in-person classes. Unrelated to UW-Platteville she states, “local businesses being forced to close or suspend their work hours can cause distress in communities and obviously these would be more lasting effects of the pandemic.”
As students around the globe share the negative effects of the novel coronavirus, it is important to remember the strategies that help people stay calm and get through these tough times. Although it may seem like only frustration can come from this, there will always be people who work to make tough times better.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can find that's relevant to how pandemics affect students.

First, there's a document from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) about back-to-school statistics. It gives general information about enrollment, teachers, expenditures, and college enrollment. It also mentions distance learning during the pandemic, which is directly related to my question. It shows that in early 2021, a significant percentage of students were enrolled in remote instruction, and there were variations based on race and ethnicity. This suggests that the pandemic has led to unequal access to education, which could have lasting impacts on students' academic progress.

Next, there's an article from WCPo about a study showing the impact of the pandemic on students' education progress. It mentions that reading performance stayed around the same as the previous year, but math performance was down by five to ten percentage points. The dean from Northern Kentucky University cautions that the study might be missing data from students who lack access to technology, who are likely the ones struggling the most. This highlights the digital divide and its impact on education during the pandemic.

Then, there's an NPR report that delves deeper into the NWEA study. It reiterates that reading performance held steady, but math performance lagged behind. The report also notes that many vulnerable students are missing from the data, which could skew the results optimistically. This emphasizes the need to consider the entire student population when assessing the pandemic's impact on education.

Moving on, there's an Office for National Statistics (ONS) bulletin from the UK about higher education students during the pandemic. It discusses students' behaviors, plans, opinions, and well-being. It shows that students reduced their social interactions but still reported feeling lonely, with lower life satisfaction scores compared to the general adult population. This suggests that the pandemic has had a significant mental health impact on students.

Lastly, there's an article from the Exponent about the effects of COVID-19 on students at UW Platteville. It mentions increased stress, anxiety, and isolation among students and cites a study showing that many students lost jobs and expect lower incomes in the future due to the pandemic. The article also suggests ways to mitigate these effects, such as outdoor activities and mindfulness practices.

So, compiling all this information, it seems that the pandemic has had several negative impacts on students:

1. Disruption to education: Shift to online learning, which may not be effective for all students, especially those without reliable internet or devices.

2. Learning loss, particularly in math, although reading skills held relatively steady.

3. Increased stress, anxiety, and loneliness due to isolation and uncertainty.

4. Economic hardships affecting students and their families, leading to potential dropout risks or reduced future earnings.

5. Inequities in access to education, with disadvantaged students possibly falling further behind.

6. Mental health issues, with students reporting lower life satisfaction and increased feelings of loneliness.

However, there are also some potential positives, such as students developing resilience and adaptability, and possibly improving their digital literacy skills.

It's important to note that the impacts vary among students, with some being more adversely affected than others based on factors like socioeconomic status, access to technology, and pre-existing health conditions.

Given this information, it's clear that the pandemic has had profound effects on students' academic and personal lives. Addressing these issues will require comprehensive approaches, including bridging the digital divide, providing mental health support, and implementing targeted interventions to help students catch up on missed learning.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{Pandemics have negatively impacted students through disrupted education, learning losses, increased stress and loneliness, economic hardships, and exacerbated inequities in access to education.}} \]
