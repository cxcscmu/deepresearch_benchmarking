So I have this question: "How did WWII end the Great Depression?" Hmm, I remember that the Great Depression was a really tough time economically, starting in 1929 with the stock market crash and lasting through the 1930s. Then WWII started in the late 1930s and ended in 1945. So somehow, the war managed to pull countries out of the depression. But how exactly did that happen? I need to understand the connection between the war and the end of the depression.

First off, I should probably look into what the Great Depression was and what its main characteristics were. I think it was a period of severe economic downturn, with high unemployment, low production, and overall economic stagnation. Governments tried various methods to stimulate the economy, but nothing seemed to work until the onset of WWII.

I recall that during WWII, there was a massive increase in production to support the war effort. Countries were building weapons, ammunition, ships, planes, and other military supplies on a huge scale. This must have created a lot of jobs and boosted industrial production. Maybe that's how it helped end the depression.

But I need to dig deeper. I should look into how government spending changed during the war and how that affected the economy. I think Keynesian economics might be relevant here, as it suggests that government intervention and increased spending can help pull an economy out of a depression.

Let me try to structure my thoughts. Perhaps I can think about it in terms of the macroeconomic factors: GDP, employment, government spending, and so on.

First, during the Great Depression, GDP was low, unemployment was high, and there was little to no economic growth. Then, when WWII started, governments, particularly in the US, began spending massively on military goods and services. This increased demand for goods and services likely led to more production and, consequently, more jobs.

I should look up some statistics on government spending before and during the war to see the magnitude of the increase.

Also, I should consider the role of monetary policy during this time. How did central banks respond to the depression and the war?

Moreover, it's important to think about the civilian sector. If the government was allocating so many resources to the military, what happened to consumer goods? Were there shortages or rationing?

And what about after the war? Once the massive government spending stopped, didn't the economy dip again? I think there was some concern about that happening.

Wait, actually, in the US, after the war, the economy didn't dip back into depression. Instead, there was a transition to a peacetime economy, and the post-war period was one of prosperity and growth. So maybe the ending of the war didn't have the negative economic impact that some people feared.

Perhaps the war acted as a catalyst for economic reform and development, setting the stage for post-war growth.

I should also consider the global perspective. The Great Depression was a worldwide phenomenon, and WWII was a global conflict. Did all countries experience the same relationship between the war and their economic conditions?

For example, in Europe, many countries were devastated by the war, both in terms of human casualties and physical destruction. So for them, the war may not have had the same positive economic effects as in countries like the US, which was not directly attacked.

Maybe I need to focus on the US for now, as it's the most straightforward example.

Let me try to outline the sequence of events:

1. Great Depression hits in 1929.

2. Unemployment rises, production falls, economy stagnates.

3. Government tries various measures to stimulate the economy, but with limited success.

4. WWII starts, and the US begins ramping up military production.

5. Government spending on the military increases dramatically.

6. More jobs are created, both directly in military-related industries and indirectly through increased economic activity.

7. As more people get jobs, they have more income to spend, which further stimulates demand and production.

8. This virtuous cycle helps pull the economy out of depression.

9. After the war, the US transitions to a peacetime economy, but the infrastructure and industrial capacity built during the war remain, supporting continued growth.

Does that make sense? It seems plausible, but I need to verify it with actual data and economic analysis.

I should look for sources that discuss the relationship between WWII and the end of the Great Depression. Maybe some economic history books or articles.

Alternatively, perhaps there are critics who argue that the war didn't really end the depression, or that there are other factors at play.

I should consider multiple perspectives to get a fuller understanding.

Let me start by searching for some key terms.

WORLD WAR II AND THE ENDING OF THE DEPRESSION
World War II had a profound and multifaceted impact on the American economy. Most obviously, it lifted the nation out of the Great Depression of the 1930s. As late as 1940, unemployment stood at 14.6 percent; by 1944 it was down to a remarkable 1.2 percent, and the gross national product (GNP) had more than doubled. But the wartime economic mobilization did more than end the Depression. It greatly increased the size, power, and cost of the federal government. It corroborated the argument of the British economist John Maynard Keynes that deficit spending could stimulate economic growth, with consequences not only for government fiscal policy, but also for the agenda of New Deal liberalism. It virtually revolutionized the tax structure by vastly increasing the number of taxpayers, making personal income taxes a larger source of federal income than corporate taxes, and inaugurating the withholding system. It enlarged the economic and political power of big business, spurred the mechanization of agriculture and the further consolidation of big agribusiness, and increased the size and influence of organized labor. It catalyzed major breakthroughs in science and technology, including the development of the atomic bomb. It contributed to the resurgence of conservatism in Congress that had begun in the late 1930s. And among its other consequences, it made the United States overwhelmingly the dominant economic power in the world.
As the United States became the "arsenal of democracy" during World War II, economic mobilization brought a double victory for the American people by ending the decade-long Great Depression at home, as well as playing a pivotal role in defeating the Axis Powers abroad. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s had contributed to economic improvement after the calamitous collapse of the American economy that had led to unemployment of at least 25 percent by 1933. It had also provided essential assistance to the impoverished and unemployed. But the New Deal had not ended the Depression. Indeed, after some recovery from 1933 to 1937, the sharp recession of 1937 to
1938 sent economic indexes plummeting again, with unemployment reaching 19 percent. The economy then headed up again, but in 1940 unemployment still stood at a Depression-level 14.6 percent.
By 1940, however, the war in Europe and the American national defense program provided economic stimulus, and in 1941 and 1942 defense spending and mobilization for war began to send the economy to new levels of prosperity. With the United States accounting for about 40 percent of all war goods produced worldwide by 1944, the GNP rose from $91 billion in 1939 to $126 billion in 1941, to $193 billion in 1943, and to $214 billion in 1945. Civilian employment increased by eight million workers, to some fifty-four million, between 1939 and 1944, at the same time that the armed forces mushroomed from one-third of a million to 11.5 million. Unemployment virtually vanished, falling to just 1.2 percent in 1944. National income soared from $73 billion in 1939 to $183 billion in 1944. And as the United States prospered, the economies of the other major nations were distorted and damaged by the war. In 1947, the United States produced about half of the world's manufactured goods, three-fifths of the world's oil and steel, and four-fifths of the world's automobiles. Such newer industries as aviation, petrochemicals, and electronics also grew in size and importance because of the war—as did new technologies in those and
other areas, including computers. One leading economic historian has argued that such American economic dominance was perhaps "the most influential consequence of the Second World War for the postwar world."
World War II thus brought the return of good times for the American people and laid foundations for the unparalleled prosperity of the postwar era. Even allowing for wartime inflation and shortages, the new employment opportunities and higher incomes produced increased consumer spending and rising living standards. And while there was very little redistribution of income during the war, personal income increased so dramatically—it nearly doubled among the lowest 40 percent of families—that it seemed to many that the war had worked a revolutionary change in their circumstances and aspirations. Wartime shortages of workers also led employers to hire women, African Americans, and other groups in larger numbers and better positions than before. In addition to their wartime training and experiences, armed forces personnel received important educational and economic benefits from the G.I. bill.
Economic mobilization not only produced widespread prosperity, rising living standards, and new opportunities, but also helped to enhance and institutionalize the economic and political power of big business, big farming, and big labor. In manufacturing, defense contracts tended to go to corporate giants with a demonstrated capacity for high-volume, high-quality production. Just thirty-three firms won more than half of all prime war contracts awarded from 1940 to 1944. The proportion of workers employed by businesses with 10,000 workers or more rose from 13 to 30 percent of the total. Working with the military, in an early manifestation of what came to be called the "military-industrial complex," big business resisted spreading war contracts around more, lobbied successfully for curtailing antitrust efforts, and helped prevent early re-conversion to peacetime production by smaller firms.
Mobilizing the economy was achieved more by government support and subsidy than by controls and coercion. Though federal power over materials, priorities, manpower, and production increased significantly during the war, expansion was facilitated by such assistance to business as tax breaks, subsidies, low-cost loans, and contracts that guaranteed the cost of production plus a profit. War contractors also received federal assistance in postwar demobilization. To bring needed experience and expertise to economic mobilization, moreover, executives from such business giants as General Motors, U.S. Steel, General Electric, and Sears, Roebuck were brought to Washington and played key roles in the war mobilization agencies. These "dollar-a-year men," who remained on their corporate payrolls while accepting a nominal salary from the government, further augmented the influence of big business. In all, big business emerged from the war with its reputation enhanced and with enlarged economic and political power.
Organized labor and big commercial farmers also experienced gains during the war. Membership in American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) unions rose by about 50 percent during the war, and AFL and CIO leaders played significant roles in wartime mobilization agencies, though without the same influence as business. Big commercial farmers represented by the "farm bloc" in Congress saw that farm prices received relatively high ceilings in the wartime price control efforts. To make up for the loss of farm labor, more farmers turned to mechanization, which contributed to the ongoing depopulation of parts of rural America and to the consolidation of large commercial farming. The growing size and influence of big business, big labor, and big farming gave clearer shape to the modern American political economy that had been emerging over the previous half century.
So also did the larger size, power, and cost of the federal government. To manage wartime economic mobilization and organize the material, manpower, and money needed to win the war, the number of civilian employees of the federal government quadrupled, to some four million. Such agencies as the War Production Board (WPB), the Office of Price Administration (OPA), the Office of Economic Stabilization (OES), the National War Labor Board (NWLB), the War Manpower Commission (WMC), the Office of Scientific Research and Development
(OSRD), the Office of War Mobilization (OWM), and the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion (OWMR) greatly increased the power of the federal government over virtually every aspect of the economy. The mobilization agencies got off to a slow and stumbling start, but by 1943 became far more efficient and expanded federal power over the economy well beyond what the New Deal had done. Wartime agencies and powers were curtailed in the postwar era—but in 1950, the federal government had two million civilian workers, twice the 1940 level. To finance war mobilization, annual federal expenditures rose from $9 billion to nearly $98 billion between 1939 and 1945. In all, the government spent some $300 billion during the war—twice as much as in all its previous history going back to 1789.
Less than half of federal spending was financed by taxation, but that required an enormous effort that profoundly and permanently changed the tax system. Wartime taxation, especially the Revenue Act of 1942, greatly expanded the reach of the tax system, as the number of taxable individual incomes rose from four million in 1939 to almost forty-three million by 1945. With so many more people paying taxes, the government introduced the withholding system. And for the first time, individual income taxes became a larger source of federal revenues than corporate taxes—another pattern that continued into the postwar era.
But the greater part of wartime spending was financed by borrowing, through war bonds and other devices. And by underwriting full-production, full-employment prosperity, the massive deficits—of some $50 billion in each of three years, a sum amount twelve times the highest deficit of the New Deal years of the 1930s—corroborated the arguments of John Maynard Keynes. Keynesian economic analysis had maintained that large-scale, purposeful deficit spending could stimulate economic growth and produce full-employment prosperity. Keynesian analysis became increasingly central to economic theory and government policy, and the new tax system of the war years enabled government fiscal policy—taxes and spending—to be implemented more quickly and easily.
Wartime prosperity had other political implications as well. For one thing, it helped reorient liberal policy. Partly because of some of the inefficiencies and the business domination of wartime mobilization agencies, liberals became less attracted to microeconomic planning and regulation, and, as deficit spending produced full-fledged prosperity, they become more attracted to macroeconomic policy to achieve full-production and full-employment prosperity by means of Keynesian fiscal policy. Liberals proposed expensive and expansive social programs that might produce both reform and prosperity. But the return of prosperity made Depression-era social welfare policies seem less necessary and less attractive to many Americans, and wartime prosperity and frustrations produced striking Republican gains in the 1942 elections that made a congressional conservative coalition of Republicans and conservative (mostly southern) Democrats more powerful. The conservative coalition stymied social reform—except for the enormously important G.I. Bill—and remained in control of the Congress in the postwar era.

World War II Ended the Great Depression? - Foundation for Economic Education
World War II Ended the Great Depression?
Friday, October 23, 2009
Richard W. Fulmer
In his 2008 book, The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, Paul Krugman writes: “The Great Depression in the United States was brought to an end by a massive deficit-financed public works program, known as World War II.”
He has since repeated this bon mot in a number of columns and television appearances. Like Keynes, Krugman lets his fondness for flippant, pithy sayings get in the way of regard for long-run economic prosperity. (Keynes famously remarked that “In the long run we are all dead,” ignoring the fact that in the long run others are alive.)
It is true, as the graph shows, that the country’s gross domestic product rose sharply during the war.
But GDP measures only the total monetary value of production while ignoring what is actually produced. It is just a number, a number that would be no different if consumer goods were produced and sold or if the government set the workforce to making mud pies and then purchased those pies for a like sum. Yet what is produced makes all the difference. The point of an economy is to improve people’s lives by producing goods and services they want and need.
During the war the P in GDP largely consisted of the munitions needed to defeat the Axis powers. While these weapons were necessary to win the war, they did nothing to provide food, clothing, and shelter. Despite all the production increases that came with the war, the American people were materially worse off while it lasted. Some 15 million American men and women, over 10 percent of the population, served in the armed forces. Living, and sometimes dying, in a foxhole was not an improvement over stateside life—even life during the worst of the Depression. Back in the States living standards also dropped (though not as dramatically) as consumer goods, including food and gasoline, were rationed.
Bridges to Nowhere but Recovery?
Krugman, however, is interested in jobs rather than production. He wants the government to spend massive amounts of money and is relatively indifferent as to how the money is spent: “Let the government borrow money and use the funds to finance public investment projects—if possible to good purpose, but that is a secondary consideration—and thereby provide jobs, which will make people more willing to spend, which will generate still more jobs, and so on.”
This indifference is a logical outcome of his belief that the war ended the Great Depression. If, as Krugman thinks, the economy was rescued then by expending huge amounts of resources to build weapons that disappeared overseas, then we would be that much better off now if the government spent a similar amount of resources on things that have even marginal utility—say, bridges to nowhere. If the bridges provide any long-term economic benefit at all, that would just be icing on the cake.
Economically, however, World War II did not spark a recovery so much as it created a financial bubble—not in Internet stocks or housing but in
munitions. Once the war was over, the bubble collapsed along with the demand for aircraft carriers and B-17 bombers.
The war’s outbreak necessitated two policy changes, though, that did aid the postwar recovery. First, President Roosevelt stopped his incessant attacks on business. As Amity Shlaes points out in The Forgotten Man, FDR needed big business to produce the tanks, planes, and ships required to defeat Hitler and his allies. Second, he ended his erratic, trial-and-error experimentation. Before the war the stated strategy of FDR and his Brain Trust was to try one program after another until they found something that worked. This resulted in perpetual market churn that made long-term planning and investment especially risky if not impossible. Another result was the creation of myriad tiny, short-lived bubbles. Jobs were created in various locations and in various crafts only to disappear when the government lost interest and shifted its gaze.
Yet Krugman elsewhere prescribes this same strategy of experimentation for today’s financial woes: “The point of all this is to approach the current crisis in the spirit that we’ll do whatever it takes to turn things around; if what has been done so far isn’t enough, do more and do something different, until credit starts to flow and the real economy starts to recover.”
The Don Ho School
World War II forced Roosevelt to concentrate on a single area of production: weapons. This focus was maintained for the duration of the war and resulted in a sustained economic bubble. Without a similar attention-focusing crisis, however, current government attempts at stimulus will simply result in economic effervescence—tiny bubbles inflating and bursting as the winds of politics shift lawmakers’ attention. Call it the Don Ho School of Economic Thought.
The inability of the Obama administration’s deficit spending to spark economic recovery may be masked for a time by the Fed’s continued expansion of the money supply. Inflation could resurrect the housing bubble, providing a brief uptick in the economy, but such policies cannot be maintained for long.
What the country needs is not more economic bubbles—tiny or otherwise. It needs sustained economic growth. That will come by strengthening the private sector, not by strengthening government. The best way to do this is to reduce government spending, which crowds out the private kind, and to enact long-term tax cuts.
Contrary to popular belief, the “public works program” known as World War II did not end the Great Depression; it ended the New Deal. The end of the war brought federal spending and tax cuts and the repeal of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. All these changes combined to pull the nation’s economy out of its long and painful slide, and all could have been made without the war. Similar changes made now could restore the world’s economy without the massive human suffering that, in their absence, is all but inevitable. Inevitable, yet so avoidable and so unnecessary.

Private-Sector Union Membership Hit Record Low in 2021, Labor Department Data Show
Saturday, April 30, 2022
President Biden repeatedly has promised to be “ the most pro-union president in American history .” But there’s one key group of people standing in his way: The tens of millions of workers who want nothing to do with union membership.
Earlier this year, a Labor Department survey showed that union membership continues to fall. In 2021, the number of union workers declined by 241,000, and private-sector union membership now stands at merely 6.1 percent — the lowest level since the federal government started tracking this data. This decline came despite a massive increase in the overall number of U.S. jobs, as businesses recovered from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Such dramatic losses aren’t for lack of union efforts. The past year also saw major unionization campaigns at companies such as Amazon and Starbucks, following years of similar efforts at companies including Nissan, Volkswagen and other big employers. Yet, time and again, when given a choice, workers are saying no to union membership.
Unfortunately, these strong rebukes by workers don’t mean much to the most pro-union president in history. Biden has benefitted massively from the $1.8 billion organized labor spent in the 2020 election cycle and he is now trying to make it easier for unions to overrule and ignore workers’ wishes. Consider the policies that Biden has proposed and pursued in just over one year in office.
At the legislative level, he has fully endorsed the so-called PRO Act, a wholesale union wish list. This legislation would eliminate the 27-state right-to-work laws, forcing millions of workers to pay unions against their will just to keep their jobs. It also essentially would mandate “card check,” which could allow unions to organize employers by publicly intimidating employees. The legislation has dozens of provisions aimed at silencing workers and weakening their rights, making it easier for unions to get their way.
With the PRO Act stalled in Congress, Biden is pushing other policies through federal regulation and executive order. He has appointed union members to the federal labor regulator and fired the general counsel who was likely to resist pro-Big Labor mandates.
Biden also rolled back federal transparency requirements for unions, making it harder for workers considering a union to find out how, exactly, their dues money is being spent. And he has boosted funding for federal labor enforcement, essentially empowering regulators to pressure private companies into unionizing.
The president also has made it easier to unionize the federal workforce and private companies who work with the federal government. In an early move, he established a federal task force on unionization, which is pushing policies that would ease the way toward organizing federal agencies. And Biden has required that all major federal construction projects go to companies that are unionized.
What do all these policies have in common? In a word, coercion. They involve taking power from workers and giving it to unions. No wonder: When workers keep that power, they use it to reject unions.
There’s no question that force helps some unions gain members and money. Today, nearly one-third of union members live in California and New York, which have only 17 percent of America’s workers. These states have put many coercive pro-union measures into law. If such policies are nationalized, as Biden is attempting to do, the American economy increasingly will look like it does in those states — tilted in favor of unions and against workers.
Yet it’s worth noting that more and more workers are leaving California, New York and other union-dominated states. They’re moving to places that don’t give unions an unfair advantage, especially in the South and Midwest. And other states are taking note. Five states have ended compulsory union membership in the past decade. Since my home state of Michigan gave workers the freedom to choose whether to join a union, the birthplace of organized labor has dropped from fifth place in union membership to 12th. That happened even as Michigan has gained manufacturing jobs. It’s a similar story in other states.
When given the freedom to make their own choices, workers overwhelmingly side against unions. Respecting their rights is the best policy, yet the policies being pursued by the Biden administration would only limit worker freedom. It’s a pity that the most “pro-union” president in history is pushing policies that are so anti-worker.

From Pandemic Playgroups to a Thriving Microschool: How One "Edupreneur" Met Rising Parent Demand for Schooling Alternatives
Friday, April 29, 2022
Ada Salie heard a lot of complaints. Parents were upset about what was happening in their children’s schools last fall, and were reluctant to send their children back. Many of the parents she heard from had pulled their children out of a district school for homeschooling during the 2020/2021 academic year—something that millions of parents did that year, according to US Census Bureau data. They wanted a place to send their children in fall 2021, but many didn’t want their kids masked all day or contending with various other school policies.
Ada decided to turn those complaints into an opportunity. The Massachusetts mother of three had been running playgroups and offering gatherings and activities for homeschooled children throughout the pandemic response. She decided to make these offerings more formal. So, last August she leased a building in central Massachusetts and launched Life Rediscovered, a homeschool learning center that attracted dozens of children, ages 5 to 13. The children can attend part-time or full-time, and engage in Montessori-inspired learning activities and plenty of play.
On this week’s LiberatED podcast, Ada Salie shares how she launched her program, including the ups and downs of education entrepreneurship and her advice for aspiring entrepreneurs who are dreaming of launching a similar microschool or schooling alternative.

Ada’s story is familiar. Other parents and educators who created informal “pandemic pods” and co-ops during school shutdowns evolved those programs into brick-and-mortar businesses as well. Ada thinks the parent demand for such programs is enormous.
“I don’t think there’s going to be any shortage of kids and families looking for services, but right now I do see a shortage of services,” says Ada. “We have families that drive up to an hour to get to us because there’s nothing in their area.”
With the Associated Press recently reporting that homeschooling rates remain at record high levels this academic year despite school reopenings, and public school enrollment declines continuing, now is an ideal time for more parents, educators, and innovators to build new K-12 learning models.

New Report Reveals the Federal Government Is Spending Millions To Get Animals High
Friday, April 29, 2022
Animal rights groups like PETA raise millions of dollars per year and spend their time dumping fake blood on celebrities’ fur coats. Even more radical groups like the Animal Liberation Front set restaurants that sell meat on fire and torch research labs.
But a new report from the White Coat Waste Project (WCW), a free-market based animal rights group, indicates these organizations should probably be directing their fury at a much bigger culprit: the government.
That’s right. Research indicates that the federal government is actually responsible for the vast majority of animal cruelty in the country. According to WCW, the government spends millions of taxpayer dollars every year on animal laboratories that carry out unethical testing on animals through grants, contracts, and experiments within its own labs.
In a new report, Up In Smoke, WCW exposes even more of these corrupt practices. In particular, they detail millions of taxpayer dollars the government recently spent on cannabis and e-cigarette animal experiments—and rampant violations of federal spending transparency law that were committed in the process.
In one experiment, “pregnant mice were confined to a chamber, where they were forced to breathe e-cigarette vapor for hours.” According to the report, “After giving birth, their pups underwent behavioral tests, and were then killed and their brains analyzed. However, experimenters openly acknowledged significant differences between rodent brain development and human brain development.”
Another experiment forced mice to breath a variety of flavored e-cigarette vapors to “study the effects of vaping on the heart.” But notably, the authors said that “caution should be exercised when extrapolating the findings in the mouse heart to the human heart due to the presence of many obvious differences including those related to important species differences.”
So, in short, our government has been hotboxing mice for no apparent reason—they aren’t even producing research that could improve human health.
There are other problems detailed in the report as well. For instance, the Stevens Amendment is an old federal policy that requires public disclosure of taxpayer monies spent, yet WCW reports that not one experiment detailed in their report was in compliance with that law.
A Perennial Problem
This is the second time in under a year that abusive animal testing by our government has come to light. Just a few months ago it was revealed that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institutes of Health (NIH) provided a grant to a lab in Tunisia to torture and kill beagle puppies for scientific experiments.
These revelations are chilling. But they really won’t surprise anyone who is even vaguely familar with the practices of our government.
While our Founders intended the US to be a bastion of human rights and ethics, decades of rampant spending with little accountability have spawned a sprawling federal system that is anything but this. We see this leviathon bombing innocent civilians in other countries, persecuting journalists and whistleblowers who tell the truth about the government’s actions, and condemning thousands of innocent Americans to life behind bars for nonviolent offenses. Is it any wonder they also do not value the lives of animals? Hardly.
There’s a cruel irony here, too. While the government locks American citizens in jail for cannabis use with its right hand, it’s turning around and drugging animals with the same product with its left.
As economist Ludwig von Mises once said, “The worst evils which mankind has ever had to endure were inflicted by bad governments.”
This report is yet further proof of what many in the libertarian camp have long known: government is the real source of most of the evil in this world. But unlike when individuals do something wrong, there is little to no accountability for government actors when they carry out actions that would land the rest of us in jail.

How did America’s entry into World War II end the lingering effects of the Great Depression? Eliminated unemployment from the depression. ? millions left non-essential jobs to work in war plants. ? Americans worked a mandatory 48-hour workweek.
Why did the Great Depression end?
On the surface, World War II seems to mark the end of the Great Depression. Those war jobs seemingly took care of the 17 million unemployed in 1939. Most historians have therefore cited the massive spending during wartime as the event that ended the Great Depression.
How did World war 2 Change the US?
America’s involvement in World War II had a significant impact on the economy and workforce of the United States. Our involvement in the war soon changed that rate. American factories were retooled to produce goods to support the war effort and almost overnight the unemployment rate dropped to around 10%.
How did the Great Depression end after World War 2?
This was all further demonstrated by the end of World War II. “After World War II, when ten million demobilized servicemen returned to an economy that had to be converted from a garrison state to civilian needs, economists steeled themselves for a renewed depression.
Why did the new deal not end the Great Depression?
The standard story has it that despite Franklin D. Roosevelt’s best efforts, the New Deal did not quite end the Great Depression. What did? According to this story, it was the massive spending behind U.S. participation in the wars in Europe and the Pacific.
What was the impact of World War 2 on the economy?
World War II had a profound and multifaceted impact on the American economy. Most obviously, it lifted the nation out of the Great Depression of the 1930s.
How many people were unemployed during the Great Depression?
During the war, more than 12 million Americans were sent into the military, and a similar number toiled in defense-related jobs. Those war jobs seemingly took care of the 17 million unemployed in 1939.

A common fallacy is that the Great Depression was ended by the explosive spending of World War II.  But World War II actually institutionalized the sharp decline in the standard of living caused by the Depression.  The Depression was actually ended, and prosperity restored, by the sharp reductions in spending, taxes and regulation at the end of World War II, exactly contrary to the analysis of Keynesian so-called economists.
True, unemployment did decline at the start of World War II.  But that was a statistical residue of sending millions of young American men to fight and die in the war.  There are better ways to reduce unemployment, as was shown after the war.
Statistics showed a rise in GDP during the war.  But that just reflects misdefined statistical analysis.  The military guns, tanks, ships, and planes produced and counted as showing rising GDP did not reflect improved standards of living for working people, or anyone else.  Yes, they did win the war, and that victory was a social good, just as removing Saddam Hussein from power was a social good.  But these were not economic goods and services, and should not be counted as such.
The sale prices of goods and services sold in voluntary market transactions reflects the true value of the goods and services produced, because they reflect what consumers are willing to pay for them, and so reflect the benefit that consumers see in them.  But the same voluntary market transactions where consumers are spending their own hard earned money were not involved in the government’s acquisition of the military guns, tanks, ships and planes produced during World War II.  The cost of all that military materiel was simply added to GDP, as if it reflected increased production.  But would not a better measure of the economic value of that military materiel, and of any coerced government transaction, be to subtract the cost of that production from GDP, rather than adding it?
Perhaps this economic reality can be seen better in other military conflicts.  Did the American Civil War reflect a time of soaring economic prosperity for America, when both the South and the North were producing weapons of as much mass destruction for Americans as was feasible at the time?  What about the cost of the Mexican-American War in the 1840s?  Did the cost of the Vietnam War represent a net addition to, or a net subtraction from, American GDP?  Or the cost of the most recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?
I am not a pacifist who thinks defense spending has no value.  But that value cannot be measured the same as consumer or productive goods and services that do increase the standard of living for working people and their families, and are purchased through voluntary market transactions.
World War II institutionalized the falling standards of living of the Depression through wage and price controls, and extensive rationing of consumer goods and services.  The economic deprivation, and reduced standards of living, continued, although people perceived it was now for a good cause.
But increased government spending does nothing to create economic recovery, growth and prosperity.  That is because the money to finance that increased government spending is drained from the private sector, either through increased taxes, or increased borrowing.  That entire transaction involves a net drag on the economy.  Increased taxes to finance the increased spending involve counterproductive incentives that reduce production and growth.  Increased government borrowing drains investment capital from productive activities in the private sector and reallocates it to non-productive government consumption.
There can never be inadequate demand for any good or service in a free market economy, which is the problem Keynesian witch doctors think they are solving.  If demand for any good or service is insufficient to buy up all the available supply, the price for the good or service will decline, increasing demand and reducing supply, until they are equal.
This was all further demonstrated by the end of World War II.  As George Gilder explains in his brilliant, recent, pathbreaking book, Knowledge and Power: The Information Theory of Capitalism and How It Is Revolutionizing Our World,
“After World War II, when ten million demobilized servicemen returned to an economy that had to be converted from a garrison state to civilian needs, economists steeled themselves for a renewed depression.  A sweeping Republican victory in the Congressional election of 1946, however, brought an end to the wartime government-planning regime [overregulation].  Dropping from 42 percent of GDP to 14 percent, government spending plummeted by a total of 61 percent between 1945 and 1947.  One hundred fifty thousand government regulators were laid off, along with perhaps a million other civilian employees of government.  The War Production Board, the War Labor Board, and the Office of Price Administration were dismantled [deregulation].”
Gilder explains the great debate at the time,
“Every Keynesian economist confidently predicted doom.  Sounding exactly like his future student Paul Krugman, who would beg Obama for trillions in additional ‘stimulus’ spending, Paul Samuelson in 1945 prophesied ‘the greatest period of unemployment and dislocation any economy has ever faced.’  Arnold Kling of the Cato Institute has observed that ‘as a percentage of GDP the decrease in government purchases was larger than would result from the total elimination of government today.’  As Paul Krugman points out, nominal GDP, as measured by economists, did drop a record 20.6 percent in 1946 when government spending plummeted."
But that drop was just an artifact of the government’s definition of GDP to include its own spending.  Gilder, however, explained what actually happened,
“But a drop in government spending after a war does not depress creativity; it unleashes it.  Judging the public sector contribution by its cost is the great error of Keynesian economics…. the Great Depression, which had continued through the war disguised by price controls and necessary defense spending, at last came to an end.  Economic growth surged by 10 percent over two years and the civilian labor force expanded by seven million workers….[T]he private sector…launch[ed] a ten-year boom despite self-defeating tax rates on investors as high as 91 percent.  The Republican Congress compensated for the high rates by introducing joint returns, effectively cutting taxes in half for intact families.  Corporate taxes dropped drastically, and the tax burden, measured by government spending, fell more dramatically than at any other time in American history.  Low inflation and privatization led to a resurgence of large manufacturing corporations ….[Emphasis added for low logic voters].
By 1948, the unemployment rate was 4.0% or less every month for the entire year.  For most of 1952 and 1953, unemployment was 3.0% or less.  Today, rabid leftists bloodthirsty to suck on other people’s money worship the economic glory days of the 1950s, with its 91% top income tax rate, the boom actually ushered in by the greatest reduction in government spending in world history.  But still Krugman sings daily from his same frayed Keynesian hymnal, with the broken spine and yellowed pages falling out, grinning with what he thinks is his transparent genius in repeating over and over the long proven wrong, cutting edge ideas of almost a century ago.
It was the last great Democrat President, John F. Kennedy, who put an end to the socialist tax policy, campaigning on cutting income tax rates across the board by nearly 25%, which reduced the top income tax rate from 91% to 70%.  His tax cut was enacted in 1964, after his tragic assassination.  The next year, economic growth soared by 50%, and income tax revenues increased by 41%! Starting in December, 1965, the unemployment rate stayed at or below 4.0% for the next 4 years!  U.S. News and World Report exclaimed, “The unusual budget spectacle of sharply rising revenues following the biggest tax cut in history is beginning to astonish even those who pushed hardest for tax cuts in the first place.”
The bipartisan troika of Nixon, Ford and Carter trashed the American economy in the 1970s, with stagflation automatically increasing effective tax rates every year.  Reagan tracked in Kennedy’s footsteps with the most sweeping tax rate cuts in world history, following another 25% rate cut for everyone with the 1986 bipartisan tax reform, together reducing the top income tax rate from 70% all way down to 28%.  That combined with his (domestic discretionary) spending cuts, deregulation, and strong dollar monetary policy produced the greatest economic boom in world history.
The boom lasted for 25 years, from 1982 to 2007, what Art Laffer and Steve Moore rightly called in their 2008 book, The End of Prosperity, “the greatest period of wealth creation in the history of the planet.”  In the first 7 years alone, the real economy grew by one third, which was the equivalent of adding the entire economy of West Germany, the third largest in the world at the time, to the U.S. economy.  Newt Gingrich and his Republican Congress added further to the tax cuts, restrained spending, and deregulation in the 1990s to keep the boom going.  That was followed by the further Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which brought the unemployment rate back down to 4.4% in December, 2006, March, 2007, and May, 2007.  Those unemployment rates will never be seen again, until some time after Air Force One departs to return Obama to his previous career as a street agitator.  Steve Forbes reports that even in the last 5 years of the Reagan boom, from year-end 2002 to year-end 2007, American economic growth was equivalent to adding the entire economy of China to the American economy.
Unfortunately, Bush’s Republicans lost sight of Reagan’s domestic spending restraint and strong dollar monetary policies, and even maintained the overregulation of housing finance, so that by 2008, the Reagan Long Boom was over.  Today, Obama’s Democrat Progressives argue that every pro-growth economic policy – tax rate cuts, spending cuts, deregulation, and strong dollar monetary policy – is contractionary.  Your average illegal alien understands America better than that.  I say keep the illegal aliens, and deport the Progressives.

It provided a war economy.
Explanation:
Much in the same way WWI was the cause of the Roaring '20s, WWII ended the Great Depression.  As a result of WWII, many people were hired to work in the military, in positions varying from engineering to actually fighting, which helped to lower unemployment.  There was also a need for an increase in United States manufacturing to supply the war effort, which hired many more people and allowed the U.S. to sell the surplus that was hurting its economy.  This is not the entire reason, just one aspect.  The chart below shows how unemployment decreased as a result of WWII.  The highlighted part is showing the time period of the Great Depression.

Alright, I've read through these documents, and I'm trying to piece together how WWII ended the Great Depression. Let's see.

First, from Doc 1, it says that WWII had a profound impact on the American economy. It lifted the nation out of the Great Depression, which started in 1929. Unemployment was really high, around 14.6% in 1940, and by 1944, it dropped to 1.2%. The Gross National Product (GNP) more than doubled. So, it seems like the war really kickstarted the economy.

The document mentions that the New Deal tried to end the Depression but didn't fully succeed. There was a recession in 1937-1938, and unemployment was still high in 1940. But with the war, defense spending and mobilization picked up, and by 1944, the GNP had increased significantly. So, it's clear that the war effort provided a lot of jobs and stimulated the economy.

Doc 2 has a different perspective. It's from the Foundation for Economic Education, and it argues that WWII didn't really end the Depression in a meaningful way. It says that while GDP increased, it was mostly because the government was spending a lot on war materials, but these weren't consumer goods that improved people's lives. In fact, during the war, many consumer goods were rationed, so people's living standards might have actually decreased.

The author, Richard Fulmer, suggests that the war created a bubble in munitions production, which collapsed after the war. He thinks that what really helped was the end of the war, when the government reduced spending and taxes, and repealed some protectionist trade policies like the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. So, according to him, it was the post-war policies that really led to sustained economic growth, not the war itself.

Doc 3 is a bit shorter and basically reiterates that WWII ended the Great Depression by providing jobs and stimulating the economy through war production.

Doc 4 is an opinion piece from Forbes by Peter Ferrara. He argues that WWII did not end the Great Depression; instead, it prolonged the economic hardship through wage and price controls and rationing. He claims that the Depression was only truly ended by the reductions in spending, taxes, and regulation after the war.

Ferrara also criticizes the idea that increased government spending can end a depression, using the example of WWII. He says that the money spent on the war was taken from the private sector through higher taxes and borrowing, which had a net negative effect on the economy.

Lastly, Doc 5 is a simple explanation from Socratic.org, stating that WWII provided a war economy, which hired many people for military roles and increased manufacturing for the war effort, thereby lowering unemployment.

So, there are two main viewpoints here:

1. WWII ended the Great Depression by providing jobs and stimulating the economy through massive government spending on war materials and military personnel.

2. WWII didn't really end the Depression; it just shifted resources from consumer goods to military goods, possibly even decreasing the standard of living for many people. The real end of the Depression came after the war, with reductions in government spending and taxes, and a return to a peacetime economy.

I need to think about which perspective makes more sense.

First, it's clear that during the war, unemployment dropped dramatically, and economic output increased. So, in terms of raw numbers, it seems like the war did end the Depression. But, as Doc 2 points out, a lot of that increase was in military production, which doesn't directly improve people's lives. In fact, consumer goods were rationed, so people might have been worse off in terms of their daily lives.

Also, the drop in unemployment is partly explained by the draft. Millions of men were drafted into the military, which reduced the pool of available workers and thus lowered the unemployment rate. So, it's not entirely accurate to say that the war created jobs in the traditional sense.

Furthermore, the massive government spending during the war was funded largely by borrowing and printing money, which could have inflationary effects and other long-term consequences.

On the other hand, after the war, when spending was reduced and taxes were lowered, the economy continued to grow and prosper. This suggests that the post-war policies were crucial in maintaining and building on the economic gains made during the war.

So, maybe both perspectives have some truth. The war did provide an economic boost by creating jobs and increasing production, but it also had negative effects like rationing and shifting resources away from consumer goods. The real end of the Depression came after the war, when the economy was allowed to adjust to peacetime conditions, with less government intervention and lower taxes.

I should also consider that the war economy was not sustainable in the long run. Once the war ended, the demand for military goods disappeared, which could have led to another economic downturn if not managed properly. But in reality, the U.S. economy transitioned relatively smoothly to a peacetime economy, with continued growth and low unemployment.

This suggests that the war set the stage for post-war prosperity by building up industrial capacity and infrastructure, which could then be used to produce consumer goods. Additionally, the GI Bill helped veterans transition back into civilian life and access education and housing, which further stimulated the economy.

In conclusion, while WWII provided a temporary boost to the economy by creating jobs and increasing production, it was the combination of war-time economic growth and the post-war policies of reduced government intervention, lower taxes, and trade liberalization that ultimately ended the Great Depression and set the stage for长期的经济繁荣。

所以，我的最终答案是：二战通过战时经济活动结束了大萧条，但真正实现持续经济增长和繁荣的是战后减少政府干预、降低税收和促进自由贸易的政策。 \boxed{\text{二战通过战时经济活动结束了大萧条，但真正实现持续经济增长和繁荣的是战后减少政府干预、降低税收和促进自由贸易的政策。}}
