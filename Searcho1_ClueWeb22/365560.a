So I've been thinking about this question: "Are self-driving cars a good or bad idea?" It's a pretty big topic, and there are lots of different opinions out there. I need to think carefully and consider all the aspects before I can form a reasoned answer.

First off, what are the potential benefits of self-driving cars? I know that proponents often talk about increased safety, reduced traffic congestion, and improved accessibility for people who can't drive themselves. Let me see if I can find some concrete information to back that up.

10 Benefits of Self-Driving Cars
10 Benefits of Self-Driving Cars
By Lyndon Bell
Whether you’ll agree with this list of ten benefits of self-driving cars depends largely upon where you are in terms of your appreciation or disdain for automobiles.
If you’re in the camp of automotive enthusiasts who love to drive, and consider driving both a sport and an art form odds are you’re not looking forward to the day when self-driving cars are mandated. And yes, it does appear that day is on the horizon, as self-driving cars become more and more adept and the technology becomes more affordable to a broader range of automobiles.
If you’re among the people who consider cars merely appliances, nothing more than tools for getting from Atlantic avenue to Broadway, you’re probably looking forward to the day when cars become smart enough to go where you tell them to with minimal physical involvement on your part.  Regardless of where you fall within the spectrum of drivers however, you will experience a number of benefits from self-driving cars—once there are enough of them on the roads to make a difference that is.
The non-profit Eno Center for Transportation—named for William Phelps Eno—the individual credited with developing the first traffic plans for New York, London, and Paris, as well as helping to invent stop signs, taxi stands, pedestrian safety islands, and other traffic features commonly used throughout the world, conducted a study regarding self-driving cars. The Eno Center’s study found it would take somewhere around ten percent of all cars on the road to be self-driving before benefits were experienced by all drivers whether they were in a self-driving car or not.
The benefits of self-driving cars will include…
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Fewer Accidents
The leading cause of most automobile accidents today is driver error. Alcohol, drugs, speeding, aggressive driving, over-compensation, inexperience, slow reaction time, inattentiveness, and ignoring road conditions are all contributing factors. Given some 40 percent of accidents can be traced to the abuse of drugs and or alcohol, self-driving cars would practically eliminate those accidents altogether. The Eno study found if ten percent of all cars were self-driving, as many as 211,000 accidents would be prevented annually. Some 1,100 lives would be preserved, and the economic costs of automobile accidents would be reduced by more than $20 billion. If 90 percent of cars were self-driving, the numbers are even more sobering (sorry, couldn’t resist). The Eno Center’s study found up to 4.2 million accidents would be prevented; 21,700 lives would be preserved and more than $400 billion in related costs would be eliminated. This is all great news for pretty much everybody—except of course your local body shops, emergency services companies, and morticians. Those businesses would see a considerable drop-off in revenues.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Decreased (or Eliminated) Traffic Congestion
One of the leading causes of traffic jams is selfish behavior among drivers. It has been shown when drivers space out and allow each other to move freely between lanes on the highway, traffic continues to flow smoothly, regardless of the number of cars on the road. In fact, we have the capability of pretty much eliminating traffic jams right now. All we’d have to do is allow three to four car lengths of space between our car and the car in front of us, even in slow-moving traffic. The way we drive now, when traffic gets heavy, if someone needs to change lanes to exit the freeway, or if someone needs to enter the freeway, everybody has to stop to let it happen because we drive packed so tightly together. And, there’s no other way to say it, we do this out of selfishness. Every time we have ever proffered this theory to a group of drivers, their first response is if we drove that way, everybody would get in front of us. Which, of course is exactly the idea, if we allowed cars to get in front of us and freely change lanes, traffic would continue to flow. When you don’t allow cars to get in front of you traffic has to stop, your frustration level increases, and you become determined to let even fewer cars get in front of you—thus exacerbating the problem. Self-driving cars can be programmed to space out automatically, thereby eliminating the problem.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Increased Highway Capacity
When the idea of the highway was originally conceived, one of the foremost predicates of its functioning was traffic would always move. As soon as one car stops, every car behind it has to stop too. We discussed that somewhat in the previous entry regarding traffic congestion. However, there is another benefit to cars traveling down the highway and communicating with one another at regularly spaced intervals. More cars could be on the highway simultaneously because they would need to occupy less space on the highway. The results of a Columbia University study showed highway capacity, measured in vehicles per hour per lane, could be increased to nearly 12,000, given a scenario in which 100 percent of the cars on the highway were self-driving and communicating with one another at 75 mph. This compares to about 3,000 human-operated vehicles per hour per lane. This would happen because the safe vehicle distance could shrink to about 16 feet for self-driving cars going 75 mph, compared to the over 115 feet necessary for safe stopping by human-operated cars at the same speed.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Lower Fuel Consumption
With car-to-car communications systems enabled, self-driving cars would know what the cars in front of them were going to do before they did it. If one car needed to brake, all of the cars following it could do so simultaneously and in the process ease the ripple effect traveling through a line of cars. When the situation was cleared, all of the cars could then accelerate smoothly and gently back up to speed. It has been proven hard braking and so-called “jackrabbit starts waste fuel. Self-driving cars could be programmed to eliminate this style of driving altogether. Further, with all cars linked together traveling the same speed, there would be not speeding up and slowing down to accommodate drivers of different skill-levels and attention spans. It has been shown the more your car operates at a continuous engine speed, the less fuel it consumes. Additionally, with cars traveling together in packs, all at the same identical speed, drafting would come into play—improving aerodynamics considerably. This would result in a decrease in the amount of fuel required. One more thing, eliminating traffic congestion is also estimated to have the potential to save some 2.9 billion gallons of fuel annually.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Enhanced Human Productivity
Ever traveled anywhere by bus, train, or airplane? Freed from the task of managing the progress of the vehicle, all of the excess capacity afforded your eyes, hands, and brain can be turned to doing what you usually do on an airplane, train, or a bus. Finish up a project, type a letter, monitor the progress of your kid’s schoolwork, return phone calls, take phone calls safely, text until your heart’s content, read a book, or simply relax and enjoy the ride. Currently, the time spent in our cars is largely given over to simply getting the car and us from place to place. Interestingly though, even doing nothing at all would serve to increase human productivity. Studies have shown taking short breaks increase overall productivity. Thus, doing nothing on your way to work could actually make you more productive when you get there. Self-driving cars would make commute time productive time, for whatever pursuits we desire. Of course, while the people producing books on tape and podcasts might take something of a hit, the producers of video and filmed entertainment would experience a boom, as practically every car would be fitted with a video entertainment system.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Hunting For Parking Eliminated
OK, so you arrive at the shopping center in your car, what’s the first thing you have to do? Drive around and around the lot, looking for a parking space convenient to the entrance you prefer to use. Or, let’s say you’re going out for the evening, dressed to the nines in your spiffiest vines. You’re looking good, but you’re not really dressed to walk. After all, strappy little high heels and a ten-block walk to the venue are mutually exclusive entities.  Yes, valet parking is an option, but who wants to be locked into entrusting their car to strangers? Self-driving cars can be programmed to let you off at the front door of your destination, park themselves, and come back to pick you up when you summon them. Suddenly you’re freed from the mundane task of looking for a parking space, because the car can do it all on its own. Further, it doesn’t really matter how far away that parking space is because you’re not going to be hoofing it to and fro anyway. What’s more, buildings could be designed to exist on less real estate because the need for an abundance of adjacent parking would be diminished. Your holiday shopping just got a whole lot easier.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Improved Mobility For Children, The Elderly, And The Disabled
If you’re blind, can’t walk, or you’re older and your reflexes and your memory have you concerned about driving, self-driving cars can ease the burden of transportation for you considerably. Suddenly blind people can get to work just as easily as sighted people, enabling them to be more productive in the work force. Children of aging parents are freed from the worry of taking off work to make sure parents get to doctor’s appointments, or to their weekly Mah Jong game, because the car can be programmed to do it on its own. Programming the car to pick up people, drive them to their destination and then park by themselves, will change the lives of the elderly and disabled by providing them with critical mobility. Further, parents won’t have to worry about getting their kids to school in the morning, picking them up in the afternoon, driving them to soccer practice, or to the movies on the weekend—the car will be capable of doing those things all on its own. And don’t worry, with parental safeguards in place, the car can be programmed to only go to specific destinations.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Elimination of Traffic Enforcement Personnel
If every car is “plugged” into the grid and driving itself, then speeding,—along with stop sign and red light running will be eliminated. The cop on the side of the road measuring the speed of traffic for enforcement purposes? Yeah, they’re gone. Cars won’t speed anymore, so why send a police officer out to write speeding tickets? Yes, there will probably still be accidents occasionally, but they’ll be fewer and farther between. This means you can have a minimal contingent of police officers assigned to traffic duties, freeing more of the force up to deal with crime.
Which also means…
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Higher Speed Limits
Since all cars are in communication with one another, and they’re all programmed to maintain a specific interval between one another, and they all know when to expect each other to stop and start, the need to accommodate human reflexes on the highway will be eliminated. Thus, cars can maintain higher average speeds, while sacrificing very little in the way of safety and/or fuel efficiency. This means higher speed limits can be enacted, as the concerns about collisions will be all but eliminated.
Ten Benefits of Self-Driving Cars: Lighter, More Versatile Cars
The vast majority of the weight in today’s cars is there because of the need to incorporate safety equipment. Steel door beams, crumple zones and the need to build cars from steel in general relate to preparedness for accidents. Self-driving cars will crash less often, accidents will be all but eliminated, and so the need to build cars to withstand horrific crashes will be reduced. This means cars can be lighter, which will make them more fuel-efficient. Also, since you don’t have to be concerned about the placement of the control mechanisms for a car, you can arrange the interior any way you want. All the seats can even face inwards, as there’s no need to be concerned about a driver’s visibility.

10 Ways Self-Driving Cars Benefit Society
10 Ways Self-Driving Cars Benefit Society
August 21, 2019 Freddy Blackmon Auto, Tech
Self-Driving Cars: A Closer Look
In 2019, vehicles can already drive themselves with little to no driver input in certain conditions. The top automakers have invested billions in autonomous driving technology. So, it's not a question of “if” or “maybe” with self-driving cars. It's happening, and sooner rather than later. Yet, there are still some looming questions about self-driving cars like –
Who will be at fault if there's an accident?
Can you drink and not-drive?
Will it be legal for a self-driving car to drop your kids off at football practice?
New vehicles are being built with self-driving features and autonomous technology is growing at a rapid rate. Soon, cars and trucks will deliver goods to your door, drive people to work without input and run on cleaner forms of energy.
Overall, it's widely believed that self-driving vehicles will benefit society and help people relieve stress, improve our social relationships, and keep our environment cleaner.
It's important to clarify specific ways that autonomous driving can benefit society. Here are some of the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles so you can embrace the new wave of driverless cars coming to a city near you.
1. Less Traffic
Self-driving vehicles present the opportunity for less traffic on the road. One way to produce less traffic is for people to commute together in shared driverless vehicles. People will also drive less frequently simply for the joy of driving. That will keep the number of people on the road to a minimum.
Also, developers are working on “connected vehicle” technology that allows onboard vehicle computers to link up. This technology will allow vehicles to choose less congested routes and prevent accidents from happening. When vehicles communicate and work on automation, they are less likely to experience errors of judgement. Less errors leads to an easier flow of traffic.
2 Less Stress
Driving in dense traffic and commuting to and from work can really stress you out. A 2014 study by the UK Office of National Statistics found that daily commuters “have lower life satisfaction, a lower sense that their daily activities are worthwhile, lower levels of happiness and higher anxiety on average than non-commuters.
Average happiness levels begin to fall, and anxiety levels begin to rise after the first 15 minutes of the commute to work. Then, the worst effects of commuting on personal well-being are experienced on average by those whose journey to work lasts between 61 and 90 minutes”.
Autonomous vehicles will improve your health and lower stress levels because the cars on the road will travel in a more stable pattern. You’ll be free to read a book, watch a movie or get close with your fellow passengers.
3. Environmental Benefits
Transportation on roads and highways is responsible for producing five billion tons of CO2 each year. One of the first vehicles available with driverless technology will be the Tesla Model 3. It’s an all-electric vehicle, paving the way for other companies to create similar cars.
A world with more electric driverless vehicles will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even without electric vehicles, driverless cars will use less fuel. If the vehicles are connected electronically, there will be less stopping and starting, which will keep emissions on the road at record low levels.
4 Safer Transportation
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA ), at least eight people are killed and 1,161 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver every single day. An autonomous vehicle future will almost certainly be a safer one.
Self-driving cars can make hundreds of calculations per second and quickly make changes in acceleration and braking. There are already vehicles on the road that have autonomous braking that can stop the vehicle without the driver’s input if an object is detected by onboard sensors. Most researchers believe that driverless cars will have less errors than human drivers and create safer road conditions for motorists and pedestrians alike.
5. Higher Speeds
Self-driving cars will take you to destinations much faster than cars driven by humans. Like high speed rail, driverless vehicles that are connected electronically can safely maintain higher speeds. This could completely transform the way we commute between cities.
Another way we could reach higher speeds is by redesigning the vehicle itself. By taking out the driver’s seat, automakers can put larger, more powerful engines inside the car. Every self-driving car could rival the speeds of a supercar and allow you to reach your destination faster than ever before.
6. Multi-tasking
People already multi-task while driving on the road. We try to squeeze more and more activities into our commute such as talking on the phone, personal hygiene, and texting. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, at any given moment, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving.
A car that drives itself will give you the opportunity to finish up job proposals, text friends, and spend more time multi-tasking. People will be able to pre-program their journey and use that time more effectively for their own pursuits.
7. More Parking Space
Access Magazine estimated that there are 722 million parking spaces in America. That conservative estimate takes up 0.64 percent of all U.S. land space. A driverless future could reduce the number of parking spaces nationwide.
Your car could take you to work in the morning and then automatically return to your home. You can then use your mobile smart phone to summon the vehicle when it’s time to go home at the end of the day. A smart car with autonomous technology could circle the block while you do your grocery shopping and scoop you up afterwards.
8. Lower Municipal Costs
A transportation sector dominated by driverless cars could drastically reduce municipal costs. Most of the traffic signals and signage on the roads are for drivers: turn here, stop ahead, etc. With self-driving cars, these signs are pointless.
A connected vehicle can already tap into road conditions and make course corrections electronically without the need for visual cues on the road. There are also less errors with autonomous vehicles.
Therefore, there will be less need for diverted traffic and road maintenance that results from accidents. Soon, highways could have fewer signs for driving directions and more advertisements for passengers.
9.  New Vehicle Designs
Self-driving cars could open the doors for all new vehicle aesthetics. Since its creation, the motor vehicle has been designed with the driver in mind. Future vehicles could replace a front windshield with a wrap-around touchscreen for entertainment purposes.
Passengers can sit facing sideways or backwards. Electric vehicles can put motors and battery packs in various locations around the vehicle, so the overall shape of cars in the future could completely change. Driverless cars may even come to resemble rail cabins that allow passengers to take a nap or enjoy a meal.
10. Less Crime
A residual benefit of self-driving vehicles could be a reduction in crime. Sometimes, criminals use cars to elude capture. Autonomous vehicles will be harder to manipulate in this fashion.
If all vehicles are connected to a regional transportation grid, it might become impossible to use one in the commission of a crime. Another way that self-driving cars can reduce crime is reducing or eliminating auto theft. Your driverless vehicle might be accessible through fingerprint recognition only, making it extremely difficult to steal.
Finding the New Norm with Self-Driving Vehicles
Self-driving cars have numerous social benefits, but it will be difficult to break away from our driving culture. Just think about all the great movies that feature a cool car or a bad-ass driver.
Having a relaxing commute while you catch up with your Summer reading is nice, but so is gripping the steering wheel of a muscle car and feeling the power of its engine rumble your seat.
Society will have to find a balance. There's no stopping a driverless future, but perhaps we don't have to leave our love for cars in the dust.

Editor Note: The views and opinions presented in this article do not necessarily reflect those of the Editor.
With smart devices now all around us, a new and attractive innovation in the form of self-driving cars is finally becoming a reality. In some cities, they have already begun hitting the roads.
Whenever a new concept is introduced that is as disruptive as self-driving vehicles, its pros and cons are always discussed and analyzed in detail. Let’s look at just some of the ways that driverless cars can improve the quality of our lives.
RELATED: Best Electric Car Deals
Top Benefits of Self-Driving Cars
1. Environmentally Friendly
Most driverless cars to be introduced in the future will be electric vehicles. We can almost certainly classify these vehicles as ‘green’.
Technology used in self-driving cars ensures that fuel consumption will be optimized. This should result in dramatically reducing emissions. The driving protocol of autonomous cars guard against excessive speed and avoid repeated braking and re-accelerating, reducing the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere compared to a vehicle driven by an infallible human.
2. Improved Safety
It may be some time before self-driving cars are widely accepted in our transport systems and seen for sale at buy here pay here auto dealerships. But as self-driving cars become more popular and networked, the number of road crashes will decrease. The chance of human error due to distraction or drunk driving is minimized, saving millions of lives and millions of dollars.
Self-driving cars are expected to save precious lives that are lost every day due to excessive speeding or driving under the influence of alcohol. Estimates indicate that nearly 1.3 million people lose their lives in road accidents worldwide every year. An autonomous car does away with manual controls and eliminates fatalities caused by human error.
3. Car Sharing
We may see cities move to a system where people no longer usually own cars, instead calling up the use of a self-driving car only when they need it. Cars would be pooled together as a public service. There would be no need for car garages, and people would no longer need to worry about ongoing maintenance and repair of their own vehicle.
4. Better Mobility
Many people are unable to drive a vehicle because of age, disability, or restricted mobility. They cannot procure a driving license, and can find themselves feeling isolated. Fully-automated cars prove to be a boon for such people, allowing them to reclaim their freedom while ensuring that lives will not be endangered.
5. Faster Commutes
One of the biggest advantages of driverless cars that we can foresee is a dramatic reduction in traffic jams that account for delays in commuting. Self-driving cars will be able to communicate with other cars on the road. As braking functions can be fully automated, nose-to-tail crashes can largely be avoided. Cars will travel at safe distances from one another. Speed limits can also be increased as we gain higher confidence in our vehicles.
6. Better Use of a Driver’s Time
Normally, a driver has to be very alert when driving a car. While commuting to and from work, he has to focus entirely on driving. With self-driving cars, the passenger can gainfully utilize the time spent commuting.
7. Better Traffic Management
According to estimates, urban American drivers spend nearly seven billion hours in traffic, wasting up to 3.1 billion gallons of fuel, resulting in a loss of about $160 billion from traffic congestion.
Self-driving cars can access digital maps, real-time and accurate traffic data. Using this data, they will efficiently select the best possible route. The obvious benefits that would result are less traffic and congestion, with decreased wastage of fuel and time.
8. Space Saving
resent day parking lots have to provide ample space in between vehicles to facilitate parking and taking out of vehicles. Self-driving cars will be able to park themselves without needing so much space. Around 15% reduction in parking space is expected with driverless cars. Smaller parking lots mean better use of the building space.
9. Potential for New Design
There is ample scope for trying out new designs in driverless cars, as there will be no need for complicated driving tools meant for human drivers. Improved interiors with arrangements for relaxation and entertainment will make them a mobile living room! As fewer complex mechanical parts will be required, prices of vehicles should drop, making buy here pay here financing even easier to get.
10. Potential for More Powerful Vehicles
Since driverless cars could run at much higher speeds, they would require more powerful and efficient engines. The mechanical parts could be re-positioned in a more advantageous manner.
We would have safer streets, less pollution, and almost no parking woes. Looking at these environmental and economic advantages, self-driving cars seem to be a viable and attractive option for our future transportation needs. However, they are still in an early stage of development. The safety features are yet to be comprehensively tested and there is a lurking distrust of self-driving cars in the minds of some of the public. This will go away when such vehicles become more and more operational on the roads.

The Benefits of Self-Driving Cars
June 10 2019 · Perspectives · autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles, efficiency, safety, self-driving cars, Transportation
We’ve already covered what autonomous driving is. Now, let’s take a look how this futuristic world of self-driving cars will benefit society in more ways than one.
Improved Safety
Often times, there is fear associated with a fully autonomous world. Humans are scared of technology taking over and don’t want to give up control. However, the fact that autonomous vehicles improve safety should not be understated. A 2015 study by the US Department of Transportation NHTSA attributed 94% of accidents to human error, with only 2% to vehicular malfunction, 2% to environmental factors and 2% to unknown causes. By removing people from the driving equation, we remove the large potential for human error, and can expect an incredible leap in safety. Fewer accidents. Fewer injuries. Fewer fatalities. Thus, autonomous vehicles should not be feared, but rather celebrated. This increase in safety also further reduces the pressure and cost of secondary factors such as emergency and medical services, government roadway management and beyond.
Less Traffic
Just as humans are the leading cause of accidents, we are also the main reason for traffic. It just takes one person slamming on their brakes or cutting someone off on a busy highway to cause a traffic jam, with ripple effects that could last for miles. Autonomous vehicles would run on a network, communicating with other autonomous cars to determine the best, most efficient routes. Cars would no longer be controlled by individuals, but rather would all work together as a unit, moving as one, getting rid of unnecessary brake slamming and traffic jams.
Convenient Parking
You’ve made it to where you’re going, but now the challenge is finding a parking spot. Especially if you live in a large metropolitan city where parking lots aren’t that common, this can be a nightmare and sometimes takes as long as the drive itself. But, wait. Your car can drive itself without you even being in it. That means that your car can drop you off at the entrance of work or the grocery store or wherever you are going, and then park itself. You don’t even have to be present. Further, because humans don’t have to worry about getting in and out of the car in tight parking spaces, cars can park extremely close together to maximize the number of vehicles that can fit in one parking lot.
More Free Time
Still not sold on how the amazing world of autonomous vehicles will benefit you? With less traffic and more convenient parking, think about how much shorter and efficient your commute will be. You can sleep in longer in the mornings and get home earlier for dinner in the evenings, or have more free time for whatever you feel like you’re missing out on because of your long, stressful commute. Not only would you be spending less time in your car every day, but because your car can drive itself, you will also have free time during your commute to maybe read the morning paper on the way to work, rather than before.  Or, think about how much you can do on a long road trip when you don’t have to worry about actually controlling the car. The possibilities are endless! The point is that with autonomous vehicles, you will have more free time, both inside and outside of your car. If time is money, then we’ll all be a little bit richer in the world of full autonomy.
Environmental Benefits
Last, but certainly not least, self-driving cars will be extremely helpful in reducing CO2 emissions and global warming. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, in the United States, the petroleum-dependent transportation sector is responsible for about 33% of the nation’s climate changing emissions. About 15% of all global CO2 emissions comes from transportation. Many autonomous vehicle manufacturers, such as General Motors and Tesla, believe that self-driving cars should be completely electric, meaning zero emissions. This would reduce one third of America’s annual CO2 emissions! Other companies, like Ford, are making the push for hybrid self-driving cars, which still would have some global warming effects, but not nearly as much as on the road right now. Even with cars still partially running on gasoline, autonomous vehicles would have the capacity to maximize fuel efficiency, and minimize harmful emissions, reducing both climate change and air pollution.
Less accidents. Less stress. More free time. Good for the environment. Seems pretty great to me. I personally can’t wait for this world of fully autonomous driving to arrive.

5. Easier for Those Who Hate Driving
Cons of Self Driving Cars
1. Technology Can Go Wrong
2. Extremely Expensive
3. Eliminate Numerous Jobs
4. Negative Impact on the Environment
5. Loss of Privacy
Conclusion
Self Driving Cars
The self driving cars navigate the way themselves through radars, cameras, and sensors adjusted in their system. These sensors process the movement of other vehicles, pedestrians or bikes on the road.
For example, Tesla cars use 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and a front facing radar that analyzes the vehicles surrounding, preventing any possible damage. Also, 5G cellular networks, which are 1000% faster than the regular 4G LTE, are said to be implemented in the near future to increase efficiency.
Pros of Self Driving Cars
1. Eliminates human error
Globally, 1.5 million people die in vehicle accidents every year. In the U.S alone, the number exceeds more than 40,000. 93% of the car accidents are said to be as a result of human error. People tend to lack vigilance, resulting in numerous accidents.
For instance, you can easily get distracted by a phone call, message or you could get lost in a conversation with anyone in your vehicle. This means there’s a high possibility you may hit any pedestrians or crash your car anywhere. This is the reason why experts believe self driving cars can reduce traffic fatalities caused by human error.
Autonomous cars have advanced technology which keeps them alert and undistracted at all time, unlike humans. Researchers of DoT have estimated that self driving cars can reduce accidents due to human error by up to 94%, saving millions of lives.
2. Economic Benefits
Road crashes cause a considerable amount of economic loss. These expenses arise from the treatment cost, repairment of the damaged car and properties if any. According to the WHO, road crashes cost most countries more than 3% of their domestic product. Autonomous cars will drastically reduce the number of accidents, saving millions of dollars if it’ll be integrated within our transport, worldwide.
3. Accessibility For Those who Cannot Drive
With a car that can drive itself, you won’t ever need to worry about not having a license. Suppose, emergency situations arise where you have to reach somewhere but you can’t drive. With the help of autonomous cars, you can reach your destination without any delay. Even for disabled people, commuting becomes a lot easier and enjoyable experience.
4. Environment Friendly
Rather than using combustion engines like regular vehicles, most companies design self driving cars to be electrical. Using electrical vehicles reduces carbon emissions that are released into the atmosphere. If you drive, you might use you your brakes more than necessary, which burns an excessive amount of fuel. In contrast, self driving cars perform at its maximum efficiency most of the time, decreasing carbon emissions.
5. Easier for Those Who Hate Driving
Driving on a busy road can be stressful, especially if you are traveling long distance daily. Commuting to and from work every day by autonomous vehicles can be an enjoyable experience.
The time you’d spend driving can now be utilized by spending leisurely or productively. For example, you can use your commute time to relax, sleep or watch t.v instead of having to pay attention to the road.
Cons of Self Driving Cars
1. Technology Can Go Wrong
No matter how advanced technology is used, there’s always a high possibility of self driving cars making mistakes. For example, a Tesla Model “S” in its autopilot mode failed to hit the brake at the right time and crashed the car into a trailer, causing the death of the passenger.
On the other hand, the manufacturers also need to constantly update the software to make the cars run smoothly. Consequently, there may be errors in the updated software, increasing the risk of traffic fatalities.
2. Extremely Expensive
Worldwide, the number of countries using autonomous cars is still low, mainly due to the hefty price tag. The estimated value of a self driving car is at least $100,000 more than the price of normal vehicles. Although it reduces the number of crashes and saves some amount of money, it’s impossible for everyone to be able to afford these cars.
3. Eliminate Numerous Jobs
There are a lot of people working in the transportation sector. Using autonomous vehicles means numerous public transportation drivers, personal drivers or taxis drivers will be left jobless, impacting the economic conditions of the whole country- directly or indirectly. Simultaneously, the people involved in the business of gasoline will have to suffer because these cars will mostly be electrical.
4. Negative Impact on the Environment
One other downside of self driving car is that more people might buy there own personal vehicles, increasing the amount of carbon emissions. And, people could prefer longer commutes due to how convenient and easy it is to use self driving cars. With more vehicles and more commute time, the negative impacts on the environment will increase.
5. Loss of Privacy
Although the companies claim that they’ll fully protect your private information. There are more risks since self driving cars use technology such as GPS to navigate their way, which can make your location more accessible to other people. For example, hackers can easy access your personal data stored in the software.
Conclusion
As this brief article shows, self driving cars have a huge potential in the near future but as of today it’s accessibility is limited. Although it provides you more time, increases productivity and drastically drops the risks of traffic fatalities, one cannot ignore the fact that even these technologies malfunction. Thus, trusting it wholeheartedly might not the smartest thing to do.

Alright, so I've got some information here about the benefits of self-driving cars. Let's see what they are.

First up, increased safety. According to the Eno Center for Transportation, having just 10% of cars as self-driving could prevent up to 211,000 accidents annually and save 1,100 lives. If 90% of cars are self-driving, it could prevent 4.2 million accidents and save 21,700 lives. That's huge. The main reason is that most accidents are caused by human error, like drunk driving, speeding, and distraction. Self-driving cars don't make those mistakes.

Next, decreased traffic congestion. Self-driving cars can communicate with each other and maintain optimal distances, which can smooth out traffic flow and prevent jams caused by human driving behaviors. Also, with better spacing, highway capacity could increase significantly, maybe up to four times more cars per hour per lane.

Then, lower fuel consumption. Self-driving cars can drive more efficiently, with smoother acceleration and braking, and potentially through drafting, which improves aerodynamics. This can lead to significant fuel savings, up to 2.9 billion gallons annually.

Enhanced human productivity is another benefit. Since people aren't driving, they can use that time for work, relaxation, or other activities, which could boost overall productivity.

Parking is also improved. Self-driving cars can drop you off and then park themselves far away, where space is cheaper or more abundant, and come back to pick you up when needed. This could reduce the need for parking spaces in congested areas.

Improved mobility for children, the elderly, and the disabled is a big plus. These groups may not be able to drive themselves, but with self-driving cars, they can maintain their independence and mobility.

Elimination of traffic enforcement personnel is mentioned, which could free up law enforcement resources for other tasks.

Higher speed limits could be possible because self-driving cars can handle higher speeds safely, as they react faster and more accurately than humans.

Lastly, lighter and more versatile car designs are possible because self-driving cars are less likely to be involved in accidents, so they don't need as much safety reinforcement. This could make cars more fuel-efficient and allow for more creative interior designs.

Okay, so those are the benefits. But I need to consider the drawbacks as well to answer whether self-driving cars are a good or bad idea.

Let me think about what the potential downsides might be.

First, there's the issue of reliability. What if the self-driving car's systems fail? There have been cases where self-driving cars have been involved in accidents, sometimes with fatal consequences. For example, there was a Tesla Model S that crashed into a trailer while on Autopilot, killing the driver. So, if the technology isn't perfect, it could still pose risks.

Second, self-driving cars are currently very expensive. The sensors, processors, and software required are costly, making these cars unaffordable for the average consumer. For example, the estimate is that self-driving cars cost at least $100,000 more than conventional cars. This high cost limits accessibility and slows down adoption.

Third, there's the potential job loss. If self-driving cars become prevalent, it could eliminate jobs for drivers, such as taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery drivers. This could have significant economic impacts on those workers and possibly on the economy as a whole.

Fourth, there are privacy concerns. Self-driving cars collect a lot of data about their passengers and the environments they travel through. There's a risk that this data could be misused or hacked, leading to privacy breaches.

Fifth, there's the possibility that self-driving cars could increase traffic and congestion if more people choose to travel because driving becomes more convenient. This could lead to more cars on the road and potentially worse environmental impacts.

Sixth, there's the ethical dilemma of programming self-driving cars to make decisions in unavoidable accident situations. For example, if a crash is imminent, should the car prioritize the safety of its passengers or try to minimize overall harm, possibly at the expense of the passengers? This is a complex ethical issue that hasn't been fully resolved.

Seventh, there's the potential for increased suburban sprawl if commuting becomes more pleasant and people are willing to live farther from urban centers. This could lead to more land being consumed for housing and increased environmental degradation.

Eighth, there are legal and regulatory challenges. Laws and regulations need to be updated to accommodate self-driving cars, and liability in the event of accidents needs to be clearly defined. This could take time and may hinder the adoption of the technology.

Ninth, there's the issue of public acceptance. Some people may be reluctant to give up control of their vehicles and trust autonomous systems. Overcoming this psychological barrier could be difficult.

Tenth, there's the potential for cyberattacks. If self-driving cars can be hacked, it could lead to serious safety risks and even allow for malicious use of the vehicles.

Alright, so I've brainstormed some potential disadvantages. Now, I need to weigh the benefits against these drawbacks to form a conclusion.

Starting with safety: self-driving cars have the potential to greatly reduce accidents caused by human error. However, if the technology isn't foolproof, there's still a risk of accidents. It's crucial that the technology is thoroughly tested and regulated to ensure it's as safe as possible.

Regarding traffic and congestion: while self-driving cars could improve traffic flow, there's a risk that increased convenience could lead to more people choosing to drive, which might offset some of the benefits.

On the economic front: the high cost of self-driving cars is a significant barrier to adoption. Unless the technology becomes more affordable, it may remain out of reach for many consumers.

Job losses are also a valid concern. The shift to self-driving cars could disrupt entire industries and leave many people unemployed. Measures would need to be in place to support these workers and transition them to new roles.

Privacy is another important issue. Strict regulations and security measures must be implemented to protect passengers' data and prevent misuse.

Ethical programming of self-driving cars is a complex problem that needs to be addressed. Developers must consider various scenarios and establish clear guidelines for how the cars should behave in hazardous situations.

Suburban sprawl is a possibility, but it's not inevitable. Urban planning and policies could be implemented to encourage sustainable development and limit sprawl.

Legal and regulatory frameworks need to be updated to accommodate self-driving cars. This will require collaboration between governments, automakers, and technology companies to establish standards and guidelines.

Public acceptance is key. Education and awareness campaigns could help people understand the benefits and safety features of self-driving cars, thereby increasing trust in the technology.

Lastly, cybersecurity is paramount. Self-driving cars must be designed with robust security measures to prevent hacking and ensure the safety of passengers.

Considering all these factors, I think self-driving cars have the potential to be a good idea, but only if certain conditions are met. These include ensuring the technology is safe and reliable, making the cars affordable, addressing job displacement, protecting privacy, resolving ethical dilemmas, promoting sustainable urban planning, updating laws and regulations, gaining public trust, and safeguarding against cyber threats.

If these challenges can be adequately addressed, then self-driving cars could lead to significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and quality of life. However, if these issues are not properly managed, the adoption of self-driving cars could result in negative consequences.

Therefore, my answer is that self-driving cars could be a good idea, but only if accompanied by comprehensive strategies to mitigate their potential drawbacks.
