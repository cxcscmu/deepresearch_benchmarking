So I have this question: "How does stigma affect mental health?" I need to understand this properly. First off, what is stigma? I think stigma is like when society has negative attitudes or stereotypes about something. In this case, it's about mental health. So, people might believe that someone with a mental health issue is weak or flawed in some way. That doesn't sound good.

I need to figure out how these negative views affect the actual mental health of individuals. Maybe it causes them to feel bad about themselves, right? Like, if everyone thinks they're crazy or unstable, they might start believing it and feel worse. That makes sense.

But there might be more to it. Perhaps stigma also affects how people seek help. If there's a lot of shame around mental health, people might be afraid to admit they have a problem and seek treatment. That could make their condition worse over time.

Also, maybe the stigma affects their social lives. People might avoid those with mental health issues, thinking they're dangerous or difficult to be around. That kind of isolation can't be good for mental health.

Hmm, maybe it also affects their job prospects. Employers might be hesitant to hire someone with a mental health history, fearing they won't be reliable. That could lead to financial struggles and further stress.

I should probably look up some studies or articles on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe there are specific ways that stigma impacts mental health that I haven't considered yet.

Let me try searching for some information.

Summary
With a growing number of people experiencing a decline in their mental health, society is becoming better equipped to respond to our needs. However, the stigma around mental illness and seeking help remains.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mental illness is among the most common health conditions in the United States.
More than 50% of U.S. adults will need mental health treatment at some point during their lifetime. In addition, 1 in 25 are currently living with a serious mental illness, such as an eating disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or major depression.
A national survey estimates that 11.2% of all U.S. adults report regularly feeling some form of worry, nervousness, or anxiety, while 4.7% report frequently experiencing sadness or symptoms of depression.
Given how common it is for people to experience a decline in mental health, the level of stigma that exists in society is surprising and often contradictory.
For example, one survey concluded that the majority of people in the U.S. believe in supporting those living with mental illness, so they can live normal lives with others who could help them recover.
The respondents stated they do not support the idea of keeping those with a mental health condition out of society. The survey also suggests that generally, people do not believe that those living with mental illness are excessively dangerous or prone to violence.
However, two-thirds of the survey respondents believed there was still a lot of stigma attached to mental illness, while almost half said they would not welcome a mental health facility into their neighborhood.

What is a stigma?

Stigmas in society are commonplace. They can be difficult to dismantle and overcome once they become established over many years.
A stigma is a negative and often unfair social attitude attached to a person or group, often placing shame on them for a perceived deficiency or difference to their existence.
Individuals or groups can apply stigma to those who live a certain way, have certain cultural beliefs or make lifestyle choices, or to people living with health conditions, such as mental illnesses.
Mental health stigma
Mental health stigma refers to societal disapproval, or when society places shame on people who live with a mental illness or seek help for emotional distress, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or PTSD.
The pressure of mental health stigma can come from family, friends, coworkers, and society on a broader level. Groups can also politicize stigma. It can prevent people living with mental illness from getting help, fitting into society, and leading happy and comfortable lives.
Mental health stigma can come from stereotypes, which are simplified or generalized beliefs or representations of entire groups of people that are often inaccurate, negative, and offensive. They allow a person to make quick judgments about others based on a few defining characteristics, which they then apply to anyone in that group.
For instance, people living with depression are often stereotyped as lazy, while some judge those with anxiety as cowardly.
Many people fear being labeled “crazy” for simply seeking support from a therapist. None of these characterizations are valid, and all of them are misinformed, cause pain, and prevent people from getting the help they need.
An often politicized stereotype about people with mental illness is that they are violent or dangerous. However, a small minority of people living with mental illness commit violent acts. They are actually 10 times more likely to be victims of a crime, making them a vulnerable population we should be protecting instead of fearing.
Why is mental health stigmatized?
Stigma against mental illness can come from several sources, such as personal, social, and family beliefs, and from the mental health condition itself, which may cause a person to act outside what is considered the social or cultural norm.
A lack of awareness, education, perception, and a fear of people with mental illness can all lead to increased stigma.
Effects of mental health stigma
According to the Mental Health Foundation, nearly 9 out of 10 people with a mental illness feel stigma and discrimination negatively impact their lives. They also state that those with a mental health issue are among the least likely of any group with a long-term health condition or disability to find work, be in long-term relationships, live in good housing, and be socially included in mainstream society.
Stigma against a person living with a mental health condition can make their symptoms worse and make it hard to recover. A person may also be less likely to seek help if they live with stigma.
Stigma may not be obvious or be expressed in large gestures. It can come in the words people use to describe a mental health condition or people living with mental illness. This can involve hurtful, offensive, or dismissive language, which can be upsetting for people to hear. This can cause them to feel alone and that no-one understands what they are going through.
The effects of stigma can include:
internalization of negative beliefs
social isolation
low self-esteem
hopelessness
shame
avoiding treatment
worsening symptoms
lack of criminal justice
discrimination at work
unemployment
How to overcome mental health stigma
Public education to increase knowledge around mental illness is paramount, since the majority of stigma comes from a lack of understanding and misplaced fear.
It is important to review reliable sources of information on mental health conditions and become better informed when learning that a friend, family member, or coworker is living with a mental illness.
At the individual level, a person with a mental health illness can get actively involved in their treatment. They could also consider getting an advocate if they feel that stigma impacts their ability to navigate day-to-day circumstances, such as employment, housing, or healthcare.
An advocate is a trained professional who helps people work through employment disputes, medical appointments, financial claims and appointments, and housing problems. They support the rights of others who may not have the strength or knowledge to do so on their own.
Summary
Stigma is a complex issue that is well-documented but challenging to overcome.
However, there are steps that a person facing mental health stigma can take, such as finding an advocate who can support them with work issues and financial matters. They can also educate others by sharing their stories to promote a wider understanding of mental health conditions.
Importantly, everyone has a role in diffusing mental health stigma. People should educate themselves about mental health issues, and better comprehend what life is like for those living with these conditions. By doing so, they can help dispel commonly held myths and stereotypes both in themselves and others.
Through education and understanding, we can eliminate the stigma around mental illness, and there is support available to people who are currently experiencing stigma.

Stigma and Discrimination: The Effect of Stigma
Samantha Gluck
Stigma and discrimination go hand-in-hand, especially when it comes to mental illness. According to the Wisconsin United for Mental Health website, “. . . people with a mental illness would rather tell their employers they have committed a petty crime and were in jail than admit to being in a psychiatric hospital.” Herein lies the core effect of stigma associated with mental health issues – discrimination and diminished self-worth.
Frequently, stigma against people with mental health disorders involves the propagation of inaccurate and negative perceptions – namely by the media. Movies and other media platforms often portray those with mental illness as violent, incompetent and disdainful. The perpetuation of hurtful and inaccurate stereotypes by the media is especially harmful because of the profound role it has in shaping and influencing social mores and attitudes. Whether consciously or not, the community as a whole ingests these negative attitudes, which they then use to stigmatize those with mental disorders.
Effect of Stigma on People With Mental Illness
The effect of stigma on people dealing with mental health issues is as painful as the mental disorders themselves. The stigma causes society to develop the following attitudes and actions toward people with mental illness:
Fear
Mistrust
Prejudice
Violence against those with mental disorders
The effect of stigma on people living with mental illness causes them to:
Develop an intense fear of "coming out"
Delay seeking necessary mental health care
Develop a practice of self-stigmatization
Endure discrimination
Self-stigmatization occurs when people with mental illness internalize the negative perceptions and stereotypes that are prevalent in society. This results in low self-esteem and robs them of quality of life.
Stigma and Discrimination
Living in the Shadows
Even in this enlightened day and age, people with mental illness feel they must live in the shadows for fear of stigma and discrimination. In fact, although it’s estimated that nearly 50 million Americans live with a mental illness, fewer than half of those with a serious disorder seek proper treatment. What’s more, many of those who do seek mental health services expend a significant amount of time and energy ensuring their condition remains a secret.
It’s time to stop the stigma and discrimination against those with mental health issues. Find out how you can help.

... Just like any other stigmatized group of people, individuals diagnosed with mental illness are affected by stigma in several ways. The impact of stigma and discrimination has been found to affect patients profoundly (Yanos, Roe, Markus & Lysaker, 2008;Rüsch et al, 2009b;Oleniuk, Duncan & Tempier, 2011;Shrivastava et al, 2011;Assefa, Shibre, Asher & Fekadu, 2012;Daumerie, et al., 2012;Lazowski, Koller, Stuart & Milev, 2012; Parle, 2012; Thomé et al, 2012;Yuksel, Bingol, Oflaz, 2013).

Persons with mental health or addiction issues often deal with stigma. In turn, stigma negatively affects mental health. This downward spiral makes it harder to seek treatment, leaving people feeling even more socially isolated.
Stigma consists of a label used to exclude an individual, causing them to internalize this label as part of their identity. They generally consist of labels based on negative stereotypes about a specific demographic. For example, the word “junkey” can be stigmatizing for persons with an addiction. So how does this affect someone’s mental health?
Stigma affects mental health by inflicting further harm on already vulnerable populations. A person may internalize a stigmatizing label, causing further isolation, distrust, and low self-esteem, resulting in increased anxiety or depression.
Anxiety is the fight or flight response to stigma, whereas depression is the purposelessness and hopelessness resulting from this downward spiral.
In this article, I share the experience of Stephanie, a fellow recovery advocate who experienced a great deal of stigma during active use and recovery.

How Stigma Triggers Anxiety
How Stigma Affects Identity
What Stigma and Anxiety Have in Common
Conclusion
How Stigma Triggers Anxiety
Persons already suffering from mental health or addiction issues often experience anxiety. A stigmatizing social environment amplifies this anxiety. As Stephanie states:
“When I got off the drugs my anxiety went right through the roof. It told me I was a mess and no good and that it would be years before I ever was trusted or treated “normal”. When people stigmatized me, it confirmed those anxious thoughts for me. A lot of my recovery work has been on my anxiety. It was bad before I used, but after it was worse.”
While in a vulnerable state of recovery, she had to navigate family, friends, and professionals who treated her differently due to her addiction. She states:
“It’s not so much what they said as how they treated me. They were cold and avoided conversations with me. There were a lot of snide comments about how I should make better choices… everybody wanted to make sure I understood how much I hurt the people around me… they didn’t seem to think I knew.”
This sense of being different from everyone else leaves a person feeling isolated. Without a sense of social support, persons who are already vulnerable experience increased anxiety, particularly in social situations. As Stephanie states:
Social situations could mean answering a lot of questions based on stigmatic things people heard and believed about addiction. It could mean people talking horribly about me because of the life I previously led. It could mean running into people from my past that could tell others around me that didn’t know… because of the stigma and negative perceptions, I had horrible anxiety when having to go into social situations. Until I was strong enough to use an education “shield” to deflect the anger towards the stigma and educate the person using the stigma, I would avoid all social settings at all costs.
As the isolation and anxiety spiral further, it makes it increasingly difficult for a person to pull themselves out of this difficult place.
How Stigma Affects Identity
As stigma takes over one’s identity, a person begins to internalize stigmatizing labels. This process can also be called “self-stigma”. The labels become anxious thoughts, replaying like a broken record. Stephanie’s mind raced with self-stigmatizing thoughts:
“You are a fuck up… You cant do this… You are not good enough… No one likes you… You can’t work… You’re stupid… You won’t get better… You will never stop… No one will take you seriously… Everyone is better off without you…”
This self-stigma is further reinforced when interacting with others who make off-handed remarks regarding any of these anxious thoughts. Stephanie felt like she was living in a constant state of judgment:
“It made it worse and harder to navigate the world. I was afraid that everyone would hate me. I was always second-guessing everything I did and how people perceived me.”
This prevented her from being able to reach out for help. Living in this state of anxiety led her to believe there was no way out:
“I was hopeless and believed that I would not be able to get help. In my own head, I was a lost cause.”
What Stigma and Anxiety Have in Common
Stigma and anxiety are both based on fear. We fear the unknown, and a person using stigmatizing language often does not know or understand the experiences of those they stigmatize.
Beyond the realm of mental health and addiction, we can find a great deal of stigma in the politics of immigration. Before the pandemic captured all of the headlines, immigration was one of the biggest global issues. This included issues like Brexit, Trump’s statements regarding Mexicans and other minority groups, and the surge in nationalism.
Stigma does not often come from true hatred. Even when hatred does exist, the issue goes much deeper. Beyond hate, anger, and frustration, you can often find fear. Immigrants and other minority groups can provoke fear among those who lack familiarity with such groups.
When we feel threatened by economic uncertainty, fear often gets projected outward as anger. Immigrants and other minority groups often become scapegoats for this fear.
Now, more than ever, we need to keep our fear in check. As we navigate a world full of heightened fear of contagion, we need to consider the humanity of others, rather than resorting to broad stigmatizing labels.
Conclusion
Stigma affects the mental health of persons who are already vulnerable by further instilling a sense of social isolation. This social isolation increases social anxiety, potentially leading to internalized self-stigma. Self-stigma makes recovery increasingly challenging as it becomes reinforced by others, leading to further marginalization and a sense of hopelessness.
Recovering from stigma requires separating yourself from the negatively spiraling self-reinforcing thought loops. Rather than identifying with a self-stigmatizing thought, greet it like an old friend, welcome it in, and tell it you have more important things to focus on right now. Then focus on those more important things, letting it be.
Recognize persons who perpetuate stigma are often doing so based on fear or ignorance. Their reactions to you say more about them than about you.
Lastly, stigma makes it difficult to trust others enough to reach out for support. This is a large part of what kept Stephanie stuck in her addiction. When she gained the courage to reach out for help, she broke the power of stigma, finding a supportive treatment facility. Through the support of staff at Aegis Health Group in Windsor, Ontario, she was able to rebuild trust, coping skills, and the confidence to succeed in her recovery.
Unfortunately, many people do not encounter supportive professionals the first time they reach out. Like so many others, Stephanie had to reach out to various sources before finding the right fit for her. If you have been unable to find the right support, persistence will likely pay off when you find the right fit. I discuss this topic further in my article here.

6. What are the effects of stigma?
© Elizabeth Hollenberg
Stigma has many different effects on the person who is stigmatised, on their family and on the community. It may also affect the programmes available to serve those affected.
The effect of stigma may be psychological. As mentioned in ‘Who stigmatises?’, a stigmatised person can feel fear or shame, which can lead to anxiety and depression. Because of this, or because of discrimination or anticipated stigma, they may no longer take part in any social activities. This limits social participation and leads to social exclusion. Social exclusion or discrimination may in turn result in an economic burden for the affected person and their household and may thus cause or aggravate poverty. The next chapter of this Guide explains what mental health is and how stigma and discrimination affect the mental wellbeing of stigmatised persons.
Stigma or anticipation of stigma may cause affected people to conceal their condition. The burden of keeping this secret, of being ever watchful and careful, taking evasive actions and ‘living a lie’, takes an emotional toll. In addition, non-disclosure to family means loss of emotional and social support. Because of stigma, many persons with a stigmatised health condition do not seek help. This delays the diagnosis and treatment and may worsen the health condition. The risk of disability may also increase. Stigma thus hinders the effective treatment and care of the person.
In the case of infectious diseases, stigma can complicate efforts to control the disease. It can cause delay in diagnosis and treatment, which may prolong transmission in the community. Stigma may also be a barrier to preventive behaviour; for instance, some people may refuse to come forward for a free screening session of NTDs. The silence and concealment inhibit prevention programmes. People may not change their behaviour, because doing so would expose them to stigma. In addition, patients may not adhere to treatment if clinic attendance or regular medication leads to awkward questions and potential exposure to stigma. This increases the risk of further disease transmission, disability and drug resistance.
Overall, stigma is likely to have a negative impact on the quality of life of affected persons, their family, health programmes and society through the above mechanisms.

Alright, I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they say about how stigma affects mental health.

First, from Medical News Today, it talks about mental health stigma being a negative attitude towards people with mental illness. It mentions that stigma can prevent people from seeking help and can lead to social isolation, which isn't good for mental health. It also says that stigma can make people feel ashamed and that this can worsen their symptoms.

HealthyPlace.com also discusses how stigma leads to discrimination and lowers self-worth for people with mental illness. It mentions that the media often portrays mentally ill people in a negative light, which reinforces stereotypes and causes society to fear or mistrust them.

Another article by Siobhan Parle talks about different ways stigma affects people with mental illness. It seems like stigma can cause feelings like anger, depression, social anxiety, insecurity, and guilt. Plus, it can lead to actual discrimination, like being denied jobs or housing.

From Steve Rose's blog, he talks about how stigma triggers anxiety in people with mental health or addiction issues. He says that stigma confirms their anxious thoughts and makes social situations terrifying, leading to avoidance and increased isolation.

Lastly, InfoNTD has a section on the effects of stigma, mentioning psychological impacts like anxiety and depression, social exclusion, and economic burdens. It also notes that stigma can prevent people from seeking help, which can worsen their condition and even affect disease control in the case of infectious diseases.

So, overall, it seems like stigma has really harmful effects on mental health. It makes people feel bad about themselves, avoids social interactions, and stops them from getting the help they need. This can create a vicious cycle where mental health worsens because of these factors.

I think to answer the question "How does stigma affect mental health?" I can summarize these points:

Stigma leads to negative self-perception and low self-esteem, which can exacerbate mental health symptoms like depression and anxiety. It causes social isolation and exclusion, as people fear judgment and discrimination, which are crucial for mental well-being. Additionally, stigma prevents people from seeking treatment, either because they're too ashamed or because they're afraid of being labeled or discriminated against. This lack of treatment can lead to worsening conditions and higher chances of disability.

Moreover, the fear and stress associated with potential stigma can be chronic and debilitating, adding another layer of mental distress. In some cases, it can even affect the economic stability of individuals and their families, creating additional stressors.

So, in essence, stigma acts as a barrier to recovery and improves the overall quality of life for people with mental health issues.

I should probably look for some statistics or specific examples to make this more concrete.

Let me try another search.

Stigma Still a Major Hurdle in Getting People the Mental Health Care They Need
Fear of treatment, shame, and embarrassment are keeping a large number of people from seeking the help they need.
Experts estimate that one in four people have treatable mental or emotional difficulties, but up to 75 percent of Americans and Europeans don’t seek the help they need.
A recent study in the journal Psychological Medicine shows that the stigma associated with mental illness is still a major barrier to seeking treatment.
Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP) at King’s College London examined data from 144 studies, which included over 90,000 participants from across the globe. They found that the stigma of mental illness remains one of the top reasons people choose to forgo care.
“We now have clear evidence that stigma has a toxic effect by preventing people seeking help for mental health problems,” senior author Prof. Graham Thornicroft said in a statement. “The profound reluctance to be ‘a mental health patient’ means people will put off seeing a doctor for months, years, or even at all, which in turn delays their recovery.”
According to the latest statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 40 to 50 percent of all people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia go untreated each year. The number of untreated people suffering from some other disorders, such as anxiety or depression, is even greater.

Types of Mental Health Stigma and Those Most Affected
The study concluded that the main types of stigma facing those with a mental illness included the stigma associated with using mental health services, and shame or embarrassment. Other barriers included fear of disclosing their mental condition, concerns about confidentiality, wanting to handle their problems on their own, and not believing they need help.
Those most affected by the stigma included young people, men, minorities, people in the military and, perhaps surprisingly, those working in the health field.
“We found that the fear of disclosing a mental health condition was a particularly common barrier,” lead study author Dr. Sarah Clement said. “Supporting people to talk about their mental health problems, for example through anti-stigma campaigns, may mean they are more likely to seek help.”

Some Advice From a Stigma Breaker
Natasha Tracy, a mental health writer and recipient of the 2014 Erasing the Stigma Leadership Award by Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, said the hardest stigma to beat is the stigma that “looks back at us in the mirror.”
Tracy helps her own bipolar disorder by writing about it on her wildly popular blog, Bipolar Burble.
“Every one of us sees anti-mental illness images and ideas in society and just getting a mental illness does make these go away,” she told Healthline. “We must consciously be aware of our own thoughts and feelings towards our own mental health and fight to ensure that any unhealthy thoughts are replaced by more reasoned ones.”
Acknowledging that it’s no easy task, Tracy said that it can take years for someone to get over feeling bad about having a mental illness. She said the important part is knowing that mental illness is a disease of the brain, just like pancreatitis or liver disease.
And just as with any physical illness, the pain of mental illness doesn’t go away unless you treat it. But instead of worrying about what others who doubt the necessity of mental health treatment think, focus on yourself and your own wellness.
“It can be difficult if people around you can’t accept your mental illness treatment but first and foremost, treatment is about getting you better and bringing people onside is a secondary concern,” Tracy said. “I recommend seeking out people who are supportive and using them to lean on at first.”

Abstract
Introduction: Many service members experiencing symptoms of mental health conditions do not receive mental health care for these symptoms. The stigma associated with having a mental health condition or seeking treatment is often cited as a specific barrier to mental health care. However, study results bearing on the question of whether and how stigma may reduce treatment-seeking have been inconsistent.
Methods: We searched 10 databases for sources published between 2004 and 2014 that prospectively linked stigma to treatment-related outcomes (such as treatment seeking, retention, and reports of symptoms) using longitudinal data and predictive models. The searches yielded 2,409 sources. After reviewing titles and abstracts for relevance, we retained 15 sources to undergo full-text review.
Results: Overall, this review illustrates that evidence exploring the direct effect of stigma on treatment-related outcomes is still scant. We identified two studies whose outcomes conflict when it comes to stigma and treatment-initiation and utilization, and three studies found no relationship between stigma and treatment-initiation and utilization. One study suggested that the relationship between stigma and experience of symptoms is nuanced and may depend on the type of stigma and types of symptoms considered. Meager evidence was available to inform the relationship between stigma and treatment duration, attrition, and quality of life/functioning. The evidence was not sufficient to draw conclusions about the state of these relationships. No conclusions could be made about the direct impact of stigma on treatment-related outcomes among military service members given that only two studies explored this relationship among military service members.
Conclusion: Current research does not provide a true understanding of the degree to which mental illness stigma affects treatment-related outcomes for service members experiencing mental health challenges. This understanding could only be developed through a longitudinal study assessing prospectively whether stigma affects treatment-utilization in the military. Should such a study show that stigma reduces treatment-utilization, the military would need to consider whether changes to their current approaches to stigma reduction are warranted.

Abstract
Many people who would benefit from mental health services opt not to pursue them or fail to fully participate once they have begun. One of the reasons for this disconnect is stigma; namely, to avoid the label of mental illness and the harm it brings, people decide not to seek or fully participate in care.

Okay, so I've got some more information here. The first article from Healthline talks about how stigma prevents people from seeking mental health treatment. It mentions that despite a high prevalence of mental health issues, up to 75% of people don't seek help, and stigma is a major reason for that.

The study from Psychological Medicine, conducted by researchers at King's College London, looked at data from 144 studies and found that stigma is a significant barrier to seeking mental health treatment. They noted that fear of disclosure, concerns about confidentiality, and embarrassment are common reasons people don't seek help.

Another article from PubMed discusses a narrative review on mental health stigma and its effects on treatment-related outcomes. It highlights that while some studies show a link between stigma and reduced treatment-seeking, others find no relationship. The review suggests that more research is needed, especially among military service members.

There's also an APA article by Patrick Corrigan that delves into how stigma interferes with mental health care. It explains that stigma can harm self-esteem and limit social opportunities, both of which can discourage people from seeking or engaging in treatment.

Looking at these sources, it seems like stigma has a multifaceted impact on mental health. Not only does it make individuals feel bad about themselves, but it also affects their behavior in seeking help and participating in treatment.

I think it would be helpful to look for statistics on how many people don't seek treatment due to stigma. Maybe there are some numbers that can illustrate the scale of this issue.

From the Healthline article, it mentions that up to 75% of Americans and Europeans don't seek the help they need for mental health issues, and stigma is a major factor. That's a staggering percentage.

Also, the NIMH website has a section on statistics, which might have more current data on mental health treatment rates and the role of stigma.

I should probably check the latest statistics from reputable sources like NIMH or WHO to get an idea of how widespread this issue is.

Let me try searching for some statistics.

Self-Stigma Information • Self-Stigma Research Collaborative • Iowa State University
Self-Stigma Information
Many people who experience psychological and interpersonal concerns never pursue treatment (Corrigan, 2004). According to some estimates, within a given year, only 11% of those experiencing a diagnosable problem seek psychological services. In addition, fewer than 2% of those who struggle with problems that do not meet diagnosable criteria seek treatment (Andrews, Issakidis, & Carter, 2001). The most often cited reason for why people do not seek counseling and other mental health services is the stigma associated with mental illness and seeking treatment (Corrigan, 2004). Stigma can decrease the likelihood that an individual will seek services even when the potential consequences of not seeking counseling (e.g., increased suffering) are severe (Sibicky & Dovidio, 1986). In fact, in April 2002, during the launching of the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (http://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov ), the president declared that the stigma that surrounds mental illness is the major obstacle to Americans getting the quality mental health care they deserve. This is consistent with the 1999 surgeon general’s report on mental health (Satcher, 1999). The surgeon general’s report identified the fear of stigmatization as deterring individuals from (a) acknowledging their illness, (b) seeking help, and (c) remaining in treatment, thus creating unnecessary suffering. These commissions and reports stress the importance of better understanding the role of stigma in seeking care so that efforts to reduce stigma can be implemented.
Stigma Associated With Seeking Counseling
Stigma has been defined as a mark or flaw resulting from a personal or physical characteristic that is viewed as socially unacceptable (Blaine, 2000). The “stigma associated with seeking mental health services, therefore, is the perception that a person who seeks psychological treatment is undesirable or socially unacceptable” (Vogel, Wade, & Haake, 2006, p. 325). The existence of public stigma (i.e., negative views of the person by others) surrounding mental illness and the seeking of psychological services is clear. Past research has found that the public often describes people with a mental illness in negative terms (for a review, see Angermeyer & Dietrich, 2006). For example, survey research has shown that the majority of community respondents report negative attitudes toward people with an identified disorder (Crisp, Gelder, Rix, Meltzer, & Rowlands, 2000) and tend to avoid and perceive as dangerous those who are labeled as having been previously hospitalized (Link, Cullen, Frank, & Wozniak, 1987).
Whereas the stigma attached to being a mental health patient may not be the same as the stigma associated with being a counseling client, researchers have found that people tend to report more stigma surrounding counseling clients than nonclients. For example, people labeled as having used counseling services have been rated less favorably and treated more negatively than those who were not labeled (Sibicky & Dovidio, 1986). In scenario-based research, individuals described as seeking assistance for depression were rated as more emotionally unstable, less interesting, and less confident than those described as seeking help for back pain and than those described as not seeking help for depression (Ben-Porath, 2002). As a result, it seems that it is not just having a disorder but seeking psychological services that is stigmatized by the public.
Given the negative perceptions of those who seek psychological services, it is not surprising that individuals hide their psychological concerns and avoid treatment to limit the harmful consequences associated with being stigmatized (Corrigan & Matthews, 2003). Consistent with this, individuals are less likely to seek helpfor issues that are viewed negatively by others (Overbeck, 1977). In addition, surveys of undergraduate students have found that those who endorse stigmas of the mentally ill are less likely to seek psychological help (Cooper, Corrigan, & Watson, 2003). Researchers have also found that perceptions of counseling stigma predict attitudes toward seeking counseling (Deane & Todd, 1996; Komiya, Good, & Sherrod, 2000; Vogel, Wester, Wei, & Boysen, 2005) as well as willingness to seek counseling (Rochlen, Mohr, & Hargrove, 1999). Survey research with community samples has also found that the fear of being viewed as crazy is a common barrier to seeking professional help (Nelson & Barbaro, 1985) and that participants who do not seek therapy are more likely to report stigma as a treatment barrier than those who do (Stefl & Prosperi, 1985). Furthermore, the stigma associated with mental illness has been linked to the early termination of treatment (Sirey et al., 2001). In all, there is clear support that awareness of the stigma associated with seeking treatment has a negative influence on people’s attitudes toward seeking help and keeps many people from seeking help even when they have significant problems.
The Role of Self-Stigma
Despite the awareness of the relationship between perceived public stigma and the decision to seek treatment, the complex role that stigma plays in this decision-making process is not fully known. Corrigan (1998, 2004) asserted that there are two separate types of stigma affecting an individual’s decision to seek treatment. The first, public stigma, is the perception held by others (i.e., by society) that an individual is socially unacceptable. The second, self-stigma, is the perception held by the individual that he or she is socially unacceptable, which can lead to a reduction in self-esteem or self-worth if the person seeks psychological help (Vogel et al., 2006). In other words, the negative images expressed by society toward those who seek psychological services may be internalized (Corrigan, 1998, 2004; Holmes & River, 1998) and lead people to perceive themselves as inferior, inadequate, or weak (Nadler & Fisher, 1986). As a result, people higher in self-stigma may decide to forego psychological services to maintain a positive image of themselves (Miller, 1985).
Whereas the direct relationship of perceived public stigma on one’s willingness to seek psychological services is well established, the role of self-stigma has only recently been addressed. Related research, however, has shown that people can internalize negative perceptions when dealing with mental health issues (Link, 1987; Link & Phelan, 2001) and that being labeled mentally ill can lead to lower self-esteem (Link, Struening, Neese-Todd, Asmussen, & Phelan, 2001). In addition, modified labeling theory asserts that societal devaluation and discrimination toward the mentally ill could directly lead to negative consequences for people’s self-esteem if they are labeled, by themselves or others, as having a mental illness or as being in need of psychological care (Link, Cullen, Struening, Shrout, & Dohrenwend, 1989). Consistent with this, perceptions of stigma surrounding mental illness are related to lower self-esteem for those suffering from a mental illness (Link et al., 1987). Research has also shown that individuals are less likely to ask for help from nonprofessional sources, such as friends, if they fear embarrassment (Mayer & Timms, 1970) or if asking for help would lead them to feel inferior or incompetent (Nadler, 1991).
Studies have showed that self-stigma is conceptually different from other, potentially related constructs, such as self-esteem and public stigma, suggesting that self-stigma is potentially unique in the conceptualization of help-seeking behavior. Similarly, self-stigma uniquely predicts attitudes toward seeking psychological help and willingness to seek counseling above previously identified factors. Furthermore, research suggests that self-stigma mediates the relationship between perceived public stigma and attitudes toward seeking help as well as willingness to seek help. This mediating relationship makes sense, as public stigma’s effect on one’s decision to seek help may have as much or more to do with the internalization of societal messages about what it means to be mentally ill (Link et al., 1989) or to seek psychological services. The internalization can lead to shame and loss of self-esteem (Link, 1987), and the attempt to avoid those feelings may have the most direct effect on an individual’s attitudes toward and willingness to seek counseling.
Researchers have also recently suggested that self-stigma should be assessed even among individuals who elect to seek psychotherapy (Wade, Post, Cornish, Vogel, & Tucker, 2011). For example, researchers have found that when individuals experiencing self-stigmatizing feeling do enter treatment, self-stigma may be associated with poor treatment adherence and dropout, if self-stigma reduction is not addressed (Sirey, Bruce, Alexopoulos, Perlick, Friedman et al., 2001; Sirey, Bruce, Alexopoulos, Perlick, Roue et al., 2001). Self-stigma has also been shown to produce lasting negative effects on well-being, even when mental health symptoms largely remit (Link et al., 1997). Over time, enduring harmful effects of self-stigma may even counteract or nullify positive treatment outcomes (Link et al., 1997) and negatively affect well-being (Rosenfield, 1997), whereas reductions in self-stigma are associated with enduring positive treatment effects and of quality of life (Rosenfield, 1997). Similarly, individuals who have a positive therapeutic experience that reduces self-stigma may experience more enduring treatment benefits (Link et al., 1997). Therefore, self-stigma could be important to address both before and during treatment.

Nearly half of American households have had someone seek mental health treatment this year, but many still perceive cost and lack of insurance coverage as barriers to seeking help, according to a recent national poll by APA's Practice Directorate. The poll--a telephone survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans between the ages of 18 and 64--also shows that stigma about seeking mental health treatment is increasingly less of an obstacle to getting treatment. The Practice Directorate conducts such a poll every few years to gauge public sentiment about mental health care.
Indeed, 48 percent of those polled reported a visit to a mental health professional by someone in their household this year, and more than nine out of 10--91 percent--said they would likely consult or recommend a mental health professional if they or a family member were experiencing a problem.
"We've made progress in people's attitudes toward getting mental health treatment or seeking it for their loved ones," says Russ Newman, PhD, JD, APA's executive director for professional practice. "But cost, lack of insurance and access still can be barriers for people in getting the help they need."
In fact, 87 percent of those polled pointed to lack of insurance coverage as a barrier to seeking treatment, and 81 percent pointed to cost concerns.
The survey also found that:
Eighty-five percent of respondents thought that health insurance should cover mental health services, up from a reported 79 percent in 2000, when the Practice Directorate conducted a similar poll.
Ninety-seven percent of respondents considered access to mental health services "important," but only 70 percent feel they have adequate access to mental health care.
Only 30 percent of respondents were concerned about other people finding out if they sought mental health treatment, and 20 percent said that stigma is "a very important reason not to seek help" from a mental health professional.
Nearly half of those polled--47 percent--said that the stigma surrounding mental health services has decreased in recent years.
A similar poll released in May, "Therapy in America 2004," and co-sponsored by Psychology Today magazine and PacifiCare Behavioral Health, found that an estimated 59 million people have received mental health treatment in the past two years, and that 80 percent of them have found it effective.
Respondents to the poll--a phone survey of 501 adults followed by an online survey of 1,731 people known to have needed or received treatment--pointed to cost, lack of confidence that treatment helps and lack of health insurance as treatment barriers.

3 Reasons Why People Don’t Seek Help for Mental Health - My Mental Health
3 Reasons Why People Don’t Seek Help for Mental Health
BY ADRIAN TOH
20 August 2020  | 7 min read
Research informs that there has been an increase in Singaporeans experiencing mental health disorders between 2010-2016 1. Not only is the quality of life of affected individuals are compromised, mental health disorders can also result in productivity loss 2.
However, the treatment-seeking behaviours among those affected did not increase proportionately in comparison to the 2010 and 2016, period. There is a considerable treatment gap among the affected individuals 3. This is despite having a steady expansion of mental health-care services, training sessions and research in Singapore 4.
So, why are people not seeking help for mental health? Here are three factors and how they can play a role in minimising the impact on treatment-seeking behaviours.
Stigma
According to World Health Organisation, stigma is seen as “a mark of shame, disgrace or disapproval that results in an individual being rejected, discriminated against and excluded from participating in a number of different areas of society 5 ”.
Public stigma can lead to patients experiencing shame, loss of self-esteem and withdrawal from academic or vocational pursuits 6. Furthermore, to avoid being labelled by others, many individuals avoid receiving a diagnosis or be seen seeking mental health treatment.
A local population-wide study in 2017 found presence of significant stigma towards people with mental illness 7. In the same study, stigma was also observed as an inaccurate perception that the individuals (e.g., someone with depression) were “weak” and they may get better “with some willpower”; or “dangerous and/or unpredictable” as in someone addicted to alcohol and thus, the need for greater social distancing from them.
There are some things that we can do to reduce stigma:
Having an increased awareness of our beliefs and attitude. When we cross paths with individuals who are suffering from mental health disorders or are having difficulties with coping, it can be helpful to examine our thoughts and (emotional and behavioural) responses to consider if we are being judgemental, and where the thought and emotions are stemming from (e.g., upbringing and society).
Provide support with kindness and acceptance. Not everyone appreciates advice, to be offered help, or to be asked to visit a mental health professional. It may be more helpful and supportive to listen patiently to the person, and where necessary, discuss with the person the best way to address the issues and how you can provide specific help. In fact, most of the times, many appreciate the offer of a listening ear and good company.
Be inclusive. Instead of social distancing individuals who might seem “weak, dangerous, or unpredictable”, consider how you can include these individuals in social activities (e.g., going for a walk or having a meal) or assisting in project works.
Mental health literacy
One of the key contributors to stigma is the lack of mental health literacy. Mental health literacy has been described as “knowledge and beliefs about mental health disorders which aid recognition, management or prevention”. Many untrained (mental health) individuals in Singapore are unable to recognise different types of mental health disorders 8 .
While there are increasing number of movies and dramas that feature mental health disorders, not all of them depict the mental health disorders accurately. Similar to some food sellers who add more seasoning to make their food more flavourful (translating to sales), some of these movies and dramas script writers dramatize the presentation of mental health disorders for the same purpose. Consequently, increasing misconceptions, stigma, and reducing treatment-seeking behaviours.
A good resource to learn more about mental health is t he Singapore Psychologist, a publication by the Singapore Psychological Society. It provides a wide range of psychological perspectives on current mental health issues, ranging from anxiety, burnout, depression to eating.
Through the increased knowledge, we will be able to minimise the impact of mental health disorders through preventive actions, to recognise the symptoms of mental health disorder and to seek appropriate treatment earlier, which most often promises better chance at recovery.
“Individuals suffering from mental health disorders do not need to suffer alone, in silence. Treatments by mental health professionals are widely available.”
Awareness of resources
Lastly, there are individuals who recognise that they need help to address their mental health concerns but are limited by the awareness of resources in the community.
As highlighted earlier, mental health-care services have expanded over the years. At present, there are mental health professionals available in the public hospitals and polyclinics, family service centres, psychology clinics in universities as well as private practice. These places may vary in specialisation, cost and availability.
The Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) encourages the public and organisations to refer to the list of registered psychologists when seeking out psychological services. All psychologists wishing to be listed were rigorously examined before being included in the register. Some of the criteria includes having an appropriate post-graduate training in an applied psychology programme and having met international standards for hours of direct client work and supervision. Additionally, these registered psychologists are required to receive compulsory continuing professional development and to abide by the profession’s Code of Ethics to maintain their registration. In sum, individuals can be better assured that the registered psychologists deliver quality psychological service in an ethical manner.
Individuals suffering from mental health disorders do not need to suffer alone, in silence. Treatments by mental health professionals are widely available. Also, we can all play a part in alleviating their suffering by increasing our understanding of mental health disorders, minimising the impact of stigma, and directing them to appropriate resources in the community.
To explore the different perspectives of mental health disorders, here are some movies to watch:
Inside Out (2015) for understanding emotions
Silver Linings Playbook (2012) for understanding bipolar disorder
The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) for understanding growing up with mental illness
Welcome to Me (2015) for understanding borderline personality disorder
Still Alice (2015) for understanding Alzheimer’s disease
The contributor is the Chairman of Singapore Register of Psychologists (SRP), a member of Singapore Psychological Society and a registered Psychologist under SRP.

Barriers to Mental Health Treatment: Stigma or Self-Sufficiency?
While some media outlets are reporting that a recently published study implicates mental health stigma as one of the primary reasons for people not seeking out treatment, that’s only a part of the story.
Glossed over by most media reports of the study is that the study actually found larger barriers to treatment that pale in comparison next to the concept of “stigma” (or, more accurately, discrimination and prejudice).
Let’s take a quick look…

Foregoing mental health treatment for a serious mental illness — such as anxiety, ADHD, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or anything else — can result in more serious problems down the road. For decades, researchers have been studying why some people don’t get treatment. Their findings suggest it is a complex set of reasons behind this reluctance to seek out treatment.
The latest study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, reviewed findings from 144 studies that covered a population of nearly 90,000 subjects. The researchers specifically looked at barriers to treatment reported in these studies, and pooled the findings to come up with ten barriers to getting mental health treatment.
The fourth most common reason for not seeking treatment was stigma-associated. Yeah, fourth. But the new study, conducted at King’s College London, was only focused on examining stigma-associated reasons. The researchers didn’t really examine — and therefore, discuss — much about the other nine reasons.
So what are some of the top reasons people don’t seek treatment for mental illness? Self-sufficiency — wanting to handle the problem on one’s own — and simply feeling that they didn’t need treatment for the issue. Perhaps the issue was mild enough that although it was impacting their lives in some significant ways, they had found ways to cope with it nonetheless.
The researchers also note that for young people, the barriers may be a bit different than the rest of the population:
A systematic review of barriers and facilitators to mental health help-seeking in young people showed the key barriers to be stigma, confidentiality issues, lack of accessibility, self-reliance, low knowledge about mental health services and fear/stress about the act of help-seeking or the source of help itself (Gulliver et al. 2010).
Stigma was only reported to be a barrier to treatment by approximately a quarter to one-third of the participants. So, to be clear, most subjects in the studies reviewed did not see stigma as a significant barrier.
In addition to self-sufficiency and not seeing the need for care, gaining access to treatment in a timely and affordable manner has also been cited in past research as barriers to treatment.

Although stigma, discrimination and prejudice remain serious concerns for those seeking out mental health treatment, they are not the foremost concerns any longer among most people. That’s good news for organizations like ours who’ve spent the past 19 years online helping educate people about the basics of mental disorders and getting good mental health treatment for their concerns. It’s working, and we’re glad to hear we’ve helped make an impact.

Does CISD work?
Pros and cons
Recap
A critical incident may lead you to experience symptoms of traumatic stress, anxiety, or depression. Critical incident stress debriefing can help minimize the chances of this occurring.
Critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) is a seven-stage group intervention. It’s meant to help groups of people manage the short-term effects of a potentially traumatic event.

What is critical incident stress debriefing?
CISD is considered a form of crisis intervention that aims to perform “psychological first aid” to people exposed to or directly affected by a potentially traumatic incident. It typically occurs within 24 to 72 hours of the incident.
CISD is a structured debriefing process led by facilitators and carried out in small groups of around 20 people.
It was created in 1974 by Dr. Jeffrey T. Mitchell, a professor of emergency health services and a former first responder.
CISD was originally designed to help first responders manage emotional pain and stress and reduce the chances of them experiencing long-term mental health effects.
First responders may include:
disaster response crews
emergency dispatchers
firefighters
hospital workers
lifeguards
military personnel
paramedics
police officers
CISD has most recently been adopted by multiple other industries, including:
aviation
banking
churches
railroad
mining
oil
education
What is a critical incident?
A critical incident may mean different things to different people. In general, it refers to a sudden and unexpected event that has a significant impact on your mind, body, or emotions.
This critical incident has the potential to cause long lasting effects on your mental health.
Critical incidents may include:
accidents or crashes
military combat
wildfires or arson
natural disasters like tornadoes or floods
shootings
hate crimes
tragedies involving children
In some cases, you don’t have to experience these critical incidents firsthand to experience some of their effects. Witnessing a hate crime, for example, can also feel like an intensely overwhelming event.
If you experience distress from this experience, this is referred to as “critical incident stress.”
Signs of critical incident stress
Critical stress impacts people uniquely, but there are some general signs to watch for. For some people, symptoms can be similar to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Physical signs
chest pains
dizziness
exhaustion
headache
increased thirst
loss of appetite
shallow breathing
sleep disturbances
tremors
Cognitive signs
brain fog
confusion
dissociation
flashbacks
impaired ability to make decisions
nightmares
trouble concentrating
Emotional signs
anger or rage
anxiety
depression
grief
irritability
survivor guilt
Behavioral signs
difficulty relaxing
not showing up to work
social withdrawal
substance use disorder
reduced communication

Basics of critical incident stress debriefing
Facilitators
Typically, there’s one facilitator for every five to seven people. At a minimum, there are always two facilitators present in CISD.
At least one facilitator is a licensed mental health professional, and the other is someone with the same background or a similar background as those who experienced the critical incident.
Group
In the case of first responders, participants of CISD are typically part of the same unit or team.
They’ve had a “homogeneous” experience, meaning they all experienced the critical incident or the aftermath at roughly the same time and with the same intensity.
The members of the group may have already displayed symptoms of stress or impaired functioning since the incident, or they have the potential to experience these at some point.
Goals
There are three main objectives of CISD, as outlined by Mitchell:
reducing the long-term impacts of the critical event
supporting the healing process so people can overcome the traumatic event
screening for those who might need extra support
Sessions
A CISD session lasts 1 to 3 hours. It can vary depending on how many people are involved and how traumatic the experience was.
Stages of critical incident stress debriefing
CISD goes through seven phases over the course of one session:
1. Introduction
Everyone introduces themselves, and the facilitators lay out some ground rules for the session.
2. Fact phase
The facilitators encourage everyone to go around the room and give a brief description of what they experienced.
3. Thought phase
The facilitators ask participants what they first thought about the event when they realized what was happening.
4. Reaction phase
The facilitators ask group members what impact this experience has had on them, and what emotions or thoughts they’ve experienced since.
For example, they may experience:
anger
grief
confusion
a sense of loss
5. Symptom phase
The facilitators ask the team what kinds of physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms they’ve experienced since the disturbing event.
6. Teaching phase
The facilitators discuss the rationale behind common stress symptoms to add context to what the group is experiencing.
7. Reentry phase
The facilitators summarize what has been discussed and provide resources for further support.
Follow-up
After the group session ends, the facilitators may have the group members gather informally for refreshments so they have a chance to connect on an individual level.
Is critical incident stress debriefing effective?
Among other benefits, CISD can help people not feel so alone in their experiences, says Janika Joyner, a licensed clinical social worker in Chesapeake, Virginia, who often uses therapy dogs in conjunction with debriefs.
“As a psychotherapist who has provided CISD for mass shootings (like Virginia Beach in 2019) and multiple employee deaths for various organizations, I would say that it is effective,” she says.
While it can’t replace therapy, CISD can certainly spark conversations about therapy.
“CISD can assist individuals with deciding to enter treatment and begin therapy to deal with any long-term symptoms that go beyond acute responses,” she adds. “Then, therapy teaches a person how to manage those symptoms.”
To date, the research on CISD is still mixed.
A 2019 literature review found that while hospital personnel viewed CISD as important, it was still unknown whether it could reduce symptoms of PTSD.
In a 2021 review, Mitchell suggests that the CISD method is effective for disaster survivors and response teams alike, provided that the facilitators are crisis-trained.
On the other hand, a 2022 review of studies found that only one study out of nine showed that psychological debriefing is effective in reducing psychological distress after a critical incident.
The existing body of literature may be difficult to assess because some studies use a modified version of Mitchell’s CSID method, and this could skew the results.
Overall, more research is needed to determine how effective CISD is.
Pros and cons of CISD
“In my own work in the disaster mental health field, I have found many of the CISD tools to be effective,” says Dr. Sandra Wartski, a licensed psychologist in Raleigh, North Carolina. “However, there are situations when CISD might not be appropriate or able to be properly put into practice. ”
Pros
provides a chance to educate personnel on the stress response and possible effects
may be convenient to have on-site services
may reduce burnout and compassion fatigue
gives an opportunity to connect with others who have similar experiences
can promote cohesion as a unit
offers a small group environment
Cons
may discourage folks who would rather speak privately
is only a short-term offering, rather than ongoing support
may be difficult to make time for it in demanding or low staff environments

Let’s recap
Critical incident stress debriefing is a facilitated technique for helping small groups process a potentially traumatic experience.
It was designed to reduce long-term symptoms of traumatic stress and help first responder groups return to their usual level of functioning as a team.
Studies are mixed on how effective CSID can be, so more research is still needed.

So, from these articles, it's clear that stigma is a significant barrier to seeking mental health treatment. The Healthline article mentions that up to 75% of Americans and Europeans don't seek help for mental health issues, and stigma is a major reason for that. The Psychological Medicine study reviewed 144 studies and found that stigma is one of the top reasons people choose not to seek care.

However, in one of the articles, it's noted that stigma is only the fourth most common reason people don't seek treatment. The top reasons include self-sufficiency—wanting to handle problems on their own—and not feeling the need for treatment. So, while stigma is definitely a factor, it's not the only or even the primary barrier for many people.

I think it's important to consider all the factors that prevent people from seeking help, not just stigma. For example, access to care, cost, and lack of insurance are also major barriers, as mentioned in the APA Monitor article.

Additionally, the concept of self-stigma is interesting. It seems that when people internalize negative stereotypes about mental illness, it can lower their self-esteem and make them less likely to seek help. So, it's not just about what others think; it's also about how individuals perceive themselves.

I recall that in some cultures, mental health stigma is even stronger, which might further deter people from seeking help. It would be worthwhile to look into cultural differences in stigma and their effects on mental health treatment-seeking behaviors.

Maybe I should look for some cross-cultural studies on this topic.

How cultural stigma impacts those seeking mental health services
Understanding the role of cultural stigma on seeking mental health services
August 4, 2020
Mental health stigma may impact whether a person seeks mental health services and treatment, or their decision not to seek care at all.

For some people, making an appointment with a mental health provider may be a personal and independent decision. For others, the decision to seek therapy services may be influenced by their culture or community, as each culture has its own understanding, interpretation and beliefs around mental health symptoms.
Our own culture also teaches us ways to cope with distress and whom to rely on for support during difficult times. This may impact whether a person seeks mental health services and treatment, or their decision not to seek care at all.
In many cultures, negative stigma about mental health symptoms or therapy services is a major obstacle to getting professional help. Research shows that people in racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.S. are less likely than White people to seek outpatient therapy services. Many ethnic minority groups are more comfortable going to their primary care physicians or family members for assistance with mental health symptoms as opposed to speaking with a mental health provider. We all want to be accepted by our communities, and sometimes fear of shame or embarrassment prevents people from seeking mental health treatment.
For instance, Black families may be understandably reluctant to seek mental health therapy due to the longstanding history of discrimination, racism and mistreatment the Black community has experienced at the hands of providers in the U.S. Instead, they tend to take an active approach in handling adversities independently and directly. They also tend to rely more on spiritual resources for emotional support. While these beliefs and approaches are valid, overly negative views of therapy can keep children who do need a higher level of care from getting that help.
Studies show that Latinx (a gender neutral reference to a person of Latin American cultural or ethnic identity in the U.S.) families are also less likely to trust mental health providers compared to White families and are more likely to rely on social support from extended family and other community members. When Latinx individuals do tell others about their experiences with stress or emotional difficulties, they often focus on physical symptoms such as trouble sleeping or loss of appetite and are less likely to discuss the thoughts or feelings that are bothering them.
For Asian American and Middle Eastern American communities, cultural beliefs that seeking mental health treatment will bring shame and dishonor to the family leads some people to internalize their symptoms instead of seeking therapy. Many Asian American children have described feeling pressured to appear perfect and successful, and therefore keep their symptoms secret. For Middle Eastern American adolescents, research has found that they tend to seek support from other family and religious community members.
While these beliefs and approaches are valid, overly negative views of therapy can keep children who do need a higher level of care from getting that help.
These examples are broad, but they illustrate just a few of the reasons why ethnic minority children are much less likely to receive therapy when they need it. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the mental and medical health system to make services more accessible to under-served families, and to spark change to counteract myths about the stigma of mental health symptoms and mental health treatment. Parents can also play an important role in examining their family’s own cultural beliefs about treatment and identifying ways to advocate for their children to get expert help whenever they need it.
How our community can end mental health stigma
So, how do we, as parents, healthcare professionals and the community begin to work on eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health disorders and accessing mental health services? After all, one in five children experiences a mental health disorder.
Here are some tips that can help our children and families feel more comfortable with identifying, discussing, managing and accessing services for mental health.
Seek reliable information
A first step that we can take to end mental health stigma is to seek out reliable and accurate information about mental health disorders, treatment options and resources in our community. Trusted sources can include, but are not limited to:
National Alliance on Mental Illness
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
Orange County Health Care Agency
CHOC mental health education and services
When speaking to children about mental health, use resources that are age-appropriate and engaging. A young child may find books helpful, while an older child may prefer to get information online. Look over resources with your child to help them find reputable sources of information and avoid popular social media platforms as your only source of information. Not sure how to start? Here are a few resources for kids:
OK2Talk.org
Sesame Street Communities
CHOC’s Let’s Talk About It guides for starting conversations around mental health
Use appropriate language
The resources listed above can help you understand how to talk to your children about mental health issues, as well as how to dispel mental health myths they might have heard about conditions and treatment. Using correct language can reduce any shame or guilt you or your family and friends may have about mental health and can create a space that makes it easier for children and teens to speak openly about their own struggles and seek help.
Celebrities normalizing mental health conditions
Because so many people live with and manage symptoms related to a mental health condition, it isn’t hard to find a celebrity or well-known public figure your child admires who has a mental health condition. We can use celebrity or public figure examples to help normalize mental health conditions and access to mental health treatment. Our children will be more open to discussing their mental health condition and to trying out mental health services if they know that their favorite singer, actor or athlete also lives with a mental health condition.
Learn to explain your child’s mental health condition to your support system and community
Once we have accurate information about our child’s mental health condition and treatment plan, it could help to share this information. If we share information about mental health with our families, schools or places of worship, as well as other members of our support system, they can each better understand the child’s mental health and how they manage symptoms. Sharing information can also help increase empathy and support for the child’s well-being.
Seek support in your community
Children and teens with mental health conditions may not know anyone else with a similar diagnosis, which can impact their self-esteem. For teens especially, finding support from an online community may be a helpful way to openly speak about their mental health condition. Parents may also benefit from knowing other parents with children who have mental health conditions, as this can allow families to find a sense of community or support. Your local National Alliance on Mental Illness chapter offers peer support groups for parents and individuals with mental health conditions.
Advocacy
Engaging in advocacy is another way that parents and community members can help break down mental health stigma. Organizations like National Alliance on Mental Illness engage in advocacy and policy change using individual’s stories. Advocacy can help raise awareness about important mental health issues and help dispel myths and break down stigma. It could also have positive impacts for those who are engaging in advocacy, helping to develop a sense of solidarity and common purpose.

Cultural and Ethnic Stigmas Surrounding Mental Health - Shepell·fgi
Cultural and Ethnic Stigmas Surrounding Mental Health
PRINT ARTICLE
Mental illness is such a serious issue  that the Surgeon General of the United States has made this explicit  recommendation for all people: "Seek help if you have a mental health problem  or think you have symptoms of a mental disorder."
And yet it’s recognized that most  people who have mental health problems do not get help. The reasons why are  complex, but one of the main reasons is stigma. Stigma is defined as a mark of  disgrace. Cultural and ethnic stigma around mental health can impact people  dramatically despite the overall prevalence of mental illness being the same  across all people.
The Impact of Culture and Ethnicity on Mental  Illness
The ethnicity of a person is their race  while their culture is the norms and values with which they identify, and both  can affect the way people view and treat mental illness. While cultural and  ethnic differences are known to have strong effects, studying the phenomenon is  very difficult as people must admit to the stigmas that often go unsaid in a  community. Cultures feel the stigmas without anyone having to explicitly  express them.
The overall prevalence of mental  illness is known to be the same across all races; however it is interesting to  discover that there are some differences in mental health divided by culture  and ethnicity, reinforcing just how pervasive these two elements can be. These  include:
Suicide rates
Incidence of "culture-bound" syndromes  or "folk illnesses"; diseases or conditions that are only recognized within a  specific cultural or society – examples include specific sleep disorders and suppressed-anger  syndrome
Prevalence of mental illness type;  depression versus phobias and anxiety as an example
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)  rates, especially in relation to war-zone trauma
Mental Health Perceptions Influenced by  Culture and Ethnicity
Stigmas around mental illness occur  both towards specific populations and from within it. Consider the following  stigmas that have been found to exist within specific cultures and ethnicities  today:
Rating of people  with a mental illness as more dangerous as compared to the ratings of another race
Increased  desire to be separated from an individual with mental illness, despite research  showing interaction and proximity normally reduces stigma
Increased  fear of treatment due to perceptions of unfair treatment in the healthcare  setting due to race
Decreased communication  about the state of personal mental health to a physician, mental health  professional or even friend
Mental  illness is seen to reflect poorly on the  entire family, diminishing marriage and economic prospects overall
Making Changes
Increased awareness, education and  sharing facts about mental health in today’s multi-cultural society are all key  areas of opportunity. The good news is that there are anti-stigma campaign  success stories; a specific ethnic group that originally ranked people with a  mental illness as more dangerous than other ethnicities did actually changed  their perceptions after being given anti-stigma information. This shows that  anti-stigma campaigns can work to reduce mental illness stigmas and that  targeting these campaigns towards specific ethnicities may be crucial to their  success.

Abstract
Most stigma research to date has considered the stigma of mental illness to be a universal occurrence, but one that presents with different manifestations in different contexts. Yang et al., for example, observe that ‘stigma appears to be a universal phenomenon, a shared existential experience’ (Yang et al. 2007) (p. 1528). In a review of the global evidence on stigma and discrimination, Thornicroft concludes that ‘there is no known country, society or culture where people with mental illness (diagnosed or recognised as such by the community) are considered to have the same value or be as acceptable as persons who do not have mental illness’(Thornicroft 2006).

... Yet there is no comprehensive theoretical model for SBA. Research suggests that family stigma is no monolithic phenomenon, because it varies depending on the relationship the family member has with the person with the mental illness: studies have shown that parents of children with a mental illness are more likely to experience the stigma of neglect and blame for their children's disease onset (12, 28), and the siblings of children with a mental illness and spouses of someone with a mental illness are more likely to experience the stigma of blame for the persistence of their relative's disease (12); COPMI are more likely to face the stigma of "contamination"meaning that the general population believes that parental illness, and especially regarding COPMI, is passed on to children (29).

... Explaining diversity makes the results more complicated if we consider different samples and completely different cultures. Indeed, the manifestation of stigma is under the influence of culture,therefore, diverse experiences worldwide are almost a universal phenomenon [16].  ...
... Another possibility includes cultural contextualization that plays a mediator role in different cultures. Furthermore, previous studies have explored that socioeconomic factors, including income and accessing healthcare services, pertain to mental illness consequences, which are more than just cultural diversity [16]. Thus, reviewing other relevant factors is not within the scope of this research paper, and performing more cross-cultural studies is strongly recommended.  ...

... Attitudes about seeking help among Asian Americans have been found to be related to a preference for self-control (Han & Pong, 2015) and a tendency towards self-concealment (Masuda & Boone, 2011).

Cultural Perspectives on Mental Health
Module 7: Cultural Perspectives on Mental Health
Stigma,  Discrimination, and Mental Health
Mental illness stigma is defined  as the “devaluing, disgracing, and disfavoring by the  general public of individuals with mental illnesses”. (1) Stigma often leads to discrimination, or the  inequitable treatment of individuals and the denial of  the “rights and responsibilities that accompany full citizenship”. (2) Stigmatization  can cause individual discrimination, which occurs  when a stigmatized person is directly denied a resource (e.g. access  to housing or a job), and structural  discrimination, which describes  disadvantages stigmatized people experience at  the economic, social,  legal, and institutional levels. (3) In addition, stigma  can prevent mentally ill individuals from seeking treatment, adhering  to treatment regimens, finding employment, and  living successfully in community settings. In 2001, the World  Health Organization (WHO) identified stigma and discrimination towards mentally  ill individuals as “the single most important barrier to overcome in the  community”, and the WHO’s Mental Health Global  Action Programme (mhGAP) cited  advocacy against stigma and discrimination as one of its four core strategies  for improving the state of global mental health. (4) (5)
Cultural Perspectives  on Mental Illness
Attitudes toward mental illness vary  among individuals, families, ethnicities, cultures, and countries. Cultural and  religious teachings often influence beliefs about the origins and nature of  mental illness, and shape  attitudes towards the mentally ill. In addition to influencing whether mentally  ill individuals experience social stigma, beliefs about mental illness can  affect patients’ readiness and willingness to seek  and adhere to treatment. (6) Therefore, understanding individual and cultural beliefs about mental illness  is essential for the implementation of  effective approaches to mental health care. Although each  individual’s experience with  mental illness is unique, the following  studies offer a sample of cultural  perspectives on mental illness.
A review of ethnocultural beliefs and mental  illness stigma by Abdullah et al. (2011) highlights the wide range of cultural  beliefs surrounding mental health.  For instance, while some American Indian tribes do not stigmatize mental illness, others stigmatize only some mental  illnesses, and other tribes stigmatize all mental illnesses. In Asia, where  many cultures value “conformity to norms, emotional self-control, [and] family  recognition through achievement”, mental illnesses are often stigmatized and  seen as a source of shame. (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other  factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In  a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a  vignette in which an  individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major  depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded  that the individual’s illness was  “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants  were asked to rate how they would feel if  one of their children dated, married, or  reproduced with the subject of the  vignette. Genetic attribution of  mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce  among Chinese Americans, but it increased  the same measures among European Americans, supporting  previous findings of cultural variations in  patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)
Many studies have reported other  significant differences in attitudes towards mental  illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song  et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic  study of 25 severely mentally ill  individuals living in inner city Hartford,  Connecticut. The European American participants frequently  sought care from mental health professionals and tended  to express beliefs about mental illness that were aligned with biomedical  perspectives on disease. In contrast,  African American and Latino participants were more likely  to emphasize “non-biomedical interpretations” of mental illness symptoms. Although  participants of all three ethnic groups reported experiencing stigma due to  their mental health, stigma was a  core component of the African Americans’  responses but was not  highly emphasized by  the European Americans. While European Americans tended to view psychiatric  medications as “central and necessary” aspects of treatment, African  American participants reported frustration over  mental health professionals’ focus on medication. Furthermore, Latino  participants often viewed clinical diagnoses as “potentially very socially  damaging”, preferring to describe their mental health conditions more generally  as nervios, which was perceived to  hold less stigma. Because African Americans and Latinos in the U.S. are  significantly less likely to seek and receive mental health care  compared to European Americans, investigating  possible cultural contributions to this usage pattern may help  efforts to increase uptake of  mental health care services. (9)
Bailey  et al. (2011) also report negative attitudes toward health care professionals among  many African Americans, noting that stigma, religious  beliefs, distrust of the medical profession, and communication barriers may  contribute to African Americans’ wariness  of mental health services. (10) In a 2007 study, approximately 63% of African Americans  viewed depression as a “personal weakness”, 30% reported that  they would deal with depression themselves, and  only one-third reported that they would accept medication  for depression if prescribed by a medical professional. (11) Because African Americans are less likely to receive proper diagnosis and  treatment for depression and are more likely to have depression for longer  periods, African Americans’  perceptions of mental illness and the medical profession should  be taken into account in efforts to improve mental health care  access. (12)
Although  the reasons for stigmatization are  not consistent across communities or cultures, perceived stigma by individuals  living with mental illness is reported internationally. For  instance, the World Mental Health Surveys showed that stigma  was closely associated with anxiety and mood disorders among adults reporting  significant disability. The survey data, which included responses from 16  countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South  Pacific, showed that 22.1% of participants from  developing countries and 11.7% of participants from  developed countries experienced embarrassment and discrimination due to their  mental illness. However, the authors note that these figures likely  underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they  only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)
Finally,  presenting mental health care services in  culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to  increasing access to and usage of mental health care services,  as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical  perspective on mental illness.  For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes  toward mental illness surveyed students at  a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in  the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.  The Indian students were more likely to view depression as  arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and  to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation”  as ways to deal with depression. The authors report that “conceptualizations  and treatments” for depression should take into account diverse  perspectives on mental illness in order to maximize the  effectiveness of mental health care  delivery programs.

Genetic attribution of  mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce  among Chinese Americans, but it increased  the same measures among European Americans, supporting  previous findings of cultural variations in  patterns of mental illness stigmatization.

Many studies have reported other  significant differences in attitudes towards mental  illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song  et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic  study of 25 severely mentally ill  individuals living in inner city Hartford,  Connecticut. The European American participants frequently  sought care from mental health professionals and tended  to express beliefs about mental illness that were aligned with biomedical  perspectives on disease. In contrast,  African American and Latino participants were more likely  to emphasize “non-biomedical interpretations” of mental illness symptoms. Although  participants of all three ethnic groups reported experiencing stigma due to  their mental health, stigma was a  core component of the African Americans’  responses but was not  highly emphasized by  the European Americans. While European Americans tended to view psychiatric  medications as “central and necessary” aspects of treatment, African  American participants reported frustration over  mental health professionals’ focus on medication. Furthermore, Latino  participants often viewed clinical diagnoses as “potentially very socially  damaging”, preferring to describe their mental health conditions more generally  as nervios, which was perceived to  hold less stigma. Because African Americans and Latinos in the U.S. are  significantly less likely to seek and receive mental health care  compared to European Americans, investigating  possible cultural contributions to this usage pattern may help  efforts to increase uptake of  mental health care services.

Bailey  et al. (2011) also report negative attitudes toward health care professionals among  many African Americans, noting that stigma, religious  beliefs, distrust of the medical profession, and communication barriers may  contribute to African Americans’ wariness  of mental health services. (10) In a 2007 study, approximately 63% of African Americans  viewed depression as a “personal weakness”, 30% reported that  they would deal with depression themselves, and  only one-third reported that they would accept medication  for depression if prescribed by a medical professional. (11) Because African Americans are less likely to receive proper diagnosis and  treatment for depression and are more likely to have depression for longer  periods, African Americans’  perceptions of mental illness and the medical profession should  be taken into account in efforts to improve mental health care  access. (12)
Although  the reasons for stigmatization are  not consistent across communities or cultures, perceived stigma by individuals  living with mental illness is reported internationally. For  instance, the World Mental Health Surveys showed that stigma  was closely associated with anxiety and mood disorders among adults reporting  significant disability. The survey data, which included responses from 16  countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South  Pacific, showed that 22.1% of participants from  developing countries and 11.7% of participants from  developed countries experienced embarrassment and discrimination due to their  mental illness. However, the authors note that these figures likely  underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they  only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)
Finally,  presenting mental health care services in  culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to  increasing access to and usage of mental health care services,  as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical  perspective on mental illness.  For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes  toward mental illness surveyed students at  a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in  the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.  The Indian students were more likely to view depression as  arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and  to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation”  as ways to deal with depression. The authors report that “conceptualizations  and treatments” for depression should take into account diverse  perspectives on mental illness in order to maximize the  effectiveness of mental health care  delivery programs.
