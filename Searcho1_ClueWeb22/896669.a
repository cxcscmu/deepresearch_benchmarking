I'm trying to understand why some customers might be challenging to one individual but not to another. This seems like it could be related to various factors such as communication style, personality clashes, or even specific behaviors. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to consider what makes a customer challenging. Is it their behavior, their expectations, or perhaps their level of difficulty in being satisfied? It's probably a combination of these factors. So, if a customer is challenging to one person but not another, there must be something different about how each person interacts with the customer.

Maybe it's about communication styles. Some people are better at communicating with certain types of personalities. For example, a customer who is very detail-oriented might be easier to handle for someone who is also detail-oriented, whereas someone who is more laid-back might struggle with that customer's need for specifics.

Another factor could be past experiences. If one individual has had negative interactions with a particular customer, that might color their future interactions, making them more challenging. On the other hand, another person who hasn't had those past issues might find the same customer easier to deal with.

Perhaps it's also about expectations. Different individuals may have different expectations of what constitutes good service, and customers might respond differently based on whether those expectations are met. So, if one person consistently meets or exceeds the customer's expectations, the interactions are smoother, whereas another person might not understand those expectations as well.

Cultural backgrounds could play a role too. Differences in culture can affect communication styles and expectations, so what might be straightforward for one person could be misinterpreted by another due to cultural differences.

It's also possible that some customers prefer certain traits in the people they deal with. For example, some customers might prefer dealing with someone who is very assertive, while others might prefer someone who is more nurturing or patient. Therefore, the compatibility between the customer's preferences and the individual's personality could determine how challenging the interaction is.

Moreover, the way each individual handles complaints or issues could vary. Someone who is adept at problem-solving and conflict resolution might find it easier to handle difficult customers, whereas someone who struggles with these skills might find the same customers more challenging.

Training and experience also come into play. A more experienced employee might know exactly how to handle a difficult customer, whereas a newer employee might not yet have developed those skills.

Emotional intelligence is another key factor. Individuals with higher emotional intelligence might be better at reading and managing their own emotions as well as the emotions of the customer, leading to smoother interactions.

So, in summary, there are multiple reasons why some customers might be challenging to one individual but not to another. These include communication styles, past experiences, expectations, cultural backgrounds, personality compatibility, problem-solving skills, level of training, and emotional intelligence.

To get a more concrete understanding, maybe I should look up some research or articles on this topic. Perhaps there are studies that have explored why certain customer-service interactions are more difficult than others based on the individual providing the service.

Let me try searching for some information on this.

1. Why are some customers challenging to one individual and not to another? As we learn from young adults as we start to communicate with different people in our lives it may be easier to understand some people a little better. Although my parents and I speak the same language sometimes I find it difficult to understand what their objective is or what exactly they are trying to communicate. In sales it is the same with customers and sales people, both have a similar objective. Sales person wants to sell the product while customer wants to buy the product, but not always are they able to get on the same page. There are several reasons that some customers can be a challenge to some while others find the customer easily understood. Difficulty in making decisions, feelings of bias or visibly upset about something (other than the situation at hand) are all reasons I am aware I may be a difficult customer for some sales people, while others understand that as a woman I need to be treated equally or that I may have had a bad experience in the pastd.

( page 29 Pearson Custom Library MKTG 1230 ) Knowing the changing aspects of the customers sales people are calling is not the only importance in positioning the product . Understanding and communicating the difference in new and existing products .

Five Reasons Why Customer Service is Hard
Five Reasons Why Customer Service is Hard
Jeff Toister
Your service culture guide.
Published Apr 14, 2014
+ Follow
Customer service is hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is in denial, bad at it, or both. The notion that serving customers is easy is something I’ve referred to as the Biggest Myth in Customer Service.
There are many reasons why customer service isn’t easy. These obstacles range from poor corporate strategy to ineffective leadership to our own limitations as human beings.
Here are five common examples:
#1 It’s not instinctive
There are many situations where our natural instincts result in the wrong customer service move.
For example, if you encounter an angry or upset person, your “fight or flight” instinct will kick in. This is a natural urge to either fight the danger (verbally or physically) or flee the danger. Neither is acceptable in customer service, so employees wind up struggling against their own instincts when they try to make the upset customer happy again.
#2 Our customers see what we don't
People tend to get locked in to a certain perspective, but this perspective may not match our customer’s. This can cause us to be blind to a customer's need that might be obvious in hindsight.
The classic nine dot puzzle provides an example of how this naturally happens.
Connect all nine dots using just four straight lines.
You can't lift your finger off the screen
If you get stumped, click here to find the solution.
#3 It's sometimes hard to be friendly
Customer service employees are supposed to be friendly, but what happens when an employee doesn’t feel friendly?
It takes effort to outwardly project a feeling you don’t really feel. The worse you actually feel, the harder it gets to pretend you're in a good mood. This effort, called emotional labor, can leave people physically and mentally exhausted.
To add insult to injury, research shows that customer service employees don’t get paid very much for their emotional labor.
#4 We aren’t good at multitasking
Multitasking is a requirement for many customer service jobs. Unfortunately, we’re not very good at it. The end result is multitasking hurts service quality.
That’s because our brains can only process one conscious thought at a time. When we try to do more, we’re really just rapidly shifting resources between various thoughts. The inevitable result is we operate slower and are more prone to making mistakes.
#5 Directed Attention Fatigue
All of this chronic multitasking causes a condition called Directed Attention Fatigue. It comes from overusing the part of our brain that focuses attention.
Here are a few of the symptoms:
Distractibility
Irritability
Impatience
Indecisiveness
Difficulty starting and finishing tasks
Obviously, none of these symptoms are good for customer service. You can read more about it in a blog post I wrote called “ How detoxing our brains can improve customer service .”
What can you do about it?
Start by embracing the fact that customer service is difficult. If you want to serve your customers at the highest level, you have to work at it every day.
Next, slow down and focus on one customer at a time. The obstacles described above get exacerbated when we get anxious and try to do too many things at once.
Finally, learn from experience. When you encounter a challenging customer service situation, think about what you'll do differently next time to get a better result.

I don't mind serving a customer as long as there are no time constraints.  However, there are ALWAYS time constraints.  :)

I find a customer service specialist as a person who represents a company in the best way in order to meet the need of the company's customers. Excellent communications skills and a creative problem - solving also are a must.

I always adopted the attitude that anyone I dealt with was my customer and if that was another employee it took just a little of my time to explain what the objectives were and to suggest that if it nwas unsatisfactory maybe another employer was their answer, and if the corporation was responsible for the unhappy employee bring it to the attention of the appropriate department to put it right.

Burn out is also a poor excuse.   Establishing a rapport with anyone is simply convincing them you understand their concerns and acting positively to address these concerns. If the corporation is unable to accept that, and honor the commitment of the employee to bring satisfaction to the customer, then the corporation should get out of the business and allow corporations who can to excel at what they do.

Compensation is a crock. Customers merely want what they paid for. If corporations cannot deliver they deserve to be hit for compensation. But understanding how a customer feels is the first and most successful step in establishing a relationship with a disappointed customer and retrieving lost customer appreciation. If the corporation or its representatives have failed to meet customer expectation then the cost of recovery of that customer's patronage is a fair expense and not to be argued

Bill McCall
Corporations are more focused on what they consider the correct procedures and adhering to them for corporate control purposes, that on conceding that customers do not know and do not care what the company expects. Customer expectations do not take account of what the corporation feels its obligations may be. The corporation or employee who best understands that the customer expectations are not connected to the corporate goals, are those who will successfully deliver the best levels of customer service

So very true. As a person who has 10 plus years of experience in customer service, I still find every day and every customer I meet a learning experience. There is no single magic wand to resolve customer dissatisfaction. But 70% of problems get solved the moment you go to customer's place and show your earnestness in resolving his problem.

That's why Customers are believed to be Kings.

If they are kings, we are the subjects against/towards whom the king should never be hard but should, instead, be always soft and responsive to situations

It is unfortunate that emotional labour is never recognised for remuneration. It appears to be part of the business game

This is so true.  I think workplaces should also rethink how customer service departments are set up - most commonly customer service departments seem to be set up in a "bull pen" sort of way.  Being in close quarters with other CSR's increases distraction greatly, and also promotes inter-office conflict (gossip, tattling, etc.) as many people become too distracted by what other people are doing rather than accomplishing their own tasks.

4 Types Of Challenging Customers And How To Deal With Them
by Danielle McGaw
As a server, it is important to know how to communicate with different kinds of people. Some customers will be easy. Others will be more challenging. When you come across those challenging customers, it is crucial that you know how to deal with them.
Here are some of the challenging customers that you are likely to come across and tips for dealing with them appropriately.
Challenging Customer #1: The “Nothing Is Right” Customer
This customer may be looking for things to complain about because it makes them feel important. The soup is not hot enough. There’s a spot on this knife. Where is my ranch dressing (usually asked when you have a tray full of other stuff that they have asked for plus meals and your other hand has a pot of coffee in it)?
The most important thing that you need to remember when is that you must keep your cool! Don’t snip at them. Don’t roll your eyes. Remain calm. Losing your cool could result in a negative online review that can’t be erased!
The second thing you can do is apologize (even knowing that their complaint is out of your control) and get them what they want as quickly as you can. Apologies go a long way.
Challenging Customer #2: The “I’m The Most Important Person Here” Customer
In the hospitality industry, some days can get extremely busy and you suddenly find yourself with a full section all at once. Most people are understanding when this happens. But there will almost always be that one customer that thinks they are the only person in the restaurant and expects more than humanly possible from you.
It might be tempting to point out how busy the restaurant is. Instead, put a smile on your face and apologize. Let them know that you will take care of their needs (more coffee, dessert, etc) as soon as possible.
If there is a genuine reason (like being short-staffed) you can tell them. You can make them aware that you have other things that need your attention, too, but do it in a way that doesn’t sound like you are making excuses. Keep it simple. “I just need to get one more food order out and then I will be right back with the coffee pot.” Then make sure that you do come right back!
Finally, thank them for being so understanding, even if they aren’t.
Challenging Customer #3: The “I Need My Food ASAP” Customer
There will always be that one table that is in a rush. There is always a reason why their time is limited.
The best thing you can do is have a shortlist of menu items that can be made and delivered in a short amount of time. Memorize them. Be ready to suggest them to the customer.
First, find out how much time they have and then, check with the kitchen staff. The BOH is going to be really annoyed if you come in with an order that you’ve promised in a short time and they are getting slammed with a 15 top’s orders!
Once you confirm with the kitchen staff that they can make the order within the customer’s time constraints, suggest menu items to the customer. Keep an eye on the clock and make sure that you get them the bill before they have to leave. Be ready to clear the table when they are done eating and pack up food that they have not been able to finish.
Challenging Customer #4: The “Let Me Tell You My Life Story” Customer
As a server, being sociable is part of your job. When there is time, it can be enjoyable to hear people’s stories. Unfortunately, you aren’t paid to socialize and it isn’t often that you have time for it. How do you get out of it without being rude though?
First, smile and nod. Let them know that you enjoy the conversation. As soon as you have an opportunity though, let them know that you have another table waiting for you and that if you have time you will come back so they can finish telling you about their granddaughter’s first steps or the great shopping find that they got earlier in the day.
Above all, be polite, but be assertive. You are in control of the situation.
If you think that you can deal with challenging customers like these and the other types of challenging customers that people in the hospitality industry come across, check out the FOH jobs available now.

Characteristics of Challenging Customers - Best Essays ASAP

Characteristics of Challenging Customers
List 3 characteristics of challenging customers. Next, explain how you would deal with each of the 3 by using ways to cope with challenging customers.
Challenging customer are the customers who are creating problems, questions, and they want special treatment to meet their demands. There are several properties of challenging customer such as gossip client, who usually wants to talk all the time without sense or meaning, and likes debate and enthusiasm, which is not logical in its responses. The egotist client who feels that he is distinct from the others and thinks so. This client thinks deliberately through his mind that you exist for only to serve him. Impatient client who is a hasty, impatient, needs to implement its business at that moment,and without the impact of a client, passionate.
To deal with gossip client I have to:
1 – This requires the client to deal with a private seller or employee.
2 – I should give attention to what he says, then trying to attract the main theme in a friendly manner.
3 – I do not try to silence the talkative client by force!
To deal with egotist client  I have to:
1 – This client is easy to handle with him;it is enough to satisfy his ego
2 –I must be patient and that you have the ability to courtesy.
To deal with impatient client I have to:
1 –I should try to provide the service to him as soon as possible.
2 –I try to equip the workplace or work environment and tools do not things can feel bored.
3 –I try to leave nothing to him if it is busy you are dealing with another customer.
4 –I try to give him attention from one moment to another and in the office with another customer.
Do you feel employees are motivated by money, recognition, or both
Motivate employees has two types money, and recognition. All of them have power and effective to achieve productivity and effectiveness of every company employee. Money rewards is popular in the business world today such as increase salary, share the profits.  Recognitionmotivation helps the company to give empowerment for employee and encourage them to perform well. Recognition is such as responsibilities, a certificate of gratitude, honor him in front of staff, participation in the company’s projects
There should be a strategy for the distribution of rewards commensurate with the objectives of the company’s long-term goals. Benefits and additional compensatory aspects of a company’s strategy are to reward employees, and it is known that companies that do not provide benefits equal to what the competition offers fail to attract the expertise and special skills of specialists in the industry.List 3 qualities of a good leader and explain how those strengths can be beneficial in customer service.
Excellent leader should have the following:
1.  Give support is necessary for a leader to get succeed all the time. At any situation he should the leader be the helper, When leader support the customer sure he will get customer trust. .
2. Flexibility: Its one of the most important quality because flexibility that is like interacting with the people and teaching them.  Also,  a leader interacts and listens to his subordinates problems and the ideas etc., So, .Most of the customers who decide not to deal with a company does not  have any flexibility  because of their sense of  strict company with them, some staff may transfer to the customer is not bothered by them and often it stems from the dominant culture in the company, which does not give priority to customers
3. Show care and respect: As a leader one has to follow a fair relationship with each and every individual. Respect is very crucial in every aspect. It helps in getting the good support from the followers when ever required. Visiting customers and key adults who rely on them to the company’s sales, in order to care to them and find out what  they want from the company they are dealing with and trying to meet, if possible, or taken into account in the future
Why is a maintaining customer relationship so important for an organization?
To maintain existing customers need to provide a unique service and reasonable care. While companies need to five times these efforts to attract new customers. Some of our companies do not pay the necessary attention to the client deal with their customers a sense of superiority and lack of interest, do not listen to the problems of their clients, but they listened not attach the necessary attention.
The companies interested customers to identify these experiences, benefit from and take lessons. The reasons are many and varied levels, unlike the expected price were not a cause of dissatisfaction with the services provided. Poor services were not restricted to specific companies, but the promiscuous between domestic and international companies. Industrial, recreational, and food, cars, and Communications and others.
Companies that do not work a mistake, the error are human nature. But the good companies are benefiting from its mistakes and documenting its relations with its customers. Studies have shown that angry customers if the best deal with them and increase their loyalty and their willingness to deal with the company will continue
How is technology involved in building customer loyalty? Give 3 specific examples.
To keep existing customers loyalty need to provide a unique service and reasonable care. While companies need to five times these efforts to attract new customers. It is sure the technology contributes to get customer loyalty for example:
1 – Customer  need security when he use online website for baying or use their bank account , and this should be achieved by the website through the protection element. Whether it comes to the protection of privacy of customer and personal data of each penetration and piracy is illegal, or to protect and secure money transfers and goods through the availability of location on the certificates of guarantee and quality software systems.  That address any attempt is not allowed to enter the site as a firewall “Firewall” or the digital signature and other various programs for protection. Then comes the other means that meet the remaining needs and that further raise the level of satisfaction with the customer
2 – Use connection directly with the customer after the purchase by phone or e-
Mail to find out the level of satisfaction to him, and recorded all of the proposals on the development and dissatisfaction.
3- Use the SMS to send to the customer his goods price
The Foundation works to develop the loyalty of its customers from the first to be a potential customer to become a customer of the participants, and in each stage
The institution is trying to push the customer to repeat the procurement process by providing products with characteristics that agree desires
. Thus technology plays an important role to maintain customer loyalty

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why are some customers challenging to one individual and not to another?" I need to figure this out, and I have the ability to do web searches to help me. I think starting with a general search would be a good idea. Maybe look for articles or blogs that discuss different types of challenging customers and how various people handle them differently.

So, I'll发起一个搜索查询，看看能找出什么信息。

There are several reasons that some customers can be a challenge to some while others find the customer easily understood . Difficulty in making decisions , feelings of bias or visibly upset about something ( other than the situation at hand ) are all reasons I am aware I may be a difficult customer for some sales people , while others understand that as a woman I need to be treated equally or that I may have had a bad experience in the pastd .

Characteristics of Challenging Customers
List 3 characteristics of challenging customers. Next, explain how you would deal with each of the 3 by using ways to cope with challenging customers.
Challenging customer are the customers who are creating problems, questions, and they want special treatment to meet their demands. There are several properties of challenging customer such as gossip client, who usually wants to talk all the time without sense or meaning, and likes debate and enthusiasm, which is not logical in its responses. The egotist client who feels that he is distinct from the others and thinks so. This client thinks deliberately through his mind that you exist for only to serve him. Impatient client who is a hasty, impatient, needs to implement its business at that moment,and without the impact of a client, passionate.
To deal with gossip client I have to:
1 – This requires the client to deal with a private seller or employee.
2 – I should give attention to what he says, then trying to attract the main theme in a friendly manner.
3 – I do not try to silence the talkative client by force!
To deal with egotist client  I have to:
1 – This client is easy to handle with him;it is enough to satisfy his ego
2 –I must be patient and that you have the ability to courtesy.
To deal with impatient client I have to:
1 –I should try to provide the service to him as soon as possible.
2 –I try to equip the workplace or work environment and tools do not things can feel bored.
3 –I try to leave nothing to him if it is busy you are dealing with another customer.
4 –I try to give him attention from one moment to another and in the office with another customer.
Do you feel employees are motivated by money, recognition, or both
Motivate employees has two types money, and recognition. All of them have power and effective to achieve productivity and effectiveness of every company employee. Money rewards is popular in the business world today such as increase salary, share the profits.  Recognitionmotivation helps the company to give empowerment for employee and encourage them to perform well. Recognition is such as responsibilities, a certificate of gratitude, honor him in front of staff, participation in the company’s projects
There should be a strategy for the distribution of rewards commensurate with the objectives of the company’s long-term goals. Benefits and additional compensatory aspects of a company’s strategy are to reward employees, and it is known that companies that do not provide benefits equal to what the competition offers fail to attract the expertise and special skills of specialists in the industry.List 3 qualities of a good leader and explain how those strengths can be beneficial in customer service.
Excellent leader should have the following:
1.  Give support is necessary for a leader to get succeed all the time. At any situation he should the leader be the helper, When leader support the customer sure he will get customer trust. .
2. Flexibility: Its one of the most important quality because flexibility that is like interacting with the people and teaching them.  Also,  a leader interacts and listens to his subordinates problems and the ideas etc., So, .Most of the customers who decide not to deal with a company does not  have any flexibility  because of their sense of  strict company with them, some staff may transfer to the customer is not bothered by them and often it stems from the dominant culture in the company, which does not give priority to customers
3. Show care and respect: As a leader one has to follow a fair relationship with each and every individual. Respect is very crucial in every aspect. It helps in getting the good support from the followers when ever required. Visiting customers and key adults who rely on them to the company’s sales, in order to care to them and find out what  they want from the company they are dealing with and trying to meet, if possible, or taken into account in the future
Why is a maintaining customer relationship so important for an organization?
To maintain existing customers need to provide a unique service and reasonable care. While companies need to five times these efforts to attract new customers. Some of our companies do not pay the necessary attention to the client deal with their customers a sense of superiority and lack of interest, do not listen to the problems of their clients, but they listened not attach the necessary attention.
The companies interested customers to identify these experiences, benefit from and take lessons. The reasons are many and varied levels, unlike the expected price were not a cause of dissatisfaction with the services provided. Poor services were not restricted to specific companies, but the promiscuous between domestic and international companies. Industrial, recreational, and food, cars, and Communications and others.
Companies that do not work a mistake, the error are human nature. But the good companies are benefiting from its mistakes and documenting its relations with its customers. Studies have shown that angry customers if the best deal with them and increase their loyalty and their willingness to deal with the company will continue
How is technology involved in building customer loyalty? Give 3 specific examples.
To keep existing customers loyalty need to provide a unique service and reasonable care. While companies need to five times these efforts to attract new customers. It is sure the technology contributes to get customer loyalty for example:
1 – Customer  need security when he use online website for baying or use their bank account , and this should be achieved by the website through the protection element. Whether it comes to the protection of privacy of customer and personal data of each penetration and piracy is illegal, or to protect and secure money transfers and goods through the availability of location on the certificates of guarantee and quality software systems.  That address any attempt is not allowed to enter the site as a firewall “Firewall” or the digital signature and other various programs for protection. Then comes the other means that meet the remaining needs and that further raise the level of satisfaction with the customer
2 – Use connection directly with the customer after the purchase by phone or e-
Mail to find out the level of satisfaction to him, and recorded all of the proposals on the development and dissatisfaction.
3- Use the SMS to send to the customer his goods price
The Foundation works to develop the loyalty of its customers from the first to be a potential customer to become a customer of the participants, and in each stage
The institution is trying to push the customer to repeat the procurement process by providing products with characteristics that agree desires
. Thus technology plays an important role to maintain customer loyalty

4 Types Of Challenging Customers And How To Deal With Them
by Danielle McGaw
As a server, it is important to know how to communicate with different kinds of people. Some customers will be easy. Others will be more challenging. When you come across those challenging customers, it is crucial that you know how to deal with them.
Here are some of the challenging customers that you are likely to come across and tips for dealing with them appropriately.
Challenging Customer #1: The “Nothing Is Right” Customer
This customer may be looking for things to complain about because it makes them feel important. The soup is not hot enough. There’s a spot on this knife. Where is my ranch dressing (usually asked when you have a tray full of other stuff that they have asked for plus meals and your other hand has a pot of coffee in it)?
The most important thing that you need to remember when is that you must keep your cool! Don’t snip at them. Don’t roll your eyes. Remain calm. Losing your cool could result in a negative online review that can’t be erased!
The second thing you can do is apologize (even knowing that their complaint is out of your control) and get them what they want as quickly as you can. Apologies go a long way.
Challenging Customer #2: The “I’m The Most Important Person Here” Customer
In the hospitality industry, some days can get extremely busy and you suddenly find yourself with a full section all at once. Most people are understanding when this happens. But there will almost always be that one customer that thinks they are the only person in the restaurant and expects more than humanly possible from you.
It might be tempting to point out how busy the restaurant is. Instead, put a smile on your face and apologize. Let them know that you will take care of their needs (more coffee, dessert, etc) as soon as possible.
If there is a genuine reason (like being short-staffed) you can tell them. You can make them aware that you have other things that need your attention, too, but do it in a way that doesn’t sound like you are making excuses. Keep it simple. “I just need to get one more food order out and then I will be right back with the coffee pot.” Then make sure that you do come right back!
Finally, thank them for being so understanding, even if they aren’t.
Challenging Customer #3: The “I Need My Food ASAP” Customer
There will always be that one table that is in a rush. There is always a reason why their time is limited.
The best thing you can do is have a shortlist of menu items that can be made and delivered in a short amount of time. Memorize them. Be ready to suggest them to the customer.
First, find out how much time they have and then, check with the kitchen staff. The BOH is going to be really annoyed if you come in with an order that you’ve promised in a short time and they are getting slammed with a 15 top’s orders!
Once you confirm with the kitchen staff that they can make the order within the customer’s time constraints, suggest menu items to the customer. Keep an eye on the clock and make sure that you get them the bill before they have to leave. Be ready to clear the table when they are done eating and pack up food that they have not been able to finish.
Challenging Customer #4: The “Let Me Tell You My Life Story” Customer
As a server, being sociable is part of your job. When there is time, it can be enjoyable to hear people’s stories. Unfortunately, you aren’t paid to socialize and it isn’t often that you have time for it. How do you get out of it without being rude though?
First, smile and nod. Let them know that you enjoy the conversation. As soon as you have an opportunity though, let them know that you have another table waiting for you and that if you have time you will come back so they can finish telling you about their granddaughter’s first steps or the great shopping find that they got earlier in the day.
Above all, be polite, but be assertive. You are in control of the situation.
If you think that you can deal with challenging customers like these and the other types of challenging customers that people in the hospitality industry come across, check out the FOH jobs available now.

Five Reasons Why Customer Service is Hard
Five Reasons Why Customer Service is Hard
Jeff Toister
Your service culture guide.
Published Apr 14, 2014
+ Follow
Customer service is hard. Anyone who tells you otherwise is in denial, bad at it, or both. The notion that serving customers is easy is something I’ve referred to as the Biggest Myth in Customer Service.
There are many reasons why customer service isn’t easy. These obstacles range from poor corporate strategy to ineffective leadership to our own limitations as human beings.
Here are five common examples:
#1 It’s not instinctive
There are many situations where our natural instincts result in the wrong customer service move.
For example, if you encounter an angry or upset person, your “fight or flight” instinct will kick in. This is a natural urge to either fight the danger (verbally or physically) or flee the danger. Neither is acceptable in customer service, so employees wind up struggling against their own instincts when they try to make the upset customer happy again.
#2 Our customers see what we don't
People tend to get locked in to a certain perspective, but this perspective may not match our customer’s. This can cause us to be blind to a customer's need that might be obvious in hindsight.
The classic nine dot puzzle provides an example of how this naturally happens.
Connect all nine dots using just four straight lines.
You can't lift your finger off the screen
If you get stumped, click here to find the solution.
#3 It's sometimes hard to be friendly
Customer service employees are supposed to be friendly, but what happens when an employee doesn’t feel friendly?
It takes effort to outwardly project a feeling you don’t really feel. The worse you actually feel, the harder it gets to pretend you're in a good mood. This effort, called emotional labor, can leave people physically and mentally exhausted.
To add insult to injury, research shows that customer service employees don’t get paid very much for their emotional labor.
#4 We aren’t good at multitasking
Multitasking is a requirement for many customer service jobs. Unfortunately, we’re not very good at it. The end result is multitasking hurts service quality.
That’s because our brains can only process one conscious thought at a time. When we try to do more, we’re really just rapidly shifting resources between various thoughts. The inevitable result is we operate slower and are more prone to making mistakes.
#5 Directed Attention Fatigue
All of this chronic multitasking causes a condition called Directed Attention Fatigue. It comes from overusing the part of our brain that focuses attention.
Here are a few of the symptoms:
Distractibility
Irritability
Impatience
Indecisiveness
Difficulty starting and finishing tasks
Obviously, none of these symptoms are good for customer service. You can read more about it in a blog post I wrote called “ How detoxing our brains can improve customer service .”
What can you do about it?
Start by embracing the fact that customer service is difficult. If you want to serve your customers at the highest level, you have to work at it every day.
Next, slow down and focus on one customer at a time. The obstacles described above get exacerbated when we get anxious and try to do too many things at once.
Finally, learn from experience. When you encounter a challenging customer service situation, think about what you'll do differently next time to get a better result.

I don't mind serving a customer as long as there are no time constraints.  However, there are ALWAYS time constraints.  :)

I always adopted the attitude that anyone I dealt with was my customer and if that was another employee it took just a little of my time to explain what the objectives were and to suggest that if it nwas unsatisfactory maybe another employer was their answer, and if the corporation was responsible for the unhappy employee bring it to the attention of the appropriate department to put it right.

Burn out is also a poor excuse.   Establishing a rapport with anyone is simply convincing them you understand their concerns and acting positively to address these concerns. If the corporation is unable to accept that, and honor the commitment of the employee to bring satisfaction to the customer, then the corporation should get out of the business and allow corporations who can to excel at what they do.

Compensation is a crock. Customers merely want what they paid for. If corporations cannot deliver they deserve to be hit for compensation. But understanding how a customer feels is the first and most successful step in establishing a relationship with a disappointed customer and retrieving lost customer appreciation. If the corporation or its representatives have failed to meet customer expectation then the cost of recovery of that customer's patronage is a fair expense and not to be argued

Corporations are more focused on what they consider the correct procedures and adhering to them for corporate control purposes, that on conceding that customers do not know and do not care what the company expects. Customer expectations do not take account of what the corporation feels its obligations may be. The corporation or employee who best understands that the customer expectations are not connected to the corporate goals, are those who will successfully deliver the best levels of customer service

So very true. As a person who has 10 plus years of experience in customer service, I still find every day and every customer I meet a learning experience. There is no single magic wand to resolve customer dissatisfaction. But 70% of problems get solved the moment you go to customer's place and show your earnestness in resolving his problem.

That's why Customers are believed to be Kings.

If they are kings, we are the subjects against/towards whom the king should never be hard but should, instead, be always soft and responsive to situations

It is unfortunate that emotional labour is never recognised for remuneration. It appears to be part of the business game

This is so true.  I think workplaces should also rethink how customer service departments are set up - most commonly customer service departments seem to be set up in a "bull pen" sort of way.  Being in close quarters with other CSR's increases distraction greatly, and also promotes inter-office conflict (gossip, tattling, etc.) as many people become too distracted by what other people are doing rather than accomplishing their own tasks.

Okay, so I've got these search results. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's a course hero file from Columbus State Community College about marketing. It seems like a student's response to some questions, one of which is about why some customers are challenging to one individual and not to another. The student mentions that it could be due to communication styles, past experiences, expectations, cultural backgrounds, personality compatibility, problem-solving skills, training, and emotional intelligence. That's a good start. It suggests that there are multiple factors at play here.

Then, there's a LinkedIn article by Jeff Toister titled "Five Reasons Why Customer Service is Hard." He points out that customer service is not instinctive, that customers can have perspectives we don't see, that being friendly can be tough when you're not feeling it, that multitasking is problematic because humans aren't great at it, and that directed attention fatigue can set in, leading to irritability and indecisiveness. These are all valid points and seem to align with what the course hero response mentioned about personal factors affecting how we handle customers.

Next, there's a blog post from Edizeven about four types of challenging customers in the restaurant industry and how to deal with them. They mention the "nothing is right" customer, the "I'm the most important person here" customer, the "I need my food ASAP" customer, and the "let me tell you my life story" customer. Each type has specific strategies for handling them, such as staying calm, apologizing and addressing complaints quickly, suggesting quick menu options, and being polite but assertive in conversations. This is practical advice tailored to a specific industry, which is helpful.

There's also a BestEssaysAsap page that lists characteristics of challenging customers, categorizing them into types like gossip customers, egotistical customers, and impatient customers, and provides strategies for dealing with each. It seems similar to the Edizeven blog but perhaps more generalized across industries.

Lastly, there's a GroupProject2BusinessComm blog that lists characteristics of different types of difficult customers, including 'leave me alone' customers, domineering customers, thrifty customers, suspicious customers, slow customers, and dishonest customers. Each type has specific traits and suggested handling methods.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that customers can be challenging for various reasons, and different people handle these challenges differently based on their skills, temperament, and training. The key factors appear to be communication styles, emotional intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and the capacity to manage multiple tasks and stresses.

From the LinkedIn article, it's clear that customer service isn't innate; it requires training and practice to overcome natural tendencies that might not serve customers well. For example, the fight or flight response when faced with an angry customer isn't helpful, and employees need strategies to manage their own reactions.

The restaurant-focused blog emphasizes the importance of remaining calm, apologizing effectively, and being assertive when necessary. These are universal skills that can apply beyond the restaurant industry.

The BestEssaysAsap page provides specific examples of how to handle different types of challenging customers, which can be adapted to various scenarios.

The group project blog offers a broader classification of difficult customers and suggests how to approach each type.

In conclusion, handling challenging customers effectively requires a combination of interpersonal skills, emotional regulation, and problem-solving abilities. Different individuals may naturally possess varying degrees of these skills, which is why some find it easier to handle difficult customers than others. Training can help bridge these gaps and improve overall customer service.
