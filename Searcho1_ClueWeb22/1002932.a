So I have this question: "Is neglect a form of abuse?" Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. First off, what exactly is neglect? Neglect usually refers to a failure to provide something that is needed or expected, especially care or attention. So, in the context of abuse, it might mean not giving someone the care or attention they need, which could be harmful to them.

Now, what is abuse? Abuse generally means to use something in a wrong or harmful way. When we talk about abuse in relationships or towards people, it often involves physical, emotional, or sexual harm. But I think abuse can also include other forms of mistreatment.

So, is neglect a form of abuse? I think it could be, depending on the situation. For example, if a parent doesn't provide proper food, shelter, or medical care for their child, that's called neglect, and it's definitely considered a form of abuse. Similarly, in nursing homes, if caregivers don't attend to the needs of the residents properly, that can also be neglectful and abusive.

But maybe there are situations where neglect isn't necessarily abuse. Like, if someone forgets to do something once in a while, maybe it's not intentional harm. So perhaps the intent matters here. If the neglect is deliberate and meant to cause harm or distress, then it's more likely to be considered abuse.

I should probably look up some definitions to get a clearer picture. Maybe check what legal systems define as abuse and whether neglect is included in those definitions.

Let me try searching for this.

Child neglect
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Child neglect is a form of abuse,[1] an egregious behavior of caregivers (e.g., parents) that results in depriving a child of their basic needs, such as the failure to provide adequate supervision, health care, clothing, or housing, as well as other physical, emotional, social, educational, and safety needs. [2] All societies have established that there are necessary behaviors a caregiver must provide in order for a child to develop physically, socially, and emotionally. Causes of neglect may result from several parenting problems including mental disorders, unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse, unemployment, overemployment, domestic violence, and, in special cases, poverty .
Child neglect depends on how a child and society perceives the parents’ behavior; it is not how parents believe they are behaving toward their child. [3] Parental failure to provide for a child, when options are available, is different from failure to provide when options are not available. Poverty and lack of resources are often contributing factors and can prevent parents from meeting their children's needs, when they otherwise would. The circumstances and intentionality must be examined before defining behavior as neglectful.
Child neglect is the most frequent form of child abuse, with children born to young mothers at a substantial risk for neglect. Neglected children are at risk of developing lifelong social, emotional and health problems, particularly if neglected before the age of two years.

Definition[edit]
Neglect is difficult to define, since there are no clear, cross-cultural standards for desirable or minimally adequate child-rearing practices. [4] Research shows that neglect often coexists with other forms of abuse and adversity. [5] [6] While neglect generally refers to the absence of parental care and the chronic failure to meet children's basic needs, defining those needs has not been straightforward. In "Working Together", the Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom) [7] defined neglect in 2006 as:
...the persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child's health or development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance abuse. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment); protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger; ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers); or ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child's basic emotional needs.
Child neglect is commonly defined as a failure by a child's caregiver to meet a child's physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs. [8] Forms of child neglect include: Allowing the child to witness violence or severe abuse between parents or adult, ignoring, insulting, or threatening the child with violence, not providing the child with a safe environment and adult emotional support, and showing reckless disregard for the child's well-being. [9]
Other definitions of child neglect are:
"the failure of a person responsible for a child's care and upbringing to safeguard the child's emotional and physical health and general well-being" per Webster's New World Law Dictionary [10]
"Acts of omission: failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm. [...] harm to a child may or may not be the intended consequence. Failure to provide [results in] physical neglect, emotional neglect, medical/dental neglect, educational neglect. The failure to supervise [results in] inadequate supervision, exposure to violent environments." per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [11]
"the persistent failure to meet a child's basic physical and/or psychological needs resulting in serious impairment of health and/or development". [12] : 1–8 
Summary
The definition of child neglect is broad. There are no specific guidelines that determine when a child is being neglected; therefore, it is up to state government agencies and professional groups to determine what is considered neglect. [13] : 13  In general, child neglect is considered the failure of parents or caregivers to meet the needs that are necessary for the mental, physical, and emotional development of a child. [14] : 262 
Child neglect is one of the most common forms of child maltreatment, and it continues to be a serious problem for many children. Child neglect tremendously affects the physical development, mental development, and emotional development of a child causing long term consequences, such as poor academic achievement, depression (mood), and personality disorders. These consequences also impact society, since it is more likely that children who suffered from child neglect will have drug abuse problems and educational failure when they grow up. [15]
Types[edit]
There are various types of child neglect.
Types
Definition
Case study examples
Supervisory
Guardian or parent of child is unable or unwilling to display acceptable supervision or control over the child or young person. e.g. leaving the child alone for long periods of time.
Henry, a 7-year-old boy, walks home from school every day and looks after himself till his mother comes home at 7pm. Sometimes, he tries to cook food on the stove or goes for walks to the local shops.
Physical
Basic physical needs are not met due to the child not being provided with food, water, clothing, shelter, inadequate hygiene, etc.
Joyce, a 4-year-old girl, is given snacks (chips and chocolate) and McDonald's meals by her father. Her father does not like to cook, and when he does it is just frozen meals. Although she is fed, her nutritional needs are not met.
Medical
Refusal or delay in child receiving needed medical care.
Ben, a 9-year-old boy, has had a cough for a month. His parents are worried about his health. However, his father has recently lost his job, so his parents continue to not take him to a doctor because of the financial cost.
Educational
Guardian or parent fails to ensure that the child receives formal education, e.g. attending school, ensuring special needs requirements are met.
Chase, is a 8-year-old boy, who hates school. His mother has given up on making him attend as he throws a tantrum each time. He has missed over a month of school. His teachers suspect that he has a learning disability, but his mother has not had him tested.
Emotional
Guardian or parent give inadequate nurturing or affection. The parent or guardian fails to create an environment where the child feels secure, loved, wanted, worthy, etc.
Tiana, is a 3-year-old girl, both her parents work long hours. She currently in childcare from 7am to 6pm every week day. On the weekends her parents give an iPad to play but are too busy to play or talk to her.
Physical neglect refers to the failure to provide a child with basic necessities of life such as food and clothing.
Medical neglect is a failure of caregivers to meet a child's basic health care needs. Example: not brushing teeth on a daily basis, bathing a child and or taking children to doctor visits when needed.
Emotional neglect is failing to provide emotional support such as emotional security and encouragement.
Educational/developmental neglect is the failure to provide a child with experiences for necessary growth and development, such as not sending a child to school or giving them an education.
Depending on the laws and child protective policies in one's area, leaving a young child unsupervised may be considered neglect, especially if doing so places the child in danger. [16]
Child neglect can also be described by degrees of severity and the responses considered warranted by communities and government agencies. [17]
Mild neglect is the least likely to be perceived as neglect by the child, but raises the possibility of harm in ways that need intervention by the community. An example might be a parent who does not use a proper car safety seat.
Moderate neglect occurs when some harm to the child has occurred. An example might be a child repeatedly dressed inappropriately for the weather (e.g. shorts in winter.) In cases of moderate harm, governmental agencies might be called in to assist parents.
Severe neglect occurs over time and results in significant harm to the child. An example might be a child with asthma being denied treatment.
Experience[edit]
Children may be left at home alone, which can result in negative consequences. Being left at home alone can leave young people feeling scared, vulnerable and not knowing when their parents are going to return. [18] The frequency and duration of being left at home alone may range from every evening, to several days or even weeks at a time. [18]
Also, young children may not be provided with a suitable amount of decent food to eat, which is another form of neglect. Children have reported being provided with moldy food, or not having any food in the house, or they were given an insufficient amount of food. [18]
Causes[edit]
The causes of child neglect are complex and can be attributed to three different levels: an intrapersonal, an inter-personal/family, and a social/economic level. [12] Although the causes of neglect are varied, studies suggest that, amongst other things, parental mental health problems, substance use, [19] [20] domestic violence,[21] [22] unemployment, [23] and poverty [24] are factors which increase the likelihood of neglect. Children that result from unintended pregnancies are more likely to suffer from abuse and neglect. [25] [26] They are also more likely to live in poverty. [27] Neglectful families often experience a variety or a combination of adverse factors.
Intra-personal[edit]
At the intra-personal level, the discussion around neglectful parents' characteristics often focuses on mothers, reflecting traditional notions of women as primary caregivers for children. [12] [28] "Neglectful attributes" have included an inability to plan, lack of confidence about the future, difficulty with managing money, emotional immaturity, lack of knowledge of children's needs, a large number of children, being a teenage mother, high levels of stress and poor socioeconomic circumstances. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Mental health problems, particularly depression, have been linked with a parent's inability to meet a child's needs. [34] Likewise, substance misuse is believed to play a crucial role in undermining a parent's ability to cope with parental responsibilities. Recent empirical works have also pointed to parental burnout (i.e., chronic lack of parenting resources) as an especially potent mechanism in driving neglectful behavior toward children. [35] While the literature largely focuses on mothers, the role of fathers in neglect, as well as the impact of their absence, remains largely unexplored. There is still little known about whether mothers and fathers neglect differently and how this affects children. Similarly, not much is known about whether girls and boys experience neglect differently.
Inter-personal/family[edit]
At the inter-personal/family level, a significant number of neglectful families are headed by a lone mother or have a transient male. [36] Unstable and abusive relationships have also been mentioned as increasing the risk of child neglect. The impact of living with domestic violence on children frequently includes either direct violence or forced witnessing of abuse, which is potentially very damaging to children. [37] While the UK Department of Health connects children's exposure to domestic violence to parents' failure to protect them from emotional harm, [38] the notion of "failure to protect" has been challenged as it focuses primarily on the responsibility of the abused parent, usually the mother, who is often herself at significant risk. [39] A recent reform to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act (2004) has introduced a new offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, thus reinforcing the notion of "failure to protect". Research on domestic violence, however, has consistently shown that supporting the non-abusive parent is good child protection. There is some indication of the cyclical and inter-generational nature of neglect. A study on childhood abuse and the mother's later ability to be sensitive to a child's emotions showed that mothers with a self-reported history of physical abuse had higher indications of insensitivity and lack of attunement to infants’ emotional cues than mothers with no history of abuse. [40] Although the literature suggests that neglectful parents may have been affected adversely by their own past experiences, more research is needed to explore the link between past experiences of maltreatment and neglectful parenting behaviours. [41] Alcohol and drug abuse in caregivers are important risk-factors for recurrent child maltreatment after accounting for other known risk factors; the increased risk appears to be similar between alcohol and drug abuse. [42]
Social/economic[edit]
At the social/economic level, the association between poverty and neglect has frequently been made. A study of the maltreatment of children by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) supports the association between neglect and lower socio-economic class. [22] US studies have shown that less affluent families are more likely to be found to maltreat their children, particularly in the form of neglect and physical abuse, than affluent families. [43] [44] Some argue that many forms of physical neglect, such as inadequate clothing, exposure to environmental hazards and poor hygiene may be directly attributed to poverty [45] whereas others are more cautious in making a direct link. [23] Studies have shown that parents in a low socioeconomic level are less likely to purchase resources needed for their children, which makes them experience school failure at a more frequent level. [46] While poverty is believed to increase the likelihood of neglect, poverty does not predetermine neglect. [47] Many low-income families are not neglectful and provide loving homes for their children. However, when poverty coexists with other forms of adversity, it can negatively impact parent's ability to cope with stressors and undermine their capacity to adequately respond to their child's needs. It can also mean that parents who want to work are faced with the choice between being unemployed and leaving their children at home. [48] McSherry argues that the relationship between child neglect and poverty should be seen as circular and interdependent. [47] Where caregiver alcohol abuse is identified, children are significantly more likely to experience multiple incidents of neglect compared with children where this is not identified, as were children where other family risk factors (including markers of socioeconomic disadvantage) are found. [49]
Parenting styles[edit]
The patterns of repetitive behavior point out that a cycle of violence repeats. Research on correlation between child neglect and parenting styles has shown that those who suffered from parental neglect tend to have problems in relationships as adults. [50] Attachment style of children of abusive parents was less secure compared to children with authoritative caregivers. Children who suffered from physical and emotional abuse are more likely to have insecure attachment, such as preoccupied, dismissive, or fearful. There are three parenting styles that lead to child neglect: authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged styles. [51]
Taboo[edit]
There is some evidence to suggest that there is a cultural taboo around acknowledging child neglect in one's own family. In one research study parents who accessed a service focused on families where child neglect is a concern never mentioned the word 'neglect' during interviews designed to find out about their experience of the service. [52] In an analysis of NSPCC Childline data, John Cameron, the Head of Helplines reported that many of the neglected children who contacted the line did not use the word neglect and did not indicate that they were being neglected when they first spoke to a member of Childline.[18]
Effects[edit]
Effects of child neglect can differ depending on the individual and how much treatment is provided, but generally speaking child neglect that occurs in the first two years of a child's life may be more of an important precursor of childhood aggression compared to later neglect, which may not have as strong a correlation. Children who suffer from neglect most often also have attachment difficulties, cognitive deficits, emotional/behavioral problems, and physical consequences as a result of neglect. Early neglect has the potential to modify the body's stress response, specifically cortisol levels (stress hormones) which can cause abnormalities and alter the body's overall health. Research has shown that there is a relationship between neglect and disturbed patterns of infant-caretaker attachment. If parents lack sensitivity to their baby's needs, the baby may develop insecure-anxious attachment. The neglectful behavior the child experiences will contribute to their attachment difficulties and formation of relationships in the future, or lack thereof. In addition to biological and social effects, neglect affects intellectual ability and cognitive/academic deficits. Also, children who suffer from child neglect may also suffer from anxiety or impulse-control disorders. Another result of child neglect is what people call "failure to thrive ". Infants who have deficits in growth and abnormal behaviors such as withdrawal, apathy and excessive sleep are failing to thrive, rather than developing to become "healthy" individuals (Barnett et al., p 86).[full citation needed].
A study by Robert Wilson, a professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, and his colleagues, showed for the first time that children under the age of 18 when they were moderately neglected in some manner by their caregivers had a 3 times likely risk of stroke over those with moderately low levels, after controlling for some common risk factors (they interviewed 1,040 participants ages 55 or older; after 3 1 ⁄ 2 years, 257 of them died and 192 were autopsied, with 89 having stroke evidence upon autopsy and another 40 had a history of it). Neglect, bullying, and abuse have previously been linked to changes in the brain's grey matter and white matter and to accelerated aging. For further information, please see the link to the online news story article on the study, from the NBCNews.com Health VITALS blog, by unnamed LiveScience staff. [53]
Statistics[edit]
In terms of who is reported for neglectful behavior, it is most often women. The higher proportion of females reported for neglect may reflect the social attitude that mothers are responsible for meeting the needs of their children. In recent years, latent issues for child development and for the culture and political economy that are associated with paternal neglect have received more attention, however. [54] Neglecting parents interact less with their children, engage in less verbal instruction and play behavior, show less affection and are involved in more negative interactions with their children, for example verbal aggression. Often parents who neglect their children are single parents or disabled mothers who already have to care for themselves, and therefore the child is an additional stress. This additional stress is often neglected. Family size can contribute to child neglect. If a family has several children, they may not be able to give all the children all the basic necessities needed to survive and thrive. Unfortunately, if the family cannot provide for all their children, children can suffer neglect. Family history can play a role in parents’ neglectful behavior. If parents were neglected as children meaning they learned neglectful behavior from their own parents, they often internalize and believe those behaviors to be the "norm", which results in neglecting their own children (Barnett et al., p. 92). [55] In one study done in 2011, results showed that one in four mothers were neglectful, and neglect was four times as likely with a maternal history of physical abuse in childhood than with no history of maltreatment. [56] Neglect is by far the most common type of child abuse reported in the U.S., and in 2016, it accounted for nearly 65 percent of child abuse cases.
Disclosure[edit]
Research suggests that most neglected children, even when they are able to talk to a professional about their circumstances, do not use the word 'neglect' and may not even indicate that they are being neglected. [18] It is therefore recommended that professionals are proactive in exploring for and identifying neglect. [18]
When neglect is disclosed, action is not always taken. Equally when professionals pass concerns about neglect on to other professionals in the workplace they find those professionals do not always respond. [18] The NSPCC recently reported on the case of a teaching assistant, who contacted the organization with concerns about a particular child. The teaching assistant asked to remain anonymous, fearing that she would be sacked by her school if they were to find out that she'd made the disclosure. [18]
Assessing and identifying[edit]
Assessing and identifying neglect pose a number of challenges for practitioners.
Selecting the right method to identify neglect can be helped by having a clear conceptualization of neglect. Neglect is a process whereby a child experiences developmental delay owing to the fact of not having received sufficient levels of any combination of care, stimulation or nutrition, what collectively can be referred to as nurturance. Given that neglect is a dynamic between the child's development and levels of nurturance, the question in identifying neglect, becomes one of where does one start, with the child's development or with the levels of nurturance?
Development focused methods[edit]
Some professionals identify neglect by measuring the developmental levels of a child, for if those developmental levels are normal, one can, by definition, conclude that a child is not being neglected. Areas of development that could be measured include weight, height, stamina, social and emotional responses, speech and motor development. All these features go up to make a medical assessment of whether a child is thriving, so that a professional looking to start an assessment of neglect, might reasonably start with information collected by a doctor. Infants are often weighed and measured when seen by their physicians for well-baby check-ups. The physician initiates a more complete evaluation when the infant's development and functioning are found to be delayed. What this suggests is that social work staff could consult medical notes to establish if the baby or child is failing to thrive, as a first step in a pathway towards identifying neglect. If developmental levels are subnormal, then the identification of neglect requires the professional establish if those subnormal levels of development can be put down to the level of nurturance experienced by the child. One needs to discount that the developmental delay was caused by some genetic condition or disease.
Starting the assessment by examining the nurturance received by child[edit]
Another way of beginning the process of identifying neglect is to identify if the child in question is experiencing a level of nurturance lower than that considered necessary to support normal development. [57] In part, this requires a knowledge of the level of nurturance required by the child to sustain normal development, which might be particular to his or her age, gender and other factors. [57] However, quite how one ascertains what a particular child needs, without referring back to their level of development, is not something theory and policy on neglect is clear about. Furthermore, ascertaining whether a child is getting the requisite level of nurturance needs to take into account not just the intensity of the nurturance, but also, given that the intensity of certain forms of nurturance can carry across time, the duration and frequency of the nurturance. It is OK for a child to experience varying and low levels of certain types of nurturance across a day and from time to time, however, it is not OK if the levels of nurturance never cross thresholds of intensity, duration and frequency. For this reason, professionals are minded to keep detailed histories of care provision, which demonstrate the duration to which the child is exposed to periods of subnormal exposure to care, stimulation and nutrition. [58] [59] [60]
Starting the assessment by examining the nurturance provided by the carer or parent[edit]
Professionals should focus on the levels of nurturance provided by the carers of the child, where neglect is understood as an issue of the parents' behaviour. [61] Some authors feel that establishing the failure of parents and caregivers to provide care would be sufficient to conclude that neglect was occurring. [62] Action for Children [63] state that, "A child experiences neglect when the adults who look after them fail to meet their needs" clearly defining neglect as a matter of parental performance. This raises the question about what level of nurturance, a carer or parent needs to fall under, to provoke developmental delay, and how one goes about measuring that accurately.
The method, which focuses on the stimulation provided by the carer, can be subject to critique. Neglect is about the child's development being adversely affected by the levels of nurturance, but the carers' provision of nurturance is not always a good indicator of the level of nurturance received by the child. Neglect may be occurring at school, outside of parental care. The child may be receiving nurturance from siblings or through a boarding school education, which compensates for the lack of nurturance provided by the parents.
Linking development to stimulation[edit]
Neglect is a process whereby children experience developmental delay owing to experiencing insufficient levels of nurturance. It has been argued that in principle, this means that when starting an assessment of neglect by identifying developmental delay one needs to then check the levels of nurturance received by the child. Certainly, where guidance on identifying neglect does urge for practitioners to measure developmental levels, some guidance urges practitioners to focus on how developmental levels can be attributed to parental behaviour. [64] However the narrow focus on parental behaviour can be criticised for unnecessarily ruling out the possible impact of institutionalised neglect, e.g. neglect at school.
If one starts by concluding that the levels of nurturance received by the child are insufficient, one then needs to consider the developmental levels achieved by the child.
Further challenges arise however. Even when one has established developmental delay and exposure to low levels of nurturance, one needs to rule out the possibility that the link between the two is coincidental. The developmental delay may be caused by a genetic disorder, disease or physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Of course the developmental delay may be caused by a mixture of underexposure to nurturance, abuse, genetics and disease.
Practical tools for measuring[edit]
The Graded Care Profile Tool [65] is a practice tool which gives an objective measure of the quality of care in terms of a parent/carer's commitment. It was developed in the UK. [66]
The North Carolina Family Assessment Scale is a tool which can be used by a practitioner to explore whether neglect is taking place across a range of family functioning areas. [67] The NSPCC makes use of the NCFAS in their Evidence Based Decision-making Practice Model, which involves a Society practitioner working alongside the local authorities' assigned social worker to review the functioning of the family in complex neglect cases. [68]
Intervention programs[edit]
Early intervention programs and treatments in developed countries include individual counselling, family, group counselling and social support services, behavioural skills training programs to eliminate problematic behaviour and teach parents "appropriate" parenting behaviour.
Parenting programmes[edit]
Video Interaction Guidance[edit]
Video interaction guidance is a video feedback intervention through which a "guider" helps a client to enhance communication within relationships. The client is guided to analyse and reflect on video clips of their own interactions. [69] [70] Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. [71]
SafeCare[edit]
The SafeCare programme is a preventative programme working with parents of children under 6 years old who are at risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. The programme is delivered in the home by trained practitioners, over 18 to 20 sessions and focuses on 3 key areas: parent-infant/child interaction; home safety and child health. [72]
Triple P[edit]
Triple P (Parenting Program) is a positive parenting program. It is a multilevel, parenting and family support strategy. The idea behind it is that if parents are educated on "proper" parenting and given the appropriate resources, it could help decrease the number of child neglect cases. When deciding whether to leave a child home alone, caregivers need to consider the child's physical, mental, and emotional well-being, as well as state laws and policies regarding this issue. [16]
Effectiveness of intervention programs[edit]
Evidence for the effectiveness of intervention programs can be divided into two types. One type is impact studies where the aim of the evaluation is to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in outcomes on a population, which can be attributed to the intervention. A second type is qualitative studies which aim to illuminate the mechanisms through which program participants can access the resources and help offered in the program to achieve better outcomes.
Impact studies[edit]
Several interventions aimed at families where child neglect is occurring, have been subject to an impact study.
Video interaction guidance[edit]
Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. [71] An evaluation of the project demonstrated that VIG produced a significant change in the emotional and behavioural difficulties of the population of children who received the service, and improvement in reported level of parenting and reported parental relationship with their children in the population of parents whose children received the service. [71] The data excludes to parents who failed to complete the programme, parents who completed the programme but decided not to complete evaluation measures, and on some measures parents who completed measures but whose feedback was adjudged to have been positively biased. [71]
SafeCare[edit]
The SafeCare programme has been provided to families in the United Kingdom where a professional has judged there is a risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. Outcome data shows that on average families who participated in the evaluation of the programme improved parenting skills and reduced neglectful behaviours. Furthermore, all referrers reported see positive changes in the families they referred, particularly in home safety, parent child interaction and health. However, in the absence of a comparison group it was not possible to attribute the changes to SafeCare. [72]
Triple P[edit]
Triple P has also been provided to families in the United Kingdom where neglect is a concern. The findings from this service showed that, on average the children who participated in the evaluation experienced improved emotional and behavioural outcomes. However this positive change could not be attributed to Triple P because a control group had not been established. [52]
Mechanisms to stop neglect[edit]
Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of the ways in which programs can help individual parents.
Social learning theory[edit]
Evaluations have demonstrated that in certain cases parents have learned to improve their parenting in the way described by social learning theory.[73] Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing behaviours and the positive outcomes associated with them. [72] An evaluation of the Triple P intervention highlighted how many parents were able to improve the way in which they related to their children after having received advice about how to be clear with their children, and in some cases after having tried and seen the effects of such approaches for themselves, first-hand, and often for the first time. [52] Prompted by Video Interaction Guidance, parents–with several children, who traditionally spent time with each of them all-together in a group–started spending one-to-one time with their individual children, oftentimes for the very first time. [71] Some parents also started to do activities with their children, which involved a small element of risk, after having agreed to do them for the first time as part of Video Interaction Guidance. [71]
Relationship between practitioner and parent[edit]
A common finding across evaluations of programmes designed to help families where neglect is a concern is that the principal factor which influences parents' engagement and perception is the quality of the relationship that they are able to build up with the practitioner delivering the programme. [52] [71] [74] Key factors in helping practitioners engage parents into the intervention include:
Establishing a sense that the practitioner will support the family beyond what is necessary to complete the intervention. [71]
Giving family members time to talk about their problems both during and out of appointments. [71]
Advocating for the family on issues with which the intervention is not directly concerned. [71]
Ensuring that fun forms a part of the interaction. [71]
Making family members feel cared for through the provision of clothes, food and gifts. [71]
Giving parents a lead in analysing family functioning and parenting. [68] [71]
Carrying out the intervention in the home of the parent. [71] [74]
Practitioners working on weekday evenings. [71]
In the case of Video Interaction Guidance, when parents were asked about their experience of the intervention, parents invariably referred to the care and support provided by the practitioner. Effectively the intervention is experienced as an aspect of the overall relationship of care. [71]
Children's responses[edit]
There are a variety of ways in which children can act in response to an experience of neglect.
Some children attempt to talk about the neglect to their parents. [18] In some cases the parents may respond aggressively or abusively to such attempts to resolve the issue. [18]
Some children steal money from their parents' purses in order to feed themselves. [18]
Babies are too young to ameliorate parental neglect, however in some cases siblings will step in and take care of them. [18] Some older siblings go without food so that their younger siblings can eat. [18]

Neglect
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For the concept of neglect in the legal context, see negligence.
Neglect
Specialty
Pediatrics
In the context of caregiving, neglect is a form of abuse where the perpetrator, who is responsible for caring for someone who is unable to care for themselves, fails to do so. It can be a result of carelessness, indifference, or unwillingness and abuse. [1]
Neglect may include the failure to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, or medical care, or the failure to fulfill other needs for which the victim cannot provide themselves. The term is also applied when necessary care is withheld by those responsible for providing it from animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. Neglect can carry on in a child's life falling into many long-term side effects, including physical injuries, developmental trauma disorder, low self-esteem, attention disorders, violent behavior, and death.

Legal definition[edit]
In English law, neglect is a term of art, identical to the (now deprecated) expression lack of care and different from the concept of negligence. Its sole function is to qualify a verdict returned at an inquest by finding that it was a factor that contributed to a death. [3] [4]
Consequences of neglect[edit]
There are many different types of neglect but they all have consequences, whether it be physically or mentally. [1]
Child neglect[edit]
Main article: child neglect
Neglect can affect the body physically by affecting a child's development and health, sometimes leading to chronic medical problems. Children experiencing neglect often suffer from malnutrition, which causes abnormal patterns for development. [5] Not being given the proper nutrients at certain growth periods can result in stunted growth, and inadequate bone and muscle growth. Brain functioning and information processing may also be affected by neglect. [6] This may lead to difficulty in understanding directions, poor understanding of social relationships, or the inability to complete academic tasks without assistance. [7] Neglected children or adults can have physical injuries like fractures or severe burns that go untreated, or infections, lice and other signs of lack of care. There are many physical effects neglect can have on a person. [8]
Not only is neglect associated with physical problems; it also has an effect on a person mentally, ranging from poor peer relationships to violent behavior. Not only is behavior affected, but the way a person looks at themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and the feeling of being unwanted. Neglect is more severe in younger children when it comes to psychological consequences. Parental detachment can harm the child's development of bonding and attachment to the parents, [9] causing the child's expectations to be the same when they get older (furthering the cycle of abuse ). Too little parental availability can result in difficulties in problem solving, coping with stressful situations and social relationships. Studies of neglected children show heightened levels of depression and hopelessness, and higher incidents of suicide attempts.[10]
The effects of neglect on child development are collectively called deprivation, the absence of environmental inputs needed for development. In this context, deprivation is often contrasted with threat, experiences involving harm or threat of harm. [11]

Neglect of a child is considered a form of abuse. Generally, such neglect is described as the failure of a parent or caregiver to provide food, shelter, clothing, medical care, or the failure to supervise a child to a degree that the child’s health, safety, and well-being could result in physical or emotional harm and injury. Criminal neglect can result in the responsible adult being placed in jail or prison and the child being removed from the home.
Neglect and Abuse
There are several forms of abuse that a child may suffer from when living with abusive parents or adults. One particularly misunderstood way is through neglect. It is possible to both neglect and abuse a child at the same time through providing little or no care. The young person has little or no supervision in these circumstances. However, the parents may also not provide food, water, proper shelter or medical care when needed. This leads to physical signs and injury after some time. When neglecting the needs of the youth, the parents could also inflict emotional or psychological trauma that requires years or decades to get over.
Neglect Injuries
Most of the injuries that will show to social workers and other authorities is that of the physical harm sustained. If the child does not receive proper nutrition, this appears through a starved look. Without proper shelter, the youth may have a weathered look or could sustain injury trying to get into a building and away from the elements. Emotional or psychological harm may appear in a distrust, a lack of touch or behavioral problems. Other neglect may appear in a lack of education or understanding basic concepts. IF the parents are not ensuring the child goes to school, this is also neglect.
Neglect Statistics
The most common form of child mistreatment in the American country is neglect. In all cases of child mistreatment, over 78 percent are due to the neglect of a youth. This is comparable to the eighteen percent of those that suffer from physical abuse and the nine percent that sustain an injury through sexual abuse. Since 2012, over 2000 different children in the United States died from the abuse and neglect that they suffer at home. Of these almost 70 percent died because of neglect. Even if the child survives, it is common for him or her to remain emotionally or psychologically stunted or in pain.
Neglect in Different Forms
There are four common forms of neglect that a child may suffer from at home. These include physical, educational, medical and emotional or psychological. The most known is the physical form where the person that is to provide standard care neglects the basic needs of food, shelter, clothes and living conditions that are sanitary. Many that suffer from this form of neglect are children in foster care, in a home or when a parent abandons the youth. Proper supervision is usually not available, and all needs could suffer without additional assistance. This can lead to criminal charges if the parent is still around.
The Criminal Aspect of Neglect
It is still with visible injury or trauma that the local law enforcement will usually charge the adult or parent taking care of a child with criminal neglect. This is apparent through threadbare clothes, with a dirty appearance, bruises, broken bones or even unkempt appearance and when the child behaves as if he or she is suffering from abuse. If the parents take the child to work instead of school, this could lead to violations of the state educational decrees. This is often against the law because children under a certain age must attend school.
Psychological and emotional neglect are still criminal when the child suffers from trauma and either provides a statement to a teacher or law enforcement. There are several behaviors that can lead law enforcement to charge a parent or caregiver with neglect and these can include when the youth suffers from humiliation, insults, emotional harm or a lack of overall affection. Ignoring the basic emotional and mental needs of the youth can lead to suffering in the current state and harm to the young person when he or she is no longer in developmental years.
Criminal Defense for Criminal Child Neglect
There are times when a teacher may contact law enforcement or when the child will lie to others where the adult or parent will face criminal child neglect charges. It is important to hire a criminal defense lawyer to refute the charges and provide evidence of giving care to the youth.

Child Neglect
Benj Vardigan
A child left alone in a dirty apartment 
                        while his parent sits in a bar drinking -- this is 
                        the sort of picture "neglect" often brings to mind.
                        But child neglect can take many forms, some 
                        blatant, some so subtle as to be nearly undetectable. 
                        The American Medical Association (AMA) defines it as "an 
                        act or failure to act that results in serious harm or 
                        imminent risk of harm." The AMA categorizes neglect as 
                        one of the four major types of child abuse (along with physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional abuse). 
                        Of the four types, it is also the most common. Parents 
                        may neglect children without wishing to, as do poor 
                        parents who don't have the money for nourishing food. 
                        And neglect spans class lines, as in the case of wealthy 
                        latchkey kids with parents too busy 
                        to provide steady love and affection.
What is neglect?
Failure to meet a child's basic needs may take any of 
                        the following forms:
Physical or medical neglect. This is the most 
                              common type. It includes failing to seek 
                              appropriate and timely medical care for your 
                              child, failing to provide adequate nutrition, 
                              abandoning your child, and leaving him 
                              unsupervised at too young an age.
Educational neglect. Allowing your child to skip 
                              school frequently is 
                              another sort of neglect. Also, if you don't enroll 
                              your child in school when he's reached the 
                              mandatory age, or you don't seek special 
                              educational help if your child needs it, this may 
                              be considered neglectful.
Psychological or emotional neglect. Harder to 
                              recognize, this type occurs when, for example, 
                              parents withhold affection from their children or 
                              ignore them. Occasionally, parents withhold 
                              affection as a form of discipline, but when indifference and inattention 
                              become the norm, over an extended period of time, 
                              then it is considered neglect.
According to the federal government, you are also guilty 
                        of neglect any time you hit or verbally abuse your spouse in 
                        front of your child. Allowing your children to use drugs 
                        and alcohol is another form of psychological neglect.
How common is neglect?
Surprisingly Statistics from the U.S. 
                        government's National Child Abuse and Neglect Data 
                        System (NCANDS) show that 78 percent of the 
                        more than 700,000 child abuse victims reported suffered 
                        neglect by their 
                        parents or caretakers. The same study found that 36 percent of the 
                        1,770 child abuse-related deaths were a result of 
                        neglect.
What are some signs of child neglect?
Some varieties of neglect, such as withholding 
                        affection, are tricky to detect, but other kinds -- 
                        particularly physical neglect -- are easily noticed. The 
                        following is a list of potential signs of neglect:
Physical signs
Untreated medical problems. For example, the 
                              child has a cut that has become badly infected 
                              because it was never bandaged.
Clothing. Signs of neglect include sending a 
                              child outside in a T-shirt in the middle of 
                              winter, or without rain gear when it's pouring 
                              outside.
Poor hygiene. A dirty face, grubby fingernails, 
                              strong body odor, matted hair, and chronic 
                              infestations of lice are all possible tip-offs.
Distended stomach. A characteristic of 
                              malnutrition and constant hunger, this is a sign 
                              of extreme neglect.
Behavioral Signs
Fatigue. Falling asleep in class and other 
                              symptoms of a tired and listless child can be 
                              signs of malnutrition or extreme stress.
Stealing or hoarding food. A child who steals 
                              food from classmates' lunches or eats in needy 
                              gulps may not be getting enough nutrition at home.
Complaining of abandonment. If a child makes 
                              constant mention of being left alone at the park 
                              or at home, there is cause for concern.
Excessive absence and tardiness at school. A 
                              parent may be unaware that her child is skipping 
                              school, but truancy can also signal neglect.
Does child neglect do any long-term harm?
Yes, according to most research. A University of Albany 
                        study found that 30.6 percent of neglected children met 
                        diagnostic standards for lifetime post-traumatic stress 
                        disorder. In addition, according to a study by Dr. 
                        Jeffrey G. Johnson of Columbia University and the New 
                        York State Psychiatric Hospital, victims of childhood 
                        neglect (and/or physical and sexual abuse) are "four 
                        times as likely as those who had not been abused or 
                        neglected to have personality disorders during early 
                        adulthood." These personality disorders include symptoms 
                        of depression, paranoia, passive-aggression, dependency, 
                        and antisocial disorders.
Many neglected children never learn important basics of 
                        healthy, trusting, and loving relationships, increasing 
                        the likelihood that they'll struggle with relationships 
                        of all kinds later in life.
However, people who have suffered neglect in childhood 
                        can recover. Individual or group psychotherapy can help 
                        them learn how their personality has adapted and 
                        compensated for the neglect they experienced in 
                        childhood. With help, it's possible for adults and 
                        children to develop healthy relationships and successful 
                        lives despite past traumas.
What causes parents to neglect their children?
There are many answers to this question. Statistics show 
                        child neglect is often associated with the following 
                        "risk" factors (listed in order of severity):
Poverty. Families with incomes under $15,000 a 
                              year are nine times as likely to experience cases 
                              of neglect.
Poor social skills and unloving relationships. 
                              Social work researcher Norman Polansky's (author 
                              of Damaged Parents) study found that neglectful 
                              parents were socially deficient and had trouble 
                              investing themselves emotionally in relationships.
Substance abuse. Sadly, an alcohol or drug 
                              addiction can become the focus of one's life, at 
                              the expense of caring for and giving attention to 
                              a child.
Depression. Psychiatric researchers have found 
                              that depressed mothers are more likely to be 
                              rejecting and indifferent toward their children, 
                              as well as being more likely to neglect their 
                              diets and leave them unsupervised.
A large family. The U.S. Department of Health and 
                              Human Services' Study of National Incidence and 
                              Prevalence of Child Abuse and Neglect found that 
                              families with four or more children were almost 
                              twice as likely to be neglectful than families 
                              with three or fewer children.
Lack of support for single-parent households. 
                              Often, a single parent must work long hours in 
                              order to provide for her children, which can be a 
                              catch-22: While she is at a job trying to make 
                              money to keep her children healthy and fed, for 
                              example, she may be neglecting them by leaving 
                              them unsupervised.
Misconceptions about child development and lack 
                              of empathy. A parent who doesn't respond correctly 
                              to her child's needs often has unrealistic 
                              expectations for the child's stage of development, 
                              possibly due to the way the parent was raised. For 
                              example, if you were left at home alone a lot at 
                              an early age and never seemed to come to any harm, 
                              you may be inclined to raise your child the same 
                              way.
How can I avoid neglecting my child?
Here are a few things that will help any parent to 
                        provide responsibly for a child's needs:
Strength in numbers. A strong support network, 
                              drawing on relatives, friends, and neighbors, can 
                              give your family the boost it needs. If you have 
                              to work late, or just need a night off, have a 
                              friend take the kids out for ice cream or to a 
                              movie. And don't hesitate to call on friends for 
                              advice. If you're not sure whether your child is 
                              ready to be left at home alone, your doctor can 
                              give you an opinion based on the child's age and 
                              maturity level.
Shared responsibility. Sometimes the job of 
                              caring for children falls disproportionately on 
                              one parent -- usually the mother. If you feel that 
                              your partner isn't shouldering enough of the load, 
                              make it clear that you need to work as a team. 
                              Even if one partner does more of the breadwinning, 
                              both should take a role in childcare in order to 
                              run a healthy family.
Safeguarding against danger. Take a tour of your 
                              home to locate potential safety hazards. Fix the 
                              problem, if possible: Put rubber guards on sharp 
                              table corners, for example, and child safety 
                              latches on medicine cabinets. Make sure toxic 
                              cleaning products are locked up and out of reach. 
                              If you have a swimming pool, make sure it's fenced 
                              in. Have your children take swimming lessons; a 
                              large number of child deaths due to neglect are a 
                              result of drowning in pools.
Community support. You can help meet the 
                              challenge of creating a nurturing home environment 
                              by tapping into programs run through local 
                              churches, community centers, YMCAs, and schools.
Childcare. If you have the money, consider a 
                              nanny or think about other daycare options.
What can I do to prevent someone else from neglecting a 
                        child?
If you think another parent is neglecting a child, you 
                        can call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 
                        (800) 422-4453 (800-4-A-CHILD), for advice. If the 
                        parent is a friend or relative, have a talk and offer 
                        help and emotional support. If the direct approach 
                        doesn't work -- and if you're certain of the problem -- 
                        contact your local Child Protective Services (CPS) 
                        agency to report it. CPS professionals will evaluate the 
                        report and, if they deem it necessary, send someone out 
                        to talk with the alleged neglecter. CPS will keep your 
                        identity confidential, but you can make an anonymous 
                        report if you prefer.
In any case, it is also important to weigh cultural 
                        considerations before you intervene. Notions of 
                        parenting and ideas of "the family unit" may differ 
                        across cultures. For example, some cultures may be used 
                        to a much larger family unit, and they may be accustomed 
                        to sharing childcare among many family members -- 
                        grandparents, older siblings, aunts, and uncles. What 
                        looks to you like neglect may just be a different 
                        approach to family, and you should be sensitive to that 
                        possibility when considering taking action.
What actions are taken in cases of confirmed neglect?
Intervention groups and services always aim to preserve 
                        the family core, so removing the neglected child from 
                        the home is an option authorities avoid whenever 
                        possible. The Federal Adoption Assistance and Child 
                        Welfare Act of 1980 inspired a national movement among 
                        state CPS agencies to make "reasonable efforts" to solve 
                        cases of neglect without taking a child from the 
                        household. However, a large percentage of children in 
                        foster care are there because of neglect. The following 
                        are factors that CPS takes into account when deciding 
                        whether to place a child in foster care:
Severity of harm or imminent danger. If the child 
                              is seriously ill, suffering from extreme 
                              malnutrition, or living in extremely dangerous 
                              circumstances, CPS may place him in foster care 
                              immediately.
Age and special needs. Most child neglect 
                              fatalities happen among children under 3. Also, 
                              children with disabilities are more likely to be 
                              taken into foster care.
Parent-child bond. CPS tries to determine the 
                              strength of the existing bond between parent and 
                              child. If a bond seems extremely weak, the child 
                              is more likely to be removed.
History of neglect. CPS is more likely to remove 
                              a child if the neglect is chronic rather than an 
                              isolated incident due to recent extreme 
                              circumstances.
Caretaker's motivation to improve care. Sometimes 
                              a parent acknowledges the situation and genuinely 
                              wants to reverse it, but isn't able to take the 
                              proper steps. Intervention groups can be helpful 
                              in connecting the parent with community services 
                              or point her in the direction of affordable 
                              childcare. However, if the parent doesn't have the 
                              mental or physical ability to provide adequate 
                              care, or has a serious drinking or drug problem, 
                              CPS may remove the child regardless of an apparent 
                              desire to change. A parent can challenge this 
                              decision and may be able to regain custody of her 
                              children, particularly if she can show she has the 
                              means to provide a good home for them.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Is neglect a form of abuse?" Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. First off, what exactly is neglect? Neglect usually means not giving someone the care or attention they need. So, in the context of abuse, it might mean not providing the necessary care for someone, like a child or an elderly person.

Now, what is abuse? Abuse generally involves harming someone intentionally, whether it's physically, emotionally, sexually, or in other ways. So, is neglect a form of abuse? It seems like it could be, because if someone is not providing the necessary care, it can lead to harm, even if the neglect wasn't intended to cause harm.

Let me look at some definitions to get a clearer picture. Maybe I should search for "is neglect a form of abuse" to see what experts say.
