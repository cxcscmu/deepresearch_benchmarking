Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects natural disasters. Hmm, I know that climate change is related to global warming and it's caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mostly from human activities like burning fossil fuels. But how does that connect to natural disasters?

First, maybe I should understand what natural disasters are. Natural disasters are severe events caused by natural processes, like hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, and earthquakes. Wait, but earthquakes might be different because they're tectonic in nature. Maybe not directly affected by climate change. So, perhaps I should focus on weather-related natural disasters.

Okay, so climate change is about long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activity. I've heard that warmer temperatures can lead to more extreme weather events. But how exactly?

Maybe I should look into specific types of natural disasters and see how climate change might influence them. Let's start with hurricanes. I recall that hurricanes feed off warm ocean water. So, if the oceans are getting warmer because of climate change, that could potentially make hurricanes more powerful or more frequent.

But I'm not sure about the details there. Maybe I should look that up. <|begin_search_query|>climate change and hurricanes<|end_search_query|>

Hurricanes and Climate Change
Although scientists are uncertain whether climate change will lead to an increase in the number of hurricanes, there is more confidence that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify their intensity and impacts. Stronger hurricanes will be far more costly in terms of damages and deaths without action to make coastal (and inland) areas more resilient.
Hurricanes are subject to a number of climate change-related influences:
Warmer sea surface temperatures could intensify tropical storm wind speeds, potentially delivering more damage if they make landfall. Based on complex modeling, NOAA has suggested that an increase in Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is likely, with hurricane wind speeds increasing by up to 10 percent.  Warmer sea temperatures also are causing hurricanes to wetter, with 10-15 percent more precipitation from cyclones projected in a 2 degree C scenario. Recent storms such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (dropping over 60 inches in some locations), Florence in 2018 (with over 35 inches) and Imelda in 2019 (44 inches) demonstrate the devastating floods that can be triggered by these high-rain hurricanes.
Sea level rise is likely to make future coastal storms, including hurricanes, more damaging. Globally averaged, sea level is expected to rise by 1-4 feet in low and moderate emissions scenarios during this century, which will amplify coastal storm surge. For example, sea level rise intensified the impact of Hurricane Sandy which caused an estimated $65 billion in damages in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in 2012. Much of this damage was related to coastal flooding.
Areas affected by hurricanes are shifting poleward. This is likely associated with expanding tropics due to higher global average temperatures. The changing patterns of tropical storms (a shift northward in the Atlantic) could put much more property and human lives at risk, but much more research is required to build a better understanding of how these patterns might change.
The connection between climate change and hurricane frequency is less straightforward. It is likely the number of storms will remain the same or even decrease, with the primary increase being of the most extreme storms. For the 21 st century, some models project no change or a small reduction in the frequency of hurricanes, while others show an increase in frequency. More recent work shows a trade-off between intensity and frequency – that as warmer oceans bolster hurricane intensity, fewer storms actually form.

Background on Hurricanes and Tropical Storms
A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, which is a general term for a low-pressure system with activity like thunder and lightning that develops in the tropics or subtropics. In the Northern Hemisphere, these storms rotate counter-clockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate clockwise. Stronger systems are called “ hurricanes ” or “ typhoons ,” depending on where they form. Weaker tropical cyclones might be called “ tropical depressions ” or “ tropical storms .”
The National Hurricane Center categorizes Atlantic hurricanes based on wind speed. A storm with winds exceeding 74 mph is a Category 1 hurricane. Storms with winds stronger than 111 mph are considered “major hurricanes” (Category 3 or higher). Wind speed is just one of many factors that contribute to a hurricane’s impact. Others include its track (the site where the storm makes landfall), size, storm structure, rainfall amount, duration, and the vulnerability of the area it affects.
Frequency and intensity vary from basin to basin. In the North Atlantic Basin, the long-term (1966-2009) average number of tropical storms is about 11 annually, with about six becoming hurricanes. More recently (2000-2014), the average is over 15 tropical storms per year, including about seven hurricanes. This increase in frequency is correlated with the rise in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which could be partially related to global warming.
Threats Posed by Hurricanes
Climate change is adding to the coast and threat of hurricanes. While there have been extreme storms in the past, recent history reflects the growing expense of hurricanes. Four of the 10 costliest hurricanes on record in the United States occurred in 2017 and 2018. Hurricane Katrina (2005) remains the most expensive hurricane on record costing $168 billion (2020 dollars).
Find a map of billion-dollar extreme weather events here.
The 2017 hurricane season was historic, with Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma costing nearly $300 billion together (2020 dollars). It is important to note that while stronger hurricanes are more damaging, there are nearly 50 million homes and at least $1.4 trillion in assets within an eighth of a mile of the coast and a growing amount of property at risk in coastal areas. An important driver of the increased cost of hurricanes is increasing development in coastal areas. U.S. coastal populations grew by nearly 35 million people between 1970 and 2010. As more development occurs in harm’s way — regardless of climate change — the more likely the damage will grow.
In addition to damages to buildings, hurricanes threaten infrastructure, undermining energy systems, water and sewer systems, transportation, and flood management structures.
Stronger hurricanes pose a significant risk to public health and human lives. Hurricane Katrina caused over 1800 deaths, and Hurricane Maria in 2018 caused 2981 deaths mostly in Puerto Rico. Disruptions to water supplies and power systems can create risk for waterborne illness, environmental contaminants, mosquito borne illnesses and cause hospitals to close or affect care for patients.
How to Build Resilience
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one way to reduce the risk of the strongest storms in the future. Communities can also bolster their resilience to the impacts of hurricanes by:
Preserving coastal wetlands, dunes, and reefs to absorb storm surge and ensure building and development does not occur in harm’s way.
Replenishing beaches and improve infrastructure that affords coastal protection, such as seawalls.
Elevating vulnerable buildings to reduce flood damage.
Encouraging residents in areas that have had historically low hurricane risk to purchase flood insurance.
Designing structures to be resilient to high winds and flying debris.
Prepare directly prior to a storm’s arrival by boarding windows, clearing property of potential flying debris, and having an evacuation plan.

Increasingly destructive hurricanes are putting a growing number of people and structures at risk.

For coastal communities, the social, economic, and physical scars left behind by major hurricanes are devastating.
While hurricanes are a natural part of our climate system, recent research suggests that there has been an increase in intense hurricane activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970s. In the future, there may not necessarily be more hurricanes, but there will likely be more intense hurricanes that carry higher wind speeds and more precipitation as a result of global warming. The impacts of this trend are likely to be exacerbated by sea level rise and a growing population along coastlines.
Scientists are continuing to refine our understanding of how global warming affects hurricane activity. Cutting edge research is beginning to be able to attribute individual hurricanes to global warming. For example, new research estimates that as the Earth has warmed, the probability of a storm with precipitation levels like Hurricane Harvey was higher in Texas in 2017 than it was at the end of the twentieth century. Because of climate change, such a storm evolved from a once in every 100 years event to a once in every 16 years event over this time period.
Observed trends in hurricanes
The number and strength of storms is highly variable from year to year, which makes it challenging to detect trends in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes over time.
The advent of satellite technology in the 1970s made it possible to more consistently track hurricanes. Storm counts and strength measurements from before to the 1970s are less consistent, further complicating the study of long-term trends.
To help address these challenges, scientists run hurricane models calibrated with observations over the historical period to project future trends and understand the major factors driving these trends.
Recent research in this area suggests that there has been an increase in intense hurricane activity over the past 40 years.
The National Weather Service added new colors to its rainfall maps to effectively map Hurricane Harvey, which dropped unprecedented amounts of rainfall over Texas
The category system classifies the strength of Hurricanes on a scale from 1 to 5 according to wind speed. One 2005 peer-reviewed study showed a large increase in the number of North American hurricanes that reach Categories 4 and 5 when comparing the most recent 15-year period to the prior 15-year period. Indices for hurricane activity based on storm surge data from tide gauges further indicate an increase in intensity.
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey produced unprecedented levels of precipitation. The National Weather Service added two more shades of purple to its rainfall maps to effectively map Hurricane Harvey's rainfall amounts.
There is some evidence that in the western North Pacific Ocean, hurricanes—known as typhoons in this region—are also intensifying. Whether hurricanes are intensifying in other regions is less clear, though other recent evidence suggests that the trend toward more intense hurricanes may extend globally.
There has been little change, however, in the frequency of hurricanes globally. Roughly 90 hurricanes occur each year around the world, with by far the greatest number occurring in the largest ocean basin on Earth –the Pacific.
Factors that increase the destructive potential of hurricanes
The oceans have taken in nearly all of the excess energy created by global warming, absorbing 93 percent of the increase in the planet’s energy inventory from 1971-2010.
Human-made global warming creates conditions that increase the chances of extreme weather. In some ocean basins, the intensification of hurricanes over time has been linked to rising ocean temperatures. Since 1970, sea surface temperatures worldwide have warmed by about an average of 0.1°C per decade. This warming is especially pronounced in the North Atlantic basin.
Sea levels are also rising as the oceans warm and seawater expands. This expansion, combined with the melting of land-based ice, has caused global average sea level to rise by roughly 7-8 inches since 1900—a trend that is expected to accelerate over coming decades.
Higher sea levels give coastal storm surges a higher starting point when major storms approach and pile water up along the shore. The resulting storm surge reaches higher and penetrates further inland in low-lying areas. The risk is even greater if storms make landfall during high tides.
Growing population density on coastlines also increases the destructive potential of hurricanes.  Roughly 40 percent of the US population—about 123 million people—lives in coastal counties. US coastal county populations are growing much denser than non-coastal counties. Between 1970 and 2010 coastal counties increased population density by 39 percent (excluding Alaska). In non-coastal counties, population density hardly changed over the same period.
By concentrating ourselves along the coasts, we have increasingly exposed our communities and homes to powerful storms. As a result of coastal development, storms are exacting rising financial tolls.

Rising ocean temperatures fuel stronger North Atlantic hurricanes
Warm ocean temperatures are one of the key factors that strengthen hurricane development when overall conditions are conducive for their formation and growth.
Hurricanes require high humidity, relatively constant winds at different altitudes, and can occur when surface ocean temperatures exceed about 79°F (26°C). The rising of warm, moist air from the ocean helps to power the storm.
Two other factors may also be contributing to the rising intensities of hurricanes. First, warm air holds more water vapor than cold air—and the rising air temperatures since the 1970s have caused the atmospheric water vapor content to rise as well. This increased moisture provides additional fuel for hurricanes. Climate models project an increase in the average precipitation rate of hurricanes as a result of global warming.
Second, as ocean temperatures rise, there is also less cold, subsurface ocean water to serve as a braking mechanism for hurricanes. When strong storm winds churn up cold subsurface water, the cooler waters can serve to weaken the storm. But if deeper waters become too warm, this natural braking mechanism weakens. For example, Hurricane Katrina intensified significantly when it hit deep pools of warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.
Not all changes in climate will fuel hurricanes. For example, when there are large changes in wind speed at different altitudes (also known as "vertical wind shear ") above an area of the ocean, those conditions can interfere with hurricane formation. There is evidence that climate change may increase vertical wind shear over some regions in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean.
However, when scientists put the pieces together, they project that in general, hurricanes will become more intense in a warming world, with higher wind speeds and greater levels of precipitation.

The role of natural cycles in hurricanes
The oceans experience a variety of natural circulation patterns, or oscillations, that influence the distribution of warm and cold water in the upper ocean. These naturally occurring oscillations affect ocean conditions on timescales ranging from just a few years to several decades and are known to affect the intensity of hurricanes.
During the warm, or El Niño, phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, hurricanes are less likely to make landfall in eastern Australia and Atlantic hurricanes tend to be suppressed. However, El Niño conditions can boost typhoon risks in parts of Asia.
The presence of these natural oscillations can mask or enhance the potential influence of human-caused warming on hurricane activity. Recent scientific studies increasingly question whether human activities have contributed to observed shifts in natural circulation patterns.

What the future holds
As the climate continues to warm, the average intensity of tropical cyclones (including hurricanes in the North Atlantic) is projected to rise while the overall number of hurricanes globally is expected to either decrease or remain unchanged. Scientists project that, on average, tropical cyclones and hurricanes will have higher wind speeds and higher precipitation rates. There is some evidence that there will be an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, though there is more evidence of this finding for the eastern North Pacific than there is for the western North Pacific and Atlantic.
The projected increase in intense hurricanes is substantial—a doubling or more in the frequency of category 4 and 5 storms by the end of the century—with the western North Atlantic experiencing the largest increase. With continued warming, sea level is likely to rise by one to four feet globally by the end of the century, enabling the powerful surge associated with hurricanes to penetrate further inland than today.
Given the loss of life and the huge costs of rebuilding after hurricanes, it is essential to do whatever we can to avoid dangerous warming and protect coastal communities for ourselves and our children.
Recent experiences with super storms like Sandy in 2012, Harvey, Irma and Maria, all in 2017, have left some valuable lessons: We can’t afford to ignore global warming. Investing for the present and future of a changing climate is pressing.
How are we preparing our communities, and making sure that we don’t leave people behind? What actions are we taking to mitigate climate change and avoid its worse projections?

Hurricane Ida intensified overnight, becoming a Category 4 storm over the course of just a few hours. The rapid increase in strength raises questions about how much climate change is affecting hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. While researchers can’t say for sure whether human-caused climate change will mean longer or more active hurricane seasons in the future, there is broad agreement on one thing: Global warming is changing storms.
Scientists say that unusually warm Atlantic surface temperatures have helped to increase storm activity. “It’s very likely that human-caused climate change contributed to that anomalously warm ocean,” said James P. Kossin, a climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Climate change is making it more likely for hurricanes to behave in certain ways.”
Here are some of those ways.
1. Higher winds
There’s a solid scientific consensus that hurricanes are becoming more powerful.
Hurricanes are complex, but one of the key factors that determines how strong a given storm ultimately becomes is ocean surface temperature, because warmer water provides more of the energy that fuels storms.
“Potential intensity is going up,” said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “We predicted it would go up 30 years ago, and the observations show it going up.”
Stronger winds mean downed power lines, damaged roofs and, when paired with rising sea levels, worse coastal flooding.
“Even if storms themselves weren’t changing, the storm surge is riding on an elevated sea level,” Dr. Emanuel said. He used New York City as an example, where sea levels have risen about a foot in the past century. “If Sandy’s storm surge had occurred in 1912 rather than 2012,” he said, “it probably wouldn’t have flooded Lower Manhattan.”
2. More rain
Warming also increases the amount of water vapor that the atmosphere can hold. In fact, every degree Celsius of warming allows the air to hold about 7 percent more water.
That means we can expect future storms to unleash higher amounts of rainfall.
3. Slower storms
Researchers do not yet know why storms are moving more slowly, but they are. Some say a slowdown in global atmospheric circulation, or global winds, could be partly to blame.
In a 2018 paper, Dr. Kossin found that hurricanes over the United States had slowed 17 percent since 1947. Combined with the increase in rain rates, storms are causing a 25 percent increase in local rainfall in the United States, he said.
Slower, wetter storms also worsen flooding. Dr. Kossin likened the problem to walking around your back yard while using a hose to spray water on the ground. If you walk fast, the water won’t have a chance to start pooling. But if you walk slowly, he said, “you’ll get a lot of rain below you.”
Understand the Latest News on Climate Change
Oil field sales. Many of the world’s largest energy companies are expected to sell off more than $100 billion of oil fields and other polluting assets in an effort to cut their emissions. But a new study found that these deals often involve buyers that have made few or no pledges to combat climate change.
Extreme heat. A heat wave has been pummeling India and Pakistan for weeks, and it is expected to intensify. The scorching weather is a reminder of what lies ahead, as heat waves grow more frequent, more dangerous and longer-lasting.
Fighting fire with fire. As deadly wildfires become increasingly common across America, the country is embracing planned fires to clear away vegetation and contain the risk of wildfires. But in many places, the changing climate is making these intentional burns much more complicated to carry out.
Warming oceans. A new study found that if fossil fuel emissions continue apace, warming waters could trigger ocean species loss by the year 2300 that is on par with the five mass extinctions in Earth’s past. But reining in emissions now could drastically reduce those extinction risks, researchers found.
Viral spillovers. Over the next 50 years, climate change will drive thousands of viruses to jump from one species of mammal to another, according to a new study. Researchers noted that the shuffling of viruses could increase the risk that one will jump into humans and cause a new pandemic.
4. Wider-ranging storms
Because warmer water helps fuel hurricanes, climate change is enlarging the zone where hurricanes can form.
There’s a “migration of tropical cyclones out of the tropics and toward subtropics and middle latitudes,” Dr. Kossin said. That could mean more storms making landfall in higher latitudes, like in the United States or Japan.
5. More volatility
As the climate warms, researchers also say they expect storms to intensify more rapidly. Researchers are still unsure why it’s happening, but the trend appears to be clear.
In a 2017 paper based on climate and hurricane models, Dr. Emanuel found that storms that intensify rapidly — the ones that increase their wind speed by 70 miles per hour or more in the 24 hours before landfall — were rare in the period from 1976 through 2005. On average, he estimated, their likelihood in those years was equal to about once per century.
By the end of the 21st century, he found, those storms might form once every five or 10 years.
“It’s a forecaster’s nightmare,” Dr. Emanuel said. If a tropical storm or Category 1 hurricane develops into a Category 4 hurricane overnight, he said, “there’s no time to evacuate people.”

How climate change makes hurricanes more destructive
As our climate warms, we’re experiencing stronger winds, higher storm surges and record rainfalls during hurricane season — which is also why these storms are becoming more destructive and costly.
Warmer oceans fuel storms
So why do hurricanes bring more rain in a warmer climate?
Evaporation intensifies as temperatures rise, and so does the transfer of heat from the oceans to the air. As the storms travel across warm oceans, they pull in more water vapor and heat.
That means stronger wind, heavier rainfall and more flooding when the storms hit land.
Sea level rise makes storm surges worse
Storm surge happens when waters rise above their normal levels and are pushed inland by wind.
With Hurricane Katrina, it was the storm surge that caused the levees to fail, leading to destruction in the New Orleans area.
Storm surge was also responsible for an extra $2 billion in damage to New York City after Sandy hit in 2012, according to a Rand report.
This phenomenon is made worse by sea level rise, which is triggered by human-caused global warming as warmer ocean water expands and land ice melts.
The average global sea level has already risen by half a foot since 1900 — nearly four of those inches since 1970 — as countries have developed and populations have grown. Higher sea level can push more water inland during hurricane-related storm surges.

Hurricanes are stronger, intensify faster

Slow-moving Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas in 2019.
Stronger hurricanes are becoming more common in a warmer climate.
Researchers suggest that the most damaging U.S. hurricanes are three times more frequent than 100 years ago, and that the proportion of major hurricanes (Category 3 or above) in the Atlantic Ocean has doubled since 1980.
How fast hurricanes intensify has also increased in the Atlantic since the 1980s, due to climate change. Hurricanes Laura and Dorian are prime examples. Both rapidly intensified close to landfall, making it harder to predict the potential danger.
At the same time, hurricanes are moving more slowly, making more damage possible. Scientists are still debating exactly how this drop in speed is linked to climate change, but here’s the leading theory: The winds that steer hurricanes move more slowly in a warmer climate.
The damage we've seen from catastrophic hurricanes in recent years shows we need science more than ever to help us prepare for — and act on — climate change.

Through research, GFDL scientists have concluded that it is premature to attribute past changes in hurricane activity to greenhouse warming, although simulated hurricanes tend to be more intense in a warmer climate.  Other climate changes related to greenhouse warming, such as increases in vertical wind shear over the Caribbean, lead to fewer yet more intense hurricanes in the GFDL model projections for the late 21st century.  GFDL research on hurricanes and climate has been cited in several key assessment reports, including the WMO and IPCC assessments.  Further investigation with more advanced models is needed for more confident projections of future hurricane activity in a warming climate.

Alright, so from these search results, it seems like there's a consensus that climate change is affecting hurricanes in several ways. First, warmer ocean temperatures are fueling stronger hurricanes. So, the intensity of hurricanes is increasing, meaning they have higher wind speeds and can be more destructive.

Also, there's mention that hurricanes are bringing more rain. Warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation, so there's more water vapor in the atmosphere, which can result in heavier rainfall during storms. This can lead to more flooding when these storms make landfall.

Another point is that hurricanes are moving more slowly, which means they can linger over an area for longer periods, dropping even more rain and causing more damage.

Additionally, sea levels are rising due to climate change, which exacerbates the storm surges that accompany hurricanes. Storm surges are basically the abnormal rise in sea level due to the storm, and higher sea levels make these surges more destructive.

Furthermore, there's a suggestion that hurricanes might be moving to higher latitudes, meaning areas that haven't traditionally experienced hurricanes might start seeing them more frequently.

Now, regarding the frequency of hurricanes, it's a bit more nuanced. Some studies suggest that while the overall number of hurricanes might not increase, or might even decrease, the proportion of stronger hurricanes, like Categories 4 and 5, is increasing.

It's also important to note that natural climate variability plays a role in hurricane activity. Phenomena like El Niño and La Niña can influence hurricane seasons, but on top of that natural variability, climate change is adding its own impacts.

So, to summarize, climate change is likely leading to more intense hurricanes with higher wind speeds, more rainfall, slower movement, and higher storm surges due to rising sea levels. These factors combined make hurricanes more destructive and costly.

But, I should also consider other types of natural disasters besides hurricanes. For example, how does climate change affect wildfires, floods, droughts, and heatwaves?

Let me think about wildfires first. I know that warmer temperatures can lead to drier conditions, which can exacerbate wildfire risks. Higher temperatures can cause soil to lose moisture more quickly, making vegetation more flammable. Also, climate change can lead to more frequent and severe droughts in some regions, which again increases the risk of wildfires.

Moreover, changes in precipitation patterns can affect wildfire frequency. For instance, if an area experiences heavier rainfall followed by a dry period, the increased vegetation from the rain can later become fuel for fires during the dry spell.

I recall that in recent years, many parts of the world have seen more intense and longer-lasting wildfire seasons, which some attribute to climate change.

Now, moving on to floods. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of heavy precipitation events. Warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation, which can result in more intense rainfalls. This can lead to flash floods and riverine floods.

Also, sea-level rise due to climate change increases the risk of coastal flooding during storm surges and high tides.

Droughts are another natural disaster that can be influenced by climate change. Higher temperatures can increase evaporation rates, leading to drier soils and reduced water availability. Changes in precipitation patterns can also lead to more frequent and severe droughts in some regions.

Heatwaves are becoming more common and more intense due to global warming. Higher average temperatures mean that extreme heat events are more likely to occur and to be more severe.

So, in summary, climate change is affecting various types of natural disasters:

- Hurricanes: increasing intensity, more rainfall, slower movement, higher storm surges.

- Wildfires: increased frequency and severity due to drier conditions and higher temperatures.

- Floods: more intense precipitation leading to heavier rainfall and increased flood risks, combined with sea-level rise causing more coastal flooding.

- Droughts: increased frequency and severity due to higher temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns.

- Heatwaves: more frequent and intense due to rising temperatures.

It's also worth noting that these changes can have cascading effects. For example, more intense rainfall can lead to landslides in areas with unstable soils, and droughts can lead to water shortages and food insecurity.

Moreover, the impacts of these natural disasters are often felt more acutely by vulnerable populations, such as low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and those living in areas prone to disasters.

In conclusion, climate change is amplifying the risks and impacts of various natural disasters, posing significant challenges for society in terms of adaptation and mitigation.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change is increasing the intensity of hurricanes, exacerbating wildfires, enhancing flood risks, intensifying droughts, and raising the frequency and severity of heatwaves.}} \]
