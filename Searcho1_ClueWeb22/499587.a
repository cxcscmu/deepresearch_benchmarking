Alright, so I have this question: "How does literature change the way we think?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but interesting. I guess literature encompasses a lot, like books, poems, plays, and more. I think the way we think can be influenced by what we read, but I need to dig deeper into this.

First off, maybe I should define what literature is. Literature generally refers to written works that have artistic or intellectual value. It can include fiction, non-fiction, poetry, drama, and so on. So, it's a wide range of materials that people engage with.

Now, how does reading literature affect our thinking? I recall that reading can enhance empathy because it allows us to step into other people's shoes and understand their perspectives. Maybe that's one way literature changes our thinking—it broadens our understanding of others' experiences.

Also, literature often presents complex ideas and themes that make us think critically. For example, philosophical novels or thought-provoking stories can challenge our beliefs and make us question things we've taken for granted. So, in that sense, literature can stimulate intellectual growth and encourage us to think more deeply about various subjects.

Furthermore, literature can expose us to different cultures, time periods, and social contexts that we might not otherwise be familiar with. This exposure can broaden our horizons and make us more open-minded. By experiencing different worlds through literature, we can develop a more nuanced view of the world and its diverse peoples and practices.

Moreover, reading literature can improve our language skills and vocabulary, which in turn can enhance our ability to express ourselves and communicate effectively. Better communication skills can lead to more thoughtful and articulate thinking.

Additionally, literature often deals with universal human experiences and emotions, which can help us process our own feelings and make sense of our lives. By seeing characters go through similar struggles and triumphs, we can gain insights into our own experiences and perhaps find new ways of thinking about them.

I also think that literature can inspire creativity and imagination. When we read descriptive passages or vivid imagery in poetry, it can spark our own creative thoughts and help us visualize scenarios in our minds. This imaginative exercise can foster innovative thinking and problem-solving skills.

Moreover, literature can serve as a mirror to society, reflecting its flaws and virtues. By highlighting social issues and injustices, literature can raise awareness and encourage readers to think critically about the world around them. It can motivate people to question societal norms and consider alternative viewpoints.

Additionally, reading literature can provide escapism, allowing us to暂时脱离现实，进入一个不同的世界。这种逃避可以是放松和恢复精力的一种方式，从而在返回现实时以更清晰和积极的心态思考问题。

再者，文学作品常常包含道德和伦理的探讨，这可以影响我们的价值观和决策过程。通过观察角色的选择及其后果，我们可以学习到关于正确与错误、善与恶的教训，这些都可以塑造我们的道德观念。

此外，文学还可以作为一种历史记录，让我们了解过去的时代和事件。通过阅读历史小说或传记，我们可以获得对历史的深刻理解，并从历史中吸取教训，应用于现代情境。

最后，我认为文学能够培养耐心和专注力。在数字时代，人们往往习惯于快速消费信息，而阅读文学作品需要时间和集中注意力。这种深度阅读的习惯可以提高我们的专注力，帮助我们在其他领域也保持专注和深思熟虑。

综上所述，文学通过多种方式改变我们的思维方式，包括增强同理心、促进批判性思维、拓宽视野、提升语言能力、处理个人情感、激发创造力、引发社会意识、提供休闲放松、塑造价值观、传授历史知识以及培养耐心和专注力。

为了更全面地回答这个问题，也许我可以查找一些学术研究或专家意见来支持这些观点。比如，有没有研究表明阅读文学确实能增加人们的同理心？或者有无教育学家讨论过文学在培养批判性思维方面的作用？

让我尝试进行一次搜索，看看能否找到一些相关的资料。

How Reading Fiction Increases Our Capacity for Empathy
Musings
February 2, 2016  | Cecily Erin Hill
A 2013 study from the New School concludes that “reading literature improves theory of mind” – “the capacity to identify and understand others’ subjective states.” As the authors note, theory of mind is critically linked to empathy, that all-important ability to intuit and experience the feelings of another. Together with the cognitive component of theory of mind (“the inference and representation of others’ beliefs and intentions”), empathy is a crucial element of “positive interpersonal and intergroup relations.” We need to practice it, in other words, to be effective and considerate people at home, at work and throughout our lives.
Reading fiction had previously been shown to increase empathy by “[expanding] our knowledge of others’ lives, helping us to recognize our similarity to them.” But in this study, authors David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castono argue that literary fiction helps people practice empathy because of its complexity, too. Because it requires more mental processing, readers of literary fiction are tasked with interpretation or critical thinking. Literary fiction, they posit, has the power to “disrupt our stereotypes”; what’s more, it is full of “complicated individuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.”
Literary fiction, that is, requires of us the same kinds of interpretive tasks that we undertake when engaging with other people. At the same time, it reminds us to look beyond the stereotypes we are all guilty of relying upon, if for nothing more than to get through our days.
Upon its release, the study was highly reported, resulting in headlines like “ For Better Social Skills, Scientists Recommend a Little Chekhov ,” and “ Why Reading Fiction Makes You a Better Person .” But as Mark Liberman for Slate pointed out, the study was by no means flawless. Key among those flaws are the authors’ limited sample sets and their selection of what constitutes “literary,” indicating a need for further and much broader study of the issue.
Flaws notwithstanding (and what study is without some flaws?), studies like this one do the necessary work of legitimating readerly practices in a culture that sometimes devalues reading – and it also helps explain, in a firm way, what actually happens to us when we read. But if you are a reader, you probably don’t need a study to tell you that books open us to others and make us better in our own lives. I would challenge anyone to read Rebecca Skloot’sThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks or Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go or any number of other books, and walk away from them unchanged.
Because stories change us – often for the better.

How Reading Fiction Increases Empathy and Encourages Understanding
There might some truth to the beloved quote, "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies." Researchers say reading fiction can show us different viewpoints — and shape how we relate to each other.

Would the world be a better place if people read more books?
Of course, asserting that reading can fix the world's problems would be naive at best. But it could help make it a more empathetic place. And a growing body of research has found that people who read fiction tend to better understand and share in the feelings of others — even those who are different from themselves.
That’s because literary fiction is essentially an exploration of the human experience, says Keith Oatley, a novelist and professor emeritus of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto.
“Reading novels enables us to become better at actually understanding other people and what they’re up to,” says Oatley. “[With] someone who you’re married to ... or a close friend, you can actually get to know them. Reading fiction enables you to sample across a much wider range of possible people and come to understand something about the differences among them.”
Perspectives on Empathy
Psychologists have found that empathy is innate, as even babies show it. And while some people are naturally more empathetic than others, most people become more-so with age. Beyond that, some research indicates that if you're motivated to become more empathetic, you probably can. Although there are many ways to cultivate empathy, they largely involve practicing positive social behaviors, like getting to know others, putting yourself in their shoes and challenging one's own biases. And stories — fictional ones in particular — offer another way to step outside of oneself.
Fiction has the capacity to transport you into another character’s mind, allowing you to see and feel what they do. This can expose us to life circumstances that are very different from our own. Through fiction, we can experience the world as another gender, ethnicity, culture, sexuality, profession or age. Words on a page can introduce us to what it's like to lose a child, be swept up in a war, be born into poverty, or leave home and immigrate to a new country. And taken together, this can influence how we relate to others in the real world.
“Fiction and stories do a lot of things for us,” says William Chopik, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. “They expose us to uncomfortable ideas ... and provide us with the opportunity to take other peoples’ perspectives in a safe, distanced way. In that way, fiction serves as a playground for exercising empathic skills.”
The Link Between Fiction and Empathy
In 2006, Oatley and his colleagues published a study that drew a strong connection between reading fiction and better performance on widely used empathy and social acumen tests. They tested participants on their ability to recognize author names, which helped them gauge how much fiction they read. Then, participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which scores people across different dimensions of empathy.
Participants also took the “Mind of the Eyes” assessment, which tested people on their ability to detect and understand visual cues of other people’s thoughts and emotions. In this test, participants matched words of emotions to photos of people’s eyes. (You can take a version of the test here.) The team found that the more names of fiction authors that participants knew — and the more fiction they presumably read — the higher they scored on empathy tests.
Since then, exploring the intersection between empathy and fiction has caught on in psychology. Generally, it has been shown that the act of reading itself is what promotes a change in individuals. It’s not that people who are naturally more empathetic gravitate toward fiction, or that fiction readers have specific personality traits primed for greater empathy. “When we subtract all these things out, which we did [in our research], this idea that reading fiction enables people to understand others better was still there,” Oatley says.
Over the years, some studies have also demonstrated that literature influences how we relate to people more than other types of books. For instance, researchers of a 2013 paper published in Science assigned people to read either literary fiction, genre fiction, non-fiction or nothing. Then, the researchers measured participants' improvement on "Theory of Mind" tests. The theory of mind, which is a concept related to empathy, refers to our ability to comprehend that other people hold beliefs and desires, and that they might be different than our own. People who were assigned to read literary fiction showed the most improvement on the empathy tests. People who were assigned to read a work of non-fiction, popular genre fiction or nothing at all didn’t get a boost in scores.
The researchers also noted that there are distinctions between literary fiction and genre fiction that might explain differences in scores. Works of literary fiction tend to place greater emphasis on character development. The people and scenarios depicted in literature are more likely to disrupt reader expectations. Classic examples of literary fiction would be Toni Morrison’s Beloved or Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
On the other hand, genre fiction — think Danielle Steele romance novels or a John Grisham legal thriller — takes a more plot-driven approach. Although they’re often entertaining page-turners, these books stick to more consistent and predictable themes that tend to reinforce readers’ views rather than challenge them.
Some of the most powerful examples of fiction’s influence on empathy come from studies that specifically looked at people's attitudes toward members of stigmatized groups. For example, a 2014 study showed that elementary school and high school students in Italy and the United Kingdom became more empathic toward immigrants, refugees, and gay and lesbian people after reading Harry Potter. In their work, the researchers explained that “the world of Harry Potter is characterized by strict social hierarchies and resulting prejudices, with obvious parallels with our society.” People without magical powers are discriminated against in the series, for instance.
That same year, another research team found that people who read Saffron Dreams — a fictional account of a Muslim woman of Middle Eastern descent in New York who was the victim of racist attacks — showed less negative bias toward people of different races or ethnicities. But participants who only read a summary of the book or a work of non-fiction didn’t show a similar shift in views.
Oatley notes that different people need different things from different stories. (But in case you’re looking for a recommendation, he said you can’t go wrong with Pride and Prejudice). Memoirs, biographies and some historical non-fiction also shouldn’t entirely be ruled out, he said. As long as there are powerful stories about people and their circumstances, there’s the potential they can resonate and leave a lasting impression. And watching a story unfold in a movie also might have a similar effect on empathy as a book would.
But what people do with that extra empathy isn't well understood by scientists, says Sarah Konrath, a researcher at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University.
“There is less research on the effects of reading on prosocial behaviors like giving, volunteering and helping," says Konrath. "But since empathy is one of the main motivations of such kind behaviors, I do think that reading books can help to promote more kindness overall. But like any type of media, it probably depends on the content. After all, Mein Kampf by Hitler was a book that promoted hate.”
The End of Empathy?
Sometimes, empathy is described as the glue that holds society together. Without it, humankind probably wouldn’t have gotten very far. Our ancestors depended on acts of caring for survival — such as sharing resources, help with healing the sick, and protection from predators. And we’ll probably continue needing empathy to move forward. Yet, at this particular moment in history, it can feel like empathy is on shaky ground.
In 2010, a meta-analysis by Konrath found empathy among college students declined between the 1970s and the 2000s, as measured by standard tests for the trait. During this time period, the average level of “empathic concern,” or sympathy for the misfortunes of others, declined by 48 percent. “Perspective taking,” or the ability to imagine others’ points of view, also declined by 34 percent. Konrath says she’s working on an update to the 2010 study, and that it can be difficult to pinpoint the complex reasons behind these statistical shifts.
Chopik says a common culprit that often gets blamed is a generational shift in parenting styles, such as a hyper-focus on personal achievement and high self-esteem. Critics say these trends might compromise empathy so individuals can get ahead. Another is the rise of social media and the erosion of meaningful, in-person connections.
But Chopik also notes that things might not be as dire as they seem.
“The consequences of negative changes like these — and the exact extent to which people are changing in recent generations — can be a bit overblown sometimes," he says. "There seems to be a moral panic about young people becoming less empathic or more narcissistic."

Empathy and Literature: How Books Can Help Us Care More
Empathy and Literature: How Books Help Us Care More
by Ernie Lindsey | Jan 23, 2017 | Blog |
Readers know there’s always been a connection between empathy and literature – we put ourselves in characters’ shoes all the time! Here’s what it means.
Read more. Care more.
As an author, I’m always pleased to meet a book lover. Nothing pleases me more than to share a good story. Storytelling, verbal and written, is a part of our human culture.
The history of storytelling reaches back centuries. Well before the written word, humankind passed on its history, traditions, and ideas through storytelling. But beyond sharing facts and ideas, humans have also shared fictional tales.
Every culture has its own great works of literature. Authors and consumers continue to seek out new fiction to enjoy and share.
But why is it that we are drawn to the imaginary? What role does literature serve in our lives?
The Connection Between Empathy and Literature
Of course, one reason to read a book is for entertainment. A good book has the power to transport us away from our daily cares.
We find pleasure in sharing our ideas of imaginary worlds and their inhabitants. Authors sometimes use a fictional world to explore difficult or taboo topics.
Additionally, a work of literature can help us to understand ourselves and others. It can raise our EQ or emotional quotient.
This is one of the reasons we study literature in school. Unlike other areas of study that focus on learning the facts of a particular subject, literature is about learning unique lessons from each written work. It’s also a good reason to continue reading fictional literature throughout your life.
What Can Reading a Good Book Do for Your EQ?
Most of us remember our middle and high school years.
We were assigned different works of literature to read each year. Often we’d be asked to write a report on what we’d read or take a test to demonstrate that we had actually done our reading assignments.
The books I read in literature class exposed me to different cultures and ideas. Now, I don’t know if my teachers overtly intended for me to learn empathy from stories such as Animal Farm or Huckleberry Finn.
But, several studies demonstrate that developing empathy and literature are connected.
Several researchers have taken up the challenge of studying the relationship between empathy and literature. Among the leading authors on this topic are Raymond A. Mar, Keith Oatley and Jordan B. Peterson. In a 2009 article, these three researchers concluded that reading literature is more than just a leisurely pursuit.
Instead, exposure to literature can influence the reader’s attitude about an issue, improve readers’ social skills, and enhance their ability to feel empathy.
Reading literature provides insight into the lives of others.
In another study about empathy and literature, this one from 2013, researchers David Cormer Kidd and Emanuele Castano confirmed what our high school literature teachers already knew. They report that reading fiction expands our “knowledge of others’ lives” and helps us recognize our similarities.
We learn about lifestyles and situations that we may not have ever faced in the real world. Reading literature gives us the opportunity to walk a mile in another’s shoes, or at least imagine what it would be like.
Reading works of fiction work your theory of mind muscles.
In their article, “Reading Literary Fiction Improves Theory of Mind”, the researchers state that fiction that involves characters with complex inner lives contributed to theory of mind development in the reader.
Theory of mind refers to our ability to imagine what others are feeling and thinking. It is the theory of mind that allows us to predict what another person might do or react. This ability is essential to successful social interactions. In conducting their research
This ability is essential to successful social interactions. In conducting their research, Cormer and Castona found that literature that leads the reader to anticipate the characters’ actions and evaluates the characters’ motives exercises their theory of mind capabilities.
In other words, we are better able to practice empathy in the real world if we hone our theory of mind skills in a fictional one.
However, this bump in empathy is not always permanent. So, if we want to keep our empathy skills honed, we should keep on reading good fiction.
Reading lights up your neural pathways.
Brain researchers have found that reading a work of fiction stimulates the brain in the same way that actually experiencing an event does. When reading a book, your brain lives vicariously through the lives of the characters.
This provides readers with a safe way to work through feelings and emotions that may be difficult to face in real life. In this way, reading literature works as a form of visualization therapy. We can learn to care more for the feelings of others by following the example of the characters we read about.
We can learn to care more for the feelings of others by following the example of the characters we read about.
Literary fiction is a vehicle of shared consciousness.
In a follow-up article discussing the most recent research on empathy and literature, Keith Oatley explains the relationship between author and reader. He writes that “Fiction can be thought of as a form of consciousness…that can be passed from an author to a reader .”
Through the use of allegory, imagery, analogy, paradox and other literary devices an author can open a readers’ eyes to new ideas or perspectives. Through this process the author shares a consciousness with his reader, transforming the reader’s internal thoughts.
Share a Good Story With Me
I have enjoyed reading for as long as I can remember. I’ve enjoyed telling a good story for almost that long.
I write under two names, Ernie Lindsey and Desmond Doane. You can find out more about me and my books here on my website.
I’ve even shared a list of my favorite free Kindle books. You can also download a novel free from right here on my website.
What books have inspired you? Have you read anything lately that’s changed your point of view on an issue?
Have you found yourself more caring or understanding because of the influence of a particular author? Share your experience with me. I’d love to know what you think.
So keep reading, keep learning about others and tell me what you think. Everyone can use a little extra caring and sharing in their life.

Can reading literature help develop empathy? The opinion of cognitive scientists.
Published in: 21st century skills, Education
by Pisana Ferrari – cApStAn Ambassador to the Global Village
Educators “should not dismiss” the role that classic literature can play in developing empathy: by understanding how great novelists put themselves into the shoes of characters who are completely unlike themselves, students can learn to do the same with their neighbours from a different walk of life. So says the author of a recent article by @Acer for Education (1), who adds that empathy is one of the top skills for the future, together with communication. The two are very closely linked, as, in order to communicate effectively, you need to understand the “human emotional responses” of those you are communicating with. It is equally important that educators encourage their students to socialise with people they would not normally mingle with, expose them to points of view other than their own, and show them the importance of listening to understand rather than to reply.
The theory that reading literature can affect the reader is not new, of course. But recent studies in the “neuroscience of literature” show that there may be a scientific basis to support it. In a blog post from last year we wrote about the effects of reading on the brain, inspired by a fascinating article on LitHub by Maryanne Wolf, Professor of Child Development at Tufts University, where she is also Director of the Center for Reading and Language Research (2). The article referred, inter alia, to studies by cognitive scientist Keith Oatley, who has demonstrated a strong relationship between reading fiction and the involvement of the cognitive processes known to underlie both empathy and theory of mind. Oatley and his York University colleague Raymond Marr suggest that the process of “taking on another’s consciousness” in reading fiction and the nature of fiction’s content-where the great emotions and conflicts of life are regularly played out-not only contribute to our empathy, but represent what the social scientist Frank Hakemulder called our “moral laboratory.” (3).
Will reading literature survive the increasingly fast and “visual” world we live in? Reading requires “cognitive patience “, says Maryann Wolf. What will happen to young readers who never meet and begin to understand the thoughts and feelings of someone totally different, she asks. And what will happen to older readers who begin to lose touch with that feeling of empathy for people outside their ken or kin? This is a formula for unwitting ignorance, fear and misunderstanding, which can lead to belligerent forms of intolerance, she warns. Empathy, she says, is not solely about being compassionate toward others; it is also about a more in-depth understanding of the other, an essential skill in a world of increasing connectedness among divergent cultures.

Novel Finding: Reading Literary Fiction Improves Empathy
The types of books we read may affect how we relate to others

How important is reading fiction in socializing school children? Researchers at The New School in New York City have found evidence that literary fiction improves a reader’s capacity to understand what others are thinking and feeling.
Emanuele Castano, a social psychologist, along with PhD candidate David Kidd conducted five studies in which they divided a varying number of participants (ranging from 86 to 356) and gave them different reading assignments: excerpts from genre (or popular) fiction, literary fiction, nonfiction or nothing. After they finished the excerpts the participants took a test that measured their ability to infer and understand other people’s thoughts and emotions. The researchers found, to their surprise, a significant difference between the literary- and genre-fiction readers.
When study participants read non-fiction or nothing, their results were unimpressive. When they read excerpts of genre fiction, such as Danielle Steel’s The Sins of the Mother, their test results were dually insignificant. However, when they read literary fiction, such as The Round House by Louise Erdrich, their test results improved markedly—and, by implication, so did their capacity for empathy. The study was published October 4 in Science.
The results are consistent with what literary criticism has to say about the two genres—and indeed, this may be the first empirical evidence linking literary and psychological theories of fiction. Popular fiction tends to portray situations that are otherworldly and follow a formula to take readers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and exciting experiences. Although the settings and situations are grand, the characters are internally consistent and predictable, which tends to affirm the reader’s expectations of others. It stands to reason that popular fiction does not expand the capacity to empathize.
Literary fiction, by contrast, focuses more on the psychology of characters and their relationships. “Often those characters’ minds are depicted vaguely, without many details, and we’re forced to fill in the gaps to understand their intentions and motivations,” Kidd says. This genre prompts the reader to imagine the characters’ introspective dialogues. This psychological awareness carries over into the real world, which is full of complicated individuals whose inner lives are usually difficult to fathom. Although literary fiction tends to be more realistic than popular fiction, the characters disrupt reader expectations, undermining prejudices and stereotypes. They support and teach us values about social behavior, such as the importance of understanding those who are different from ourselves.
The results suggest that reading fiction is a valuable socializing influence. The study data couldinform debates over how much fiction should be included in educational curricula and whether reading programs should be implemented in prisons, where reading literary fiction might improve inmates’ social functioning and empathy. Castano also hopes the finding will encourage autistic people to engage in more literary fiction, in the hope it could improve their ability to empathize without the side effects of medication.

Alright, so from this search, I've gathered that there is a significant body of research suggesting that reading literary fiction can enhance empathy and social understanding. The studies mentioned indicate that literary fiction, with its complex characters and narrative techniques, challenges readers to think deeply about different perspectives and emotions, thereby improving their ability to understand others.

One key point is that literary fiction often requires more mental engagement from the reader, as it doesn't follow predictable formulas like genre fiction. This complexity can lead to a greater understanding of human behavior and emotions, which translates into better social skills and empathy in real life.

Moreover, the research suggests that this effect isn't just limited to improving understanding of fictional characters but extends to real-world interactions. By exposing readers to diverse experiences and viewpoints, literature can foster a more nuanced and empathetic approach to dealing with others.

Another interesting aspect is that this impact isn't permanent; it seems to require ongoing engagement with literary fiction to maintain these empathetic gains. This implies that making literature a regular part of one's reading habits could be beneficial for持续培养同理心。

此外，有研究指出，文学作品能够作为“道德实验室”，让读者在安全的环境中探索和理解不同的道德困境和人性的复杂性。这种体验可以帮助读者在现实生活中做出更富有同情心和理解力的决策。

不过，值得注意的是，虽然这些研究显示了文学阅读与同理心之间的积极关联，但并不意味着所有类型的文学作品都有相同的效果。选择那些着重于人物心理描写和人际关系的作品可能更能促进同理心的发展。

总的来说，这些发现强调了文学教育的重要性，不仅在学术领域，也在个人成长和社会和谐方面。通过鼓励人们阅读高质量的文学作品，我们可以培养更加理解和包容的社会成员。

接下来，我可能会考虑进一步探索这个主题，看看是否有更多的研究支持这些发现，或者是否有相反的观点。此外，我也好奇这种效应是否适用于所有年龄段的读者，以及在不同的文化背景下是否一致。

How Reading Fiction Increases Empathy and Encourages Understanding
There might some truth to the beloved quote, "A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies." Researchers say reading fiction can show us different viewpoints — and shape how we relate to each other.

Would the world be a better place if people read more books?
Of course, asserting that reading can fix the world's problems would be naive at best. But it could help make it a more empathetic place. And a growing body of research has found that people who read fiction tend to better understand and share in the feelings of others — even those who are different from themselves.
That’s because literary fiction is essentially an exploration of the human experience, says Keith Oatley, a novelist and professor emeritus of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto.
“Reading novels enables us to become better at actually understanding other people and what they’re up to,” says Oatley. “[With] someone who you’re married to ... or a close friend, you can actually get to know them. Reading fiction enables you to sample across a much wider range of possible people and come to understand something about the differences among them.”
Perspectives on Empathy
Psychologists have found that empathy is innate, as even babies show it. And while some people are naturally more empathetic than others, most people become more-so with age. Beyond that, some research indicates that if you're motivated to become more empathetic, you probably can. Although there are many ways to cultivate empathy, they largely involve practicing positive social behaviors, like getting to know others, putting yourself in their shoes and challenging one's own biases. And stories — fictional ones in particular — offer another way to step outside of oneself.
Fiction has the capacity to transport you into another character’s mind, allowing you to see and feel what they do. This can expose us to life circumstances that are very different from our own. Through fiction, we can experience the world as another gender, ethnicity, culture, sexuality, profession or age. Words on a page can introduce us to what it's like to lose a child, be swept up in a war, be born into poverty, or leave home and immigrate to a new country. And taken together, this can influence how we relate to others in the real world.
“Fiction and stories do a lot of things for us,” says William Chopik, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. “They expose us to uncomfortable ideas ... and provide us with the opportunity to take other peoples’ perspectives in a safe, distanced way. In that way, fiction serves as a playground for exercising empathic skills.”
The Link Between Fiction and Empathy
In 2006, Oatley and his colleagues published a study that drew a strong connection between reading fiction and better performance on widely used empathy and social acumen tests. They tested participants on their ability to recognize author names, which helped them gauge how much fiction they read. Then, participants completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, which scores people across different dimensions of empathy.
Participants also took the “Mind of the Eyes” assessment, which tested people on their ability to detect and understand visual cues of other people’s thoughts and emotions. In this test, participants matched words of emotions to photos of people’s eyes. (You can take a version of the test here.) The team found that the more names of fiction authors that participants knew — and the more fiction they presumably read — the higher they scored on empathy tests.
Since then, exploring the intersection between empathy and fiction has caught on in psychology. Generally, it has been shown that the act of reading itself is what promotes a change in individuals. It’s not that people who are naturally more empathetic gravitate toward fiction, or that fiction readers have specific personality traits primed for greater empathy. “When we subtract all these things out, which we did [in our research], this idea that reading fiction enables people to understand others better was still there,” Oatley says.
Over the years, some studies have also demonstrated that literature influences how we relate to people more than other types of books. For instance, researchers of a 2013 paper published in Science assigned people to read either literary fiction, genre fiction, non-fiction or nothing. Then, the researchers measured participants' improvement on "Theory of Mind" tests. The theory of mind, which is a concept related to empathy, refers to our ability to comprehend that other people hold beliefs and desires, and that they might be different than our own. People who were assigned to read literary fiction showed the most improvement on the empathy tests. People who were assigned to read a work of non-fiction, popular genre fiction or nothing at all didn’t get a boost in scores.
The researchers also noted that there are distinctions between literary fiction and genre fiction that might explain differences in scores. Works of literary fiction tend to place greater emphasis on character development. The people and scenarios depicted in literature are more likely to disrupt reader expectations. Classic examples of literary fiction would be Toni Morrison’s Beloved or Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
On the other hand, genre fiction — think Danielle Steele romance novels or a John Grisham legal thriller — takes a more plot-driven approach. Although they’re often entertaining page-turners, these books stick to more consistent and predictable themes that tend to reinforce readers’ views rather than challenge them.
Some of the most powerful examples of fiction’s influence on empathy come from studies that specifically looked at people's attitudes toward members of stigmatized groups. For example, a 2014 study showed that elementary school and high school students in Italy and the United Kingdom became more empathic toward immigrants, refugees, and gay and lesbian people after reading Harry Potter. In their work, the researchers explained that “the world of Harry Potter is characterized by strict social hierarchies and resulting prejudices, with obvious parallels with our society.” People without magical powers are discriminated against in the series, for instance.
That same year, another research team found that people who read Saffron Dreams — a fictional account of a Muslim woman of Middle Eastern descent in New York who was the victim of racist attacks — showed less negative bias toward people of different races or ethnicities. But participants who only read a summary of the book or a work of non-fiction didn’t show a similar shift in views.
Oatley notes that different people need different things from different stories. (But in case you’re looking for a recommendation, he said you can’t go wrong with Pride and Prejudice). Memoirs, biographies and some historical non-fiction also shouldn’t entirely be ruled out, he said. As long as there are powerful stories about people and their circumstances, there’s the potential they can resonate and leave a lasting impression. And watching a story unfold in a movie also might have a similar effect on empathy as a book would.
But what people do with that extra empathy isn't well understood by scientists, says Sarah Konrath, a researcher at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University.
“There is less research on the effects of reading on prosocial behaviors like giving, volunteering and helping," says Konrath. "But since empathy is one of the main motivations of such kind behaviors, I do think that reading books can help to promote more kindness overall. But like any type of media, it probably depends on the content. After all, Mein Kampf by Hitler was a book that promoted hate.”
The End of Empathy?
Sometimes, empathy is described as the glue that holds society together. Without it, humankind probably wouldn’t have gotten very far. Our ancestors depended on acts of caring for survival — such as sharing resources, help with healing the sick, and protection from predators. And we’ll probably continue needing empathy to move forward. Yet, at this particular moment in history, it can feel like empathy is on shaky ground.
In 2010, a meta-analysis by Konrath found empathy among college students declined between the 1970s and the 2000s, as measured by standard tests for the trait. During this time period, the average level of “empathic concern,” or sympathy for the misfortunes of others, declined by 48 percent. “Perspective taking,” or the ability to imagine others’ points of view, also declined by 34 percent. Konrath says she’s working on an update to the 2010 study, and that it can be difficult to pinpoint the complex reasons behind these statistical shifts.
Chopik says a common culprit that often gets blamed is a generational shift in parenting styles, such as a hyper-focus on personal achievement and high self-esteem. Critics say these trends might compromise empathy so individuals can get ahead. Another is the rise of social media and the erosion of meaningful, in-person connections.
But Chopik also notes that things might not be as dire as they seem.
“The consequences of negative changes like these — and the exact extent to which people are changing in recent generations — can be a bit overblown sometimes," he says. "There seems to be a moral panic about young people becoming less empathic or more narcissistic."

How Reading Fiction Increases Our Capacity for Empathy
Musings
February 2, 2016  | Cecily Erin Hill
A 2013 study from the New School concludes that “reading literature improves theory of mind” – “the capacity to identify and understand others’ subjective states.” As the authors note, theory of mind is critically linked to empathy, that all-important ability to intuit and experience the feelings of another. Together with the cognitive component of theory of mind (“the inference and representation of others’ beliefs and intentions”), empathy is a crucial element of “positive interpersonal and intergroup relations.” We need to practice it, in other words, to be effective and considerate people at home, at work and throughout our lives.
Reading fiction had previously been shown to increase empathy by “[expanding] our knowledge of others’ lives, helping us to recognize our similarity to them.” But in this study, authors David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castono argue that literary fiction helps people practice empathy because of its complexity, too. Because it requires more mental processing, readers of literary fiction are tasked with interpretation or critical thinking. Literary fiction, they posit, has the power to “disrupt our stereotypes”; what’s more, it is full of “complicated individuals whose inner lives are rarely easily discerned but warrant exploration.”
Literary fiction, that is, requires of us the same kinds of interpretive tasks that we undertake when engaging with other people. At the same time, it reminds us to look beyond the stereotypes we are all guilty of relying upon, if for nothing more than to get through our days.
Upon its release, the study was highly reported, resulting in headlines like “ For Better Social Skills, Scientists Recommend a Little Chekhov ,” and “ Why Reading Fiction Makes You a Better Person .” But as Mark Liberman for Slate pointed out, the study was by no means flawless. Key among those flaws are the authors’ limited sample sets and their selection of what constitutes “literary,” indicating a need for further and much broader study of the issue.
Flaws notwithstanding (and what study is without some flaws?), studies like this one do the necessary work of legitimating readerly practices in a culture that sometimes devalues reading – and it also helps explain, in a firm way, what actually happens to us when we read. But if you are a reader, you probably don’t need a study to tell you that books open us to others and make us better in our own lives. I would challenge anyone to read Rebecca Skloot’sThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks or Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go or any number of other books, and walk away from them unchanged.
Because stories change us – often for the better.

Research Shows Reading Improves Kids Emotional Intelligence | Reading Partners

Research shows reading improves kids' emotional intelligence and increases empathy
Growing up in a small town in Iowa, books were my window to a larger world. I would curl up in our overstuffed floral chair and be transported to a new world–from the 1930s Dust Bowl in Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse to the castle in Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. Books taught me about people who had different life experiences and grew up in different places than the Midwest.
The author, David Foster Wallace, accurately summarizes the importance of reading fiction and how fiction can help us better understand others, saying, “Fiction is about what it means to be human.”
This notion that reading can better help us connect to the broader human experience is more than a simple observation, it has been supported by extensive research. Studies show that reading can help kids build developmental skills of emotional intelligence and empathy, enabling our young readers to better connect with other perspectives and human experiences.
Fiction can increase emotional intelligence
The ability to learn about diversity through reading has been studied extensively, as researchers try to tap into what lifelong readers know as the magic of reading.
According to an article in the Scientific American, researchers at the New School in New York City “found evidence that literary fiction improves a reader’s capacity to understand what others are thinking and feeling.” The article further argues that literary fiction can “support and teach us values about social behavior, such as the importance of understanding those who are different from ourselves.”
The results of this study suggest that readers have greater emotional intelligence and empathy, meaning they can better put themselves in someone else’s shoes.
An important concept for parents, volunteers, mentors, and teachers to keep mind during classroom time and one-on-one sessions with kids. By supporting kids’ literacy development and a love of reading, you will in turn foster their emotional growth as you read and discuss fiction with them.
Stories and human connection
The notion that reading is a valuable skill for building social awareness and empathy is echoed by many authors who know and love this magical, important part of reading.
In an interview with Lit Hub, author Sunil Yapa says, “Empathy is a radical act, particularly when you use it to connect with people who are very different from you. Loving others is wonderful, but caring for others is profound…Empathy is a profound act of imagination and human connection. In fiction, we imagine ourselves into other people’s experiences. Of course, another word for that is ‘reading.’”
In this quotation, Yapa captures the essence of the connection between empathy and reading. He highlights how stories can be used as points of access for understanding other people’s lives.
Whether fiction or nonfiction, reading offers a unique experience to become engrossed in the stories and life experiences of the characters in the book. Providing readers with the opportunity to connect with other worldviews.
Applying this research in practice
At Reading Partners, we have the chance to read and discuss amazing children’s fiction with the students we work with. Giving children an array of diverse choices of fiction will not only help them become better readers, but will encourage them to be more empathetic people.
Books can be a window into different worlds for our students, just like they were for me growing up. Last Stop on Market Street by Matt de la Pena and Home by Carson Ells are two of my recent favorite children’s books that inspire empathy.
Here are some tips to incorporate this research in your next tutoring session:
Pick a literature book for read aloud time that discusses different types of life events and/or cultures.
Ask comprehension questions related to characters’ responses to the events in the book.
Encourage your student to think about how they might have responded to the events a character is experiencing in the book.
The opportunity to strengthen each student’s empathy through reading is an exciting prospect. Stories matter, and understanding others matters. I’m grateful for all the time I spent reading growing up and believe reading has made me a more empathetic person.

Reading literary fiction improves empathy, study finds
New research shows works by writers such as Charles Dickens and Téa Obreht sharpen our ability to understand others' emotions – more than thrillers or romance novels

Have you ever felt that reading a good book makes you better able to connect with your fellow human beings? If so, the results of a new scientific study back you up, but only if your reading material is literary fiction – pulp fiction or non-fiction will not do.
Psychologists David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, at the New School for Social Research in New York, have proved that reading literary fiction enhances the ability to detect and understand other people's emotions, a crucial skill in navigating complex social relationships.
In a series of five experiments, 1,000 participants were randomly assigned texts to read, either extracts of popular fiction such as bestseller Danielle Steel's The Sins of the Mother and Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, or more literary texts, such as Orange-winner The Tiger's Wife by Téa Obreht, Don DeLillo's "The Runner", from his collection The Angel Esmeralda, or work by Anton Chekhov.
The pair then used a variety of Theory of Mind techniques to measure how accurately the participants could identify emotions in others. Scores were consistently higher for those who had read literary fiction than for those with popular fiction or non-fiction texts.
"What great writers do is to turn you into the writer. In literary fiction, the incompleteness of the characters turns your mind to trying to understand the minds of others," said Kidd.
Kidd and Castano, who have published their paper in Science, make a similar distinction between "writerly" writing and "readerly" writing to that made by Roland Barthes in his book on literary theory, The Pleasure of the Text. Mindful of the difficulties of determining what is literary fiction and what is not, certain of the literary extracts were chosen from the PEN/O Henry prize 2012 winners' anthology and the US National book awards finalists.
"Some writing is what you call 'writerly', you fill in the gaps and participate, and some is 'readerly', and you're entertained. We tend to see 'readerly' more in genre fiction like adventure, romance and thrillers, where the author dictates your experience as a reader. Literary [writerly] fiction lets you go into a new environment and you have to find your own way," Kidd said.
Transferring the experience of reading fiction into real-world situations was a natural leap, Kidd argued, because "the same psychological processes are used to navigate fiction and real relationships. Fiction is not just a simulator of a social experience, it is a social experience."
Not all psychologists agreed with Kidd and Castano's use of Theory of Mind techniques. Philip Davies, a professor of psychological sciences at Liverpool University, whose work with the Reader Organisation connects prisoners with literature, said they were "a bit odd".
"Testing people's ability to read faces is a bit odd. The thing about novels is that they give you a view of an inner world that's not on show. Often what you learn from novels is to be a bit baffled … a novel tells you not to judge," Davies said.
"In Great Expectations, Pip is embarrassed by Joe, because he's crude and Pip is on the way up. Reading it, you ask yourself, what is it like to be Pip and what's it like to be Joe? Would I behave better than Pip in his situation? It's the spaces which emerge between the two characters where empathy occurs."
The five experiments used a combination of four different Theory of Mind tests: reading the mind in the eyes (RMET), the diagnostic analysis of non-verbal accuracy test (DANV), the positive affect negative affect scale (PANAS) and the Yoni test.
However, although Castano and Kidd proved that literary fiction improves social empathy, at least by some measures, they were not prepared to nail their colours to the mast when it came to using the results to determine whether a piece of writing is worthy of being called literary.
"These are aesthetic and stylistic concerns which as psychologists we can't and don't want to make judgments about," said Kidd. "Neither do we argue that people should only read literary fiction; it's just that only literary fiction seems to improve Theory of Mind in the short-term. There are likely benefits of reading popular fiction – certainly entertainment. We just did not measure them."

From these additional search results, it seems that the positive impact of literary fiction on empathy is a recurring theme in psychological research. The studies suggest that literary fiction, with its complex characters and narratives, enhances the reader's ability to understand and share the feelings of others, which is a key component of empathy.

One of the articles mentions a study from the New School in New York City that found reading literary fiction improves a reader's capacity to understand others' thoughts and feelings. This aligns with the earlier search results, emphasizing that literary fiction can teach us about social behavior and the importance of understanding those who are different from ourselves.

Another article discusses how fiction can expose readers to different viewpoints and shape how they relate to others. It cites a 2013 study published in Science that demonstrated readers of literary fiction performed better on tests measuring empathy and social perception compared to those who read popular fiction or non-fiction.

Moreover, there's a mention of a study showing that reading Harry Potter can increase empathy towards stigmatized groups among children and teenagers. This suggests that literature can have a positive impact on reducing prejudice and fostering inclusivity.

It's also noted that while some studies indicate a decline in empathy among college students between the 1970s and 2000s, the exact reasons for this trend are complex and not fully understood. However, the potential of reading to counteract such declines is highlighted.

Overall, these findings underscore the importance of incorporating literary fiction into educational curricula and personal reading habits to promote empathy and social understanding. They also suggest that the benefits of reading extend beyond entertainment and can have real-world implications for how we interact with others.

Given that the research seems consistent across different studies and sources, it appears that reading literary fiction does indeed have a positive effect on empathy across various age groups. However, it's essential to consider that other factors, such as the individual's pre-existing disposition and the specific content of the literature, may also play a role in shaping empathetic responses.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly supports the idea that engaging with literary fiction can enhance our ability to empathize with others by providing insights into different perspectives and emotions. This makes literature a powerful tool for personal growth and social harmony.
