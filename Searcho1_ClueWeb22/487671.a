As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information and insights on how robots might impact people's quality of life.

Firstly, robots have the potential to enhance quality of life in various ways. In healthcare, robotic assistants can help elderly or disabled individuals with daily tasks, providing assistance and improving independence. In addition, surgical robots can perform precise operations, leading to better patient outcomes and faster recovery times.

In the workplace, robots can take over dangerous or repetitive tasks, reducing the risk of injury for human workers and allowing them to focus on more meaningful and creative work. This can lead to improved job satisfaction and overall well-being.

Moreover, robots can contribute to environmental sustainability by performing tasks that reduce energy consumption or help in cleaning up pollution. For example, robots can be used in recycling plants to sort materials more efficiently or in oceans to collect plastic waste.

However, there are also potential negative impacts to consider. The increasing use of robots may lead to job displacement in certain industries, causing economic hardship for those who lose their jobs. It's important to manage this transition through retraining programs and social support systems.

Additionally, there are concerns about privacy and security when it comes to robots that collect and process data. Ensuring that these technologies are developed ethically and with robust safeguards is crucial to maintaining public trust and safety.

In conclusion, while robots have the potential to significantly improve quality of life in many areas, it's essential to address the associated challenges to maximize the benefits and minimize any negative effects.

\boxed{\text{Yes, robots can increase people's quality of life, but it requires careful management of associated challenges.}}
