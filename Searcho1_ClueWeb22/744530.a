I've been hearing a lot about athletes experiencing heart attacks lately, and it's really concerning. I mean, these are people who are supposed to be in top physical condition, right? So why are they suddenly having heart issues? Is there something specific about their lifestyle or maybe some underlying conditions that aren't being addressed? I need to understand this better.

First off, I should probably define what I mean by "athletes." Are we talking about professional athletes, Olympians, college athletes, or even just regular people who work out a lot? I think it includes all levels of competitive sports and intense physical activity. So, from high school athletes to pros, everyone who pushes their bodies physically.

Now, heart attacks are typically associated with older adults, people with poor lifestyle choices, or those with a family history of heart disease. But athletes are generally young and healthy, so why are they experiencing heart attacks?

Maybe it's because of overexertion. Pushing the body beyond its limits could potentially stress the heart too much. I remember reading something about how extreme physical exertion can trigger heart issues in people who have undiagnosed heart conditions. So, perhaps these athletes have some underlying heart problems that only surface when they push themselves too hard during training or competitions.

Another thing that comes to mind is dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Athletes sweat a lot, and if they don't replenish their fluids and minerals properly, that could lead to heart rhythm disturbances, which might cause heart attacks. I think this is more common in endurance sports like marathons or cycling.

Also, maybe the pressure and stress of competition play a role. Mental stress can affect heart health, and professional athletes deal with enormous pressure to perform, especially during big games or events. That constant stress might take a toll on their hearts over time.

Furthermore, some athletes might be using performance-enhancing drugs, which could have harmful effects on the heart. Steroids, stimulants, and other substances can put extra strain on the heart and increase the risk of heart attacks.

It's also possible that some athletes aren't taking care of themselves outside of their sport. Maybe they have unhealthy diets, smoke, or have other bad habits that compromise their heart health despite their fitness levels.

I should look into some statistics to see how common heart attacks are among athletes compared to the general population. Maybe it's not as prevalent as it seems, and it's just that when athletes have heart issues, it gets more media attention.

Wait, maybe that's part of it—media coverage. Because athletes are public figures, any health issues they have might be reported more widely than similar incidents in non-athletes. So, it might give the impression that heart attacks are more common among athletes than they actually are.

But even so, there are documented cases of young, seemingly healthy athletes collapsing during games or practices due to heart problems. That can't be ignored.

I think it's important to distinguish between heart attacks and sudden cardiac arrest, because they're not exactly the same thing. A heart attack is usually caused by blocked arteries leading to the heart, whereas sudden cardiac arrest is often due to an electrical malfunction in the heart. Athletes might be more at risk for sudden cardiac arrest due to certain genetic conditions or structural abnormalities in the heart.

For example, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thick, making it harder for the heart to pump blood. This can lead to sudden cardiac arrest, especially during strenuous exercise. Some athletes might have this condition without knowing it, and it only becomes apparent when they're pushed to their limits.

Another condition is arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), which affects the right ventricle of the heart and can cause arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac arrest.

So, perhaps these underlying heart conditions are more common in athletes than we think, or maybe they're just more likely to experience symptoms because of their intense physical activities.

It would be helpful to know if there are pre-participation screenings for heart conditions in athletes. Do schools and sports organizations require EKGs or other heart tests before allowing athletes to compete? I think in some places they do, but maybe not everywhere.

If more widespread screening was implemented, perhaps some of these underlying conditions could be detected early on, and athletes could receive appropriate medical care to prevent heart attacks.

Additionally, maybe there needs to be more education for athletes and coaches about the signs and symptoms of heart issues, so they can recognize them early and seek medical attention promptly.

Another factor could be the use of dietary supplements or energy drinks that contain stimulants, which might increase the risk of heart problems, especially in susceptible individuals.

Moreover, the culture of pushing through pain and ignoring symptoms might discourage athletes from reporting signs of heart trouble, fearing they'll be benched or lose their spot on the team.

This is a complex issue with multiple possible causes. It's crucial to approach it from various angles—to educate, to screen, and to change the culture around athlete health.

I need to find some reliable sources to back up these thoughts and see what experts in the field are saying.

Let me try to search for some information.

Why are high-performance athletes having heart attacks?

Fabrice Muamba, a 23-year-old professional soccer player in Britain, collapsed during a game last month after suffering cardiac arrest. He's now up and walking. A 27-year-old Indian soccer player was not so lucky: He died a few days after having cardiac arrest during a match. At least six other professional soccer players around the world have died in the last three years from cardiac-related incidents. As well, not a year goes by now without news of a marathoner who died in a race because of a heart attack or cardiac arrest.
Stories such as Mr. Muamba's might shock us – a 23-year-old suffering cardiac arrest? Moreover, a professional athlete in peak physical condition? But it's not just pros who are felled by cardiac conditions; non-elite athletes who over-exert can be just as prone, and for just the same reasons. When a everyday person who looked to be in good health collapses during exercise, the reasons why are rarely a mystery.
"Most of these guys and women, mostly guys, are dying of very well-known causes," says Eric Larose, a cardiologist at the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute and a Heart and Stroke Foundation spokesperson. Many of these deaths could have be prevented if, beforehand, the victims knew their risk factors and the warning signs of an impending cardiac event.
Although deaths at marathons are certainly tragic, the incidence rate is far too low to make it practical for organizers to screen every runner who plans on participating, says Chris Woollam, medical director of the Mississauga Marathon and the Toronto Marathon. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January that looked at running events between Jan. 1, 2000, and May 31, 2010, found that of the 10.9-million runners who participated in marathons and half-marathons in the U.S., 59 suffered cardiac arrest, an incidence rate of 0.54 per 100,000 runners. Most were men, and cardiovascular disease accounted for the majority of cardiac arrests.
And there is no higher incidence of sudden death in runners compared to the general population, Dr. Larose says, adding: "Because of this, the guidelines don't suggest that we specifically screen young populations that are participating in sporting events." Which means the onus is on us to do due diligence when it comes to matters of the heart.
What should we be looking for? First, it helps to know the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest.
"A heart attack is a plumbing problem," says Dr. Chris Simpson, chief of cardiology at Queen's University. An artery leading to the heart becomes blocked, usually from cholesterol build-up, and the part of the heart muscle that is fed by that artery becomes damaged.
"Cardiac arrest is an electrical problem," Dr. Simpson says. "The natural rhythm of the heart that generates every heart beat that you have suddenly either just completely stops and becomes electrically silent, or it becomes so fast and erratic that your heart muscle essentially can't keep up with all the electrical signals and so it just quivers – literally quivers – and it can't generate any pumping output."
Sudden cardiac arrest is usually due to a handful of genetically inherited heart rhythm disorders: Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT), Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
These conditions can be difficult to diagnose, Dr. Simpson says, "but one of the things we've found recently is that if you take the whole universe of people who just dropped dead at age 23, it turns out that over half of them, in retrospect, had some warning signs."
There are, in fact, three key warning signs. One is having dizzy spells or passing out during exercise. That can be a sign that a your heart's rhythm was out of whack long enough to make you collapse but went back to normal quickly enough to let you wake up, Dr. Simpson says.
Fainting as a result of a loud noise or being startled is a second red flag. "The reasons for it aren't entirely clear, but it's a well-described phenomenon in Long QT Syndrome," Dr. Simpson says.
Third is a family history of sudden death at a young age or of drowning. Many cardiac conditions can make you pass out during exercise, which may not be fatal in a marathon, when you can stand back up after you recover. "But if you pass out in the water, you drown," Dr. Simpson says.
Even if none of these red flags are raised in your case, there still may be reasons to see a physician. If you have a family history of heart disease, fainting, chest pain or cardiac irregularities, you should book a trip to the doctor's office. That trip could result in having your blood pressure checked or having an electrocardiogram done, which can pick up some electrical problems with the heart. More specialized tests include an echocardiogram, a heart ultrasound, which can identify whether or not a person has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and can also often pick up ARVC, says Harry Rakowski, a senior staff cardiologist at the University Health Network in Toronto.
And if you're older and planning on running your first marathon, you may want to undergo a stress test, Dr. Rakowski says; people over 40 are more likely to have coronary artery disease. You'll run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike to measure your heart rate and blood pressure while you perform at increasingly more difficult levels of exercise. Or you may have a nuclear stress test that looks at blood flow to the heart.
"These tests can predict whether you have significant coronary disease about 85 per cent of the time," Dr. Rakowski says. They can also pick out some electrical problems. "They'll basically tell you whether the heart's performance during exercise is reasonable or not," he adds.
But these tests are not perfect, which is why anyone exercising needs to know warning signs of a cardiac event. If you have chest pain, feel your heart beating too fast, shortness of breath, or feel yourself become faint during exercise, then "you just have to use common sense and stop," Dr. Rakowski says. "You can't be so macho that you push yourself to exhaustion and to having a heart attack or a fatal rhythm problem."
Few people with the drive to conquer a marathon this summer will enjoy being told to stop, especially those people who think pain is a wall you just push through.
"Marathons have that extra aura about them where people will push themselves just to finish it. Everybody knows you're doing it, your friends are out there, your family's at the finishing line. I've felt it myself," Dr. Larose says. "Don't push. You just want to finish. You don't want to finish at all costs."

It remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the sudden cardiac death of athletes, typically defined as natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on mechanical life support. [1] (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The prevalence of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% of the population in the athletes' age group,[citation needed] and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is fainting or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation. [2] The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional soccer, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems.

While most causes of sudden cardiac death relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease, an exception is commotio cordis, in which the heart is structurally normal but a potentially fatal loss of rhythm occurs because of the accident of timing of a blow to the chest. Its fatality rate is about 65% even with prompt CPR and defibrillation, and more than 80% without. [4] [5]
Age 35 serves as an approximate borderline for the likely cause of sudden cardiac death. Before age 35, congenital abnormalities of the heart and blood vessels predominate. These are usually asymptomatic prior to the fatal event, although not invariably so. [6] Congenital cardiovascular deaths are reported to occur disproportionately in African-American athletes. [7]
After age 35, acquired coronary artery disease predominates (80%), [6] and this is true regardless of the athlete's former level of fitness.[citation needed]
Various performance-enhancing drugs can increase cardiac risk, though evidence has been inconclusive about their involvement in sudden cardiac deaths. [8]
Genetics[edit]
Cardiomyopathies[edit]
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, showing fatty infiltration of right and left ventricle, and poor contraction of right ventricle
Cardiomyopathies are generally inherited as autosomal dominants, although recessive forms have been described, and dilated cardiomyopathy can also be inherited in an X-linked pattern. Consequently, in addition to tragedy involving an athlete who succumbs, there are medical implications for close relatives. Among family members of index cases, more than 300 causative mutations have been identified. However, not all mutations have the same potential for severe outcomes, and there is not yet a clear understanding of how these mutations (which affect the same myosin protein molecule) can lead to the dramatically different clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). [9]
Since HCM, as an example, is typically an autosomal dominant trait, each child of an HCM parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. In individuals without a family history, the most common cause of the disease is a "de novo" mutation of the gene that produces the β-myosin heavy chain.[citation needed]
Channelopathies[edit]
Sudden cardiac death can usually be attributed to cardiovascular disease or commotio cordis, but about 20% of cases show no obvious cause and remain undiagnosed after autopsy. Interest in these "autopsy-negative" deaths has centered around the "ion channelopathies ". These electrolyte channels are pores regulating the movement of sodium, potassium and calcium ions into cardiac cells, collectively responsible for creating and controlling the electrical signals that govern the heart's rhythm. Abnormalities in this system occur in relatively rare genetic diseases such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, all associated with sudden death.  Consequently, autopsy-negative sudden cardiac deaths (no physical abnormalities identified) may comprise a larger part of the channelopathies than previously anticipated. [10] [11]
Heritable connective tissue diseases[edit]
Myxomatous degeneration of the aortic valve, common in Marfan syndrome
Heritable connective tissue diseases are rare, each disorder estimated at one to ten per 100,000, of which Marfan syndrome is the most common. It is carried by the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the connective protein fibrillin-1, [12] [13] inherited as a dominant trait. This protein is essential for synthesis and maintenance of elastic fibers. Since these fibers are particularly abundant in the aorta, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules of the eye, these areas are among the worst affected. Everyone has a pair of FBN1 genes and, because transmission is dominant, those who have inherited one affected FBN1 gene from either parent will have Marfan syndrome. Although it is most frequently inherited as an autosomal dominant, there is no family history in 25% of cases. [14]
Recruiting practices aimed at attracting athletes who are unusually tall or who have an unusually wide arm span (characteristics of Marfan syndrome) can increase the prevalence of the syndrome within sports such as basketball and volleyball. [15]
DNA testing[edit]
After a disease-causing mutation has been identified in an index case (which is not always accomplished conclusively), the main task is genetic identification of carriers within a pedigree, a sequential process known as "cascade testing". Family members with the same mutation may show different severities of disease, a phenomenon known as "variable penetrance ". As a result, some may remain asymptomatic, with little lifelong evidence of disease. Nevertheless, their children remain at risk of inheriting the disorder and potentially being more severely affected. [16]
Screening[edit]
See also: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy screening
Echocardiogram showing left ventricle
Screening athletes for cardiac disease can be problematic because of low prevalence and inconclusive performance of various tests that have been used. Nevertheless, sudden death among seemingly healthy individuals attracts much public and legislator attention because of its visible and tragic nature. [17]
As an example, the Texas Legislature appropriated US$1 million for a pilot study of statewide athlete screening in 2007. The study employed a combination of questionnaire, examination and electrocardiography for 2,506 student athletes, followed by echocardiography for 2,051 of them, including any students with abnormal findings from the first three steps. The questionnaire alone flagged 35% of the students as potentially at risk, but there were many false positive results, with actual disease being confirmed in less than 2%. Further, a substantial number of screen-positive students declined repeated recommendations for follow-up evaluation. (Individuals who are conclusively diagnosed with cardiac disease are usually told to avoid competitive sports.) It should be stressed that this was a single pilot program, but it was indicative of the problems associated with large-scale screening, and consistent with experience in other locations with low prevalence of sudden death in athletes. [18]
Incidence[edit]
Sudden cardiac death occurs in approximately one per 200,000 young athletes per year, usually triggered during competition or practice. [6] The victim is usually male and associated with soccer, basketball, ice hockey, or American football, reflecting the large number of athletes participating in these sustained and strenuous sports. [3] For a normally healthy age group, the risk appears to be particularly magnified in competitive basketball, with sudden cardiac death rates as high as one per 3,000 annually for male basketball players in NCAA Division I. [19] This is still far below the rate for the general population, estimated as one per 1,300–1,600 and dominated by the elderly. [20] However, a population as large as the United States will experience the sudden cardiac death of a competitive athlete at the average rate of one every three days, often with significant local media coverage heightening public attention. [17]
In the United States approximately 8 to 10 deaths per year can be attributed to sudden cardiac death in NCAA with overall rate of 1 per 43,000. [21] [22]

1. Introduction
The sudden cardiac death (SCD) of an athlete is always a tragedy shocking the family, the team, and the local community. Although it is a rare event, its catastrophic nature mandates the medical community to develop and implement effective preventive strategies. The most common mechanism of cardiac arrest during sports activity is abrupt ventricular fibrillation (VF) as a consequence of an underlying cardiovascular disease. The cause of SCD reflects the age of participants, with inherited and/or congenital heart diseases occurring in young competitive athletes under the age of 35 years and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease being the most common cause in older age group [1].
2. SCD in young competitive athletes
The annual incidence of SCD in young athletes is low, from 0.5 in 100,000 among high school athletes in Minnesota to 2.3 in 100,000 among young competitive athletes in Northern Italy [1]. Young athletes are at increased risk of SCD compared with their sedentary counterpart: as shown by the prospective clinico-pathologic study of the Veneto region of Italy, the incidence of fatal events among young competitive athletes is 2.8-fold higher compared with age-matched non-athletes [2]. Also, males are at a higher risk than females. The most common causes of sport-related SCD in adolescents and young adults are genetic heart muscle diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), followed by congenital anomalies of coronary arteries, myocarditis, aortic rupture in Marfan's syndrome, conduction defects, and valve diseases including aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve prolapse [3]. Sudden death during sports can also be the result of a non-penetrating blow to the chest wall, which can trigger sudden VF in the absence of any structural cardiac lesions. A sizeable proportion of sports-related SCD victims have no evidence of structural heart disease at autopsy and the cause of their cardiac arrest is most often related to primary electrical cardiac conditions, namely inherited cardiac ion-channel defects (channelopathies) including long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and Brugada syndrome. The emerging practice of post-mortem molecular genetic screening of victims of unexplained SCD offers the potential to better define the prevalence of these conditions as a cause of sports-related events in young people with an apparently normal heart [4].
3. Mortality reduction by pre-participation screening
Pre-participation evaluation allows the identification of asymptomatic athletes who have potentially lethal cardiovascular abnormalities and protect them from the risk of SCD through restriction from competitive sports [1], [5]. Both the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology consensus panel recommendations agree that cardiovascular screening for young competitive athletes is justifiable and compelling on ethical, legal, and medical grounds. Screening that relies solely on history and physical examination has limited sensitivity to identify athletes at risk because most individuals with undetected cardiovascular diseases are asymptomatic and cardiac arrest most often represents the first manifestation of the disease [6]. The addition of 12-lead ECG substantially enhances the power of screening for early detection of athletes with cardiomyopathies, channelopathies and pre-excitation syndromes, which commonly manifest with ECG abnormalities [7].
The long-running Italian experience has provided compelling evidence that pre-participation ECG screening is a life-saving strategy. The time-trend analysis of the incidence of SCD in young competitive athletes in the Veneto region of Italy over 26 years (1979–2004) demonstrated a sharp decline of mortality rates after the introduction of the nationwide ECG screening programme [8]. The annual incidence of SCD in athletes decreased by 89%, from 3.6 per 100,000 athlete-years in the pre-screening period (1979–1981) to 0.4 per 100,000 athlete-years in the late-screening period (1993–2004). By comparison, the incidence of SCD in the unscreened non-athletic population of the same age did not change significantly over that time. Of importance, most of the reduced death rate in screened athletes was due to fewer cases of SCD from cardiomyopathies (HCM and ARVC) and there was a parallel increase of the number of asymptomatic athletes diagnosed with cardiomyopathies at preparticipation screening during the same period [8]. This indicated that the mortality reduction of SCD from cardiomyopathies was a reflection of increasing identification of the affected athletes at pre-participation screening. It is noteworthy that the SCD database in the Veneto region of Italy is unique, in so far as cases are collected according to a prospective study design with systematic investigation of all young people (≤ 35 years) who die suddenly and undergo a standardised investigation of the heart by a team of cardiovascular pathologists. The heart specimens, as well as the clinical records of all SCD victims since 1979, are stored at the Registry of Cardiovascular Pathology, University of Padua, allowing retrieval and review of each case. This guarantees the reliability of the Italian data on causes and trends of SCD in young athletes, at odds with other reports that are mostly based on retrospective analysis of data from public media and insurance claims, which unavoidably led to inaccuracy from mortality underestimation [9].
A common objection to ECG screening is the concern for a high false-positive rate, leading to either unnecessary secondary evaluations or restriction from sport activity. However, it is critical to recognise that the false-positive rate for ECG screening is largely affected by the criteria used to define ‘abnormal’. Significant advances have been made in our understanding of how to interpret an athlete's ECG. Modern standards have been proposed to improve the ability to distinguish physiologic cardiac adaptations in athletes from findings suggestive of underlying pathology [10].
4. Concealed substrates of SCD
Recent autopsy studies report that the cause of SCD in athletes remains undetermined in up to 40% of cases [11], [12]. Besides inherited ion-channel diseases causing VF in the absence of structural heart abnormalities, failure to detect structural heart disease at post-mortem can be explained by the concealed or unknown nature of the pathologic substrate, that can be overlooked by a non-experienced pathologist, as well as the underestimation of the potential role of some cardiac pathology in triggering a lethal ventricular arrhythmia. Representative examples of these concealed substrates are the so-called “non-ischemic, isolated left ventricular (LV) scar” and the “arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse (MVP)”.
Recent clinical and pathologic studies have demonstrated that an isolated, non-ischemic LV scar may be associated with life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in the athlete [13], [14]. A recent post-mortem study reported a 25% prevalence of isolated, non-ischemic LV scar among the causes of juvenile SCD during exercise [13]. This substrate, which can be evidenced “in vivo” as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) at contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CE-CMR), has been shown to underlie exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias [14]. Furthermore, young athletes showing ventricular arrhythmias with a right bundle branch block pattern (suggesting a LV origin) and isolated, non-ischemic LV LGE at CE-CMR may experience malignant arrhythmic events including SCD (Fig. 1) [14]. The diagnostic power of routine cardiovascular tests for this condition is limited because ECG changes and echocardiographic LV systolic dysfunction, either regional or global, are found in a minority of affected patients. The segmental nature of myocardial fibrosis confined to small myocardial area and involving outer wall layers (without reaching the subendocardium which is the part of the LV that contributes the most to myocardial thickening) explain why the scar is usually undetectable by echocardiography. The difficulty to identify affected athletes by pre-participation screening makes this condition one of most challenging and unpredictable causes of SCD during sports, as shown by the fatal event of the Italian professional soccer player Pier Mario Morosini in 2012 [15].

Mitral valve prolapse has been largely underestimated as a cardiac pathology responsible of SCD in the athlete by general and forensic pathologists. This may be explained by the traditional perspective that MVP is a common valve variant with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 2–3%. Hence, it is deemed to be an uncertain or unlikely cause of SCD at postmortem investigation. Although it is generally regarded as a benign condition, malignant ventricular arrhythmias and SCD have been reported; the incidence of SCD in MVP has been estimated to range from 0.2%/year to 0.4%/year in prospective follow-up studies [16]. Using rigorous criteria for morphologic diagnosis (i.e., myxomatous mitral valve) at postmortem, MVP has been implicated in 7% of all cases of juvenile SCD in the Registry of the Veneto region of Italy. Recent clinico-pathologic studies on MVP patients with arrhythmias or SCD victims provided new insights into our understanding of the underlying myocardial substrate [17], [18]. Revision of the histologic features in SCD victims demonstrated the presence of myocardial fibrosis affecting both the infero-basal LV free wall (under the posterior leaflet) and the papillary muscle [17]. The scarring process may be caused by the mechanical stretch of the inferobasal wall and papillary muscles secondary to the excessive mobility of the valve leaflets due to by posterior systolic curling, eventually leading to myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis [18]. Most important, the presence and location of myocardial fibrosis observed at histology in SCD victims were confirmed in living patients with MVP and ventricular arrhythmias by demonstration of LGE at CE-CMR. This suggests a promising role of CE-CMR for arrhythmic risk stratification beyond traditional electrophysiological markers. The athlete with at-risk arrhythmic MVP can be identified at pre-participation screening based on the following characteristics: a young adult (most often woman) with a mid-systolic click at auscultation, T-wave abnormalities on inferior leads and complex ventricular arrhythmias with a right bundle branch block morphology on ECG, and bi-leaflet involvement of the mitral valve on echocardiography [17]. These clinical features may help to select a high-risk subgroup of patients which are candidates for further evaluation by CE-CMR.
5. SCD in older athletes
The risk of sports-related acute cardiovascular events, including SCD, increases exponentially among individuals aged >35 years and is almost exclusively related to the development and progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease [3]. Whereas ECG screening has been proven to be lifesaving in young competitive athletes in whom SCD is mostly caused by ECG-detectable genetic cardiomyopathies, it appears to be non accurate for identification of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic middle aged/senior athletes [1]. Because of its established prognostic value, widespread availability and low cost, exercise testing is widely deemed the best available test for screening asymptomatic adults prior to an exercise programme [19]. However, the test accuracy for detection of coronary artery disease is limited among the general population because of the relatively low disease's prevalence. The test performance increases with a greater pre-test probability of coronary atherosclerosis, i.e. in subjects with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. According to current recommendations for preparticipation cardiovascular evaluation in adults, the assessment of risk is based on age, sex, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and smoking history, using available scoring systems such as the ESC Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) [19]. Maximal exercise testing (and possibly further cardiologic evaluations) is reserved to those individuals embarking in moderate/intense physical activity who show an increased risk for coronary events.
6. Conclusions
The available evidence indicates that ECG screening has to be considered an efficient health strategy for prevention of SCD of young competitive athletes. The development of modern criteria for interpretation of athlete's ECG is expected to improve the accuracy of screening athletes for cardiovascular disease, with a lower proportion of false-positive results, and lead to a considerable cost savings in the context of a preparticipation screening process. On the other hand, no screening strategy will identify all athletes at risk of SCD, particularly those affected by cardiac conditions such as congenital anomalies of coronary arteries or atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, who usually have no abnormalities on 12-lead ECG. Moreover, cardiac arrest due to blunt chest trauma (commotio cordis) cannot be prevented by screening. Such screening limitations justify the increasing efforts for implementing cardiopulmonary resuscitation intervention programmes including early external defibrillation by automated external defibrillator for treating unpredictable arrhythmic cardiac arrest events in the athletic field [20].

Athletes and Heart Disease
As many athletes lead a healthy lifestyle, there is often an assumption that athletes and physically active people are not at risk for heart disease.  However, athletes can be impacted by heart disease or suffer from heart-related health conditions at any point in their life.
While athletes are generally considered healthy, they are not completely “safe” from developing heart disease, having a heart attack or even dying from a heart condition.
Heart Conditions That Can Impact Athletes
There are several heart-related health problems that an athlete or active person could be affected by. Some of the more common health conditions potentially impacting athletes include:
Congenital heart disease – Also known as congenital heart defects, these involve abnormalities in the heart structure that are present at birth. Roughly one-quarter of the population has a “hole” in their heart, which might not cause any symptoms at all, or could lead to serious health complications later in life.
Inherited heart conditions – Coronary artery disease, which can run in families, may lead to a heart attack, stroke or heart failure. Certain cardiac disorders, including arrhythmia and high cholesterol, can be inherited.
Arrhythmia – Arrhythmia refers to an abnormal beating of the heart, whether it beats too fast, too slow or irregularly. Arrhythmia could potentially lead to other heart problems and impact people of all ages, including newborns, young people, adults in middle age and the elderly.
Hypertension – Hypertension is considered the most common cardiovascular disease among athletes and people who are physically active. Hypertension typically begins in early adulthood and becomes more prevalent with age.
These are just some the heart conditions that athletes could develop or be impacted by. While a healthy diet and physical activity can reduce one’s risk of heart disease, an athlete could still be at risk due to age, family history or other factors. Learn more about arrhythmias and electrophysiology.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) in Athletes
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) occurs when electrical problems in the heart cause an extremely rapid heart rate, which interrupts blood flow and prevents the heart from pumping blood to vital organs. If not treated right away, SCA can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a matter of minutes.
Among young athletes, sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death. Young athletes, including high school and college students, are more than twice as likely to experience SCD than young non-athletes.
Key facts about sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes:
The average age for SCD in young athletes is 17.5 years old
Ninety percent of SCD victims are male
More than two-thirds of young athletes who die suddenly are basketball or football players
While SCA can occur without warning, signs can include fainting during physical activity, a family history of SCD, shortness of breath, or chest pain.
Specialized Treatment for Athletes with Heart Disease
Dr. Vijay Subbarao, cardiologist at Denver Heart and Rose Medical Center, specializes in treating athletes and high-level physical activity patients with heart disease. As a provider for the Colorado Rapids MLS team, Denver Heart is a leader in treating athletes with heart conditions or heart-related health problems.
For athletes, heart-health screenings, prevention and regular checkups are imperative for keeping the heart healthy and diagnosing heart disease as soon as possible. Cardiologists at Denver Heart strong encourage athletes at risk for a heart condition to consult with a cardiac specialist, who could save your life or help stop heart disease before it starts.

The sudden death of a young, apparently healthy athlete is a great tragedy. The odds that any given athlete will die suddenly are very small. Estimates range from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 300,000 over 10 years. However, each sudden death that does occur is devastating to family, friends, and the community.
The large majority of these sudden deaths are related to underlying cardiac conditions that were undiagnosed beforehand. The sudden death is usually a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia called ventricular fibrillation. This is a heart rhythm disturbance where the heart quivers rather than contracts, which stops the heart from pumping blood. In most cases with young athletes, intense exercise triggers life-threatening arrhythmia.
This article discusses cardiac conditions that can cause sudden cardiac death in young athletes. It also looks at what symptoms to watch for and how screening can help.

Cardiac Conditions That Increase the Risk
The age that seems to divide "young" athletes from "non-young" athletes is 35 years. Above 35 years of age, sudden death in athletes is usually caused by coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis .
Below 35 years of age, sudden death in athletes is commonly related to congenital or genetic heart conditions. Some cases can also be caused by infections or inflammatory disease. 1
The cardiac conditions that may increase the risk for sudden death fall into two general categories. Structural heart disease is when the heart is structurally, or anatomically, abnormal. With non-structural heart disease, the heart has "electrical" abnormalities causing abnormal heart rhythms.
Structural Heart Disease
Here is a list of structural heart diseases that can increase the risk for sudden death in young athletes: 1
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Congenital abnormalities of the coronary arteries
Mitral valve prolapse
Myocarditis
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
Marfan syndrome
Congenital heart disease
Non-Structural Health Disease
The following non-structural heart diseases are shown to increase the risk of sudden cardiac death in young athletes:
Long QT syndrome
Brugada syndrome
Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)
In the United States, the most common causes are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital abnormalities in the coronary arteries. Myocarditis contributes to a smaller, but still significant amount of deaths.
The common causes of sudden cardiac death are different for various locations. For instance, in Northern Italy, the most common cause of sudden death in young athletes is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (22%), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy only accounts for 2%. 2
In general, for most of these conditions, the risk of sudden death is highest during physical activity that requires:
Bursts of extreme exertion, such as sprinting, football, soccer, basketball, and tennis
Intensive training programs
Exercise in extreme conditions of heat, humidity, and/or altitude
Exercise recommendations from physicians may limit certain activities depending on the condition involved.
Recap
For athletes younger than 35, sudden cardiac death can be caused by structural or non-structural heart disease. Intense activity or hot weather can increase the risk of a cardiac event for those with heart conditions.
Symptoms of Cardiac Conditions
Some cases of sudden cardiac death can happen without warning. In other cases, symptoms and signs may be apparent in the weeks and months before, especially during exercise.
Some signs of cardiac distress include:
Dizziness or fainting
Chest discomfort or pain
Heart palpitations, which feel like your heart is fluttering, skipping a beat, or beating too fast
Unexplained fatigue with usual exercise
Shortness of breath
See your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms or warning signs.
Screening Young Athletes
Cardiac screenings can help to identify "silent" cardiac abnormalities that are potentially deadly. The American Heart Association recommends that athletes provide medical history and have a physical examination before participating in sports.
However, standard physical exams have been found to miss some of the conditions that cause sudden cardiac death. In a study of 115 cases of sudden cardiac death, only one was correctly identified through a physical examination and medical history.
Some diagnoses may be missed when the athletes don't have any symptoms. Research shows that 60% to 80% of athletes who had sudden cardiac death did not have any symptoms or warning signs.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) can help detect some silent cardiac conditions more than just a physical exam alone. Research shows that ECG is about five times more sensitive than medical history questions and 10 times more sensitive than a physical examination. It also has a lower false-positive rate than medical history and physical exam.
The AHA hasn't recommended mandatory ECG screening programs for young athletes. However, it does encourage athletes to attend local ECG screening programs that are well-organized and have adequate resources. That should include participation from medical professionals, including pediatric cardiology specialists.
If your physician finds abnormalities during your examination or ECG screening, you'll be referred to a cardiologist for further testing.
Recap
The American Heart Association recommends that young athletes provide a medical history and have a physical examination before participating in sports. Research shows that electrocardiograms (ECG) can detect silent cardiac conditions more than just a physical exam alone.
Summary
Sudden cardiac death in young athletes can be caused by a number of different conditions, including both structural and non-structural heart disease. Sometimes, symptoms may be present beforehand, but most of the time it can happen without warning. Cardiac screenings can help to identify abnormalities. Research shows that ECG can help detect some cases that wouldn't be found by physical exam alone.
A Word From Verywell
Exercise has clear benefits for your overall health. The risk of sudden cardiac death is rare, but it's important to be aware of symptoms and get regular check-ups with your doctor.
Talk with your doctor about your personal and family history of cardiac disease. If you experience any symptoms, like dizziness or chest pain, stop exercising and contact your doctor.

Alright, I've read through these articles, and I'm trying to make sense of why so many athletes are having heart attacks. It's really concerning because athletes are usually seen as the picture of health. But clearly, there are underlying issues here that need to be addressed.

First off, I need to clarify that when we talk about "heart attacks" in athletes, we're actually often referring to sudden cardiac death (SCD), which can be caused by various heart conditions, not just traditional heart attacks like those caused by blocked arteries in older adults.

From the articles, it seems that SCD in young athletes is usually due to underlying heart conditions that weren't detected before. These conditions can be genetic or congenital, meaning some people are born with them. It's sad because these athletes might not have any symptoms until the tragic event happens.

One of the main causes mentioned is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. This can obstruct blood flow and lead to dangerous heart rhythms. Another condition is arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), which affects the right ventricle of the heart and can cause arrhythmias leading to SCD.

There are also congenital abnormalities in the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. If these arteries are positioned abnormally, it can lead to reduced blood flow during exercise, potentially causing a heart attack.

Marfan syndrome is another condition that can be fatal in athletes. It's a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue, including the heart valves and aorta. If the aorta ruptures, it's often fatal.

Moreover, some athletes might have inherited electrical abnormalities in the heart, known as channelopathies, such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). These can cause sudden arrhythmias, especially during exercise.

It's important to note that SCD in athletes is still rare, but it gets a lot of media attention because it's so shocking when it happens. The articles mention that in the U.S., the incidence is about 1 in 200,000 to 300,000 athletes per year. So, while it's rare, it's still something that needs to be taken seriously.

Now, regarding screening. There's a debate about whether all athletes should undergo extensive heart screenings before participating in sports. The American Heart Association recommends a medical history and physical examination, but not necessarily an electrocardiogram (ECG) for all athletes.

However, some experts argue that adding an ECG to the pre-participation screening can help identify more athletes with potential heart problems. The Italian experience seems to support this, as their national ECG screening program has reportedly reduced the incidence of SCD in athletes.

But there are drawbacks to universal ECG screening. It can lead to false positives, where athletes are flagged as having a problem when they don't, causing unnecessary anxiety and further testing. Also, ECGs aren't perfect and can miss some conditions.

So, it's a balancing act. We need to find a way to identify athletes at risk without overwhelming the healthcare system or causing unnecessary worry for many.

Another point is that some heart conditions may not show up on an ECG or physical exam, especially if the athlete isn't experiencing any symptoms. This makes early detection even more challenging.

It's also worth mentioning that intense physical exertion can sometimes trigger heart issues in athletes with underlying conditions. So, while exercise is generally beneficial, it might pose risks for those with undiagnosed heart problems.

Furthermore, there's a cultural aspect where athletes are encouraged to push through pain and ignore symptoms, which might prevent them from seeking medical attention when they should.

In conclusion, SCD in athletes is a complex issue with no easy solutions. It involves a combination of genetic predispositions, lack of screening, and cultural pressures. It's crucial for athletes, coaches, and parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms and to encourage open communication about health concerns.

I think the key takeaway is that while exercise is essential for health, it's also important to ensure that athletes are medically cleared to participate in their sports, especially if they have a family history of heart disease or if they experience any concerning symptoms like fainting, chest pain, or irregular heartbeats during exercise.

Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach that includes education, appropriate screening, and access to medical care can help reduce the risk of SCD in athletes.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Underlying heart conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, congenital abnormalities of the coronary arteries, and genetic electrical disorders, are the primary causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. These conditions can remain undetected until strenuous physical activity triggers a fatal arrhythmia. While pre-participation screening, including electrocardiograms, can help identify at-risk athletes, the rarity of these events and the potential for false positives make universal screening controversial. Education about symptoms and promoting a culture where athletes feel comfortable reporting health issues are also crucial components in preventing such tragedies.}} \]
