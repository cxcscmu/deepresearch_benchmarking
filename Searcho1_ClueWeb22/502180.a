So I've got this question: "Should students be rewarded for good grades?" Hmm, that's an interesting topic. I need to think about this carefully because there are probably different perspectives on this issue. Let me start by understanding what it means to reward students for good grades.

First off, rewarding students could mean giving them some kind of incentive or benefit when they achieve good grades, like getting good marks on exams or in their coursework. These rewards could be tangible things like prizes, money, or gifts, or they could be intangible things like praise, recognition, or extra privileges.

I think it's important to consider why we might want to reward students for good grades in the first place. One possible reason is to motivate them to study harder and perform better academically. If students know that there are rewards for doing well, they might be more inclined to put in the effort required to achieve those good grades.

On the other hand, some people might argue that students should be intrinsically motivated to learn and that external rewards could actually undermine that intrinsic motivation. According to self-determination theory, for example, external rewards might make students focus more on the reward itself rather than the learning process, which could lead to a decrease in their intrinsic interest in the subject matter.

Let me think about that. Is there any research or evidence that supports the idea that rewards can negatively affect motivation? Maybe I should look into some studies on this topic.

Do Rewards Motivate Students to Work Harder?
Kristine Tucker - Updated September 26, 2017
Classroom rewards might motivate students to work harder, but it's often for the wrong reasons. Students benefit the most from their schoolwork when they feel proud of their accomplishments and have an internal drive that motivates them to succeed. Rewards are enjoyable, but students learn to find satisfaction in the prizes more than their personal achievements.
Stifles Creativity
Psychology professor Beth Hennessey says extrinsic rewards, such as paying kids for good grades or promising a computer at the end of the semester, can have negative results, according to the Learning Matters website. Students who are currently motivated to do well in school because they have a sense of pride when it comes to accomplishing goals or they feel a high level of self-esteem when they complete difficult assignments, often lose their creativity and excitement with extrinsic rewards. Giving kids candy rewards and other unhealthy foods often has the same negative effect with the added disadvantages of sugar highs and extra calories.
Internal Satisfaction
When teachers offer bonuses that make students feel self-assured and internally pleased with their work, it leads to a productive classroom. Intrinsic rewards motivate students to work harder because they are interested in the subject matter or assignments -- not tangible prizes. Intrinsically motivated students find their studies more enjoyable, their learning is deeper and it lasts longer, says Hennessey. For example, a teacher might reward students by allowing them to do research on classroom computers or go to the library for reading time. Teachers might incorporate fun educational games or healthy recreational parties to encourage exercise and socialization and reward hard work.
Entitlement
Students might work harder for rewards, but this style of classroom management often leads to students feeling like they are owed something for their efforts. When you offer rewards in return for good behavior or high grades, you create a sense of entitlement, according to the Smart Classroom Management website. The goal is to help students want to succeed without the promise of benefits or rewards. You don't want to create a reward system that compensates students for what they should already be doing on their own.
Motivates Struggling Learners
Extrinsic rewards might help students who have lost interest in school and don't have much to lose. When you have a student who frequently fails assignments, turns in incomplete work or shows up late for class, tangible rewards might give him a reason to try harder. Unfortunately, it's difficult to reward struggling students with tangible prizes without also rewarding productive students. Consider rewarding a struggling student during after-school tutoring sessions, so his classmates don't think you're playing favorites or showing partiality. Rewards might include pencils, gadgets, small toys or healthy snacks.

Rewarding students: should we? If so, how? – Improving Teaching
Behavioural psychology
Rewarding students: should we? If so, how?
Date: May 19, 2019Author: Harry Fletcher-Wood5 Comments
I’ve always mistrusted rewards for students.  Students should be doing things for their own sake – turning up, learning, being nice – and I understood extrinsic rewards to undermine their intrinsic motivation to do so.  Consequently, I feel uncomfortable about the reward systems found in most schools: merits, house points, or attendance awards (84% of secondary schools reward attendance).  However, there is evidence that rewards can encourage sustained behaviour change: one review describes them as a ‘central component’ of habit formation (Wood and Neal, 2016, p.73).  In this post I review the evidence for and against rewards, when and why they can be effective, and my misgivings.  I’d welcome your thoughts on how you’ve seen reward systems succeed or fail.
Rewards can help people change.  One study offered students $175 either to:
Visit the gym eight times in a month
Visit the gym once
Complete an unrelated activity
Students offered money for visiting repeatedly did – unsurprisingly – more importantly, they continued going afterwards, losing weight and reducing their Body Mass Index.  Each group was equally enthusiastic about exercise, but multiple visits initiated a new habit: “monetary compensation for a sufficient number of occurrences… appears to move some people past the ‘threshold’ needed to engage in an activity (Charness and Gneezy, 2009, p.911).”  This study encouraged me to examine rewards in education; these have had mixed effects (reviewed by Fryer, 2016):
Paying seven-year-olds to read books increased reading achievement for native English speakers, but decreased it for students speaking English as a second language
Paying ten-year-olds to complete maths homework increased maths achievement but decreased reading achievement
Paying secondary school students for interim test results and for effort had limited or no effect on outcomes
Educational Maintenance Allowance – paying poorer students up to £40 per week for attendance – increased participation in education by over 6 percentage points by Year 13 (particularly for boys; Middleton et al., 2003) and led to higher A level results (Chowdry, Dearden and Emmerson, 2007)
These mixed results suggest that rewards can change behaviour and increase attainment, but their design is crucial.  Three features affect the impact rewards have:
Specificity
We encourage habits by rewarding specific behaviours, not general achievement.  Rewards which are “too broad to promote specific habits” are “less successful at habit formation”:
Overly general rewards include symbolic trophies, prizes that recognize strong performance, or temporal landmarks such as birthdays or the kickoff of a new calendar year. Only rewards that promote the repetition of specific actions contribute to habit formation (Wood and Neal, 2016, p.75).”
In education, rewards for inputs (like doing homework) lead to better results than rewards for outputs (like exam results); one study found rewards improved performance in maths but not in other subjects, possibly because it was clearer to students how to improve (Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel, 2011).  The most pertinent test of specific rewards in England offered GCSE students money, or a trip, for meeting weekly thresholds for attendance, behaviour, homework and classwork: on average, this had no effect, but it helped in maths, particularly for lower-attaining pupils (Sibieta, Greaves and Sianesi, 2014).  The evidence is suggestive rather than conclusive, but it aligns with advice on using praise: “the more actionable the thing you reinforce, the more students can replicate their success (Lemov, 2015, p.435).”  Specific rewards rely on specific goals, and on identifying the activities which matter most: rewarding every desirable action would be expensive, time-consuming and would no longer encourage the most important.  So, while we can acknowledge and welcome any desirable behaviour, rewards should focus on behaviours which are crucial and can be identified reliably.  If what matters most in Year 7 is building study habits and learning critical ideas, we could reward regular practice (through online tests, for example), acknowledging other desirable behaviour without rewarding it.
Predictability
Rewards which are less predictable may be more effective: “habits form best when rewards are powerful enough to motivate behavior but are uncertain in the sense that they do not always occur (Wood and Neal, 2016, p.75).”  Students become desensitised to predictable rewards: they come to see a merit as an entitlement, expecting it irrespective of their effort, or demanding something more for additional effort.  Intermittent rewards remain effective; they encourage people to focus on what they hope will happen and “powerfully motivate repetition and habit formation”:
Slot machines are a good example of uncertain rewards. People keep paying money into the machines because sometimes they win, sometimes they don’t… E-mail and social networking sites have similar effects: people keep checking on them because sometimes they are rewarded with interesting communications, but other times they get only junk. The key is that rewards are received probabilistically, meaning not for every behaviour (Wood and Neal, 2016, p.75).”
Rewards may be even more effective if they are eye-catching: offering a chance to win one big prize may be more motivating than offering small prizes to everyone, as people tend to overestimate the probability they will win; a lottery offering a £5000 prize increased electoral registration by 4.2% (Service et al., 2014).  We may offer students a predictable reward to start a habit (as in the gym attendance experiment), then offer surprise rewards to maintain the habit after a few weeks (more on how long it takes to form a habit here ).*
Signalling
The signal students receive must match the signal we wish to send by offering a reward:
Intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation: Rewards may signal that an activity is unattractive, difficult or beyond students’ capacity; this may diminish their efforts after the reward is withdrawn, or encourage them to pursue the reward itself, not the learning it is designed to catalyse (Gneezy, Meyer and Rey-Biel, 2011).  This may explain why people often stop pursuing a behaviour once a reward is withdrawn (Mantzari et al., 2015).  Equally, some important things may never be intrinsically motivating and both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation have a role (Ryan and Deci, 2000).  We may promote intrinsic reward by helping students find value and satisfaction in an activity (Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel, 2011; Wood and Neal, 2016), or offer indirect rewards (as attempted by a study which offered students access to tempting audiobooks while they were at the gym; Milkman, Minson and Volpp, 2014), while balancing these approaches with more explicit rewards where these are insufficient.
Giving up: As a tutor, I found Educational Maintenance Allowance motivated students to attend.  It was paid for a full week’s attendance however: some students who were late on Monday made a point of being late for the rest of the week: “I’ve lost my EMA, there’s no point.”  We may adapt rewards if we notice such effects: paying EMA per day, rather than per week, for example, would have ensured each day mattered.
Crowding out: Rewarding one activity may reduce students’ motivation to pursue another: this may explain why students paid to do maths homework performed worse in reading (Fryer, 2012).  Recognising this encourages us to reward the actions which matter most and accept the consequences this may have for other desirable activities.
Diverging effects: Rewards affect individuals differently.  In education, girls and higher-attaining students tend to benefit more (Gneezy, Meier and Rey-Biel, 2011), but the English experiment described above found the opposite effect (Sibieta, Greaves and Sianesi, 2014).  Again, this comes with a risk: the successful gym attendance study actually diminished attendance slightly among those who were previously attending regularly – even though the overall effect was positive (Charness and Gneezy, 2009).  If we see rewards working for some students, we may wish to alter them to work for all students, changing the thresholds to achieve them, or focusing on personal bests.
Conclusion
“We have a reward system because for a few students, it really works,” one school principal told me.  In an ideal world, I’d do without; where we can help students value learning, attendance and kindness for its own sake, we should avoid diminishing this through extrinsic rewards.  The evidence beyond this seems inconsistent, but I think this is because the design of reward systems (and studies) is inconsistent too.  Under the right circumstances, targeting the right things, designed in the right way, rewards can have a positive influence.  However, I’m not convinced the average school reward system meets these criteria: most are too general, too vague and too predictable; often, the result is straight bribes: “Ten Vivos if you work all lesson.”  Specific, unpredictable and carefully-modified rewards may offer better prospects: if this helps students do better, maybe we should pursue it further.  I would welcome comments which would persuade me either way.

Using reward systems to motivate students
Lucie Renard — Jan 25, 2017
Motivating your students to learn and to participate can be very hard. Some teachers have their hands full with class management and they don’t even get to teaching.
In order to stimulate learning and to motivate good behavior, lots of teachers use rewards for students.
In this post I’ll start with the advantages of reward systems and why you should use one. But watch out. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows. Some teachers and educators aren’t a big fan of constantly rewarding your students. Reward systems also have their disadvantages.
I’ll also show you some fun and creative reward systems you can use and 10 reasonable rewards to give your students. On top of that I’ll show you how to put in work a good reward system.
Let’s dig in!
Advantages of a reward system
1. Appropriate behavior
Students conform to appropriate behaviors when rewarded either intrinsically or extrinsically.
2. Increased motivation
Students will show interest and raise their participation in the everyday classroom tasks, responsibilities and learning.
3. Joyful students
Incentives for students motivate them to be more productive because they create a feeling of pride and achievement. Being successful makes you happy.
4. Boosted self-esteem
Every success story helps students become more self-confident. They are proud and also encouraged to achieve another successful result.
5. Completed homework
The National Association of School Psychologists suggests that reward systems help motivate students to complete their homework. It’s rather shocking that without rewards, students don’t complete it.
6. Improved results
Rewarding students encourages and endorses school effort. They lead to improved outcomes for students.
Disadvantages of a reward system
Before you jump into the reward systems, you should also know the disadvantages.
1. Addiction
Students can become addicted to classroom rewards. This means that they won’t study anymore without them.
2. Devaluation
After a while rewards are no surprises anymore and they come as expected. They will lose their effect. Watch Dan Pink’s excellent TED talk on motivation for more details on how reward systems can utterly fail.
3. Race against the clock
Students focus more on finishing an assignment to win a classroom price, instead of learning what the lesson is meant to teach. Finishing it is more important than to actually understand it.
4. Control and manipulate
Students might feel they are manipulated and controlled by you. This also teaches the student how to manipulate.
5. Increased pressure
The more you praise students, the greater the fall if they can’t live up to that praise and to your expectations.
6. Bribes
The line between bribes and rewards is very thin. Rewards can lead to the idea of controlling your students. You’ll feel more powerful and use rewards as bribes.
Creative reward systems
On my search for creative classroom reward systems, I came across an interesting Pinterest board: “ Classroom Reward System ”.
I picked out a few of my favorite reward systems to show you. Most of them are for elementary school.  Click on the images to open them!

You can also create your own achievement or reward certificates by using the Canva certificate maker. Canva has many certificate templates available as well. You’ll be surprised how much your students value a simple (but beautiful) piece of paper!
10 Reasonable rewards
When you choose a reward for your students or when you let them choose, make sure you are controlling it. Give them a list to choose from, or add a value to each reward. That way, students have to save their tickets, cards, etc., in order to choose a good reward.
Here are a few reward examples:
Pick a game at recess
Sit with a friend
Teach the class a favorite game
Take a homework pass
Be the teacher’s helper for the day
Draw on the chalkboard
Choose any class job for the week
Use the teacher’s chair
Take home a class game for a night
Do half of an assignment
These are just a few suggestions. Here ’s a list with more fun rewards!
Online reward system for primary school
When it comes to class management in primary school you must have already heard of ClassDojo. If not, don’t worry, I’ll explain it to you.
ClassDojo is a free digital reward system in which every student gets evaluated on positive and negative behavior. Not only the teacher has access to ClassDojo, also the students and their parents can access the platform by entering a unique code.
As a teacher, you set up some “behavior tags”. A behavior tag consists of a description and an icon. You can add icons with a description of your own. Choose a description for the positive behavior tags and a description for the negative behavior tags.
Positive behavior gets the value “+1” and negative behavior gets “-1”. The teacher assigns the positive and negative behavior icons to the students.
When the class or week ends, you can take a look at the overview of the behavior icons you assigned to your class. You can check out the student individually or the whole class. You can also add a comment for the student’s parents.
With ClassDojo students can keep their own digital portfolio. Students can add pictures and videos of work to their Story, and share it with their parents.
The fun thing about ClassDojo are their little monsters. Every student is a different monster. It’s very visual and funny!
Online reward system for middle school and high school
Of course, you need to be able to manage older students as well. They won’t be eager to behave better because they get a badge or a treat. They need something else. You’ll need Classcraft.
I’ve recently discovered this amazing class management game! This is probably the most awesome game and class management solution I’ve ever seen. I’m a total fan of the fantasy world, so why not just use your imagination in the classroom?
Classcraft engages students to live by your class rules in an interactive way.
Students can create their own avatars that have special powers. They play in groups. If someone ignores a deadline, it may fire back on the whole group. Working together and having respect for each other is very important.
Students can gain different points by playing by the classroom rules. For example: students who help other students receive a certain amount of points. When they have enough points, they can use a power like: the “warrior” can eat in class”. They can also lose those points by not playing by the rules. If they lose all their points they get a sentence like: bring a treat for the whole class or hand in an assignment a day early.
You can choose every power and sentence. Classcraft also has a timer and a stopwatch available, as well as a quiz tool where the avatars have to battle a “boss”. In order to beat the boss, they have to get the answers right.
How to put a reward system to work
School reward systems can help, but you can’t just try out something without clearly thinking it through. Here’s how you best put a reward system to work.
1. Set class goals
Set class behavior goals that are achievable and measurable. For example: when you raise your hand, all the students stop talking within 20 seconds. Let your students participate in setting up those goals. It will motivate them more to abide by the rules.
2. Define how you will use the reward system
This is the key to success. When are students receiving rewards? What are your boundaries? Make your intentions clear. For example: students will receive a reward when they help another student, they finish homework a day early, when they participate in class.
3. Explain why you gave a reward
Give your students specific, genuine feedback attached to the reward. For example: “John, you showed respect by letting Marc in before you”.
4. Give students a voice
Like I’ve said before, it’s important to let your students participate in choosing rewards. To be sure that rewards are valuable and motivating for the students, you can have a brainstorm about it. Let them put together a list of acceptable rewards. You still have the final word!
5. Reward early
Just like giving feedback, rewards must be given shortly after the shown behavior. In that case, students won’t forget what they did to deserve it and other students won’t get suspicious.
6. Lessen the rewards over time
Raise your expectations for the student’s behavior in order to receive the same reward. Students shouldn’t get addicted to rewards. They have to work because of an intrinsic motivation. As students achieve success in your class, they can learn to be motivated by their own achievements.
7. Give random rewards
Rewarding students randomly for their behavior and achievements keeps them on their toes. They’ll want to be on task just in case!
I’ve shown you some reward systems, but there are still many more out there, on the internet. Take a look at this website. I’m sure you’ll find some inspiration here.

4 Student Rewards That Encourage Intrinsic Motivation – And Don’t Cost a Thing
Monday, August 21, 2017
Positive recognition is essential in establishing a harmonious and productive classroom culture. And, rewards for positive behavior don’t have to be anything fancy (or expensive). Avoid being the teacher who relies on candy for everything with these ideas for student-centered rewards that only require the investment of a little time.
Individual sharing
Underneath any shyness or indifference they might show, kids really do enjoy sharing their passions with their friends. Invest some class time in rewarding performance or behavior by giving students the floor for a special show-and-tell or a presentation designed to introduce classmates to more esoteric hobbies they enjoy with which others may not be familiar. Even just the ability to share an online video of their choosing (previewed by you, of course) can work. Five minutes of a cat video on YouTube can pay big dividends in piquing other students’ interest in self-expression.
Creature comforts
Every child wants more freedom. Regimented classroom norms are important, so students appreciate when they are allowed to deviate from them. This can be as simple as allowing students to sit on the floor during group or individual work, offering the option to take their shoes off or listen to music while they work, or (for elementary classes) the occasional pajama day. Depending on your level of trust and the clearances you’ve obtained, you can also allow chosen students to work in other areas of the school, like the library or a lab.
Positive feedback
When I was in the classroom, one of my favorite rewards was to send a surprise positive text to a parent when warranted. The parent always appreciated it, and the student would come in the next day telling anyone who would listen about what happened when they got home the previous day. It got to the point where students would try to negotiate the sending of such a text to coincide with when they would be asking their parents for a new phone, a raise in allowance, or a release from grounding.
Believe it or not, most students even appreciate positive feedback from school administrators. See if you can get your principal to stop by to offer some quick encouragement and reinforcement. Again, the principal will probably be as pleasantly surprised as the student(s).
Choice
Educators are increasingly recognizing the value of incorporating as much choice into the curriculum as possible, but you may want to consider holding some decision-making power back to use as rewards. Frame such a system as students who have demonstrated the right amount of maturity can be trusted to choose their own assignment/book/project or other relevant option. Of course, you can also reward students with the ability to simply choose with whom or where they sit.

Using New Research to Improve Student Motivation
September 25, 2015|By Sarah McKay|
Teachers know that motivation matters. It is central to student learning; it helps determine how engaged students are in their work, how hard they work, and how well they persevere in the face of challenges. Though we hear mostly about the “achievement gap” between demographic groups, researchers have also identified an “engagement gap,” which the High School Survey of Student Engagement calls “both more pernicious and potentially more addressable.”
Despite its obvious importance, student motivation is not a focus of today’s education system. Motivation is hard to characterize and quantify, and it is influenced by many factors outside the classroom. Partly because of these challenges, many teachers feel they can do little to improve motivation. But a growing body of research shows that they can: teachers can employ a number of strategies that have been proven to enhance students’ engagement in learning.
In a recent  Carnegie report, “ Motivation Matters: How New Research Can Help Teachers Boost Student Engagement ,” Susan Headden and Sarah McKay look at the new psychological and behavioral research focused on building motivation—how students respond to incentives to learn, how they see themselves as learners, and what they consider to be their place in school. As the report shows, educators can fortify the non-instructional side of student success in three essential ways: encouraging positive behaviors by offering rewards and emphasizing the value of students’ work, improving their academic mindsets, and enhancing their sense of connectedness with their teachers and their peers.
Teachers can employ a number of strategies that have been proven to enhance students’ engagement.
Rewards and Value
Teachers have long offered incentives for directing student behavior. Gold stars, detentions, grades—all can light fires under students. But research shows that these sorts of extrinsic rewards can also undermine students’ intrinsic motivation for learning. For example, in an oft-cited 1973 study, preschoolers were promised and received a reward for drawing. The children later chose to spend less of their free time drawing than they had prior to receiving the reward. The findings don’t mean, however, that incentives have a universally negative effect on intrinsic motivation. In the same study, students who initially showed little inherent interest in drawing, and who then received an un expected reward for doing so, later chose to spend more of their free time on that activity.
An additional problem with rewards, says Chris Hulleman, a research associate professor at the University of Virginia, is that they offer the teacher an “out”—they allow him to disregard his role in making a lesson more meaningful. A better motivation-booster, says Hulleman and other experts, is to focus on the value of the task. This requires educators to provide meaningful activities explicitly connected to things students care about. For example, in a 2009 study, Hulleman and Judith Harackiewicz assigned over 250 high schoolers to two groups; one group regularly wrote summaries of the science material they were learning in class, and the other wrote about the usefulness of this material to their lives. In this latter group, students who had started with low expectations of their success in the course reported a higher interest in science and higher grades in the course than similar students in the group that only wrote summaries.
Extrinsic rewards can produce results, particularly if they are unexpected, prize mastery of skills over absolute performance, or encourage identifiable behaviors rather than outcomes. But getting students to see the value in their schoolwork by connecting concepts to their lives may be a more effective way for teachers to boost student engagement.
Getting students to value their schoolwork may be a more effective way to boost engagement.
Student Mindsets
Evidence is mounting that academic mindsets are extremely important to student success.  Students’ sense of belonging in their learning environment, their perceptions of how or whether “kids like them” succeed academically, and the extent to which they believe that hard work and persistence pay off—all of these have a powerful effect on student motivation.
In a 2011 study, for instance, freshman at a selective college were given reports ostensibly compiled from a survey of older students at the school. One group’s report showed that these older students had initially worried about whether they belonged in college, but that these concerns dissipated over time; the other group’s report did not address the issue of social belonging. Both groups wrote essays and gave speeches describing how their own college experiences related to the survey results. African-American students who read and reflected on how belonging uncertainty is both common and temporary had dramatically higher GPAs over the course of three years than the control group (who read surveys and wrote essays about topics other than belonging, such as social-political attitudes), cutting the achievement gap between black and white students by 79 percent.
The good news for teachers is that student mindsets aren’t set in stone; educators have the power to positively influence students’ perceptions of themselves as learners. Research findings like the above show that even relatively simple classroom interventions can have a large effect.
The good news for teachers is that student mindsets aren’t set in stone.
Student Relationships
Students care when they believe that other people care about them. They are less likely to drop out, and more likely to feel positively about school, when they have ongoing connections with teachers. Likewise, when they associate with highly-engaged peers, they become more engaged themselves.
Schools can do a lot to ensure that students feel cared about in the learning environment. Check & Connect, a program used by Chicago Public Schools, carefully monitors students’ grades, attendance, and performance data to identify those most at risk of disengaging from school. Each of these students is paired with a trained mentor who helps him with personal and academic issues. In one study, chronically-absent elementary students participated in the program for two years, and at the end of that time, 40 percent were engaged in and regularly attending school. That outcome represents a 135 percent improvement over baseline behavior.
Even smaller-scale classroom interventions can make a big difference in promoting positive school-based relationships. Teachers can hold morning meetings and encourage students to work in groups in order to foster environments in which students feel safe and supported.
An Issue of Scale
None of these strategies for boosting motivation is necessarily new; good teachers have always incentivized productive behaviors, encouraged positive mindsets, and created caring and connected classroom environments. But the new research adds evidence that these factors are vital to student success, and they show that, through practical interventions, they can be changed. The challenge now is to extend best practices beyond isolated classrooms, making the work systematic and sustained.
The barriers to scaling are many. Measurement, in particular, is a significant problem. Tools like Angela Duckworth’s Grit Scale and the KIPP character growth card assess non-cognitive skills and dispositions, but even experts concede that measurement is difficult to do reliably and validly. Professional support for teachers is another issue. Educators need to be trained on how to incorporate motivation-boosting strategies into their everyday instruction. And the education system as a whole must do a better job of translating research findings into practice.
Though challenges remain, researchers and practitioners are conducting promising experiments aimed at identifying and scaling the most effective strategies for improving student motivation. Read the full report to learn more about these efforts.

Alright, so I've got some information here about rewarding students for good grades. It seems like there are different opinions on whether this is a good idea or not. Some people think that rewards can motivate students to work harder, while others believe that external rewards might actually decrease students' intrinsic motivation to learn.

From the first document, it talks about how rewards might motivate students to work harder, but there's a risk that students might focus more on the reward itself rather than the learning process. It mentions that intrinsic rewards, like feeling proud of their accomplishments, are better for long-term motivation. The document also warns that using external rewards can create a sense of entitlement, where students feel they deserve something just for doing what they're supposed to do.

The second document delves deeper into the research on rewards and motivation. It discusses how rewards can help in forming habits, especially when they are specific and unpredictable. The document mentions that rewards should target specific behaviors rather than general achievement, and that they should be designed in a way that promotes intrinsic motivation as well.

The third document provides some creative ideas for reward systems in the classroom, including things like allowing students to choose their seats or giving them a break from homework. It emphasizes that rewards don't have to be material things; sometimes, simple recognitions or privileges can be just as motivating.

The fourth document talks about using rewards that encourage intrinsic motivation, such as giving students more autonomy or allowing them to share their interests with the class. It suggests that these types of rewards can foster a sense of ownership and engagement in learning.

Finally, the fifth document discusses the importance of student motivation and how it can be influenced by factors like academic mindsets and relationships with teachers and peers. It highlights that teachers can play a crucial role in shaping students' perceptions and fostering a supportive learning environment.

So, considering all this information, I need to think about whether rewarding students for good grades is a good idea. On one hand, rewards can provide immediate motivation and help students develop good study habits. On the other hand, there's a risk that students might become too focused on the rewards and lose their intrinsic motivation to learn.

Maybe the key is to strike a balance. Perhaps rewards can be used sparingly and in combination with strategies that promote intrinsic motivation. For example, instead of just giving物质奖励 for good grades, teachers could also provide feedback that helps students see the value and relevance of what they're learning. They could encourage students to set their own goals and track their progress, which can foster a sense of ownership and accomplishment.

Additionally, building positive relationships with students and creating a supportive classroom environment can go a long way in motivating students intrinsically. When students feel connected to their teachers and peers, they're more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn.

Another approach could be to involve students in the reward process. Letting them have a say in what kinds of rewards they'd like to earn might make the rewards more meaningful and motivating to them. It could also help ensure that the rewards align with their interests and values.

It's also important to consider the long-term effects of rewards. If students are only motivated by external rewards, they might struggle once those rewards are removed, such as in higher education or in their careers, where the motivation has to come from within.

In conclusion, while rewards can be a useful tool to motivate students in the short term, it's crucial to focus on fostering intrinsic motivation as well. This can be achieved by combining rewards with strategies that help students see the value in their learning, support positive academic mindsets, and build strong relationships within the classroom.
