As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information on how immigration can help the economy based on research and data analysis.

First, I need to understand the different ways immigration can impact the economy. I know that immigration brings in new workers, which can help fill labor shortages in certain industries. For example, in agriculture, many immigrant workers fill jobs that might otherwise go unfilled. Additionally, immigrants often start their own businesses, which can create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

Moreover, immigrants contribute to the economy by paying taxes, including income tax, sales tax, and property tax. They also consume goods and services, which can increase demand and drive economic activity. In some cases, immigrants may also bring in skills and expertise that are in high demand, such as in technology or healthcare, which can further boost the economy.

It's also important to consider the long-term effects of immigration on the economy. For instance, immigrants who become citizens can participate more fully in the economy and society, potentially leading to even greater contributions over time.

However, it's worth noting that there can be both positive and negative impacts of immigration on the economy, and these can vary depending on the specific context and policies in place. For example, if there is an influx of low-skilled immigrants into an area with already high unemployment rates among low-skilled workers, this could put downward pressure on wages in that sector.

Overall, though, numerous studies have shown that immigration has a net positive effect on the economy, contributing to growth, innovation, and dynamism.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Immigration helps the economy by filling labor shortages, starting businesses, paying taxes, consuming goods and services, and bringing in skills and expertise.}} \]
