I'm trying to understand why some people are transgender. It's a topic that's been in the news a lot lately, and I've heard different opinions about it. I want to approach this with respect and an open mind.

First off, I think it's important to define what being transgender means. From what I understand, transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity—their inner sense of themselves as male, female, or something else—doesn't match the sex they were assigned at birth. So, for example, someone who was born biologically male might identify as female, or vice versa. Some people might also identify as non-binary, which means they don't fit neatly into the categories of male or female.

But why does this happen? What causes someone to be transgender? I think that's the core of what I'm trying to figure out here.

I remember hearing about how sexuality and gender are complex and involve a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors. So, maybe being transgender is similar—it's not just one thing that determines it, but a mix of different influences.

Let me try to break this down. First, there might be biological factors at play. I've read somewhere that there could be differences in the brain structure of transgender people compared to cisgender people—those whose gender identity matches their birth sex. Maybe there are hormonal influences during pregnancy that affect fetal development in ways that lead to a mismatch between biological sex and gender identity.

Wait, maybe I should look into some scientific studies on this. I think there have been research papers published on the biology of transgender identities. Perhaps I can find some reliable sources to get a better understanding.

FULL STORY
Medical care of transgender patients, including surgical and hormonal treatment, has largely been met with resistance by physicians in favor of psychiatric treatment, owing to misconceptions that gender identity can be changed. According to a review article in Endocrine Practice, there is increasing evidence of a biological basis for gender identity that may change physicians' perspective on transgender medicine and improve health care for these patients.
The article was led by researchers at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM).
Disorders of gender identity affect as many as 1 in 100 people. Transgender individuals are those who identify with a gender that differs from their natal sex. Different etiologies have been suggested as the cause of transgender identify however none have been proven definitively.
The researchers conducted a literature search and reviewed articles that showed positive biologic bases for gender identity. These included disorders of sexual development, such as penile agenesis, neuroanatomical differences, such as grey and white matter studies, and steroid hormone genetics, such as genes associated with sex hormone receptors. They conclude that current data suggests a biological etiology for transgender identity.
"This paper represents the first comprehensive review of the scientific evidence that gender identity is a biological phenomenon," explains corresponding author Joshua D. Safer, MD, FACP. "As such it provides one of the most convincing arguments to date for all medical providers to gain the transgender medicine skills necessary to provide good care for these individuals," he added.
According to the researchers the article does have some limitations due to the small numbers of individuals studied and therefore conclusions should be drawn with caution. Safer recommends that further research focus on specific biologic mechanisms for gender identity.

There are many theories, but no one knows exactly what makes someone transgender. Recently, however, some people are focusing less on what makes a person trans, and more on how to best address the needs of trans folk.
Possible Causes
There has been a lot of research into what causes someone to be transgender. As the Crossport Gender Support Group explains,

What Is Color Theory?
Theories of both psychological and biological causality have been forwarded and it is quite likely there are different causes for different individuals. Lately, strong research suggests that an incorrect amount of miss-timed secretion of male hormone during stages of fetal development may create a transgendered individual - whether male or female. Biologically, nature will produce a female unless male androgens are supplied at the right times and in the right amounts. There are physiological and mental gray areas between male and female "absolutes". Additionally, there are some theories arguing a genetic model of causality.
The Gender Identity Disorder Label
Despite the fact that the causes of a transgender identity aren't known, being transgender has typically been viewed as a psychological issue. In fact, it even has its own psychiatric diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: "Gender Identity Disorder." Of course, not everyone feels that such a label is appropriate.
A Medical Not Psychological Issue
Dr. Norman P. Spack, the co-founder of the Gender Management Services Program, a clinic that provides treatments to delay puberty in children questioning their gender, feels that we should look at a transgender identity as a medical condition, not as a psychiatric disorder.
As he explained during a Harvard Transgender Awareness Week event, "These people aren't crazy. It's a medical condition."
The Impact on Transgender Teens
If this view becomes widespread, it could really affect the way trans teens are treated. Currently, most are not allowed surgery or hormone treatment because of their age.
As a teen transman writes on the forum,
"My parents haven't let me take testosterone yet, and probably won't for at least a year, so that's out of the question for a while (which sucks, because I currently pass as a pretty young boy, imho, and will very soon need testosterone to look my age)."
And while it is controversial, allowing teens to begin transitioning can be very beneficial. In fact, studies have found that adolescents who started hormone therapy as teens, had fewer psychological problems than people who started transitioning in adulthood.
So while we might not know what causes someone to be transgender, we are learning more and more about how we can help make the transition easier.

Gender, sex and all that ‎ > ‎
What causes transsexualism?
On this page, I’m trying to give answers to
the following question:
Is there a plausible biological
mechanism that can cause a mismatch between mental gender identity and physical
sex characteristics?
Spoiler alert: The answer is yes. I have
tried to answer the question by making a list of observations and supporting
them with evidence from current scientific research.
To clarify: The root cause for
transsexualism has not yet been found. Similar to other conditions, such as
homosexuality, autism, and diabetes, there seems to be a multitude of factors
working together, which makes research more difficult. In case of
transsexualism it seems that the major biological origins are genetics,
epigenetics and pre-natal hormones. There might also be additional environmental triggers. The objective of this page is to show one or more possible, or even plausible, biological
mechanisms that can cause gender dysphoria.

There is strong evidence that sexual orientation is largely tied to biology and that initial gender assignment is the strongest predictor of gender identity in the case of intersex children. Researchers have yet to precisely pinpoint the etiology of transsexualism, however. Various studies suggest that both biological and environmental variables may play a role in transgender development, says Eric Vilain, MD, PhD, chief of the division of medical genetics and professor of human genetics, pediatrics and urology at the University of California, Los Angeles.
In 1999, scientists identified anatomic brain differences between transsexuals and nontranssexuals (Journal of Psychosomatic Research ). More recently, Vilain and his colleagues determined that genetics may have a mild to moderate effect on transgender development (Biological Psychiatry, 2009).
The biological evidence to date is not that strong, though, says Vilain. He points to another study in the April 2010 issue of the International Journal of Andrology showing that fetal exposure to a particular chemical appeared to have an effect on brain development that is linked to gender role behavior. It's quite possible that being transgender stems from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, Vilain concludes.

What causes a person to be transgender? originally appeared on Quora-the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.
Answer by Jane Chin (陳盈錦), former microbiologist and biochemist, on Quora:
“What causes a person to be transgender”? You might as well ask the question, “What causes a person to be (a) gender?” These questions ask the exact same thing.
If you are a cisgender person wanting to understand what causes a person to be transgender, then ask yourself, “What causes me to identify as the gender I am?” The answer goes to the heart of the gender “identity” — what makes a person know “the gender” that person is and what makes a person cisgender or transgender, comes from the same “root”.
For a cisgender person, the answer may be easy: look down and you have your answer. But this answer does not tell the whole story. We look down because this is the easiest way for cisgender people to get an answer, and since our self-identification is congruent with our observation, we don’t further question. But what if our self-identification is not congruent with our observation?
Then let’s examine this “root” or “roots”. In other words, What is the origin of gender identity?
We know from empirical evidence that “biology” with its “male” and “female” hormones, do not dictate gender identity. There are biological males and females who identify with the other gender. Along with biology, is the genetics and epigenetics consideration: perhaps a set of genes contribute in whole or in part a “gender identity”. Genetics determine gender from a biochemical perspective, but I don’t know of any evidence that suggests genetics determine “gender identity”.
Biology and attendant hormones do not “cause” gender identity, even though hormones certainly shape the gender experience.
Cordelia Fine’s book, Delusions of Gender describes copious evidence that gender identity is socially reinforced. The book shows how even the most conscientious parents who want to raise their children “gender neutral” are not immune to reinforcing gender biases. Delusions of Gender is persuasive in arguing that society drives the parameters of gender conformity but does not examine the origin of “gender identity”.
Social and cultural rules do not dictate gender identity, even though society and culture drive conformity of gender behaviors.
What about psychological and neurological factors? Cisgender people do not deal with psychological or neurological issues around their gender identity, because “gender identity” is not even a thought — it is a knowing that is reinforced by and congruent with their biological and social/cultural experiences. Psychological and neurological considerations arise primarily when a person’s gender identity do not align with biological sex, and even then, are considerations imposed by others (people who decide that “something is wrong”).
I don’t view psychology and neurology as determinants of gender identity, even though both are used as factors when society impose “rights and wrongs” about gender identity.
Now I am left with a phenomenological dimension as the origin of gender identity. The very origin of your conscious knowing that “you” are “you” is also the origin of your gender identity.
In other words, strip away physical properties (Homo sapiens) and social conditioning (gender) and cultural constructs (role) of what and who you are.
How do you still know “who” you are?
That which creates the conscious quality you self-identity as “Me”, gives rise to your “gender identity”.
This conscious quality, within which gender identity resides, emerges independently of biology, society, and culture.
Just as this conscious quality that lets you self-identify as “Me”, emerges independently of biology, society, and culture.
What we are seeing as “gender identity” are really products of biology, society, and culture ACTING UPON the original conscious quality, and assigning a moral value to a phenomenon.
When there is agreement between gender identity and biological/social/culture influences, we don’t think twice about “gender identity” even as we may debate on the frameworks that society and culture have on “gender roles/rules”.
When there is disagreement between gender identity and biological/social/culture influences, we have heated arguments about the “right or wrong” about gender identity, when the real “rights or wrongs” remain with the frameworks that society and culture have on “gender roles/rules”.
Gender Identity is part of Consciousness.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First up, there's an article from ScienceDaily about a study suggesting there's a biological basis for gender identity. It mentions that transgender medicine is often met with resistance from physicians who prefer psychiatric treatment, but that there's increasing evidence pointing to biological factors. The article talks about disorders of sexual development, neuroanatomical differences, and steroid hormone genetics as possible areas where biological influences can be seen.

That sounds promising. So, it seems like there might be some biological underpinnings to gender identity. Maybe it's not just a choice or a psychological issue, but something deeper.

Next, there's an article from LiveAbout that discusses various theories on what causes a transgender identity. It mentions both psychological and biological theories and suggests that different causes might apply to different individuals. There's a reference to the idea that incorrect timing or amounts of male hormones during fetal development could lead to a transgender identity. It also notes that being transgender is sometimes labeled as a "Gender Identity Disorder" in psychiatric terms, but there's a move away from pathologizing it.

Interesting. So, there's a shift in how transgender identity is viewed in the medical community. It's being seen more as a biological variation rather than a disorder.

Another document from Cakeworld.Info provides a list of observations and references related to the causes of transsexualism. It seems to compile research on hormone exposure and genetic factors affecting brain development and gender identity. There are extensive reference lists for both human and animal studies, which could be really useful for digging deeper into the topic.

This looks like a great resource for further reading. I might come back to this later if I need more specific information.

Then, there's an article from the APA Monitor that discusses whether gender identity is more influenced by biology or the environment. It mentions that sexual orientation has a strong biological component, and that initial gender assignment strongly predicts gender identity in intersex children. However, for transsexualism, the etiology isn't pinpointed yet, and both biological and environmental factors may play a role.

So, it seems like there's a consensus that biology plays a significant role, but the exact mechanisms aren't fully understood yet.

Lastly, there's a piece from HuffPost where Jane Chin answers the question "What causes a person to be transgender?" She argues that asking what causes a person to be transgender is similar to asking what causes a person to have any gender identity. She suggests that the origin of gender identity is phenomenological, arising from consciousness independently of biology, society, and culture.

This is an interesting philosophical perspective. It shifts the focus from external factors to internal, subjective experience.

Okay, so synthesizing all this information, it seems that gender identity has a complex origin involving biological, psychological, and social factors. There's growing evidence suggesting biological influences, particularly in terms of hormonal exposure during development and possible genetic factors. However, there's also recognition that social and cultural factors play a role in how gender is expressed and understood.

From these sources, it appears that being transgender isn't simply a choice or a psychological disorder, but rather a variation in gender identity that likely has biological roots. The exact causes aren't fully understood yet, but research is ongoing, and there's a movement towards recognizing and affirming transgender individuals' identities.

In conclusion, the reasons why some people are transgender involve a combination of biological and possibly environmental factors, leading to a gender identity that doesn't align with the sex assigned at birth.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Being transgender is caused by a combination of biological and possibly environmental factors, leading to a gender identity that doesn't align with the sex assigned at birth.}} \]
