So I have this question: "What are the implications when the rule of law is eradicated?" Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to understand what the rule of law is. I think it's a principle where laws govern a nation, and everyone, including those in power, must follow them. It's like no one is above the law. So, if that's taken away, what happens?

I should probably look into some definitions and maybe see what famous thinkers or legal experts have said about the rule of law. Maybe start with that.

The rule of law is the political philosophy that all citizens and institutions within a country, state, or community are accountable to the same laws.[2] The rule of law is defined in the Encyclopedia Britannica as "the mechanism, process, institution, practice, or norm that supports the equality of all citizens before the law, secures a nonarbitrary form of government, and more generally prevents the arbitrary use of power." [3] The term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat and refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule. [4] [5] [6]
Use of the phrase can be traced to 16th-century Britain. In the following century, the Scottish theologian Samuel Rutherford employed it in arguing against the divine right of kings.[7] John Locke wrote that freedom in society means being subject only to laws made by a legislature that apply to everyone, with a person being otherwise free from both governmental and private restrictions upon liberty.  "The rule of law" was further popularized in the 19th century by British jurist A. V. Dicey. However, the principle, if not the phrase itself, was recognized by ancient thinkers. Aristotle wrote: "It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens." [8]
The rule of law implies that every person is subject to the law, including persons who are lawmakers, law enforcement officials and judges. [9] In this sense, it stands in contrast to tyranny or oligarchy, where the rulers are held above the law.

History[edit]
Although credit for popularizing the expression "the rule of law" in modern times is usually given to A. V. Dicey,[10] [11] development of the legal concept can be traced through history to many ancient civilizations, including ancient Greece, Mesopotamia, India, and Rome.[12]
Ancient history (6,000 BCE – 650 CE)[edit]
In the West, the ancient Greeks initially regarded the best form of government as rule by the best men. [13] Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law. [13] Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that "Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state." [14] More than Plato attempted to do, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws. [13] In other words, Aristotle advocated the rule of law:
It is more proper that law should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servants of the laws. [8]
The Roman statesman Cicero is often cited as saying, roughly:   "We are all servants of the laws in order to be free." [15] During the Roman Republic, controversial magistrates might be put on trial when their terms of office expired. Under the Roman Empire, the sovereign was personally immune (legibus solutus ), but those with grievances could sue the treasury. [10]
In China, members of the school of legalism during the 3rd century BC argued for using law as a tool of governance, but they promoted "rule by law" as opposed to "rule of law," meaning that they placed the aristocrats and emperor above the law. [16] In contrast, the Huang–Lao school of Daoism rejected legal positivism in favor of a natural law that even the ruler would be subject to. [17]
There has recently been an effort to reevaluate the influence of the Bible on Western constitutional law. In the Old Testament, the book of Deuteronomy imposes certain restrictions on the king, regarding such matters as the numbers of wives he might take and of horses he might acquire (for his own use).  According to Professor Bernard M. Levinson, "This legislation was so utopian in its own time that it seems never to have been implemented." [18] The Deuteronomic social vision may have influenced opponents of the divine right of kings, including Bishop John Ponet in sixteenth-century England. [19]
Post-classical history (500–1500 CE)[edit]
In Islamic jurisprudence rule of law was formulated in the seventh century, so that no official could claim to be above the law, not even the caliph.[20]
Alfred the Great, Anglo-Saxon king in the 9th century, reformed the law of his kingdom and assembled a law code (the Doom Book) which he grounded on biblical commandments. He held that the same law had to be applied to all persons, whether rich or poor, friends or enemies. This was likely inspired by Leviticus 19:15: "You shall do no iniquity in judgment. You shall not favor the wretched and you shall not defer to the rich. In righteousness you are to judge your fellow." [21]
In 1215, Archbishop Stephen Langton gathered the Barons in England and forced King John and future sovereigns and magistrates back under the rule of law, preserving ancient liberties by Magna Carta in return for exacting taxes. [22] [23] This foundation for a constitution was carried into the United States Constitution .
In 1481, during the reign of Ferdinand II of Aragon, the Constitució de l'Observança was approved by the General Court of Catalonia, establishing the submission of royal power (included its officers) to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.[24]

The first known use of this English phrase occurred around 1500. [25] Another early example of the phrase "rule of law" is found in a petition to James I of England in 1610, from the House of Commons :
Amongst many other points of happiness and freedom which your majesty's subjects of this kingdom have enjoyed under your royal progenitors, kings and queens of this realm, there is none which they have accounted more dear and precious than this, to be guided and governed by the certain rule of the law which giveth both to the head and members that which of right belongeth to them, and not by any uncertain or arbitrary form of government ... [26]
In 1607, English Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke said in the Case of Prohibitions (according to his own report) "that the law was the golden met-wand and measure to try the causes of the subjects; and which protected His Majesty in safety and peace: with which the King was greatly offended, and said, that then he should be under the law, which was treason to affirm, as he said; to which I said, that Bracton saith, quod Rex non debet esse sub homine, sed sub Deo et lege (That the King ought not to be under any man but under God and the law.)."
Among the first modern authors to use the term and give the principle theoretical foundations was Samuel Rutherford in Lex, Rex (1644). [7] The title, Latin for "the law is king", subverts the traditional formulation rex lex ("the king is law"). [27] James Harrington wrote in Oceana (1656), drawing principally on Aristotle's Politics, that among forms of government an “Empire of Laws, and not of Men” was preferable to an “Empire of Men, and not of Laws”. [28]
John Locke also discussed this issue in his Second Treatise of Government (1690):
The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but to have only the law of nature for his rule. The liberty of man, in society, is to be under no other legislative power, but that established, by consent, in the commonwealth; nor under the dominion of any will, or restraint of any law, but what that legislative shall enact, according to the trust put in it. Freedom then is not what Sir Robert Filmer tells us, Observations, A. 55. a liberty for every one to do what he lists, to live as he pleases, and not to be tied by any laws: but freedom of men under government is, to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society, and made by the legislative power erected in it; a liberty to follow my own will in all things, where the rule prescribes not; and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man: as freedom of nature is, to be under no other restraint but the law of nature. [29]
The principle was also discussed by Montesquieu in The Spirit of Law (1748). [30] The phrase "rule of law" appears in Samuel Johnson 's Dictionary (1755). [31]
In 1776, the notion that no one is above the law was popular during the founding of the United States. For example, Thomas Paine wrote in his pamphlet Common Sense that "in America, the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other." [32] In 1780, John Adams enshrined this principle in Article VI of the Declaration of Rights in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts:
No man, nor corporation, or association of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from those of the community, than what arises from the consideration of services rendered to the public; and this title being in nature neither hereditary, nor transmissible to children, or descendants, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a magistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and unnatural. [33]
The influence of Britain, France and the United States contributed to spreading the principle of the rule of law to other countries around the world. [34] [35]
Meaning and categorization of interpretations[edit]
The Oxford English Dictionary has defined rule of law this way: [36]
The authority and influence of law in society, esp. when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.
Rule of law implies that every citizen is subject to the law. It stands in contrast to the idea that the ruler is above the law, for example by divine right .
Despite wide use by politicians, judges and academics, the rule of law has been described as "an exceedingly elusive notion". [37] Among modern legal theorists, one finds that at least two principal conceptions of the rule of law can be identified: a formalist or "thin" definition, and a substantive or "thick" definition; one occasionally encounters a third "functional" conception. [38] Formalist definitions of the rule of law do not make a judgment about the "justness" of law itself, but define specific procedural attributes that a legal framework must have in order to be in compliance with the rule of law. Substantive conceptions of the rule of law go beyond this and include certain substantive rights that are said to be based on, or derived from, the rule of law. [39]
Most legal theorists believe that the rule of law has purely formal characteristics. For instance, such theorists claim that law requires generality (general rules that apply to classes of persons and behaviors as opposed to individuals), publicity (no secret laws), prospective application (little or no retroactive laws), consistency (no contradictory laws), [40] equality (applied equally throughout all society), and certainty (certainty of application for a given situation), but formalists contend that there are no requirements with regard to the content of the law. Others, including a few legal theorists, believe that the rule of law necessarily entails protection of individual rights. Within legal theory, these two approaches to the rule of law are seen as the two basic alternatives, respectively labelled the formal and substantive approaches. Still, there are other views as well. Some believe that democracy is part of the rule of law. [41]
The "formal" interpretation is more widespread than the "substantive" interpretation. Formalists hold that the law must be prospective, well-known, and have characteristics of generality, equality, and certainty. Other than that, the formal view contains no requirements as to the content of the law. [38] This formal approach allows laws that protect democracy and individual rights, but recognizes the existence of "rule of law" in countries that do not necessarily have such laws protecting democracy or individual rights. The best known arguments for the formal interpretation have been made by A.V Dicey, F.A.Hayek, Joseph Raz, and Joseph Unger.
The substantive interpretation preferred by Dworkin, Laws, and Allan, holds that the rule of law intrinsically protects some or all individual rights.
The functional interpretation of the term "rule of law", consistent with the traditional English meaning, contrasts the "rule of law" with the "rule of man ". [41] According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of "rule of law", whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of "rule of law". [41] Upholding the rule of law can sometimes require the punishment of those who commit offenses that are justifiable under natural law but not statutory law. [42] The rule of law is thus somewhat at odds with flexibility, even when flexibility may be preferable. [41]
The ancient concept of rule of law can be distinguished from rule by law, according to political science professor Li Shuguang: "The difference ... is that, under the rule of law, the law is preeminent and can serve as a check against the abuse of power. Under rule by law, the law is a mere tool for a government, that suppresses in a legalistic fashion." [43]
Status in various jurisdictions[edit]

The rule of law has been considered one of the key dimensions that determine the quality and good governance of a country. [44] Research, like the Worldwide Governance Indicators, defines the rule of law as: "the extent to which agents have confidence and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime or violence." [44] Based on this definition the Worldwide Governance Indicators project has developed aggregate measurements for the rule of law in more than 200 countries, as seen in the map at right. [45]
Europe[edit]
The preamble of the rule of law European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms says "the governments of European countries which are like-minded and have a common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law".
In France and Germany the concepts of rule of law (Etat de droit and Rechtsstaat respectively) are analogous to the principles of constitutional supremacy and protection of fundamental rights from public authorities (see public law ), particularly the legislature.[46] [47] France was one of the early pioneers of the ideas of the rule of law. [48] The German interpretation is more "rigid" but similar to that of France and the United Kingdom. [49] [50]
Finland's constitution explicitly requires rule of law by stipulating that "the exercise of public powers shall be based on an Act. In all public activity, the law shall be strictly observed."
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: Rule of law in the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom the rule of law is a long-standing principle of the way the country is governed, dating from Magna Carta in 1215 and the Bill of Rights 1689.[27] [51] [52] In the 19th century, A. V. Dicey, a constitutional scholar and lawyer, wrote of the twin pillars of the British constitution in his classic work Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1885); these two pillars are the rule of law and parliamentary sovereignty.[53]

All government officers of the United States, including the President, the Justices of the Supreme Court, state judges and legislators, and all members of Congress, pledge first and foremost to uphold the Constitution. These oaths affirm that the rule of law is superior to the rule of any human leader. [54] At the same time, the federal government has considerable discretion: the legislative branch is free to decide what statutes it will write, as long as it stays within its enumerated powers and respects the constitutionally protected rights of individuals. Likewise, the judicial branch has a degree of judicial discretion,[55] and the executive branch also has various discretionary powers including prosecutorial discretion. Per repeated opinions released by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice, a sitting president cannot be indicted or prosecuted. [56]
Scholars continue to debate whether the U.S. Constitution adopted a particular interpretation of the "rule of law", and if so, which one. For example, John Harrison asserts that the word "law" in the Constitution is simply defined as that which is legally binding, rather than being "defined by formal or substantive criteria", and therefore judges do not have discretion to decide that laws fail to satisfy such unwritten and vague criteria. [57] Law Professor Frederick Mark Gedicks disagrees, writing that Cicero, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and the framers of the U.S. Constitution believed that an unjust law was not really a law at all. [58]
Some modern scholars contend that the rule of law has been corroded during the past century by the instrumental view of law promoted by legal realists such as Oliver Wendell Holmes and Roscoe Pound.  For example, Brian Tamanaha asserts: "The rule of law is a centuries-old ideal, but the notion that law is a means to an end became entrenched only in the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries." [59]
Others argue that the rule of law has survived but was transformed to allow for the exercise of discretion by administrators. For much of American history, the dominant notion of the rule of law, in this setting, has been some version of A. V. Dicey's: "no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land." That is, individuals should be able to challenge an administrative order by bringing suit in a court of general jurisdiction. As the dockets of worker compensation commissions, public utility commissions and other agencies burgeoned, it soon became apparent that letting judges decide for themselves all the facts in a dispute (such as the extent of an injury in a worker's compensation case) would overwhelm the courts and destroy the advantages of specialization that led to the creation of administrative agencies in the first place. Even Charles Evans Hughes, a Chief Justice of the United States, believed "you must have administration, and you must have administration by administrative officers." By 1941, a compromise had emerged. If administrators adopted procedures that more or less tracked "the ordinary legal manner" of the courts, further review of the facts by "the ordinary Courts of the land" was unnecessary. That is, if you had your "day in commission", the rule of law did not require a further "day in court". Thus Dicey's rule of law was recast into a purely procedural form. [60]
James Wilson said during the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 that, "Laws may be unjust, may be unwise, may be dangerous, may be destructive; and yet not be so unconstitutional as to justify the Judges in refusing to give them effect." George Mason agreed that judges "could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as judges to give it a free course." [61] Chief Justice John Marshall (joined by Justice Joseph Story) took a similar position in 1827: "When its existence as law is denied, that existence cannot be proved by showing what are the qualities of a law." [62]
United States and definition and goal of rule of law[edit]
Various and countless way to define rule of law are known in the United States and might depend on one organization's goal including in territories with security risk: [63]
First the Rule of Law should protect against anarchy and the Hobbesian war of all against all. Second, the Rule of Law should allow people to plan their affairs with reasonable confidence that they can know in advance the legal consequences of various actions. Third, the Rule of Law should guarantee against at least some types of official arbitrariness.
—  Richard H. Fallon Jr., The Rule of Law as a Concept in International Discourse, 97 COLUM . L. REV . 1, 7-8 (1997) [63]
the purpose of law is served by five “elements” of the rule of law:
(1) The first element is the capacity of legal rules, standards, or principles to guide people in the conduct of their affairs. People must be able to understand the law and comply with it.
(2) The second element of the Rule of Law is efficacy. The law should actually guide people, at least for the most part. In Joseph Raz’s phrase, “people should be ruled by the law and obey it.”
(3) The third element is stability. The law should be reasonably stable, in order to facilitate planning and coordinated action over time.
(4) The fourth element of the Rule of Law is the supremacy of legal authority. The law should rule officials, including judges, as well as ordinary citizens.
(5) The final element involves instrumentalities of impartial justice. Courts should be available to enforce the law and should employ fair procedures.
—  Fallon
concept in terms of five (different) “goals” of the rule of law:
making the state abide by the law
ensuring equality before the law
supplying law and order
providing efficient and impartial justice, and
upholding human rights
—  Rachel Kleinfeld [63]
US Army doctrine and US Government inter-agency agreement[edit]
US Army doctrine and U.S. Government (USG) inter-agency agreement might see rule of law as a principle of governance [63]
Rule of law is a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the state itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights principles.
That principle can be broken down into seven effects:
The state monopolizes the use of force in the resolution of disputes
Individuals are secure in their persons and property
The state is itself bound by law and does not act arbitrarily
The law can be readily determined and is stable enough to allow individuals to plan their affairs
Individuals have meaningful access to an effective and impartial legal system
The state protects basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Individuals rely on the existence of justice institutions and the content of law in the conduct of their daily lives
The complete realization of these effects represents an ideal.
Canada[edit]
In Canada, administrative law makes the rule of law is an underlying constitutional principle requiring government to be conducted according to law and making all public officers answerable for their acts in the ordinary courts.
Asia[edit]
East Asian cultures are influenced by two schools of thought, Confucianism, which advocated good governance as rule by leaders who are benevolent and virtuous, and Legalism, which advocated strict adherence to law. The influence of one school of thought over the other has varied throughout the centuries. One study indicates that throughout East Asia, only South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong have societies that are robustly committed to a law-bound state. [64] According to Awzar Thi, a member of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the rule of law in Cambodia, and most of Asia is weak or nonexistent:
Apart from a number of states and territories, across the continent there is a huge gulf between the rule of law rhetoric and reality. In Thailand, the police force is favor over the rich and corrupted. In Cambodia, judges are proxies for the ruling political party ... That a judge may harbor political prejudice or apply the law unevenly are the smallest worries for an ordinary criminal defendant in Asia. More likely ones are: Will the police fabricate the evidence? Will the prosecutor bother to show up? Will the judge fall asleep? Will I be poisoned in prison? Will my case be completed within a decade? [65]
In countries such as China and Vietnam, the transition to a market economy has been a major factor in a move toward the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to foreign investors and to economic development. It remains unclear whether the rule of law in countries like China and Vietnam will be limited to commercial matters or will spill into other areas as well, and if so whether that spillover will enhance prospects for related values such as democracy and human rights. [66] The rule of law in China has been widely discussed and debated by both legal scholars and politicians in China.
In Thailand, a kingdom that has had a constitution since the initial attempt to overthrow the absolute monarchy system in 1932, the rule of law has been more of a principle than actual practice.[citation needed] Ancient prejudices and political bias have been present in the three branches of government with each of their foundings, and justice has been processed formally according to the law but in fact more closely aligned with royalist principles that are still advocated in the 21st century.[citation needed] In November 2013, Thailand faced still further threats to the rule of law when the executive branch rejected a supreme court decision over how to select senators.[citation needed]
In India, the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950. The Constitution of India is intended to limit the opportunity for governmental discretion and the judiciary uses judicial review to uphold the Constitution, especially the Fundamental Rights.[67] Although some people have criticized the Indian judiciary for its judicial activism,[68] others believe such actions are needed to safeguard the rule of law based on the Constitution as well as to preserve judicial independence, an important part of the basic structure doctrine.[69]
Japan had centuries of tradition prior to World War II, during which there were laws, but they did not provide a central organizing principle for society, and they did not constrain the powers of government (Boadi, 2001). As the 21st century began, the percentage of people who were lawyers and judges in Japan remained very low relative to western Europe and the United States, and legislation in Japan tended to be terse and general, leaving much discretion in the hands of bureaucrats. [70] [71]
Organizations[edit]
Various organizations are involved in promoting the rule of law.
The Council of Europe[edit]
The Statute of the Council of Europe characterizes the rule of law as one of the core principles which the establishment of the organization based on. The paragraph 3 of the preamble of the Statute of the Council of Europe states: "Reaffirming their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law, principles which form the basis of all genuine democracy." The Statute lays the compliance with the rule of law principles as a condition for the European states to be a full member of the organization. [72]
International Commission of Jurists[edit]
In 1959, an event took place in New Delhi and speaking as the International Commission of Jurists, made a declaration as to the fundamental principle of the rule of law. The event consisted of over 185 judges, lawyers, and law professors from 53 countries. This later became known as the Declaration of Delhi. During the declaration they declared what the rule of law implied. They included certain rights and freedoms, an independent judiciary and social, economic and cultural conditions conducive to human dignity. The one aspect not included in The Declaration of Delhi, was for rule of law requiring legislative power to be subject to judicial review.[73]
United Nations[edit]
The Secretary-General of the United Nations defines the rule of law as: [74]
a principle of governance in which all persons, institutions and entities, public and private, including the State itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards. It requires, as well, measures to ensure adherence to the principles of supremacy of law, equality before the law, accountability to the law, fairness in the application of the law, separation of powers, participation in decision-making, legal certainty, avoidance of arbitrariness and procedural and legal transparency.
The General Assembly has considered rule of law an agenda item since 1992, with renewed interest since 2006 and has adopted resolutions at its last three sessions. [75] The Security Council has held a number of thematic debates on the rule of law, [76] and adopted resolutions emphasizing the importance of these issues in the context of women, peace and security, [77] children in armed conflict, [78] and the protection of civilians in armed conflict. [79] The Peacebuilding Commission has also regularly addressed rule of law issues with respect to countries on its agenda. [80] The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action also requires the rule of law be included in human rights education.[81] Additionally, the Sustainable Development Goal 16, a component of the 2030 Agenda is aimed at promoting the rule of law at national and international levels. [82]
International Bar Association[edit]
The Council of the International Bar Association passed a resolution in 2009 endorsing a substantive or "thick" definition of the rule of law: [83]
An independent, impartial judiciary; the presumption of innocence; the right to a fair and public trial without undue delay; a rational and proportionate approach to punishment; a strong and independent legal profession; strict protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client; equality of all before the law; these are all fundamental principles of the Rule of Law. Accordingly, arbitrary arrests; secret trials; indefinite detention without trial; cruel or degrading treatment or punishment; intimidation or corruption in the electoral process, are all unacceptable. The Rule of Law is the foundation of a civilised society. It establishes a transparent process accessible and equal to all. It ensures adherence to principles that both liberate and protect. The IBA calls upon all countries to respect these fundamental principles. It also calls upon its members to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities.
World Justice Project[edit]
As used by the World Justice Project, a non-profit organization committed to advancing the rule of law around the world, the rule of law refers to a rules-based system in which the following four universal principles are upheld: [84]
The government and its officials and agents are accountable under the law;
The laws are clear, publicized, stable, fair, and protect fundamental rights, including the security of persons and property;
The process by which the laws are enacted, administered, and enforced is accessible, fair, and efficient;
Access to justice is provided by competent, independent, and ethical adjudicators, attorneys or representatives, and judicial officers who are of sufficient number, have adequate resources, and reflect the makeup of the communities they serve.
The World Justice Project has developed an Index to measure the extent to which countries adhere to the rule of law in practice. The WJP Rule of Law Index is composed of 9 factors and 52 sub-factors, and covers a variety of dimensions of the rule of law – such as whether government officials are accountable under the law, and whether legal institutions protect fundamental rights and allow ordinary people access to justice. [85]
International Development Law Organization[edit]
The International Development Law Organization (IDLO) is an intergovernmental organization with a joint focus on the promotion of rule of law and development. It works to empower people and communities to claim their rights, and provides governments with the know-how to realize them. [86] It supports emerging economies and middle-income countries to strengthen their legal capacity and rule of law framework for sustainable development and economic opportunity. [87] It is the only intergovernmental organization with an exclusive mandate to promote the rule of law and has experience working in more than 90 countries around the world. [88]
The International Development Law Organization has a holistic definition of the rule of law:
More than a matter of due process, the rule of law is an enabler of justice and development. The three notions are interdependent; when realized, they are mutually reinforcing. For IDLO, as much as a question of laws and procedure, the rule of law is a culture and daily practice. It is inseparable from equality, from access to justice and education, from access to health and the protection of the most vulnerable. It is crucial for the viability of communities and nations, and for the environment that sustains them. [89]
IDLO is headquartered in Rome and has a branch office in The Hague and has Permanent Observer Status at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.
International Network to Promote the Rule of Law[edit]
The International Network to Promote the Rule of Law (INPROL) is a network of over 3,000 law practitioners from 120 countries and 300 organizations working on rule of law issues in post-conflict and developing countries from a policy, practice and research perspective. INPROL is based at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in partnership with the US Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Strategic Police Matters Unit, the Center of Excellence for Police Stability Unit, and William and Marry School of Law in the United States. [90] Its affiliate organizations include the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Folke Bernadotte Academy, International Bar Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Association of Women Police, International Corrections and Prisons Association, International Association for Court Administration, International Security Sector Advisory Team at the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, Worldwide Association of Women Forensic Experts (WAWFE), and International Institute for Law and Human Rights.
INPROL provides an online forum for the exchange of information about best practices.  Members may post questions, and expect a response from their fellow rule of law practitioners worldwide on their experiences in addressing rule of law issues.
In relation to economics[edit]
One important aspect of the rule-of-law initiatives is the study and analysis of the rule of law's impact on economic development. The rule-of-law movement cannot be fully successful in transitional and developing countries without an answer to the question: does the rule of law matter to economic development or not? [91] Constitutional economics is the study of the compatibility of economic and financial decisions within existing constitutional law frameworks, and such a framework includes government spending on the judiciary, which, in many transitional and developing countries, is completely controlled by the executive. It is useful to distinguish between the two methods of corruption of the judiciary: corruption by the executive branch, in contrast to corruption by private actors.
The standards of constitutional economics can be used during annual budget process, and if that budget planning is transparent then the rule of law may benefit. The availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of previously authorized appropriations, is a key element for the success of the rule-of-law endeavor. [92]
The Rule of Law is especially important as an influence on the economic development in developing and transitional countries. To date, the term "rule of law" has been used primarily in the English-speaking countries, and it is not yet fully clarified even with regard to such well-established democracies as, for instance, Sweden, Denmark, France, Germany, or Japan. A common language between lawyers of common law and civil law countries as well as between legal communities of developed and developing countries is critically important for research of links between the rule of law and real economy. [93]
The "rule of law" primarily connotes "protection of property rights". [94] The economist F. A. Hayek analyzed how the rule of law might be beneficial to the free market. Hayek proposed that under the rule of law, individuals would be able to make wise investments and future plans with some confidence in a successful return on investment when he stated: "under the Rule of Law the government is prevented from stultifying individual efforts by ad hoc action. Within the known rules of the game the individual is free to pursue his personal ends and desires, certain that the powers of government will not be used deliberately to frustrate his efforts." [95]
Studies have shown that weak rule of law (for example, discretionary regulatory enforcement) discourages investment. Economists have found, for example, that a rise in discretionary regulatory enforcement caused US firms to abandon international investments. [96]
In relation to culture[edit]
The Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or Roerich Pact is an inter-American treaty. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.[97] The Roerich Pact signed on April 15, 1935, by the representatives of 21 American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office. [98] The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict is the first international treaty that focuses on the protection of cultural property in armed conflict. It was signed at The Hague, Netherlands on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of June 2017, it has been ratified by 128 states. [99]
The rule of law can be hampered when there is a disconnect between legal and popular consensus. An example is intellectual property. Under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization, nominally strong copyright laws have been implemented throughout most of the world; but because the attitude of much of the population does not conform to these laws, a rebellion against ownership rights has manifested in rampant piracy, including an increase in peer-to-peer file sharing.[100] Similarly, in Russia, tax evasion is common and a person who admits he does not pay taxes is not judged or criticized by his colleagues and friends, because the tax system is viewed as unreasonable. [101] Bribery likewise has different normative implications across cultures. [94]
In relation to education[edit]
Education has an important role in promoting the rule of law (RoL) and a culture of lawfulness. In essence, it provides an important protective function by strengthening learners’ abilities to face and overcome difficult life situations. Young people can be important contributors to a culture of lawfulness, and governments can provide educational support that nurtures positive values and attitudes in future generations. [102]
Through education, learners are expected to acquire and develop the cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural experiences and skills they need to develop into constructive and responsible contributors to society. Education also plays a key role in transmitting and sustaining socio-cultural norms and ensuring their continued evolution. [103] Through formal education, children and youth are socialized to adopt certain values, behaviours, attitudes and roles that form their personal and social identity and guide them in their daily choices. [102]
As they develop, children and youth also develop the capacity to reflect critically on norms, and to shape new norms that reflect contemporary conditions. As such, education for justice promotes and upholds the principle of the RoL by: [102]
Encouraging learners to value, and apply, the principles of the RoL in their daily lives, and;
Equipping learners with the appropriate knowledge, values, attitudes, and behaviours they need to contribute to its continued improvement and regeneration in society more broadly. This can be reflected, for instance, in the way learners demand greater transparency in, or accountability of, public institutions, as well as through the everyday decisions that learners take as ethically responsible and engaged citizens, family members, workers, employers, friends, and consumers etc. [102]
Global Citizenship Education (GCE) is built on a lifelong learning perspective. It is not only for children and youth but also for adults. It can be delivered in formal, non-formal and informal settings. For this reason, GCE is part and parcel of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 on Education (SDG4, Target 4.7). A competency framework based on a vision of learning covers three domains to create a well-rounded learning experience: Cognitive, Socio-Emotional and Behavioural. [102]
Educational policies and programmes can support the personal and societal transformations that are needed to promote and uphold the RoL by:
Ensuring the development and acquisition of key knowledge, values, attitudes and behaviours.
Addressing the real learning needs and dilemmas of young people.
Supporting positive behaviours.
Ensuring the principles of the RoL are applied by all learning institutions and in all learning environments. [102]

Jurisdiction / Tag(s): Bangladeshi Law
The rule of law is an ancient ideal, and was discussed by Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle around 350 BC. Plato wrote:
Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state. [ 1 ] Law is the only element which can bring peace as well as the keeper if human right. Generally we have been hearing the term from politicians, lawyers, economists and policy-makers. They are often using the term “rule of law” to characterize a certain type of legal-political regime. It is the most important topics in the world. The ‘rule of law’ means, it is just a legal system where all level of people and organizations in a state are operated.
The rule of law, also called supremacy of law, means that the law is above everyone and it applies to everyone. Whether governor or governed, rulers or ruled, no one is above the law, no one is exempted from the law, and no one can grant exemption to the application of the law. [ 2 ] The rule of law means that is to apply the same law over all people in a state to protect the rights of citizens and their human freedom. In a one word we can say that no one is above the law.
2. Definition of “Rule of Law”:
Rule of law is not a just three word or it has not a single line definition. Rule of law has many different bases of meaning as well as interpretation according to different writers. On the other hand its meaning can vary between different nations and legal traditions. In the basic common sense, the rule of law is a system that attempts to keep the rights of citizens from arbitrary and offensive use of government power. Yet, in the previous discussion we have implicit that the rule of law is identical law which is applied above each person in a country whatever his title or category that’s will not be measured. Everyone is subject to the law and equal; in spite of any position in a state. A.K.Sen said about the rule of law in his “Commercial Law and Industrial Law” books that “the modern view is to apply the same law over all persons in the state and to give all persons equal rights and privileges for the protection of their human liberties”. [ 3 ] Rule of law – All government officials and all private citizens must follow the laws of the nation and must be treated equally under the law. The government is created by and for the people and is answerable to the people. [ 4 ] In addition to the formal and substantive interpretations of the term “rule of law”, another leading interpretation is the functional definition, which is consistent with the traditional English meaning that contrasts the “rule of law” with the “rule of man.” According to the functional view, a society in which government officers have a great deal of discretion has a low degree of “rule of law”, whereas a society in which government officers have little discretion has a high degree of “rule of law” [ 5 ] .
3. The most fundamental issues that challenge the idea if Rule of Law
3.1 Religious Issue:
According to general definition and interpretation of the rule of law, the rules and regulations are created by people who come from different religious background. On the other hand different religion has different moral and values. So, for a common law it is difficult to connect all together from various religion rules and regulation. Sometimes, there may arise a challenge between the religion’s own norm and the common legal system. Equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination on the basis of religion may differ. Challenges generally applicable law that regulates activities in public square when those law differently impact on someone’s religious observance is certainly an important part of challenges. [ 6 ] In some cases, like homosexuality behavior law could not match with rule of law.
3.2Economical Issue:
Economy is one of the most important issues that can challenge the rule of law. To run a country accurately economy is the only part which is considered as resistance power. That is for sure rule of law protects human rights and all individual are treated as equally by the ROL in a country. However in an economy system there is two types of development. One is public and other is private. In the law and development movement, the role of law was to empower the state. It was assumed that private markets were too weak to ensure growth, the state needed to play a commanding role in the economy, and law should strengthen the powers of the state. The state had to undertake many key economic roles, from banking to manufacture and state corporations were a dominant form of activity [ 7 ] . So for balancing the economic activities there should be rules and regulations. Therefore state has the right to make rules and regulations to control private business entity. Otherwise private business may do unfavorable activities and make money from that. “In that way, private actors would be fully empowered” [ 8 ] . In this circumstance the rule of law may not alien with business rules and regulations. On the other hand, there will be a chance to dictate the private economic activities by government.
The components of a good investment climate are many and varied, including macro stability, property rights, reduced crime, law and order situation, business regulation, tax and trade policy, financial markets, infrastructure, and workforce quality, industrial policy, and labor market regulation [ 9 ] . Hence there will be discrimination of product, price, taxes, policies ect. In economic system there are many issues that relates with rule of law. Like human right. Rule of law secures peoples right, example job, wage, working hour and other necessities. But the economic rules and regulation may not comply with, so there will be challenge for ROL. “The ability to trade does not affect everyone equally—often groups like the rural poor, indigenous groups and women are less likely to access the benefits of increased trade” [ 10 ] . All this may bring a challenge for the idea of Rule of Law.
3.3Constitution:
Constitution is one of the most influencing issue that challenge the rule of law. A constitution is a set of rules for government—often codified as a written document—that establishes principles of an autonomous political entity. In the case of countries, this term refers specifically to a national constitution defining the fundamental political principles, and establishing the structure, procedures, powers and duties, of a government [ 11 ] According to the rule of law the fundamental right and liberties originate from judicial decisions. But this is one-sided view. Because, in England people have got many rights through the law of parliament and charters issued by the monarchs. Various public authorities, the Crown, the House of Parliament, the court, the administrative authorities have powers and duties and most of these are determined by statute not by the courts. So, it has been clear from the above discussion that the abolition of
discretionary power is not possible fully and also equality before law is not
possible in every case. [ 12]
3.4 Political Issue:
Political issues also challenge the rule of law. The principle of rule of law says that there should be equality before law and all are amenable to ordinary courts of the land. But this principle has many exceptions because equality before law is not possible in every case. The king or the head of the state in other countries are immune from both criminal and civil action; judges are immune from personal responsibility for their official acts even if they might have acted beyond their jurisdiction but not knowingly. [ 13]
4. Rule of law in Bangladesh
The rule of law is a basic feature of the constitution of Bangladesh. It has been pledged in the preamble to the constitution of Bangladesh that –
“It shall be fundamental aim of the state to realize through the democratic process a socialist society, free from exploitation – a society in which the rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedom, equality and justice, political economic and social, will be secured for all citizens.” [ 14]
In accordance with this pledge the following positive provisions for rule of law have been incorporated in the constitution:
Article 27 guarantees that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. Article 31 guarantees that to enjoy the protection of the law, and to be treated in accordance with law, is the inalienable right of every citizen, wherever he may be and of every other person for the time being with in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh rule of law also face some challenges-
4.1 Access to law as well as equality before it, are reserved for only those who are privileged. The rest of the population are the helpless victims of as unjust society that sets great story by privileges.
4.2 The lower courts are under the direct control of the law ministry. The judges look up to the Ministry for everything infect they are obliged to.
4.3 The government of Bangladesh continued to use the Special Power Act of 1974 and section 54 of the criminal code which allow for arbitrary arrest and preventive detention, to harass political opponents and other citizens by detaining them without formal charges.
4.4 Police is no doubt a very powerful institution for the endorsement of the rule of law. But in Bangladesh, the police have never been friendly with the public. The police serve the government and enjoy, in exchanges, the freedom to act arbitrarily and in the material interests of its own members.
4.5 According to Article 141(A) the president can declare emergency whenever he wishes. By declaring emergency in peace time the government can suspend fundamental rights and suppress the opposition movement. [ 15]
5. Conclusion:
Rule of law is a very important tool to preserve the human rights. But to cope up with the modern world every government makes some exception of the rule of law. These exceptions always challenge the idea of rule of law.

Rule of law legal definition of rule of law
rule of law
Also found in: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Acronyms, Idioms, Wikipedia.
Rule of Law
Rule according to law; rule under law; or rule according to a higher law.
The rule of law is an ambiguous term that can mean different things in different contexts. In one context the term means rule according to law. No individual can be ordered by the government to pay civil damages or suffer criminal punishment except in strict accordance with well-established and clearly defined laws and procedures. In a second context the term means rule under law. No branch of government is above the law, and no public official may act arbitrarily or unilaterally outside the law. In a third context the term means rule according to a higher law. No written law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain unwritten, universal principles of fairness, morality, and justice that transcend human legal systems.
Rule According to Law
The rule of law requires the government to exercise its power in accordance with well-established and clearly written rules, regulations, and legal principles. A distinction is sometimes drawn between power, will, and force, on the one hand, and law, on the other. When a government official acts pursuant to an express provision of a written law, he acts within the rule of law. But when a government official acts without the imprimatur of any law, he or she does so by the sheer force of personal will and power.
Under the rule of law, no person may be prosecuted for an act that is not punishable by law. When the government seeks to punish someone for an offense that was not deemed criminal at the time it was committed, the rule of law is violated because the government exceeds its legal authority to punish. The rule of law requires that government impose liability only insofar as the law will allow. Government exceeds its authority when a person is held to answer for an act that was legally permissible at the outset but was retroactively made illegal. This principle is reflected by the prohibition against Ex Post Facto Laws in the U.S. Constitution.
For similar reasons, the rule of law is abridged when the government attempts to punish someone for violating a vague or poorly worded law. Ill-defined laws confer too much discretion upon government officials who are charged with the responsibility of prosecuting individuals for criminal wrongdoing. The more prosecutorial decisions are based on the personal discretion of a government official, the less they are based on law.
For example, the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments requires that statutory provisions be sufficiently definite to prevent Arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement by a prosecutor. Government officials must not be given unfettered discretion to prosecute individuals for violating a law that is so vague or of such broad applicability that evenhanded administration is not possible. Thus, a Florida law that prohibited Vagrancy was held void for vagueness because it was so generally worded that it encouraged erratic prosecutions and made possible the punishment of normally innocuous behavior(Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville,405 U.S. 156, 92 S. Ct. 839, 31 L. Ed. 2d 110 [1972]).
Well-established and clearly defined laws allow individuals, businesses, and other entities to govern their behavior accordingly(United States v. E.C. Investments, Inc.,77 F. 3d 327 [9th Cir. 1996]). Before the government may impose civil or criminal liability, a law must be written with sufficient precision and clarity that a person of ordinary intelligence will know that certain conduct is forbidden. When a court is asked to shut down a paint factory that is emitting pollutants at an illegal rate, for example, the rule of law requires the government to demonstrate that the factory owner failed to operate the business in accordance with publicly known environmental standards.
Rule Under Law
The rule of law also requires the government to exercise its authority under the law. This requirement is sometimes explained with the phrase "no one is above the law." During the seventeenth century, however, the English monarch was vested with absolute sovereignty, including the prerogative to disregard laws passed by the House of Commons and ignore rulings made by the House of Lords. In the eighteenth century, absolute sovereignty was transferred from the British monarchy to Parliament, an event that was not lost on the colonists who precipitated the American Revolution and created the U.S. Constitution.
Under the Constitution, no single branch of government in the United States is given unlimited power. The authority granted to one branch of government is limited by the authority granted to the coordinate branches and by the Bill of Rights,federal statutory provisions, and historical practice. The power of any single branch of government is similarly restrained at the state level.
During his second term, President richard m. nixon tried to place the Executive Branch of the federal government beyond the reach of legal process. When served with a subpoena ordering him to produce a series of tapes that were anticipated to link him to the Watergate conspiracy and cover-up, Nixon refused to comply, asserting that the confidentiality of these tapes was protected from disclosure by an absolute and unqualified Executive Privilege.In united states v. nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974), the Supreme Court disagreed, compelling the president to hand over the tapes because the Constitution forbids any branch of government from unilaterally thwarting the legitimate ends of a criminal investigation.
Members of the state and federal judiciary face a slightly different problem when it comes to the rule of law. Each day judges are asked to interpret and apply legal principles that defy clear exposition. Terms like "due process," "reasonable care," and "undue influence" are not self-defining. Nor do judges always agree about how these terms should be defined, interpreted, or applied. When judges issue controversial decisions, they are often accused of deciding cases in accordance with their own personal beliefs, be they political, religious, or philosophical, rather than in accordance with the law.
Scholars have spent centuries examining this issue. Some believe that because the law is written in such indefinite and ambiguous terms, all judicial decisions will inevitably reflect the personal predilections of the presiding judge. Other scholars assert that most laws can be interpreted in a neutral, objective, and apolitical fashion even though all judges may not agree on the appropriate interpretation. In either case the rule of law is better served when judges keep an open mind to alternative readings of constitutional, statutory, and common-law principles. Otherwise, courts run the risk of prejudging certain cases in light of their own personal philosophy.
Rule According to Higher Law
A conundrum is presented when the government acts in strict accordance with well-established and clearly defined legal rules and still produces a result that many observers consider unfair or unjust. Before the Civil War, for example, African Americans were systematically deprived of their freedom by carefully written codes that prescribed the rules and regulations between master and slave. Even though these slave codes were often detailed, unambiguous, and made known to the public, government enforcement of them produced negative results.
Do such repugnant laws comport with the rule of law? The answer to this question depends on when and where it is asked. In some countries the political leaders assert that the rule of law has no substantive content. These leaders argue that a government may deprive its citizens of fundamental liberties so long as it does so pursuant to a duly enacted law. At the Nuremberg Trials,some of the political, military, and industrial leaders of Nazi Germany unsuccessfully advanced this argument as a defense to Allied charges that they had committed abominable crimes against European Jews and other minorities during World War II.
In other countries the political leaders assert that all written laws must conform with universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that as a necessary corollary to the axiom that "no one is above the law," the rule of law requires that the government treat all persons equally under the law. Yet the right to equal treatment is eviscerated when the government categorically denies a minimal level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a single class of individuals. These unwritten principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to transcend ordinary written laws that are enacted by government. Sometimes known as Natural Law or higher law theory, such unwritten and universal principles were invoked by the Allied powers during the Nuremberg trials to overcome the defense asserted by the Nazi leaders.
The rule of law is a concept explain in classical time. In Greece Aristotle wrote that "law should be the final sovereign; and personal rule, whether it be exercised by a single person or a body of persons, should be sovereign in only those matters which law is unable, owing to the difficulty of framing general rules for all contingencies." In ancient Rome the Corpus Juris Civilis established a complex body of procedural and substantive rules, reflecting a strong commitment to the belief that law, not the arbitrary will of an emperor, is the appropriate vehicle for dispute resolution. In 1215 Magna Charta reined in the corrupt and whimsical rule of King John by declaring that government should not proceed except in accordance with the law of the land.
During the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas argued that the rule of law represents the natural order of God as ascertained through divine inspiration and human reason. In the seventeenth century, the English jurist Sir Edward Coke asserted that the "king ought to be under no man, but under God and the law." With regard to the legislative power in England, Coke said that "when an act of Parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the Common Law will control it, and adjudge such act to be void." In the United States, Alexander Hamilton applied the rule of law to the judiciary when he argued in The Federalist,no. 78, that judges "have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment."
Despite its ancient history, the rule of law was not celebrated in all quarters. The nineteenth-century English philosopher Jeremy Bentham described the rule of law as "nonsense on stilts." The twentieth century saw its share of political leaders who oppressed persons or groups without warning or reason, governing as if no such thing as the rule of law existed. For many people around the world, the rule of law is essential to freedom.

rule of law
everyone acts under the law. A phrase as old as Aristotle, it has a special meaning in the constitutional law of the UK and in relation to discussions of law and politics everywhere. Perhaps the most practically useful sense in which the doctrine is applied is to demand that the executive must be acting under the law. But even then this authority need not be explicit in a state where everyone is free to do anything unless it is prohibited. In another sense it reflects the view that there is a higher law than that of the government. In the UK no Parliament can bind its successor, and it is difficult to see the doctrine operating in this sense, although the supremacy of the law of the EUROPEAN UNION has given such a view renewed prominence. The significance of the doctrine in modern times is probably because of the writings of Dicey, who considered that the rule of law involved three issues:
(1) the absence of arbitrary power;
(2) equality before the law; and
(3) liberties and constitutional law generally are the result of law and law made in the courts.
The phrase still has a rhetorical significance, but it is arguable that its technical significance has been overshadowed by the notion of fundamental law or HUMAN RIGHTS.
Collins Dictionary of Law © W.J. Stewart, 2006
RULE OF LAW. Rules of law are general maxims, formed by the courts, who having observed what is common to many particular cases, announce this conformity by a maxim, which is called a rule; because in doubtful and unforeseen cases, it is a rule for their decision; it embraces particular cases within general principles.

Jurisdiction / Tag(s): US Law UK Law
The rule of law itself traces back to Aristotle who said that ‘the rule of law is preferable to any individual’[1]. This still holds true in the modern context because it is accepted the law is superior to the individual. This therefore maintains the concept of equality in constructing it. The key example to note are the three principles provided by A.V. Dicey; ‘no man can be made to suffer punishment… for any conduct not definitely forbidden by law’; ‘no man is above the law… every man, whatever be his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm; the general principles of the constitution (as for example the right to personal liberty…) are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons[2]. When Dicey’s principles are adhered to when constructing law, they can assure a citizen sufficient protection regarding the misuse of power. In theory, they limit governmental power and eliminate the chances of a dictatorship. Furthermore they maintain the standards of liberal democracy treasured by our country and endorses the notion of equality in law; therefore providing a sense of autonomy for the individual.
The declaration of Delhi (1959) can be considered a more modern interpretation of the rule of law than Dicey’s. The principles contained within it address Dicey’s interpretation but also that of others such as Joseph Raz and Ronald Dworkin. Such issues are: respect for human rights, the ability to bring proceedings against the state, the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. All of which at present are manifested within our system when accounting the human rights act (1998)[3], the process of judicial review, and the assistance of legal aid. However if we consider the criteria which states there should be adequate control of delegated legislation, one recalls the ability of the executive to pass such legislation without sufficient check and balance. This can be considered the most important aspect of Delhi which is not addressed in the constitution sufficiently as it allows the potential misuse of power due to its inbalance..
There are several modern definitions of the rule of law which should be considered, the first of which it being interpreted as a political concept. This is synonymous with Professor Joseph Raz who concentrated more on a systematic approach stating it shouldn’t be ‘confused with democracy, justice, equality… or for the dignity of man’[4]. If this particular interpretation of the rule of law was generally accepted then it would imply an individual as inferior to a member of parliament for example, allowing the potential for misuse of power. Raz also suggests that the courts should be easily accessible. This is crucial to the protection of the citizen from misuse of power because if the legal process was not transparent, then one’s rights could easily be overridden and therefore an injustice done. Furthermore, this provides certainty of impartiality as a citizen will be aware of what reason they could be prosecuted for.
Secondly there is the substantive approach as primarily conveyed by Ronald Dworkin which follows the route of utilitarianism
In the United Kingdom, the concept of equality is, in theory, manifested within the constitution. However one cannot neglect the existence of exceptions to such a concept when considering prerogative powers and certain legal immunities and power for select people in certain positions. Such examples include the police, customs officers or public health inspectors. Whether forcibly entering private premises to inspect or taking possession of someone’s property; even if legal by statute; indicates that equality in law is non-existent. Additionally one can note the legal immunities enjoyed by an ambassador or diplomats where they are posted. To elaborate even further, children aged ten and under are immune to conviction of criminal offense, even though there is the rare possibility that they could potentially commit a crime of any scale. The overarching point being that if there is true equality in the law stems from the rule of law, there should not be exceptions that protect some but not all citizens.
The harmonisation of the rule of law and the separation of powers contribute to the democratic practice of the constitution. This doctrine of the separation of powers intends that the government is not dominated by one section of it, so as to maintain justice and balance in the constitution as intended by the rule of law. This was conveyed by Montesquieu who stated ‘there is no liberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative and the executive’[5]. ’ This is further solidified through the constitutional reform act 2005[6]which states that it will ’uphold the continued independence of the judiciary’[7]which in turn validates Lord Denning’s assertion that the British constitution is ‘firmly based’[8]on the separation of powers. This exhibits the rule of law vitally incorporated into another area of our constitution in order to ensure that a citizen is protected with knowledge that in the face of the law, they will receive just and unbiased treatment. Furthermore this can be related to the idea of constitutional conventions which are essentially moralistic non legal rules. All three of these are guided by morals which are intended to be adhered to for the benefit of the citizen.
The process of judicial review is the best example of the rule of law in practice. Unlike codified constitutions such as that of the United States or France, the British constitution attempts to remedy infringement of individual’s rights through statutory law. Failing this there is the chance it will be subject to judicial review, carried out with respect to the rule of law. Lord Hoffman explained the as process ensuring ‘that administrative decisions will be taken rationally in accordance with a fair procedure and within the powers conferred by parliament’[9]because ‘ the principles of judicial review give effect to the rule of law’[10]. In essence a citizen can be reassured that if a decision is not in accordance with the rule of law, there is further remedy available which helps restructure our system. On the contrary, because judicial review is not an appeals process, raises an issue because it only determines how the decision of a case was reached, not its correctness. Consequently the rule of law can fail to protect the citizen in this instance.
The first principle can be contrasted when examining the compulsory purchase orders which theoretically denies a citizen the right to not have their ‘goods interfered with except for a distinct breach in the law’[11]
The underlying theory of the rule of law is that it helps entrench the fundamental rights of the ordinary citizen in common law. The creation of the Human Rights Act was built upon this and has, since its acceptance in the year 2000, given further protection to the citizen against misuse of power.
b.
After consideration of the facts in the previous section, this essay will now analyse how the rule of law endeavours to protect the citizen against legislation and the power of the executive, in order to determine its efficiency.
Firstly we will revisit the principles of dicey and determine if they are undermined by law or executive powers. In the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (1984)[12], there is substantial power entrusted to the police to search anyone they wish but they must take ‘reasonable steps before he commences the search’[13]. Reasonableness is a vague term and can be interpreted in any manner therefore the act allows potential for abuse; this has been outlined in the news where a couple were claiming to have had their ‘right to respect for a private and family life’[14]violated by a policeman and won their case. It is however possible to argue that such an infringement on liberty is necessary otherwise the crime rate would rise. The rule of law in this instance has served its purpose because it allowed the couple to challenge the morality of an Act. Therefore it provides the opportunity for judicial review to ensure it is suitable by the standards of the rule of law.
Diceys third principle is the most secure of all. examine the case of R v Horseferry Road Magistrates’ Court[15]where a wanted man was illegally abducted, flown back to the UK and put on trial, denied appeal at first but then overturned. The significance of this case is that after being wronged by the authorities, due to the remedy provided by the common law system the man was protected from misuse of power. This is crucial in determining the effectiveness of the rule of law because the its morals were upheld even against black and white letter law. This is similar to Entick v Carrington[16]where the Enticks house was trespassed into without a legal warrant. The fact that the ordinary citizen won the case considering his governmental opposition outlines that it is possible for the rule of law to succeed in protection of the citizen from misuse of power
The prerogative powers held by the executive pose an extreme contrast to the moral concepts intended by the rule of law. The Prime Minister retains the power to declare war and as conveyed by Julian Samiloff in the New Law Journal: ‘he knows that such use cannot generally be challenged in the courts or stopped by a Parliament’[17]. Such a decision affects citizens’ greatly due soldiers leaving for war even if they don’t agree with the decision. This is further illustrated through the resignation of ex foreign secretary Robin Cook when Tony Blair (then prime minister) chose to go to war with Iraq; Cook stated that he couldn’t ‘accept collective responsibility for the decision to commit Britain now to military action in Iraq’.[18]In a democratic society decisions are expected to reflect the will of the people. Having the power to take such action without vote in parliament or to an extent the citizens outlines disregard for the rule of law, and demonstrates how in cases it cannot protect the citizen from the exercise of executive powers.
In our system, arbitrary power is supposedly absent. This is not necessarily the case when considering the laws we maintain on terrorism. The state has exercised its power to apply different laws to suspected terrorists than to other suspected criminals The dilemma of the “tipton three” where three Britons were ‘sent to Guantánamo Bay as suspected terrorists’, then ‘released without charge’ illustrates a prime example. The case of Congreave v The Home Office[19]The rule of law suggests that one should be “innocent until proven guilty” which was not respected in this instance.
A significant area regarding the rule of law protecting a citizen against acts of parliament is the offense of rape. According to the Sexual Offences Act 2003[20]a person ‘commits an offence if he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person, with his penis’[21]. The rule of law implies that you must be in breach of the law to be punished. Jane McKenna is an example of a citizen who was failed by the rule of law as she was raped with the result being the accused acquitted of the charges. Mckenna stated ‘It is something that has taken away my dignity’[22]. One could argue in this case that Raz’s interpretation of the rule of law as a political concept would have better suited
The separation of powers must be revisited regarding the executive powers that stem from it. Like the rule of law, the separation of powers is also not codified and therefore is more of a convention. Regardless of the Constitutional Reform Act
John P Franks claimed that ‘under no circumstances should the state impose additional inequalities; it should be required to deal evenly and equally with all of its people’[23]. In effect this is not strictly followed in light of certain executive powers one crucial in particular having the ability to declare war

Alright, I've got this question: "What are the implications when the rule of law is eradicated?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what the rule of law is. From what I remember, it's a principle where laws govern a nation, and everyone, including those in power, must follow them. So, no one is above the law. If that's taken away, what happens?

I should probably look into some definitions and maybe see what famous thinkers or legal experts have said about the rule of law. Maybe start with that.
