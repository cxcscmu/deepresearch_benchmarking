Alright, so I need to figure out how internships increase the chances of employment. I'm not exactly sure where to start with this, but I think breaking it down into smaller parts might help.

First off, what is an internship? From what I understand, an internship is a period of work experience that students or entry-level candidates undertake to gain practical skills and knowledge in their field of study or interest. It's often arranged through educational institutions or directly with companies.

Now, why would having an internship make someone more employable? I can think of a few reasons off the top of my head. Maybe it's because they get real-world experience, which looks good on a resume. Or perhaps it's about building a network within the industry. Also, some internships might lead directly to job offers from the same company.

Let me try to organize these thoughts. So, first, real-world experience. When you're just starting out in a career, you might have theoretical knowledge from school, but actually applying that in a professional setting is different. Internships provide that bridge between academia and the workplace. Employers often look for candidates who not only know the theory but can also apply it practically. So, having internship experience can demonstrate to potential employers that you've already started developing those practical skills.

Second, networking. Internships offer opportunities to meet professionals in your field, learn from them, and build relationships. These connections can be invaluable when you're job hunting. They can provide advice, referrals, or even directly offer you jobs. In many industries, who you know is as important as what you know, so building a professional network early on can give you an edge.

Third, direct job offers. Some companies use internships as a way to train and evaluate potential full-time employees. If you perform well during your internship, the company might offer you a job upon graduation or after the internship period. This can be a smoother transition into employment, as you're already familiar with the company and the work.

Are there any other ways that internships can boost employment chances? Maybe improving your resume. Having internship experience can make your resume stand out among other candidates who don't have that experience. It shows that you're proactive, willing to learn, and have already taken steps to gain relevant experience in your field.

Also, internships can help you develop soft skills, like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers. These skills are transferable across different jobs and industries, making you more versatile and attractive to potential employers.

Furthermore, internships can provide references or recommendation letters, which can strengthen your job applications. Having someone vouch for your abilities and work ethic can carry a lot of weight with hiring managers.

Let me see if there's any data or statistics that support the idea that internships increase employment chances. Maybe I should look that up.

Getting Ahead at Work
By Steve Milano Updated February 11, 2021
An internship can be considered a form of employment, depending on the terms of your work and the definition of “employment” someone is seeking. For example, you might be applying for unemployment insurance, or simply looking to put your internship on your resume as work experience. Understanding how different internships work will help you decided how to classify any one you complete.
What Is an Internship?
An internship is usually a temporary professional learning opportunity for a student or recent graduate who wishes to gain experience in a specific field. It can also be an opportunity for an older employee who is unemployed or looking to make a career chance to avoid a resume gap and earn valuable experience, while auditioning for any future job openings at the company.
Internships are usually short-term arrangements, such as during a school term or year, during a summer vacation or for the duration of a professional project. In exchange for providing assistance to a business, an intern gets experience from the company, which knows the intern is not as qualified as an employee and therefore requires ongoing training and instruction.
Some companies hire interns if the interns have some industry knowledge or training and can provide some value beyond simply running errands and making copies. Some companies don’t get much out of internships, but they want to help prepare the next generation of workers while they are still in school.
Paid vs. Unpaid Internships
Some internships provide wages and benefits while others do not. Unpaid internships are supposed to provide valuable experience that helps the intern improve his or her chances for landing a job in that profession. This is in addition to the opportunity to experience working in the profession to make sure it’s the right choice for the student, and to get real work experience. Many companies and universities combine internships with course credit.
Paid internships might not provide the same wages and benefits as full-time employment, but they can still help an intern cover the expenses of the internship (such as work clothing, commuting and lunches). Some internships pay well enough that the intern can save money to use for college or other expenses.
Contractor vs. Employee
Whether or not an internship counts as employment can be a matter of semantics or law. In the former case, you will often be able to say you were employed as an intern by the company you worked for and put the job stint on your resume. In the latter case, employers must follow all laws concerning the use of interns.
You should list your internship on your resume using the same formatting you use for paid jobs you’ve held, advises ZipJob. You should always note that the job was an internship to be transparent with potential employers.
Internships as Legal Employment
In some states, both paid and unpaid internships legally count as employment, giving you increased legal protections and access to benefits such as workers’ compensation and unemployment benefits if you are injured on the job or terminated.
When you are paid for an internship, the business for which you work might take payroll taxes out of your paycheck each period, just as it does with employees. If you get a small lump sum at the end of your internship, taxes might be handled differently. For example, if you are hired as a contractor, the company you work for doesn’t pay any of your taxes. In this case, you are a 1099 contractor vs. a W2 employee, depending on how you are classified under the terms of your internship.
Companies that use unpaid interns must follow legal rules for unpaid internships; using unpaid interns to avoid having to pay employees fair wages violates federal law, according to career-advice website CareerCast.

Research funded by the NACE Center for Career Development and Talent Acquisition
NACE Journal, May 2017
Research supporting the positive role that experiential learning plays in the career outcomes of college graduates has prompted institutions to consider the internship as an important curricular option. Despite the controversy over the value of paid versus unpaid internships, recent studies have indicated that students graduating with internship experiences, in general, are more likely than students without those experiences to find employment upon graduation (Callanan & Benzing, 2004; D’Abate, 2010; Gault, Redington & Schlager, 2000; Knouse, Tanner, & Harris, 1999; Knouse & Fontenot, 2008). Adding to the research, Look Sharp’s 2016 State of Millennial Hiring Report indicates that graduates who complete three or more internships are more likely to secure full-time employment, with 81.1 percent of graduates reporting that the internships helped them shift their career directions either significantly (34.8 percent) or slightly (46.3 percent) by changing the focus of classes or majors. Further, Knouse & Fontenot (2008) found that, in addition to having employment opportunities evolve directly from their internship sites upon graduation, interns have enhanced employability after successfully completing their internships even prior to graduation.
In the ASHE-ERIC Higher Education Report, Jones (2002) emphasized that internships provide advantages to graduates in the job market and urged institutions of higher education to transform their curricular offerings to include structured experiential learning. Other researchers have cited the value of internships for employers as recruiting tools (Coco, 2000; Gault et al., 2000; Hurst & Good, 2010). Employers responding to the National Association of Colleges and Employers’ (NACE) 2016 Internship and Co-op Survey indicated that their primary goal is converting graduates who have participated in internship or co-op programs into full-time employees. Similarly, the Gallup-Purdue Index, a 2014 inaugural study of the lives of 30,000 college graduates, supported the positive relationship between experiential learning and career outcomes. Lead senior researcher in the Gallup study John H. Pryor (Gallup, 2014) commented on the importance of preparing “all students for that great job” by “making internships and partnerships with faculty and industry and organizations available to all students.”
Research into the comprehensive internship program at Endicott College, the focus of this study, provided results consistent with the broader research explorations of the internship as a high-impact practice (Jones, 2002; Kuh, 2008; Miller et.al, 2011; Simons, et al., 2012) and as a means for enhancing students’ understanding of the types of positions that are in line with their career goals. Data derived from the Endicott College Career Center Graduate Report for the Class of 2015 have shown that graduates across all majors achieve consistently positive career outcomes as a result of their internship experiences. As an example, using the recommended NACE criteria (full- and part-time employment, post-graduate education, self-employment, and military service), the career outcomes rate for the Endicott graduating Class of 2015 was 98 percent. Fifty-three percent of the graduates reported securing their positions within the first year after graduation from former internship sites or internship site contacts, and 90 percent reported working within their respective fields of study. In addition, graduates indicated that their internship had either a “high” or “positive” impact on their successes in their first year of employment (Endicott College Career Center Graduate Report Summary, 2015 ).
Internship as Part of Curriculum
The internship program at Endicott College has been an integral part of the curriculum since the college’s founding in 1939. Graduates leave Endicott with both a diploma and a robust resume as a result of strategic programming integrating academic coursework and professional application. All students are required to undertake three credit-bearing internships over the course of four years: two 120-hour internships during the January or summer break of the freshman and sophomore years and a full-semester internship during the fall of the senior year. Each student is assigned an internship coordinator who is based in an academic department and who is responsible for guiding the student through the internship search process as well as monitoring the intern’s progress at the site. As early as the freshman year, students participate in classes to develop their professional competencies, from creating resumes to practicing interviewing techniques. Essential to the success of the internship program are the partnerships that are developed with employers through collaborations with Endicott’s Internship and Career Center.
Focus of the Study
Both the longevity and comprehensive structure of Endicott’s internship program has enabled the college to collect quantitative and qualitative survey data related to student and employer views of the program and the career outcomes of students within one year after graduation. In light of the debate ensuing over the impact of unpaid internships on career outcomes, Endicott College viewed the NACE Center call for research proposals as an opportunity to expand our research efforts beyond the experiences of recent graduates and consider the long-term impact of internships on the career outcomes of Endicott alumni employed for five years after graduation. In addition, our goal was to explore more fully the views of employers relative to the unpaid internship and its impact on a candidate’s employability. This article presents a summary of our findings.
The study focused on recent graduates who completed their degrees in May of 2015 and on alumni from the Class of 2010 to determine the immediate and long-term impact of the internship experience on career outcomes. Also included in the study were employers who have supervised Endicott students undertaking full-semester internships to explore the employers’ perceptions of the unpaid internship on a candidate’s employability. The research questions guiding the study were as follows:
Do (full-time) unpaid internships result in employment and/or the pursuit of post­graduate education within the first year?
What is the relationship between (full-time) unpaid internship experiences and career outcomes (advancement in positions and/or salary) five years after graduation?
What perception do employers have of the value of unpaid internship experiences on a candidate’s employability?
A mixed-method approach was implemented, using both qualitative and quantitative measures. First, data were collected through an annual survey administered to all 555 graduates from the Class of 2015 six months after graduation. A new question was added to the Class of 2015 survey to determine if the internship was paid or unpaid. The knowledge rate for the survey was 83 percent, which represented an 11 percent increase over the previous year.
The 2010 alumni survey was administered through a collaborative effort between the Endicott College Office of Alumni Relations and the Internship and Career Center. The entire undergraduate alumni population of 385 graduates from the Class of 2010 was recruited to participate in the study. A survey instrument was developed following the examination of available literature on this topic and distributed to all contacts that were available to the researchers. Since it is more difficult to reach alumni five years out than immediately post-graduation, two different modes of survey distribution were used (e-mail and social media). The most recent e-mail addresses, which were provided by the respondents themselves, were acquired from the Endicott College Office of Alumni Relations. A total of 106 completed surveys were received with a response rate tabulated at 36 percent.
Concurrently, the Endicott College Research Center distributed surveys to all 1,680 internship supervisors who had hosted at least one full-semester intern between 2011 and 2016. There were 327 supervisors who completed the survey—a response rate of 19.4 percent. The survey instrument consisted of a mix of quantitative and qualitative questions. The last question asked if respondents would be interested in participating in a focus group for further topic exploration. During the final part of the study, focus groups were conducted with a random selection of participants who had self-selected to participate.
The majority of the data collected for this study was quantitative. However, both the use of open-ended questions in the 2010 alumni survey and the employer survey further informed the survey results and helped guide the questions that were asked in the focus groups. A strength of this study was the use of participants who had direct knowledge of the experiences that we were investigating. Since all Endicott College seniors complete full-semester internships, our alumni and full-semester internship supervisors are in a unique position to contribute knowledge to this topic area. A limitation of the study was that the self-selected nature of participants may not be completely representative of the entire Endicott alumni population. In addition, although all 2010 alumni were targeted, the highest rate of response was from sports management (12 percent), communication (11 percent), interior design (9 percent), hospitality (8.5 percent), and criminal justice (7 percent) majors, leaving a few majors underrepresented.
Findings
The first research question asked if full-time unpaid internships resulted in employment and/or the pursuit of post-graduate education within the first year. Since a full semester internship is an academic requirement for all seniors, without the expectation of compensation by the employer, recent graduates were not asked if their internships were paid in past years. However, for the purposes of this study, a question on internship compensation was included. The responses were as follows: 20 percent paid; 9 percent unpaid, but with other compensation provided (such as parking and transportation stipend); and 71 percent unpaid.
Outcomes and Satisfaction
Career outcomes data indicated that 98 percent of 2015 graduates were employed full or part time, self-employed, enrolled in graduate programs, or enlisted in the military. Ninety percent of the graduates indicated that their employment was directly related to their fields of study, and 53 percent reported that they obtained their current positions directly from their internships or internship contacts. This provided useful information about the status of our recent alumni but did not provide any specific data about the relationship between paid versus unpaid full-time internship experiences and career outcomes.
The 2010 alumni survey was designed to delve further into this topic. Similar to 2015 graduates, the majority of the 2010 alumni had an unpaid internship experience (70 percent). Twenty percent of the respondents reported that they had a paid internship while 9 percent reported being unpaid, but receiving other compensation. Of the respondents who reported having paid internships, 62 percent received an hourly wage, 5 percent had a salary, and 33 percent received a stipend.
Approximately 57 percent of 2010 alumni reported satisfaction with their progress toward meeting their salary goals (strongly agree = 1, strongly disagree = 5). The majority (92 percent) also “strongly agree” or “somewhat agree” that they are satisfied with the success they have achieved to date in their careers.
Five Years Out: Salary, Satisfaction Unaffected
A chi-square test for independence indicated no significant association between paid/unpaid internships and current annual salary. In other words, there was no significant difference between having a paid versus an unpaid internship experience and salary level five years after graduation. Hence, it appears that graduates who complete full-time unpaid internships are just as likely to advance in their salary levels five years after graduation as graduates who are compensated.
A one-way between-groups analysis of variance was conducted to explore the impact of paid/unpaid internship status on levels of satisfaction in meeting salary goals. Participants were divided into three groups (Group 1: Paid internship; Group 2: Unpaid internship with some compensation; Group 3: Unpaid internship). There was no statistically significant difference found at the p<.05 level in level of satisfaction for the three groups.
An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the career satisfaction scores for alumni who had paid versus unpaid internships. Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with the following statement: “I am satisfied with the progress I have made toward meeting my goals for advancement in my position” (strongly agree = 1, strongly disagree = 5). The findings indicated that there was no difference in the degree of satisfaction with career advancement based on whether a participant had a paid versus an unpaid internship. In summary, our findings indicate that graduates who have completed (full-time) unpaid internships are just as likely to advance in their positions and/or salary levels five years after graduation as graduates who have completed (full-time) paid internships.
Employer Perceptions: Unpaid Internships and Employability
Our third research question delved into the perception of employers on the value of unpaid internship experience on a candidate’s employability. Of the 327 respondents, the highest percentage of employers who responded to our survey were from the business industry (15 percent), followed by employers from the communication field (12 percent) and employers from sports management (12 percent). Approximately, 10 percent of the employers surveyed self-identified as being in the field of psychology, 9 percent from interior design, and 8 percent from hospitality management. The majority (60 percent) of respondents were employed in the for-profit sector while 32 percent were from the nonprofit sector and 8 percent were from government. The majority (82 percent) worked in organizations with fewer than 500 employees. Nine percent worked in organizations with 500 to 1,000 employees, 3 percent in organizations with 1,000 to 2,500 employees, and 4 percent in organizations with 2,500 to 5,000 employees; the remaining 2 percent were in organizations with more than 5,000 employees.
Sixty-eight percent of respondents had accepted one to five Endicott interns at their site within the most recent fiscal year. Fifty-five percent of respondents reported hosting at least one Endicott full-semester intern over the past five years. Twenty-five percent reported offering paid internships while 51 percent offered only unpaid internships. Twenty-four percent offered both paid and unpaid internships at their respective sites. When asked what influenced their decisions to make an internship paid or unpaid at their sites, the majority (59 percent) reported that the decision was based on the available budget. Other factors that were indicated by employers were the student’s advanced skills/experience in the field (22 percent) and the need to recruit for the talent pipeline (13 percent).
The employers that responded that they offered paid internships at their respective organizations were also asked what form of compensation was provided to those interns. The majority (73 percent) reported providing an hourly wage to interns. Eighteen percent of those employers provided a stipend/reimbursement, approximately 3 percent provided a salary, and 6 percent provided some other form of compensation, such as a per diem or a commission opportunity.
Employers were also asked several open-ended questions on the survey. When asked if they had observed a difference in performance between candidates who had previously completed unpaid internships versus those with paid internships, the majority answered that they either had not noticed a difference or did not offer paid internships at their sites.
Some of the respondents did indicate that they saw an advantage in paid internships as expressed in the following statement:
It [has] been a mixed bag. We used to offer primarily unpaid internships. We placed much greater emphasis on the learning experience for the interns since that was the sole compensation. I would say we focus less on the “teaching” aspect in paid internships. The value for the interns is more likely found in the application of skills and learning as they go. From an employee perspective, I think paid interns perform better; however, if I were an unpaid intern, I believe I’d have more freedom to learn and experiment with less on the line financially.
In contrast, other employers reported that they found that unpaid interns performed better than paid interns at their respective sites. One employer stated:
I have found that unpaid interns are actually more eager to learn and get involved with the team and members of the club. We have only ever taken one paid intern and wouldn’t do it again as you don’t get the same response from them. Unpaid interns put the effort in and are eager to learn, whereas paid interns are more enjoying time away.
Many employers emphasized that, in general, the academic credit provided for an internship created an advantage over paid internships. One employer stated the following:
In my experience, students who are earning school credit have been more accountable than students just receiving monetary compensation. They seem to care more about their level of performance and the future impact it could have on their GPA for grad school or future internships.
Focus groups were also conducted with employers who host full-time semester-long interns. The consensus among focus group participants was that it did not matter whether potential job candidates had undertaken paid versus unpaid internships. Instead, what mattered most was how the individuals performed at their internship sites. An additional consensus of focus group participants was that interns who had unpaid internships were actually at an advantage because “ A job that is unpaid would let me know that the candidate has gone above and beyond. Likely shows a passion—willing to work without pay. Not just going through the motions and getting a paycheck.”
Overall, both the results of the employer survey and focus groups indicate that the majority of employers perceive unpaid internships as adding value to a candidate’s employability. The results also demonstrate that employers highly value job candidates with unpaid internship experiences and that the duration and structure of an internship (i.e., full-semester internship with academic credit), whether paid or unpaid, is highly beneficial for college graduates in terms of their employability and career advancement.
Conclusions
The Endicott College study made several important contributions to the existing body of literature on unpaid internships and career outcomes. We believe that using a sample of alumni five years after graduation improved upon many existing studies that collect cross-sectional data immediately from the post-internship experience or within the first year post-graduation. Furthermore, the use of an employer survey and employer focus group expanded the scope of the study and provided more concrete information about the value of an unpaid internship from an employer perspective. By surveying all supervisors who host full-semester interns from Endicott College, we were able to obtain the perspectives of employers across all majors. This multi-disciplinary aspect of the study is another important contribution to the existing literature as many past studies have focused solely on one academic discipline.
The analysis of data gathered from the internship program at Endicott College supports all three hypotheses proposed as the basis for this study on the value of unpaid internships and their impact on career outcomes. Findings indicate that graduates who have completed full-time, unpaid internships are just as likely to be employed or pursuing post-graduate education within one year following graduation as those who have completed full-time paid internships. Similarly, graduates who have completed full-time unpaid internships and have subsequently been employed for five years are just as likely to advance in their positions and/or salary levels as those who completed full-time paid internships. Finally, in the hiring process, the majority of employers did not favor candidates who had completed paid internships over those who had held unpaid internship positions. The factors most likely to influence hiring decisions, as cited by the majority of employers surveyed, related to the duration of the internship experience, the structure of the experiential learning program, and most importantly, the quality of the intern’s performance at the site.
While limited to Endicott’s internship program and graduates, the study supports the broader and more extensive research findings related to the value of the internship experience with or without monetary compensation. For example, a study completed in 2015 by Hart Research Associates in conjunction with the American Association of Colleges and Universities found that 73 percent of the employer respondents believe that requiring college students to complete a significant applied learning project before graduation would improve the quality of their preparation for careers; 60 percent of those surveyed indicated that they would be more likely to consider a candidate for full-time employment if he/she had completed an internship. Future research that includes a broader population of respondents within the higher education community is needed to expand the Endicott study and to provide a longitudinal analysis of findings related to career outcomes across institutions.
Because Endicott has a uniquely structured academic internship model, this research project allowed for the opportunity to evaluate the program in relation to job opportunities and career satisfaction based on an excellent response rate for recent graduates (83 percent) and a good response rate  for alumni employed for five years (36 percent). However, in the future, additional research projects such as this one are needed at other institutions of higher education to replicate the findings this study has produced. Specifically, instead of focusing on paid versus unpaid internship opportunities, more studies are needed to examine the impact of structured, credit-bearing internship experiences on career outcomes in order to create robust programs that fully prepare graduates to fulfill their career goals.

HIRE AN INTERN
Hiring student interns can be a valuable experience for both the employer and the student. By providing on-the-job training, internships allow students to receive academic and career knowledge at the same time, and employers are then able to hire from a more experienced pool of trained workers.
Contact your local Workforce Center to find out more about hiring an intern.

Preparing to Hire an Intern
Prior to hiring an intern, employers should verify compliance with Federal Wage law. Information can be found at the U.S. Department of Labor website, Wage and Hour Division. (See "Resources" below)
To exempt a student intern's wages from Unemployment Insurance premiums, the business must meet the requirements of 8-70-132 C.R.S., which states that: Employment does not include -- educational institution.
Employment does not include services performed by an individual who is enrolled at a nonprofit or public education institution which normally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly organized body of students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are carried on, as a student in a full-time program taken for credit at such institution, which combines academic instruction with work experience, if such service is an integral part of such program and such institution has so certified to the employer, except that this section shall not apply to service performed in a program established for or on behalf of an employer or group of employers.
If an employer would like to hire student interns, documentation from the educational institution must be obtained. This document should state that the service is an integral part of the academic program and that the program has not been established for or on behalf of any business.

Internships are increasingly important for students, employers, and experienced professionals in
                        career pathway planning and workforce development. They allow for employers to connect with high
                        quality talent in an ever more competitive labor market and utilize skills their incumbent workforce may
                        be lacking. They also provide great opportunities for students to apply their classroom learning to
                        invaluable real-world career experiences, and for experienced professionals to explore new career paths
                        or reenter the workforce.

Presence | Blog | How to Use Internships to Enhance the Student Experience
I have always shied away from jobs that I knew could not offer me the training and experiences relevant to my degree — marketing.
As a college senior, I’ve found that it is extremely difficult to find a part-time position that offers this added-value to my educational experience. But when I found out my university is partnered with several businesses within the community, I found Presence.
Within the past decade, there’s been a lot of discussion regarding the workforce readiness of college graduates. Specifically, graduates feel that they are prepared for the workforce, but employers disagree.
According to the 2016 Workforce-Skills Preparedness Report from PayScale, while nearly 90% of recent college graduates feel they are workforce ready, only half of their hiring managers agreed with them. Yikes.
The NACE Survey found that these are the skills that employers are looking for in their recently-graduated new hire:
Leadership
Ability to work in a team
Communication skills (written)
Problem-solving skills
Communication skills (verbal)
Strong work ethic
Initiative
Analytical/quantitative skills
Flexibility/adaptability
Technical skills
One way to build up these skills is through experiential learning opportunities, including internships. Internships allow students to improve their changes of post-graduation success and build a higher level of confidence when entering the workforce.
Throughout the course of my internship, I have refined all 10 of those listed skills through meaningful projects and tasks.
For example, I have significantly improved my written communication skills through blog writing and content creation. Additionally, my internship has assisted me in terms of personal and professional development by creating micro-projects on institutional research and analytics, facilitating an open and collaborative work environment, ensuring creative freedom in order to initiate and implement my own ideas.
To be blunt: Employers are looking for graduates with skills and experiences developed outside of the classroom.
Internship programs add value to the student experience. In turn, students who successfully complete internships increase their chances of being a desirable candidate for future employers.
Internship programs also help identify market trends and employer needs, positively impacting program success and learning outcomes.
In Florida, public institutions are funded according to 10 different metrics, which includes the median wage of baccalaureate graduates who are employed full-time. In the current job climate, it has become increasingly more difficult for students to obtain full-time positions post-graduation due to a few reasons, including workforce readiness.
According to Generation Opportunity, in 2016 the millennial unemployment rate was 12.8 percent, compared to the national average of 4.1 percent.
By rethinking your program structure and incorporating internships into the required curriculum, you’ll prepare your students for the workforce, enhance the student experience, and start shifting the national conversation in a positive way.
If you feel like you could do more with your internship programs on campus, these four ideas could help:
1. Build community partnerships
Universities often partner with businesses within the surrounding area, which establishes relationships and helps tailor institutional programming. By creating these partnerships you are giving students the opportunity to further network within the community in which they are receiving their education. Additionally, you’re making relevant work experiences that are sought after by employers more accessible.
You begin to establish these relationships by hosting specific events like internship fairs or interview days. Offer local businesses access to university job and internship posting board — those organizations might want to hire your students as interns, but not know how to reach you. Do some proactive outreach to connect your students with opportunities for their growth.
By doing these things you are mitigating time spent searching for specific partnerships by facilitating an open platform for employers to seek out your students and you’re making the internship search process less overwhelming for students.
2. Allocate stipends for unpaid internships
Something that is less common is universities offering need-based grants or stipends to students who are participating in unpaid internships.
There are several benefits to implementing a funding program for unpaid internships. By utilizing grants or internships you are allowing students to enrich their education through meaningful work experiences, acquire skills for their professional development, and learn what it is like to work in a non-profit environment.
Most importantly, these grants and scholarships could grant access to meaningful opportunities for students who would otherwise not be able to pursue them without this financial support. If stipends aren’t an option, consider what types of financial support your institution could offer. If the internship is local and taking place over the summer, could your institution offer significantly discounted housing? Could they opt to receive course credit? Which brings me to my next point:
3. Intern for course credit
A very common form of encouraging internships on campus is through an internship for credit courses — in fact, I am currently enrolled in an internship for credit program at my university.
Providing the option to receive credit for working in an internship is extremely enticing to students. Most students are aware of the value in an internship, and if their university is giving them a course worth of credits to take advantage of an internship opportunity, they will.
Some of the immediate benefits here for the university is that:
Your students are leaving your institution with a grasp on workforce readiness. And as I mentioned before, that could mean more funded being awarded to the university by the state.
Improving the overall community relationships of your institution.
Providing students with more meaningful and positive experiences.
A faculty or staff member may serve as the internship “sponsor” allowing the institution to confirm both the quality and amount of work performed during the internship.
4. Internship within the classroom
A unique possibility would be creating a blended internship course. Within the course structure, students would spend part of their time in the classroom learning about specific “essential skills” and why they are important and applicable to the workplace. Following their conceptual understanding of these skills, they would spend the second half of the course applying the skills discussed.
More specifically, students could be assigned to particular workstations across campus and apply their learned skills through experiences and activities required while on the job. For example, if one student is assigned to the marketing department, that student may be assigned tasks that would enhance their communication skills through writing tasks, or improve their technical skills by designing purposeful spreadsheets and documents.
With these options, encouraging students to participate in internships is simple.

Alright, so I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about how internships increase chances of employment.

First, from Doc 1, it's about whether internships count as employment. It says that internships can be considered employment, depending on the terms. It mentions that internships provide experience and help students decide if a profession is right for them. It also talks about paid versus unpaid internships and how some are legally considered employment.

But for my question, I need to focus on how internships increase employment chances, not just whether they count as employment.

Doc 2 seems more relevant. It's from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) and discusses the positive implications of internships on early career outcomes. It cites several studies showing that students with internship experiences are more likely to find employment after graduation. For example, Look Sharp’s 2016 State of Millennial Hiring Report indicates that graduates who complete three or more internships are more likely to secure full-time employment.

This doc also mentions that interns are more likely to get job offers directly from their internship sites or through contacts made during internships. It quotes a study where 53% of graduates got their jobs directly from internship sites or contacts.

Moreover, it talks about the long-term impact of internships, showing that even five years after graduation, alumni who did internships fare well in terms of career advancement and salary.

So, it seems that internships not only help in getting a job right after graduation but also have positive long-term effects on career progression.

Doc 3 is from the Colorado Department of Labor & Employment, and it's about guidelines for hiring interns, including compliance with wage laws and unemployment insurance. While important, this doesn't directly address how internships increase employment chances.

Doc 4 is from New Mexico's Department of Workforce Solutions, promoting internships as a way for students and employers to connect, but again, it's more about the general benefits rather than specifics on increasing employment chances.

Doc 5 is a blog post from Presence.io, discussing how internships can enhance the student experience and make them more employable. It mentions that employers often feel that graduates lack certain skills, and internships can help bridge that gap by providing practical experience.

The blog also lists the top skills employers look for, such as leadership, teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and others, and explains how internships can help develop these skills.

It also suggests ways universities can promote internships, like building community partnerships, offering stipends for unpaid internships, and integrating internships into the curriculum for credit.

So, from these sources, I can gather that internships increase employment chances in several ways:

1. **Practical Experience:** Internships provide real-world experience that complements theoretical knowledge from academics. This makes graduates more attractive to employers who are looking for candidates with both knowledge and practical skills.

2. **Networking:** Internships offer opportunities to build professional networks. Contacts made during internships can lead to job offers or recommendations, which are valuable in the job market.

3. **Direct Hires:** Many interns are hired directly by their internship providers upon graduation, especially if they perform well during their internship.

4. **Skill Development:** Internships help develop essential skills that employers value, such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership. These skills make interns more competitive in the job market.

5. **Resume Enhancement:** Having internship experience on a resume makes a candidate stand out from those without such experience. It demonstrates initiative, relevance, and a head start in career development.

6. **Career Clarity:** Internships help students understand their career interests and aptitudes, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their career paths and potentially aligning them better with job opportunities.

7. **Adaptability and Work Ethic:** Through internships, students can showcase their adaptability to workplace environments and their strong work ethic, which are highly valued by employers.

Considering all these points, it's clear that internships play a multifaceted role in enhancing a student's employability. They not only provide direct pathways to employment through conversions but also equip students with the skills and experiences that make them more appealing to a wide range of employers.

Therefore, the answer to "how internships increase chances of employment" is that they offer practical experience, networking opportunities, direct hire possibilities, skill development, resume enhancement, career clarity, and demonstrations of adaptability and work ethic.
