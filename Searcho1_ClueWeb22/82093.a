As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information on various worldviews, including the Christian worldview, regarding solutions to human problems.

In the Christian worldview, human problems are often attributed to sin, which is understood as humanity's separation from God due to disobedience and moral failure. According to Christian teachings, the solution to these problems lies in reconciliation with God through faith in Jesus Christ.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identification of the Problem:** Christians believe that the fundamental problem of humanity is sin, which separates individuals from God. This sin nature is believed to be inherited from Adam and Eve's original sin.

2. **Nature of Sin:** Sin is not just specific actions but a state of being that affects every aspect of human life, leading to suffering, conflict, and ultimate spiritual death.

3. **Divine Solution:** Christianity proposes that God, out of love for humanity, sent his son, Jesus Christ, to earth to die on the cross as a sacrifice for sins. This event is central to Christian belief and is seen as the means by which humanity can be reconciled to God.

4. **Role of Faith:** Believers must accept Jesus Christ as their savior and Lord through faith. This faith is considered the pathway to salvation and the resolution of human problems.

5. **Transformation and Guidance:** Once saved, Christians are expected to live according to God's will, guided by the Holy Spirit. This involves personal transformation, moral living, and seeking to follow biblical principles.

6. **Communal Support:** The church community plays a crucial role in supporting believers, providing fellowship, teaching, and encouragement in their spiritual journey.

7. **Eschatological Hope:** Christians also look forward to the ultimate resolution of all problems in the afterlife, where heaven represents perfect communion with God free from suffering and sin.

It's important to note that interpretations can vary among different denominations and individual believers. Some may place more emphasis on social justice and practical solutions to human problems, seeing these as part of living out their faith.

In summary, according to the Christian worldview, the solution to human problems is found in reconciling with God through faith in Jesus Christ, leading to personal transformation and eternal life.
