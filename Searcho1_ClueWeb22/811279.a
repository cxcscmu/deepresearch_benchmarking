So I've been given this question: "Should private citizens be allowed to own guns?" It's a pretty big topic, and it's one that people have strong opinions about. I need to think this through carefully.

First off, I should probably understand what's being asked here. The question is about private citizens owning guns, not about law enforcement or military use. So, it's specifically about ordinary people having firearms for personal use.

I think it's important to consider both sides of the argument. There are arguments for why people should be allowed to own guns, and there are arguments against it. Let me start by looking at the reasons people might support gun ownership.

One common argument in favor of gun ownership is the right to self-defense. Many people feel that having a gun gives them a way to protect themselves and their families from harm. In some places, crime rates are high, and people might feel that they need a gun to feel safe.

Another reason is for hunting and sport shooting. In many countries, hunting is a traditional activity, and people enjoy it as a way to connect with nature and even as a source of food. Sport shooting is also a recognized sport in many places.

There's also the historical and cultural significance of guns in some societies. For example, in the United States, the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms, which has been interpreted to allow for individual gun ownership.

On the other side, there are arguments against private gun ownership. One major concern is public safety. Guns can be dangerous, and when more people have access to them, there's a risk of increased gun violence, including homicides and suicides.

There's also the issue of accidental shootings. Even if someone owns a gun responsibly, accidents can happen, especially if there are children in the household.

Moreover, there's the problem of guns falling into the wrong hands. Criminals might get hold of guns illegally, which can lead to more violent crimes.

I think it's also worth considering the statistics on gun ownership and gun violence. I should look up some data to see if there's a correlation between the two.

Gun ownership and gun violence in America, by the numbers
February 15, 2018 / 12:23 PM / CBS News
Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida claimed 17 lives and injured more than a dozen others. It was not the first mass shooting - or even the first shooting at a school - in 2018. Below are some statistics on gun ownership and gun violence in America.
357 Million
That was the number of guns in the United States in 2013, according to a Washington Post review of data from the Congressional Research Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. At the time that figure was determined, there were only 317 million people living in the United States – meaning the country had roughly 40 million more firearms than residents.
3 percent
That's the percentage of people who own over half of the nation's guns, according to survey data compiled by researchers at Harvard University and Northwestern University.
400,000
That's the number of firearms stolen every year, according to the same Harvard/Northwestern survey data.
Over 3 million
That's the number of times federal, state, or local background checks have denied a gun to person prohibited from owning one, according to a Department of Justice study published in 2016.
18
That's the number of times a weapon has been fired on school grounds in 2018, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that favors stricter regulations on guns.
In eight of the incidents, a gun was fired but no one was injured.
Two of the incidents were suicides.
Of the other eight, three happened in Texas, two in California, two in Michigan, and one happened in Florida (Wednesday's shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland.)
Over 150,000
That's the number of students attending primary or secondary schools in the U.S. who have experienced a shooting on their campus, starting with the 1997 shooting at Columbine High School. The figure comes from the Washington Post, which analyzed "online archives, state and federal enrollment figures, and news stories." The Post notes that at least 170 such schools have been affected.
30
That's the number of mass shootings that have occurred thus far in 2018, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a website that aggregates data "from over 2,500 media, law enforcement, government and commercial sources."
1,827
That's the number of deaths that have occurred in 2018 as a result of shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
11,564
That's the average number of Americans murdered every year by gun violence, according to The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control organization. The number was obtained, according to the group, by averaging "the most recent five years of complete data from death certificates (2011-2015) and estimates of emergency room admissions (2010-2014) available via CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System.
114,994
That's the average number of Americans annually "shot in murders, assaults, suicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, or by police intervention," according to the Brady Campaign.

19 Amazing Gun Violence Statistics [2022 Update]
19 Amazing Gun Violence Statistics [2022 Update]
Branka Vuleta
January 04, 2021
The topics of guns and violence have always gone hand in hand, especially in the eyes of mainstream media. Ask a hundred random people about what they think regarding the degree of correlation between guns and violence, and you’ll no doubt get a resounding “high” as your answer.
Now:
Gun violence statistics have traditionally been a mixed bag of extreme opinions. From pro-gun lobbyists to anti-gun lobbyists, there has been little in the way of a balanced argument. This is where the information you will find here differs from most of the sources on the internet. By employing a non-biased approach, we will provide you with facts and information from which you can be empowered and fully informed.
The things is:
Simply labeling gun violence as “bad” or as being on the increase is neither good enough nor logical, as these are simply sweeping statements that mean nothing when examined.
After all, let’s also not forget:
Gun shooting statistics clearly show that guns can be used as defensive or deterrent tools and measures, keeping the peace instead of disturbing it.
Most of what we know about guns comes from either what we see in the movies or what the media chooses to tell us. Having movies and the media as your primary source of gun violence facts is definitely not a good roadmap for anyone looking for revealing and unbiased facts.
With all that said, let’s dive right in.
Fascinating Gun Violence Stats (Editor’s Choice)
418 mass shootings took place in the US last year.
Gun violence severity in high school shootings has increased by over 50%.
Police officers are 75% more likely to be victims of gun violence in high gun ownership states than in low gun ownership states
Over 500,000 bump stocks may be in US civilian hands.
82 mass shootings that took place on US soil between 1982 and December 2019 involved guns that were legally obtained.
Gun Crime Statistics under the Microscope
1. 39,383 people died as a result of gun violence in 2019.
This figure comes from the FBI gun violence statistics and information from the Gun Violence Archive. As staggering as it is, it only tells part of the story when it comes to gun violence facts. This is because although it includes the number of the 24,090 of gun-related suicides, featured in full in gun suicide statistics, it doesn’t incorporate the 29,765 additional injuries related to firearms.
This is due to the fact that most gun deaths statistics only take into account primary deaths related to guns (deaths that occurred within a week of the gun-related injury).
2. In 2019 alone, there were 36 shootings at K-12 schools.
Statistics on gun violence in the US highlight the fact that shooting incidents at K-12 schools are a major concern. Gun crime statistics from 1970 to 2019 show a small but worryingly steady increase in K-12 school shootings, with 2018 topping off a staggering amount of 97 shootings.
Although the figure has dropped significantly in 2019 to 36 shootings, the overall data over the last decade shows a steady rise in shootings.
Which leads to the fact that...
3. Most American children are just as likely to be killed by a gunshot as they are by cancer.
According to some of the most shocking gun violence stats, most children in the US are in danger of being a victim of gun crime. In fact, firearm-related injury is the second most common cause of death for children, accounting for 15% of all child deaths.
4. Police officers are 75% more likely to be victims of gun violence in high gun ownership states when compared to low gun ownership states.
US gun violence statistics against police officers conducted over the last decade show that the likelihood of officers being shot in high gun ownership states rested around the 75% mark, something that represents firearms statistics. Unsurprisingly, large numbers of guns in an area were shown to directly correlate with the increased risk of officers being shot.
Mass Shooting Statistics
5. 418 mass shootings took place in the US last year.
Although this figure is high, it does show a decrease of 5% within the United States gun violence statistics. This encouraging trend has been attributed to the gun control legislation support that has been garnished by students of Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
The students launched a deluge of campaigns following the Parkland shooting incident that took place on their school grounds. As a result, they were able to gain the support of the media and the public, which effectively led to the government introducing more stringent gun control laws, something that has gone a long way towards bringing down American gun violence statistics.
6. Gun violence severity in high school shootings has increased by over 50%.
According to gun violence statistics FBI, some of the deadliest mass shooting incidents in the US in recent years have taken place at high schools.
Statistics on gun violence show that in addition to the Parkland shooting incident, 10 students were killed and 14 were wounded in the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas. And in Kentucky, Marshall County High School saw 2 students killed and 16 wounded. These figures from 2018 and are 54% higher than those seen 5 years previous in 2013.
7. Over 500,000 bump stocks may be in US civilian hands.
Statistics of gun violence reflect that the sales of items called bump stocks -- devices which can be attached to semi-automatic weapons to increase their fire rate -- have led to the devices being in the hands of nearly half a million US citizens. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) estimates a total of 539,000 bump stocks to still be in civilian circulation.
The issue being:
The federal government banned the sale of bump stock devices in December 2018. But prior to that, thousands of the bump stocks were being sold to the public, and some were even bought in bulk.
Unintentional Shootings
8. 82 mass shootings that took place on US soil between 1982 and December 2019 involved guns that were legally obtained.
Gun control stats show a recurring and prevalent pattern that shows the vast majority of shootings have been carried out with illegally obtained firearms.
And gun control facts clearly show gun registration and background checks are woefully inadequate and largely at fault.
Child gun violence statistics clearly reflect that 82  shootings in the US since the early 1980s involved legally owned guns, while only 16 involved guns that were illegally obtained.
9. Every day, 90 people are unintentionally shot in the US.
The number of unintentional shootings is on the rise. Current data and CDC gun violence statistics show that in 2019, approximately 90 people were unintentionally shot in the US on a daily basis. Although gun violence statistics worldwide highlight are growing, the US overtakes this rate of growth by almost 2.5%. Analysts and experts attribute this to lax laws on firearm purchase and possession. In addition, more guns are also finding themselves in the hands of minors or inexperienced owners.
10. On an average day in the US, only one person is killed by legal intervention.
World gun violence statistics point to a disturbing fact that amidst the large number of gun-related deaths that take place in the US on a daily basis, only one of these is due to legal intervention.
11. Every 16 hours, someone in the US is killed by an unintentional shooting.
The gun violence rates for gun crime and accidental death are on the rise and are under current scrutiny from many different watchdog organizations. But what isn’t always factored into most statistical analysis and gun death statistics is the number of unintentional shootings that occur.
Shockingly...
The latest data reflects that at least one person will die in the US as a result of an accidental shooting every 16 hours.
12. One in three children in the US lives in a household that stores a loaded and unlocked firearm.
Alarming gun control statistics show more children are exposed to the dangers of accidental shootings or have access to firearms that can prove as a convenient yet devastating outlet for any troubled young individual. Figures reflecting gun violence statistics by state show an increase in this problem, and no sign of decline.
Gun Death Statistics
13. Over 36,000 people are killed in the US every year.
The US has become a country where guns are have become judge, jury, and executioner. Gun statistics show that over 36,000 Americans lose their lives every year due to gun crime.
Which means:
Approximately 100 lives are lost to gun violence daily on American soil.
Did you know...
14. The majority of gun crime deaths (61%) are the result of suicide.
The growth of suicide by gun statistics shows a sad picture as to the state of affairs between Americans and firearms and our inadequate approach to mental health and wellbeing.
15. 2549 of gun-related deaths are due to unintentional shootings.
Gun violence in America statistics reflect that the number of unintentional shootings has been rising for the last ten years. With laws only recently seeing a tightening, the last decade has given birth to a slew of gun-related crimes due to protocols and measures for background checks and monitoring being mainly ineffective and flawed.
As a result, last year alone saw a saddening 2549 deaths due to unintentional shootings, a figure that is 15% higher than gun violence statistics 2018. What’s more, over 70% of those unintentional shootings involved children under the age of 18.
16. Over 1000 people are shot and killed by police officers yearly.
Police shootings severely damage the trust between communities and law enforcement. Trust is fragile in poor areas at best, and shootings can result in irreversible damage.
At present:
The number of gun deaths in the US reflects that over 1000 people are killed daily due to police shootings.
Urban Gun Violence
17. 52% of gun homicide victims in the US are black males.
Gun violence statistics 2019 show rates in communities of color have now reached epidemic proportions. Unfortunately for residents in these types of areas, the majority end up paying for the mistakes of the few. Most gun crime in these areas is caused by a small percentage of individuals (approx 13%), meaning that the remaining 87% are left to deal with the aftermath.
Amazingly:
52% of gun homicide victims in the whole of the US are black males, despite black males making up only 7% of the US population.
Which means that...
18. Black Americans are 10 times more likely to be shot than white Americans.
Facts about gun violence and results from studies on gun homicide deaths over the last decade show that black Americans were up to 10 times more likely to be shot and killed than white Americans.
Which leads us to the fact that often...
19. A small part of a city (5% or less), can account for the majority of its crime.
Empirical data, gathered and collated from gun homicide statistics, shows that most of the gun violence in US cities can be attributed to small parts of a city.
A great example of this can be found in Boston where the cost of gun violence is taking a heavy toll on its inhabitants. In this major US city, gun violence is on the rise. As a standalone fact, one can easily assume the city must be all at fault. However, when placed under the microscope, we find that over 53% of Boston’s gun crime occurs in less than 3% of the city.
To Sum It All Up
As you can see from our list of alarming gun-related violence statistics shared today, incidents and deaths are on the rise in the US.
Despite firearms being synonymous with gang-related crimes or suicides, a large aspect of most civilian related gun crime revolves around children.
The key here is really not to demonize guns in any way, shape or form, as that would be a fool’s errand.
The US has championed and will perhaps always champion the people’s right to own firearms in order to defend their homes and families. Challenging this right would only give rise to a reactive backlash from extreme pro-gun groups and lead to further complications.
Instead, it would be wise to put time and effort into decreasing gun death rates by making sure gun owners pass more rigorous background checks. They also need to undergo more consistent monitoring protocols to ensure the responsible use of firearms. Finally, gun owners need to be educated in the proper use and storage of their weapons. By implementing these measures, we can make positive strides toward moving away from statistics of a negative nature and move toward more positive ones.

Gun Control Statistics And Safety Facts
Blog
22 March 2019
Gun control facts and statistics
The United States is listed as the country with the most number of civilian gun owners. Recent Gun Control Statistics show that there are about 120 guns per every 100 Americans. Gun ownership in the United States is not as complex as every citizen of legal age has a right to own a gun for protection purposes. The legal system has put in place measure to ensure that firearms are controlled among citizens. Ownership, manufacturing, allocation of, and destruction of firearms is regulated by the federal gun laws in place.
What is Gun Control? Gun Control Statistics Explained in Detail
The gun control debate often turns up after every mass shooting. But what exactly is entailed in firearms regulations? In essence, gun control can be defined as the set policies that police the manufacture, ownership, sale, and transfer of guns by common citizens. Gun control proponents push for legislation, enforcement, and application of measures that will limit the ownership and use of firearms by civilians. The second amendment of the American constitution interprets the policies for gun possession. Those who oppose gun control argue that restricting the use of guns is unwise because citizens will not be able to protect themselves when faced with danger. The Gun Control debate is still a contentious issue that is widely discussed by the American public and congressional committees. Some view the regulation of guns as one of the solutions to stop mass shootings.
The recent past has unfortunately seen a rise in mass shootings and misuse of firearms by both legal and illegal gun owners. The deaths reported have caused numerous debates in the public domain and Congress, yet nothing conclusive has been achieved so far. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), 2019 alone has had a total number of 10950 gun incidents across the country. 2979 people have lost their lives so far. Gun control statistics show that 2018 registered the highest number of school shootings ever, with 94 school gun violence incidents. The US Naval Postgraduate School also reported that 55 people were killed in the gun attacks. Most of these shootings happen in places like businesses, private residences, worship buildings like churches and temples, government properties and of course schools and any other open place.
Gun deaths in the United States get an awful great deal of attention. Rightfully so, as a developed nation, the rate of violent deaths including a gun, and the horrendously regular shootings targeting schools, is high. Compared to the whole world though, the U.S. rate can be found in well listed below nations such as El Salvador and Venezuela which had 72.5 and 64.3 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2016, respectively. According to the Little Arms Survey, in the U.S. this rate is 3.1.
5 of the Deadliest Mass Shootings in the United States in the Past Decade
Las Vegas Shooting: October 1, 2017.
The shooter was 64-year-old Stephen Paddock who opened fire in a concert at the Mandalay Bay Resort and casino. 58 people lost their lives and about 500 were wounded. The shooter opened fire for about 15 minutes before law enforcers got to the scene. Stephen Paddock was later found dead in a hotel room. His death was ruled as a suicide.
Orlando Shooting: June 12, 2016.
29-year-old Omar Saddiqui Mateen started shooting at revelers in a gay night club in what came to be one of the worst mass shootings in the US. 49 people died and about 53 sustained injuries. Police reports showed that Omar had links with the terrorist group ISIS. He was shot dead in the club as police tried to free the hostages he had held captive.
Virginia Tech shooting: April 16, 2007.
Seung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old student began shooting random people at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, in Blacksburg. The mass shooter of Korean descent killed 32 people and injured about 20 others. The shooting happened in two locations; West Ambler Johnston Hall and Norris Hall. Seung-Hui Cho later turned the gun on himself.
Sandy Hook Shooting: December 14, 2012.
20 children between the ages of 6 and 7, and 6 adults who were staff and members of Sandy Hook Elementary school faculty were killed by Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old mass murderer. The shooter had shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, at home before going on a shooting spree at the Connecticut school. The shooter later killed himself.
Sutherland Springs Shooting: November 5, 2017.
The lives of 26 people and one unborn child were put to an end by one Devin Patrick Kelley. 20 others were injured in the mass shooting which took place at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The 26-year-old was found dead in his car in what police believed to be a self-inflicted death. The Sutherland Shooting recorded the highest number of deaths caused by mass shootings in places of worship.
How likely are you to die in a mass shooting? It is the least of your worries. You are more than a thousand times more likely to die from Parkinson's Disease.
A Shift In Gun Control Mindset
When taking a look at the period prior to the Parkland shooting, it is interesting to see how younger generations feel about gun control.
The support for gun control over the defense of gun rights in America is greatest among 18 - 29 years of age, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, with a spike after the shooting in 2016 at an Orlando nightclub. The general trend is showing a decrease in support for gun control over weapon rights considering since the year 2000.
Safety Measures for Gun Owners
You can't ignore the Gun Control Statistics presented in this article. At Centerfire Shooting Sports we take gun safety very seriously and we believe that responsible firearm owners are not a threat to society. However, gun safety starts with you, the gun owner. The following tips are crucial to becoming a responsible firearm owner.
Understand the firearm you are using
Do not use any gun without properly researching on how it should be handled. Know every part of your gun and understand how to operate it. Do not use a gun you are not familiar with out of curiosity or just because you find it fancy. Different guns have features which vary from one gun to another. Do not jump to use a pistol if you are only familiar with shotguns. Get to learn about everything mechanical about your gun.
Unload your gun when not using it
Make it a habit to only load your gun when you are in a shooting area or a safe field. Otherwise, ensure that your ammunition is stored in a secure place. Isolate your firearms even as you load them. Always remember to unload the gun after you are done using it. Do not go with the loaded gun in your car, house or any other place where the gun can be accessed by either children or people who are not authorized to handle firearms. Open the action, look at the receiver, magazine and the chamber before handing out your gun to others.
Use the right ammunition
Go through your manual and ammunition boxes to understand the type of ammunition your firearm needs. Using the wrong ammunition will not only damage your firearm but also cause unnecessary accidents. You may not know this but a single cartridge of incorrect caliber or gauge can destroy your firearm. Check your gun's specifications on the manual to be sure of the suitable ammunition. The experts at Centerfire Shooting Sports are always on hand to answer any questions you might have about your guns and ammunition.
Protect your eyes and ears when shooting
Wear protective gear when you go for target practice. It is important that you have ear and eye protection. The sound that comes from shooting can be too loud and damage your ears. Always wear shooting glasses as they will protect you from falling shots, twigs, solvents that irritate the eyes, and keep you safe in case the gun malfunctions. Do not go on a hunting spree without an ear and eye protection.
Service your gun on a regular basis
Guns need continuous servicing just like any other mechanical devices or equipment. Taking care of your gun will ensure that it does not wear easily and lasts longer. Do not hand your gun over for servicing to an amateur; be sure that whoever has it is skilled and will not alter anything inside. You can consult your manufacturer on how often your firearm needs servicing. Centerfire Shooting Sports has an on site gun mechanic that can also service your gun.
Never use your gun when under the influence
Avoid consuming alcoholic drinks, prescription medicine or any other drug that has an effect on your body when using guns. This is because you need to be in the right state of mind before shooting. Having taken in any drug may make you lose focus and shoot things you had not targeted. Do not be tempted to use your gun even for fun when you are not in a sober state.
Take note of the muzzle at all times
This is perhaps the most common rule everyone who possess a gun is told. Ensure that the muzzle is pointed in the right direction. Most of the gun accidents reported are caused by people who do not point the muzzle in a safe direction. This leads to people accidentally shooting at things they had no intentions of shooting. Point the muzzle towards a direction in which the bullet cannot hit people around. Make it your responsibility to know where the muzzle points at all times.
Attend a gun safety class
Centerfire Shooting Sports offers many gun safety classes for beginners and advanced shooting courses and experiences for group shooting events and corporate outtings. View our calendar or browse our website for more information or call our office to find out more information at 1-913-782-4900.
Bottom Line
Guns, gun laws, and gun possession policies vary from country to country. Worldatlas.com states that Serbia, Yemen, Cyprus, and Saudi Arabia are the other top four countries with the highest ratio of firearms owned by 100 people. Gun owners in America have the right to own any type of firearm they wish. Gun laws vary from state to state and so one is advised to look at the laws before visiting a particular state.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a non-governmental organization that prides itself in defending firearm ownership and advocating for equal rights and safety for every gun holder in the United States. The organization has been receiving some heat in the recent past, as gun control supporters feel like NRA members are a stumbling block to gun regulation. The bottom line is every adult who owns a gun should be responsible with how they handle the weapon because despite the fact that it can keep you safe, a gun can be dangerous to self and those around you.

Alright, so I've got some statistics here about gun ownership and gun violence. Let's see what they're saying.

First, there are a lot of guns in the US—over 300 million, which is more than the number of people. That seems like a lot. And a small percentage of people own a big share of those guns. Also, thousands of guns are stolen each year, which could contribute to illegal gun usage.

Looking at gun violence statistics, there are a high number of deaths and injuries caused by guns each year. For example, in 2019, there were nearly 40,000 deaths related to guns, and over 29,000 injuries. That's a significant number.

School shootings are a particular concern. In 2018, there were 97 shootings at K-12 schools, which decreased to 36 in 2019. But still, any number is too high. And these incidents often involve legally obtained guns.

There's also the issue of unintentional shootings. Every day, about 90 people are unintentionally shot, and one person is killed by an unintentional shooting every 16 hours. That's alarming.

Suicide is a major component of gun deaths, accounting for about 61% of gun-related deaths. So, guns are not just used in homicides but also in suicides.

In terms of gun control, some states have implemented background checks for gun purchases, which seems to be a step towards regulating gun ownership.

Now, considering all this, should private citizens be allowed to own guns? It's a complex issue. On one hand, there's the argument for self-defense and the constitutional right to bear arms. On the other hand, there are serious concerns about public safety, gun violence, and the risks associated with widespread gun ownership.

Maybe I should look into other countries' approaches to gun control and see how their policies affect gun violence rates.

What Are Gun Control Laws In Other Countries? 9 Nations The US Should Learn From

9 Countries The U.S. Should Learn From When It Comes To Gun Control
PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images
By Lani Seelinger
Oct. 6, 2017
If you've lived in the United States for your whole life, maybe you don't know the sad truth about gun violence in the country — it's not normal. Heartbreaking mass shootings don't happen at this same rate literally anywhere else in the world. There are myriad countries the U.S. should learn from about gun control, but first it helps to take note of exactly how much of an outlier the United States really is when it comes to its obsession with guns.
According to the BBC, more Americans own guns than anywhere else in the developed world. Gun homicides account for a greater percentage of homicides overall than anywhere else in the developed world, by a huge margin. High-powered assault rifles cost approximately the same as a new MacBook. Even since the heartbreaking massacre at Sandy Hook, there have been over 1,500 mass shootings. In fact, the country averages one mass shooting a day.
And yet even though the research is clear that more guns leads to more gun deaths, both across U.S. states with differing laws and across the world, the pro-gun control lobby still faces seemingly insurmountable challenges. The well-funded NRA has an iron-fisted grip on many members of Congress and state legislatures across the country, making it exceedingly difficult even to get the most basic gun regulation bills passed. Let this be a reminder — it does not have to be this way. Gun control has worked wonders in other countries, and here are just a few examples.
1
Australia
Jeff Grace on Twitter
Australia is often tossed around as an example of gun control that the United States can learn from, just because it offers such a stark contrast to the way we've gotten used to things working in the United States. In 1996, a gunman killed 35 people in a mass shooting that shook Australia to its core. Following that shooting, the country instituted a mandatory, across-the-board buyback of certain types of guns, in addition to a ban on buying any of them in the future.
The result? Australia hasn't had a mass shooting since. The buyback and ban didn't erase gun violence from the country entirely, but in 2014, for example, there were only 35 gun-related homicides — that translates to only 0.15 people per 100,000 murdered by a gun. And it didn't only affect homicides — there has also been a 74 percent drop in gun-related suicides since that change in Australia. There's absolutely no way to look at the stats and say that gun control doesn't work.
2
The United Kingdom
Duncan on Twitter
The United Kingdom is another place where mass shootings led to huge change in the country's gun control laws, with one mass shooting in 1996 leading to a handgun ban and a buyback of thousands of guns. While gun control in the U.K. hasn't been as effective as it was in Australia, it's still led to a steady decline in the murder rate and a much lower rate of gun-related deaths than in the United States.
Gun rights advocates often point to non-gun related violent crime in the U.K. as a reason why gun control is useless — but there's no way to get around the fact that fewer gun-related deaths mean fewer mourning families and friends and fewer lives lost. And after all, a violent crime carried out with a knife as a weapon has no chance of killing as many people as one with a gun.
3
Israel
US News Agency on Twitter
Most civilians in Israel know how to use a gun, given that the country has mandatory military service for both men and women. However, guns are tightly regulated under Israeli law, even for soldiers. They aren't, for example, allowed to take their guns home on leave, and PBS reports that individuals have to pass a screening and prove that they have genuine cause to own a gun before they are granted the license.
Guns are an every day part of life in Israel, but thanks to the strict controls placed on gun-owning civilians, the country only sees about two gun-related deaths per 100,000 people, according to Vox.
4
Japan
victoria on Twitter
Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with 127 million people in a country much smaller than the United States. And yet, in 2014, Japan had only six gun-related deaths. No, they haven't banned all guns outright; people are allowed to own shotguns and air rifles but not handguns or anything like assault rifles. The biggest difference between gun control in the United States and Japan is the extremely strict set of procedures that any prospective gun owner has to go through in Japan before they can buy a gun.
The BBC explains that you have to go to a class and pass a shooting test, in addition to a written exam. The authorities will check your mental state and your recent drug tests, and they'll interview your colleagues and your family members about you. Police will come check to make sure that you're actually storing your guns where you said you'd be storing them, and then guess what? You have to reapply for a license every three years. Yes, there's a different culture surrounding guns — but these gun control measures have helped to almost completely get rid of gun crime in Japan.
5
The Czech Republic
The Czech Republic is similar to the United States in that a good segment of the population owns guns, and there is a thriving gun culture in the country. It's dissimilar, however, in that one shooting in a rural town far from the capital sent the country into a frenzy when it took place in 2015.
The difference is that it takes a lot more to own a gun in the Czech Republican versus in the United States. Someone wanting to buy a gun has to pass written and practical tests related to guns, be deemed to be in a solid mental state, be in good health, and have a clean criminal record. The Czechs may be attached to their guns, but thanks to the regulations they have in place, the country still has an extremely low rate of violent crime.
6
Canada
Jean Yoon on Twitter
Canada also maintains strict control over gun ownership, which also allows it to maintain a very low rate of gun homicide — only 5.1 deaths per 1 million people, even though about three of 10 individuals in Canada own guns on average. They require intense background checks for anyone trying to buy a gun, and one telling requirement that sets them apart from the United States is the fact that they insist on safe storage of guns. They have to be locked up and unloaded — a requirement that would make it all but impossible for toddlers to murder people with guns, a heartbreaking occurrence that happens all too frequently stateside.
7
Germany
Cornelia on Twitter
You're as likely to be killed by a gun in Germany as you are to be killed by a falling object in the United States. In case you're not familiar with the statistics, that translates to just over two deaths by gun per million inhabitants. There are a lot of guns in Germany, but the controls are just so strict that gun crime is all but unheard of.
The Guardian reports that background checks, again, are a huge part of what keeps German citizens so safe. People under 25 who try to buy a gun have to go through rigorous psychiatric testing, and people over that age can be called in for the same tests if they display anything that authorities deem to be troubling behavior, which can even be something like drunk driving. People can't inherit usable guns; inherited guns have to be modified so as to be unusable. Also, police can carry out random checks of gun owners' households to make sure that the guns are being stored safely — given that the Second Amendment calls for "well regulated" gun ownership, there's no reason why this couldn't be constitutional in the United States.
8
Singapore
enne on Twitter
Singapore has absurdly strict gun control laws — punishments for possessing guns can even include caning. Using a gun can sometimes lead to the death penalty. Yes, these laws are draconic, fitting of a state like Singapore with authoritarian tendencies — but they have led to one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
9
Norway
ChristianChristensen on Twitter
Norway is another popular target for gun rights activists, because despite the country's strict gun laws, the Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik was able to carry out a mass killing spree that claimed the lives of 77 people, many of them children.
The mass shooting rocked the country — and the world — and The Guardian reports that it even led to stricter gun control laws in Norway's fellow Nordic nation of Finland. But while Breivik showed in the most chilling way that Norway's gun control laws were possible to bypass, the country did not tighten those laws after the shooting — because they decided that they were already tight enough. And unlike in the United States, this decision hasn't led to any more instances of gun-related terrorism. While part of that is certainly due to a different culture surrounding guns, part of it is also due to the fact that Norway makes it very difficult for anyone to own a gun, so it's simply not as easy to carry out a massacre on Norwegian territory.
Gun control advocates in the United States. have a long way to go, and a lot of work to do. The facts are clear, though — the world offers many cases where gun control has been a success, and there's something to learn from each and every one of them.

Four countries with gun control – and what America could learn from them
The UK, Australia, Japan and Germany have all taken measures to reduce gun homicides. Can the US learn anything from them?

Thirty people will be shot dead in America today. On average. It could be more. If it’s less, then more will die tomorrow. Or the next day.
The United States’s gun homicide rate is 25 times higher than other high-income countries, according to a recent study.
It took one massacre: how Australia embraced gun control after Port Arthur

Americans are divided on whether the country’s gun deaths could be reduced through tougher laws on gun ownership. Liberals argue that legal restrictions on gun ownership could save lives. Conservatives say that tougher gun laws would do nothing to change the behaviour of violent criminals.
Even the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting that left 20 first-graders dead was not enough to convince American lawmakers to pass new gun control laws, with many people seeing the ownership of guns as a crucial check on government tyranny. The country’s highest court has ruled that outright bans on civilian ownership of handguns are unconstitutional.
After similar mass shootings, other countries have taken more dramatic steps to regulate gun ownership. A look at four countries show that tougher gun laws have been central to these efforts, but that enforcement and culture may also play important roles in preventing violence.
UK
From the moment 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton unloaded his legally held arsenal of handguns on children and staff at Dunblane primary school on 13 March 1996, gun control was on the cards.
Nothing like Dunblane – a massacre of 16 five- and six-year-olds, along with the teacher who tried to protect them – had taken place before in Britain. The shock and collective grief of the whole nation resonated from the northernmost point of Scotland to the tip of Cornwall. This was not the United States, where by 1996, classroom shootings had occurred in many places including Nashville, San Diego and South Carolina.

As grief turned to a national anger, public debate focused on how someone like Hamilton, a former Scout leader who had been ostracised because of his suspicious behaviour with young boys, had been allowed to own such lethal weapons.
Public petitions, most notably by the Snowdrop Campaign, founded by friends of the bereaved families, called for a total ban on the private ownership and use of handguns in the UK. Signed by 750,000 people it was symbolic of the weight of public opinion.
Nine years before Dunblane, there had been Hungerford, where Michael Ryan went on a rampage through the Berkshire town, killing 16 people in a series of random shootings before turning the gun on himself. He had been carrying a handgun and two semi automatic rifles, for which he had firearms certificates.
The aftermath of Hungerford brought to an end the right to own semi-automatic firearms in Britain; they were banned along with pump action weapons, and registration became mandatory for shotgun owners.

With Dunblane the focus turned to handguns – held by tens of thousands who took part in pistol shooting across the country. The Conservative then prime minister, John Major, passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 after the Cullen inquiry into the massacre. It banned all cartridge ammunition handguns, except 22 calibre single-shot weapons.
But with the landslide election of Labour and Tony Blair the same year, the law was tightened further, and the remaining .22 cartridge handguns were also banned. The decision, supported by a majority of the public, all but wiped out target shooting as a sport in the UK.
Dave Thompson, chief constable of the West Midlands, and the lead on gun crime for the National Association of Chief Constables, said: “The legislation coincided very well with a culture.”
Overnight, however, about 200,000 owners of handguns, most of whom kept them for pistol shooting, found their weapon banned and their pastime wiped out. All small-bore pistols and rifles used by target shooters were included in the ban. Penalties for anyone in possession of an illegal firearm were tough - from heavy fines to prison terms of 10 years.
The hostility of those involved in the sport to what they term the draconian legislation is still strong, 20 years after Dunblane. Mike Wells, secretary of the Sportsman’s Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, set up in 1996 to counter public pressure for a ban on handguns, said politicians had been driven by a need to show they were doing something but their actions did nothing to stop the criminal use of guns. “It never, never has any effect. The criminal underworld in England, the drug dealers … have all got guns, but they are illegal guns,” he said.

Mark Mastaglio, an expert on firearms who worked for the Forensic Science Service for 20 years, said there was no evidence that the ban on handguns after Dunblane had done anything to cut the criminal use of firearms. “It was very rare that there was ever leakage from the licensed gun owners to the criminal fraternity. Most guns used by criminal are either illegally imported or converted weapons. And that remains the case today,” said Mastaglio.
Crime statistics in the years after the ban was introduced appear to support the theory that it had little impact. Gun crime rose sharply, to peak at 24,094 offences in 2003/4. After that the number of crimes in which a firearm was involved fell consistently, to 4,779 offences in 2013. In the year ending September 2015 there was a small rise of 4% to 4,994 offences.
Thompson said the legislation was only part of it: law enforcement agencies had to prove they would carry through on the tough penalties and there was also poor policing of gang areas, and poor ballistics records and analysis. Both were addressed in the early 2000s, when there was a huge decline in gun crime, he said.
But there has been only one mass shooting in the UK – in Whitehaven, Cumbria, in 2010, during which Derrick Bird killed 12 people – since Dunblane.
Mastaglio said: “Dunblane was certainly a turning point. It was a huge piece of legislation, and had a huge impact on registered gun owners in the UK. We now have one of the most stringent set of firearms legislation in the world – only Japan has tougher laws.”
Japan
Japan has what may be the closest any country comes to “zero-tolerance” of gun ownership – a policy that experts say contribute its enviously low rates of gun crime. As of 2011, legal gun ownership stood at 271,000, according to police records, in a country of 127 million people.
There were six reported gun deaths in Japan in 2014, according to the National Police Agency. In 2006 just two people were killed in gun attacks; when the number rose to 22 in 2007 it prompted a bout of national soul-searching.
In his seminal 1993 paper for the Asia Pacific Law Review, whose conclusions still hold true more than 20 years later, David Kopel described Japanese gun control laws as “the most stringent in the democratic world”.
The 1958 law on the possession of swords and firearms states: “No one shall possess a firearm or firearms or a sword or swords.” Among the few exceptions are shotguns, but here too, the restrictions would cause outrage among American gun owners.

Before they can even lay hands on a shotgun for hunting and sport shooting, prospective owners must attend classes and pass written and practical exams. They must then undergo psychological assessments to determine they are fit to own a firearm. Police background checks are exhaustive and even extend to the gun owners’ relatives.
The aim, according to Kopel, is to make possession of a shotgun so complex and drawn out that few people believe it worthwhile applying for one.
Civilian ownership of handguns is banned. The few violations reported in the media usually involve members of the country’s many crime syndicates who have managed to smuggle them in from abroad.
But Japan was not always a low-crime, gun-intolerant nation. Guns quickly became the weapon of choice for feuding warlords after Portuguese traders introduced them to the country’s south-west in the early 1500s. Over time, Japan improved the design and performance of firearms and began mass producing them.
The beginning of the end of widespread gun ownership came when the feudal warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537-1598) unified Japan, then disarmed the peasant population by banning civilians from owning swords and firearms in 1588.

“The shogunate banned them because they were fearful of the consequences of having guns in hands of an angry populace,” said Robert Whiting, author of Tokyo Underworld. The quid pro quo, Whiting added, was that the general population’s safety would be assured provided they paid their taxes.
The notion that gun ownership should be limited to the authorities survived Japanese militarism and carried through to the postwar period. Japanese police officers did not begin carrying pistols until 1946, with the permission of the US-led occupation authorities.
Despite sporadic outbreaks of gun violence, Japan’s yakuza crime syndicates are reluctant to build up caches of firearms. Threatening a rival with a gun is often seen as an “unmanly” departure from the yakuza’s traditional code of honour, to which even modern-day mobsters try to adhere, according to Whiting.
Kopel says Japan’s gun laws do not necessarily prevent criminals – especially the yakuza – from acquiring guns. But, he added, even gangsters “see themselves as within the social system, in a broad sense. Even when breaking the law, they still play by certain rules of society.”
Australia
Eerily, Australia’s moment of truth also occurred almost exactly 20 years ago, when a shooting spree in a gift shop in Port Arthur, Tasmania, resulted in 35 people dying in about half an hour. It was the worst mass shooting by one person in Australia’s history. The killer, Martin Bryant, received a sentence of 35 terms of life imprisonment.
Less than two weeks later, Australia’s then prime minister, John Howard, announced a sweeping package of gun reforms in a country where guns had long been considered an essential prop in the national mythology of life in the bush.
“Port Arthur we acted on,” said Tim Fischer, then Howard’s deputy prime minister. “The USA is not prepared to act on their tragedies.”
Before Port Arthur, most states had a weak licensing system and no requirement to register guns. Howard proposed each state and territory should introduce and enforce a firearm licensing and registration system which required people to have a “genuine reason” for having a firearm, such as sport or target shooting, recreational hunting or being a farmer.
Howard also introduced a national gun buyback policy for all weapons that did not comply, which led to the buying and melting down of more than 650,000 firearms at a cost of A$350m (now £185m). One study said the buyback cut the rate of firearm suicides by 74% in the first 10 years.
There have been no mass shootings in the 20 years since Port Arthur; in the 20 years before the massacre there had been 13.
However, since the 1996 National Firearms Agreement, four states have moved to wind back the mandatory 28 days “cooling off” period between applying for and buying a gun, a trend Howard has described as disturbing.
One of those states was Tasmania.
Germany
Germany’s relationship with firearms is intriguing: while there are a lot of guns in the country, they don’t seem to kill a lot of people.
Germany has one of the highest weapons-per-head rates in the world. In 2014, 5.5m legal weapons were registered as being in the hands of 1.45 million private individuals. The country’s police union estimates the number of illegal weapons in the country to be considerably higher, around 20m. According to GunPolicy.org, this puts Germany at 15th place out of 175 nations in terms of guns per capita.
Gun ownership is more widespread in the west of the country than in the former East Germany, where private gun ownership was illegal before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Recent reports suggest that gun ownership is rapidly increasing still: between November 2015 and February 2016 alone, 20,000 applications were filed for new gun licences.
Yet in Germany gun homicide rate is one of the lowest in Europe: a death rate of 0.05 per 1,000 people, compared with 3.34 in the US. In fact, incidents of gun crime, including both weapons being fired and used to threaten people, have declined by almost a quarter since 2010 (pdf).
Experts put this trend down to a number of tweaks to gun law in the wake of high-profile shootings.
In 2002, a 19-year-old student in the Thuringian state capital, Erfurt, shot dead 16 people at the school that had recently expelled him, using weapons he had obtained from his gun club.
Within a year, the law regulating access to guns had been changed: Germany is the only country in the world where anyone under the age of 25 who applies for their first firearms licence must undergo a psychiatric evaluation with a trained counsellor, involving personality and anger management tests.
Experienced hunters or sports shooters over the age of 25 may be called in for psychiatric tests if they display certain kinds of behaviour, such as being caught drink-driving.
A further tweak to the gun law in 2008 means that inherited guns have to be fitted with a state-of-the-art blocking mechanism, making them unusable.

There were calls for even more stringent laws after 17-year-old Tim Kretschmer shot dead 15 at a school in Winnenden near Stuttgart in March 2009. Kretschmer had obtained his weapons from an arsenal of 15 guns kept by his father, who was a member of a shooting club.
Under the newly amended weapons act, it is now harder for individuals to own multiple weapons. A national gun register was established for the first time in 2013 – previously, records of gun ownership were kept only at regional level.
Police officers can now also visit registered gun owners’ home for spot checks without warning. Guns in private possessions have to be locked away in a safe, with the security code or location of the key known only to the owner of the gun.
A number of politicians went even further in the wake of the Winnenden massacre, calling for a complete ban on the storage of firearms in private homes. Even hunters or sportsmen, they argued, should have to deposit their arms at centralised depots.
The proposal was rejected after protests from hunters, who argued that they frequently need access to weapons at short notice, such as when wildlife was involved in traffic accidents.

How gun control works in America, compared with 4 other rich countries
By German Lopez @germanrlopez german.lopez@vox.com Updated Mar 14, 2018,  9:48am EDT
The horrifying mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School offered yet another tragic reminder of America's gun problem: The US has much more firearm violence than its developed peers.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
One reason for this difference is the abundance of guns in America. According to a 2007 survey, the US led the world in the number of civilian-owned firearms with 88.8 guns per 100 people, while second-place Yemen fell far behind at 54.8 guns per 100 people. And the research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center, has repeatedly found a link between a higher number of guns and higher levels of gun violence.
A common explanation for this is that America has some of the most lax gun laws in the world. But are US gun laws really that different from those of other developed nations?
I looked into that question, breaking down gun laws in several developed countries based on media reports, studies on gun violence, national databases, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence's analysis of American gun laws, and the Law Library of Congress's reviews of gun laws around the world.
I found the US really does have the most relaxed gun control measures in comparison with other developed nations.
Based on the research, that's a significant reason the US leads its developed peers in gun violence. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews,found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence. That's a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.
Here's a guide to the gun control laws of some of the countries I looked at: the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and Japan — a mix of wealthy nations with similar and varying cultural backgrounds.
United States
Gun ownership rate (2007 ): 88.8 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 29.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works: There are several barriers to buying a gun in America, but there are generally so many loopholes in the current laws — even fairly restrictive city and state laws — that most people can buy a gun without too much of a problem.
Some people are technically prohibited from buying guns. People who are underage (under 18 for rifles and shotguns, and under 21 for other guns), someone convicted or indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, fugitives from justice, the severely mentally ill, unlawful users of controlled substances, those convicted of domestic violence, and undocumented immigrants are among some of the categories of people barred from buying a firearm by federal law.
Some types of guns are also restricted. Under federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, so it's illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use. Automatic weapons also tend to have more restrictions and registration requirements than other guns. Meanwhile, semiautomatic and non-automatic firearms are generally legal, barring state laws. And some states also ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.
Restrictions on purchasers are typically evaluated through a background check. Under the federal system, licensed dealers are required to run these checks before they can sell someone a gun, typically by having the FBI check a person's criminal record, mental health history, and other factors. If someone fails a background check, he or she can't legally buy a gun.
The most well-known way to bypass background checks is the private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a friend or family member, no gun background check is required. This is often mischaracterized as the gun show sale loophole, under the assumption that people can simply go to a gun show and buy a gun without getting a background check. But licensed dealers at gun shows still have to carry out a background check. The actual loophole is that someone can meet with a private seller at a gun show — or, increasingly, over the internet — and buy a firearm from that person without a background check. In other words, the gun show doesn't create a loophole; the private seller does.

But an equally big problem is that the system of background checks is notoriously underfunded, understaffed, and underresourced, allowing red flags to slip through. Although there are no waiting periods under federal law, a check that turns out inconclusive can be extended for three business days for further investigation. But these three days are a maximum for the government — and sometimes, the three days lapse without the FBI completing its check, and a buyer can, at that point, purchase a gun without the completed check.
The FBI admitted that something like this happened for Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015: Roof should have failed a background check for a handgun purchase after admitting to illegally possessing controlled substances in the past, but the FBI examiner did not obtain the shooter’s record in time.
The federal background check system also largely relies on states' reports, including some data for mental health history and criminal records. Since states have their own budget issues to deal with, or may simply ideologically oppose the idea of background checks, states' noncompliance can create yet another way the system can fail to stop someone who shouldn't buy a gun from obtaining one.
Of course, state laws vary widely. Some states restrict and ban certain types of firearms, particularly assault weapons. A few require certain licenses, registration, or training to buy and own certain guns. Several states ban or restrict open carry, and many require permits for concealed carry. Some require background checks and permits for private sales, and several rely on their own background checks instead of only the federal system. And many states try to make it as easy as possible to buy, own, and carry any type of gun. (Slate has a good rundown of differences in state laws.)
Many gun restrictions are limited by the Supreme Court's recent interpretations of the Second Amendment. For instance, the court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008, citing an individual's right to bear arms.
Broadly speaking, studies have found that states with stricter gun control laws have fewer gun deaths, and places — not just states, but cities and countries, too — with fewer guns have less gun violence after controlling for socioeconomic variables and other types of crime.
Generally, America's gun laws are far more relaxed than those of the other countries on this list. And even if your city or state is restrictive, interstate travel is so easy that it's fairly easy to go to another state to buy a gun, although this runs afoul of some states' laws. Several analyses of places with restrictive gun laws — Chicago and Illinois or "the Iron Pipeline," for example — have found that's exactly what happens in many cities and states, with guns typically flowing in from neighboring or nearby jurisdictions with laxer gun laws. The result: If you want to buy a gun in America, there's almost certainly a way to do just that, regardless of your local laws.
Canada
Gun ownership rate (2007): 30.8 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 5.1 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Canada keeps guns somewhat accessible to the general population, but maintains major restrictions on different types of guns, who can buy them, and how they're purchased. The result is a system that looks like a stricter version of the US — so some sort of firearm ownership is still a possibility, but not something that's done very easily.
Canada puts guns into three categories: prohibited (most handguns that have a short barrel or are .32 or .25 caliber, fully automatic weapons, guns with sawed-off barrels, and certain military rifles like the AK-47), restricted (some handguns, some semiautomatic rifles, and certain non-semiautomatic rifles ), and non-restricted (regular and some military-style shotguns and rifles ). The general idea is that more dangerous guns face much harsher regulations and restrictions on purchase, ownership, and storage.
Prohibited guns are, as their name implies, prohibited, but people who obtained and maintained a registration certificate before they were banned in December 1998 can keep those specific guns. All restricted and prohibited firearms must be registered, but non-restricted guns no longer have to be registered after April 2012.
In general, you must be 18 or older to buy a gun in Canada. Some exceptions are made for minors 12 to 17 owning a non-restricted firearm — but only if a licensed adult is responsible for the gun.

Canada requires a license to own a gun and ammunition, and buyers to pass safety course tests. Licenses must be renewed every five years.
Licensing requires fairly stringent background checks. An "applicant for a firearm license in Canada must pass background checks, which consider criminal, mental, addiction and domestic violence records," according to the Library of Congress's review of Canada's laws. The background checks also consider whether an applicant has been treated for a mental illness, if the person was associated with violence, threats, or attempted violence, and whether the person has a history of any behavior "that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person." On top of traditional background checks, each license applicant needs to submit third-party character references.
In addition to licensing requirements, Canadians can only obtain a permit to carry firearms in public in very limited circumstances — typically with the requirement that "an individual needs restricted firearms or prohibited handguns for use in connection with his or her lawful profession or occupation" or to protect life. There are no such federal requirements in the US, although some states place certain restrictions or bans on concealed and open carry.
Unlike federal laws in the US, Canadian laws require safe gun storage — locked in a room, compartment, or container that's difficult to break into, with a trigger or cable lock, or both, depending on the type of firearm. Guns must be unloaded when stored. And similar storage requirements apply to guns that are being transported, with laxer rules for non-restricted firearms compared to prohibited and restricted ones.
United Kingdom
Gun ownership rate for England and Wales (2007): 6.2 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate for England and Wales (2012): 0.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works: The United Kingdom maintains some of the strictest gun laws in the West and the world, which helps explain why it also has some of the lowest levels of gun homicide among developed nations.
For one, handguns are generally banned, with exceptions only for police officers, members of the armed forces, and people with special permission from the home secretary. Military-style weapons are also prohibited.
For other types of firearms and ammo, individuals must go through a stringent licensing process. They must give a "good reason" — such as job requirements, sport, or shooting vermin — to own a gun. Self-defense is not considered a good reason. Local police chiefs are expected to verify that an applicant's reasons for owning a gun are legitimate. For example, police might see if a person really has vermin in his or her house to the point that it requires a certain type of gun to deal with the pests.
Gun owners also must meet background checks, which involve a review of a person's criminal record, mental illness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and references regarding mental state, home life, and attitudes toward guns. Licenses must be renewed every five years, although they can be revoked earlier if police find that someone's gun ownership poses public safety risks or a person no longer has a good reason for the license.

The UK also has an age requirement of 18 for gun ownership. Firearm ownership also might involve storage requirements that meet "British safety standards," which are evaluated by local police, who particularly check the possibility of unauthorized access to guns by an owner's family members or other associates.
One major exemption to the licensing requirements: People can participate in gun clubs even if they don't hold a certificate "when engaged as a member of the club in connection with target shooting," according to the Library of Congress's review of UK laws. But these gun clubs must meet all sorts of criteria, including security and storage arrangements for guns and ammo.
Gun laws can be enforced very strictly: Anyone found unlawfully possessing a firearm faces a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.
The UK passed many of its gun restrictions in response to public outcry after several mass shootings. One of the shootings sounds eerily like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place in Connecticut in 2012, as described by Clare Feikert-Ahalt for the Library of Congress: In 1996, "Thomas Hamilton walked into a primary (elementary) school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed 16 small children, aged four to five, and their teacher in the school gym before killing himself.  Hamilton lawfully held the two rifles and four handguns that he used for the massacre, and had lawfully held firearms for almost 20 years prior to this incident."
According to Feikert-Ahalt's report, law enforcement's consensus in the UK is that the restrictions did not stop all gun violence, but did limit it. And although the rules are strict, more than 700,000 certificates were in effect for the period between 2008 and 2009, suggesting that gun ownership is certainly possible despite the hurdles involved.
Switzerland
Gun ownership rate (2007): 45.7 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 7.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Switzerland is perceived to have one of the more accepting cultures toward guns in Europe. Laws let militia members in the country (where all able-bodied men are required to serve in the military, except for conscientious objectors) keep their issued personal weapons in their homes, and Swiss statutes and traditions respect the right to bear arms.
But the country's restrictions are still somewhat more stringent than the US.
For one, automatic weapons are outright banned for civilians.
Private gun ownership generally requires a license, for which an applicant "must be at least 18 years of age, may not have been placed under guardianship, may not give cause for suspicion that he would endanger himself or others with the weapon, and may not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions for nonviolent crimes," according to the Library of Congress's review of Swiss gun laws. The license is valid for six to nine months, and it's usually valid only for one weapon.
But rifles and semiautomatic long arms used by recreational hunters are exempt from licensing requirements.

The licensing requirement also only applies to dealers, with an exemption for private sellers. Still, the law requires private sellers to verify the identity and age of the buyer by checking an official identification document, and private sellers must have no reason to believe the buyer has been or should be disqualified from firearm ownership — requirements that aren't necessary for private gun sales under US federal law.
For anyone to carry a gun for defensive purposes, the licensing process requires the applicant to demonstrate the need to protect himself or others and pass an exam. But no carrying license is required for transporting an unloaded weapon for "legitimate purposes" like hunting and traveling to a shooting range, as long as the ammo is kept separate from the weapon. In comparison, the license to carry is a requirement that only exists in a minority of US states.
In recent years, Switzerland has reformed its gun laws for militia members after several incidents in which militia members killed themselves or others with their issued weapons. In 2010, for instance, rules were amended to let militia members voluntarily deposit their guns in an armory. And if police, courts, prosecutors, or a military commandant finds danger of abuse or improper handling or maintenance of a militia member's personal weapon, it can be confiscated — with the possibility of further punishments, including fines and imprisonment.
Switzerland's restrictions show that a country can have a culture that is broadly more receptive to the idea of gun ownership while maintaining some restrictions that make firearms less accessible to potentially dangerous people and improve public safety. But it's perhaps no coincidence that the country is second only to America among developed nations in terms of firearm homicide deaths — although the Swiss rate is still four times lower than the US's rate.
Japan
Gun ownership rate (2007): 0.6 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 0.1 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Japan makes it very hard to buy and own guns, with some of the strongest gun control laws in the world. The system is so restrictive that even Japan's criminals, which through the notorious yakuza can be highly ingrained in corrupt government agencies,  largely see gun ownership as a liability, as Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained.
"Under current laws, if a low-level yakuza is caught with a gun and bullets that match, he’ll be charged with aggravated possession of firearms and will then face an average seven-year prison term," longtime Japan correspondent Jake Adelstein wrote in the Japan Times. "Simply firing a gun carries a penalty of three years to life. And … a yakuza boss may decide a death sentence is more appropriate if his thug miraculously gets released on bail before going to jail [because accomplice laws could get the boss indicted along with his subordinate]."
In a 2012 article for the Atlantic, Vox's Max Fisher explained the rigorous process for buying and owning a firearm, which can only be done for special purposes like hunting, professional necessity, and gun competitions:
To get a gun in Japan, first, you have to attend an all-day class and pass a written test, which are held only once per month. You also must take and pass a shooting range class. Then, head over to a hospital for a mental test and drug test (Japan is unusual in that potential gun owners must affirmatively prove their mental fitness), which you'll file with the police. Finally, pass a rigorous background check for any criminal record or association with criminal or extremist groups, and you will be the proud new owner of your shotgun or air rifle. Just don't forget to provide police with documentation on the specific location of the gun in your home, as well as the ammo, both of which must be locked and stored separately. And remember to have the police inspect the gun once per year and to re-take the class and exam every three years.
In addition to these requirements, there are age restrictions for gun ownership — 18 generally, 14 for athletes, and 20 for hunters. People can't fire their guns except for the specific reasons given for obtaining a firearm in the first place. And officials have enormous authority for supervising someone's gun ownership, including the ability to conduct nationwide inspections of gun owners' weapons and storage facilities — with prior notice to gun owners — and the ability to require owners to temporarily submit guns to the authorities following a disaster or incident that disturbs the public peace.
On top of those restrictions, there's a separate permit for buying ammunition, which can also limit how much ammo someone can buy.
Civilian possession of handguns is also banned, except for research purposes.
Partly as a result of its stringent laws, Japan has very low levels of gun violence — not just compared with the US, but compared with any other country. As Fisher wrote in 2012, there was a bit of a national scandal when the number of gun homicides in Japan — a country of nearly 130 million — rose from two in 2006 to 22 in 2007, even though both are shockingly low rates of gun homicides. In 2013, the gun homicide rate was 350 times higher in the US than in Japan.
Gun homicide rate per 100,000 people in the US and Japan in 2013
Gun homicides per 100,000 people
Gun homicides per 100,000 people
None of this is to suggest that one could simply import Japanese — or other nations' — gun laws to the US, easily implement such policies, and see US gun violence fall to match its developed peers. After all, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, and Switzerland are very different countries with varied cultural and socioeconomic influences. And non-US countries started with comparatively few guns in circulation, so it's been relatively easy to restrict guns and keep their prominence low  — whereas the US now has more guns than people, so it would be much harder to scale back access to firearms and levels of gun ownership.
But based on the research and other countries' experiences, more restrictive gun laws could at the very least make shooting deaths much less common in the US.

#3: Gun Control Has Reduced The Crime Rates In Other Countries | GOA
Section 7: Three Common Gun Control Myths
#3: Gun Control Has Reduced The Crime Rates In Other Countries
Written by
				          Gun Owners of America Published: 29 September 2008
Myth #3: Gun Control Has Reduced The Crime Rates In Other Countries
1. Fact: The murder rates in many nations (such as England) were ALREADY LOW BEFORE enacting gun control. Thus, their restrictive laws cannot be credited with lowering their crime rates.1
2. Fact: Gun control has done nothing to keep crime rates from rising in many of the nations that have imposed severe firearms restrictions.
* Australia: Readers of the USA Today newspaper discovered in 2002 that, “Since Australia’s 1996 laws banning most guns and making it a crime to use a gun defensively, armed robberies rose by 51%, unarmed robberies by 37%, assaults by 24% and kidnappings by 43%. While murders fell by 3%, manslaughter rose by 16%.”2
* Canada: After enacting stringent gun control laws in 1991 and 1995, Canada has not made its citizens any safer. “The contrast between the criminal violence rates in the United States and in Canada is dramatic,” says Canadian criminologist Gary Mauser in 2003. “Over the past decade, the rate of violent crime in Canada has increased while in the United States the violent crime rate has plummeted.” 3
* England: According to the BBC News, handgun crime in the United Kingdom rose by 40% in the two years after it passed its draconian gun ban in 1997.4
* Japan: One newspaper headline says it all: Police say “Crime rising in Japan, while arrests at record low.”5
3. Fact: British citizens are now more likely to become a victim of crime than are people in the United States:
* In 1998, a study conducted jointly by statisticians from the U.S. Department of Justice and the University of Cambridge in England found that most crime is now worse in England than in the United States.
* “You are more likely to be mugged in England than in the United States,” stated the Reuters news agency in summarizing the study. “The rate of robbery is now 1.4 times higher in England and Wales than in the United States, and the British burglary rate is nearly double America’s.”6 The murder rate in the United States is reportedly higher than in England, but according to the DOJ study, “the difference between the [murder rates in the] two countries has narrowed over the past 16 years.”7
* The United Nations confirmed these results in 2000 when it reported that the crime rate in England is higher than the crime rates of 16 other industrialized nations, including the United States.8
4. Fact: British authorities routinely underreport crime statistics. Comparing statistics between different nations can be quite difficult since foreign officials frequently use different standards in compiling crime statistics.
* The British media has remained quite critical of authorities there for “fiddling” with crime data. Consider some of the headlines in their papers: “Crime figures a sham, say police,”910 and “Police figures under-record offences by 20 percent.”11 “Police are accused of fiddling crime data,”
* British police have also criticized the system because of the “widespread manipulation” of crime data:
a. “Officers said that pressure to convince the public that police were winning the fight against crime had resulted in a long list of ruses to ‘massage’ statistics.”12
b. Sgt. Mike Bennett says officers have become increasingly frustrated with the practice of manipulating statistics. “The crime figures are meaningless,” he said. “Police everywhere know exactly what is going on.”13
c. According to The Electronic Telegraph, “Officers said the recorded level of crime bore no resemblance to the actual amount of crime being committed.”14
* Underreporting crime data: “One former Scotland Yard officer told The Telegraph of a series of tricks that rendered crime figures ‘a complete sham.’ A classic example, he said, was where a series of homes in a block flats were burgled and were regularly recorded as one crime. Another involved pickpocketing, which was not recorded as a crime unless the victim had actually seen the item being stolen.”15
* Underreporting murder data: British crime reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially low. “Suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside a bar. They are arrested for murder, but because of problems with identification (the main witness is dead), charges are eventually dropped. In American crime statistics, the event counts as a three-person homicide, but in British statistics it counts as nothing at all. ‘With such differences in reporting criteria, comparisons of U.S. homicide rates with British homicide rates is a sham,’ [a 2000 report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary] concludes.”16
5. Fact: Many nations with stricter gun control laws have violence rates that are equal to, or greater than, that of the United States. Consider the following rates:

6. Fact: The United States has experienced far fewer TOTAL MURDERS than Europe does over the last 70 years. In trying to claim that gun-free Europe is more peaceful than America, gun control advocates routinely ignore the overwhelming number of murders that have been committed in Europe.
* Over the last 70 years, Europe has averaged about 400,000 murders per year, when one includes the murders committed by governments against mostly unarmed people.17 That murder rate is about 16 times higher than the murder rate in the U.S.18
* Why hasn’t the United States experienced this kind of government oppression? Many reasons could be cited, but the Founding Fathers indicated that an armed populace was the best way of preventing official brutality. Consider the words of James Madison in Federalist 46:
Let a regular army, fully equal to the resources of the country, be formed; and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government; still it would not be going too far to say, that the State governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger . . . a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands.19

England is a prime example of how crime has increased after implementing gun control. For example, the original Pistols Act of 1903 did not stop murders from increasing on the island. The number of murders in England was 68 percent higher the year after the ban’s enactment (1904) as opposed to the year before (1902). (Greenwood, supra note 1.) This was not an aberration, as almost seven decades later, firearms crimes in the U.K. were still on the rise: the number of cases where firearms were used or carried in a crime skyrocketed almost 1,000 percent from 1946 through 1969. (Greenwood, supra note 1 at 158.) And by 1996, the murder rate in England was 132 percent higher than it had been before the original gun ban of 1903 was enacted. (Compare Greenwood, supra note 1, with Bureau of Justice Statistics, Crime and Justice in the United States and in England and Wales, 1981-96, Bureau of Justice Statistics, October 1998).

Violent Crime and Guns
The fight for more stringent gun control laws derives in part from the idea that more guns mean more violence. As it turns out, though, in the United States and the rest of the developed world, total murder and suicide rates, from all causes, do not increase with rates of gun ownership -- or drop under tougher gun laws [sources: Killias, van Kesteren and Rindlisbacher; Liptak ].
The effect of gun laws on gun-related violence is fuzzier and far more controversial but, in general, more guns mean more gun-related violence [sources: Killias, van Kesteren and Rindlisbacher; Liptak; Luo ]. We'll examine this further below.
First, let's look at the relationship between gun laws and violence in general. It is possible to have a violent society without guns. Prime evidence of that is the former Soviet Union and its successor states such as Russia, which despite stringent gun control laws, posted murder rates from 1965-1999 that far outstripped the rest of the developed world [sources: Kates and Mauser; Kessler; Pridemore ]. The killers in question did not obtain illegal firearms -- they simply employed other weapons [source: Kleck ].
On the other hand, Norway, Finland, Germany, France and Denmark, all countries with heavy gun ownership, have a history of low murder rates. According to a 2014 United Nations report, Germany's murder rate of 0.8 killings per 100,000 inhabitants was identical to Luxembourg, where the law prohibits civilian ownership of handguns and gun ownership is rare [source: UNODOC, Kates and Mauser].
The U.S., though, in many ways is a special case. Not only does it have more guns than any other nation on the planet, but it also has far more gun deaths than any other developed nation — six times the homicide rate of neighboring Canada, more than seven times as many as Sweden, and 16 times as many as Germany [source: Lopez ].
Within the U.S. picture isn't as uniform, because in addition to federal regulation, states across the U.S. have their own varying laws on firearms. Opponents of gun control often point to the city of Chicago, which had 781 homicides and 3,000 shooting incidents in 2016, despite Illinois' relatively tough gun laws, as proof that gun control doesn't work [source: Lewis ].
But one recent study suggests that stricter state gun laws do make a difference. In a study published in the May 13, 2013 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers concluded that states with the most firearm legislation have the lowest rates of firearm-associated deaths, as well as the lowest rates of both murders and suicides with guns. The quarter of states with the strictest laws had 6.64 fewer deaths per 100,000 inhabitants than the quarter with the least regulation [source: Fleegler, et al .]
A 2013 UN study came to a similar finding. "While the specific relationship between firearm availability and homicide is complex, it appears that a vicious circle connects firearm availability and higher homicide levels," it concluded.
The U.S. of Armament
Pew Research Center reported in 2013 that by various estimates, Americans own between 270 and 310 million firearms—nearly one per person. But gun ownership is concentrated among a smaller group, with only 37 percent of U.S. households reporting that they included a gun owner [source: Pew Research Center ].
Of the 12,664 murders committed in the United States in 2011, 49 percent involved handguns and more than 67 percent involved firearms overall [source: FBI ].
All told, America is the most heavily armed country in the world, with the highest number of gun-related homicides among developed nations and some of the most relaxed gun laws [source: Walsh ].

Okay, so from these articles, it's clear that different countries have different approaches to gun control, and these approaches seem to have varying degrees of success in reducing gun violence.

Starting with the United States, it's evident that gun ownership is highly prevalent, with over 300 million guns in civilian hands. Despite some regulations, there are significant loopholes, such as the private sales loophole, which allows people to buy guns without background checks. This makes it easier for individuals who shouldn't have guns to acquire them.

In contrast, countries like the United Kingdom and Japan have much stricter gun control laws. In the UK, handguns are virtually banned, and even owning a shotgun requires extensive background checks and licensing. Japan has even more stringent laws, with rigorous training, mental health evaluations, and storage requirements for gun owners. These countries have significantly lower rates of gun violence compared to the US.

Australia is another example where, after a mass shooting, the government implemented strict gun control measures, including a buyback program for certain types of guns. Since then, they haven't had another mass shooting, which suggests that these measures can be effective.

Switzerland is an interesting case because, despite having a high rate of gun ownership due to its military service requirements, it has relatively low gun violence rates. This might be attributed to strict storage requirements and mental health screenings.

Canada falls somewhere in between the US and these stricter regimes. They have licensing requirements and background checks, but still allow for certain types of guns to be owned by civilians. Their gun violence rates are lower than the US but higher than countries with stricter laws.

Looking at these examples, it seems that stricter gun control laws can lead to lower rates of gun violence. However, it's important to note that culture and enforcement also play significant roles. For instance, in Japan, the stigma against gun ownership and strict enforcement of laws contribute to their low gun violence rates.

In the US, there's a strong cultural attachment to guns, rooted in the Second Amendment and a tradition of gun ownership that dates back to the country's founding. This makes implementing stricter gun control measures politically challenging.

Moreover, the US has a much higher rate of mental illness and substance abuse compared to some of these other countries, which could be contributing factors to gun violence. Addressing these underlying issues might also be necessary to reduce gun violence.

Another point to consider is that gun control laws need to be comprehensive and well-enforced to be effective. Simply passing laws without proper enforcement won't make a difference.

Also, it's worth noting that some studies suggest that countries with higher gun ownership rates don't necessarily have higher overall crime rates, but they do have higher rates of gun-related deaths. This indicates that while guns may not cause crime, they do make violent situations more deadly.

Furthermore, there's the argument that guns are used for self-defense. Some studies suggest that guns are used defensively hundreds of thousands of times each year in the US. So, completely banning guns might not be the solution, as it could disarm law-abiding citizens who rely on guns for protection.

Perhaps a balanced approach is needed, where certain types of guns and high-capacity magazines are restricted, background checks are universal, and there are measures in place to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals, such as those with a history of violence or mental illness.

Additionally, investing in programs that address the root causes of violence, such as poverty, lack of education, and substance abuse, could also help reduce gun violence.

In conclusion, while it's clear that stricter gun control laws can reduce gun violence, implementing such laws in the US is complicated by cultural and political factors. Finding a middle ground that respects the right to bear arms while also protecting public safety is a challenging but necessary task.

\boxed{\text{Yes, private citizens should be allowed to own guns, but with stricter regulations and background checks to ensure public safety.}} 

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, private citizens should be allowed to own guns, but with stricter regulations and background checks to ensure public safety.}} \]
