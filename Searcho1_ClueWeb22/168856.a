Alright, so I need to figure out how changes in exchange rates impact businesses. I'm not super confident about this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First off, what are exchange rates? They're basically the value of one country's currency in terms of another country's currency. So, if I'm in the USA and I want to buy something from England, I need to know how many US dollars I need to get one British pound, right? That conversion rate is the exchange rate.

Now, businesses operate in different ways, some locally, some internationally. I think the impact of exchange rate changes is probably bigger for companies that do business across borders. For example, companies that import goods from other countries or export their own products overseas.

Let me think about imports first. If a US company imports components from China, and the US dollar strengthens against the Chinese yuan, what happens? Well, a stronger dollar means that each dollar can buy more yuan, so the components from China become cheaper for the US company. That’s good for their costs, but maybe not so good for their profit margins if they don’t adjust their prices accordingly.

On the other hand, if the US dollar weakens against the yuan, each dollar buys fewer yuan, so the components become more expensive for the US company. That increases their costs, which might force them to raise prices or accept lower profits.

Now, what about exports? If a US company sells its products in Europe, and the US dollar strengthens against the euro, what happens? Well, their products become more expensive for European buyers because it costs more euros to buy the same amount of dollars. So, demand for their products in Europe might decrease, which could hurt their sales and revenue.

Conversely, if the US dollar weakens against the euro, their products become cheaper for European buyers, which could increase demand and boost sales.

So, in general, exchange rate fluctuations can affect a company’s cost structure and pricing power in international markets.

But, there must be more to it. Maybe I should consider how exchange rates affect different industries differently. For instance, companies in the tourism sector are probably affected by exchange rates because travel involves exchanging currencies. If your home currency is strong, you can afford more when you travel abroad, which might increase tourism to your country. Conversely, if your currency is weak, it’s cheaper for foreigners to visit your country, which could boost tourism revenue.

Also, companies with foreign debt need to consider exchange rates. If a company borrows money in a foreign currency, changes in exchange rates can affect the cost of repaying that debt. For example, if a US company borrows euros and the dollar weakens against the euro, it will cost more dollars to repay the euro debt, which is不利的.

Similarly, companies with foreign investments need to consider exchange rates when repatriating profits. If a US company has a subsidiary in Canada, and the Canadian dollar strengthens against the US dollar, the profits repatriated from Canada will be worth more in US dollars, which is good.反之，则相反。

I think another aspect is competition. If a US company is competing with a European company in the US market, and the euro weakens against the dollar, the European company’s products become cheaper in the US, which could make it harder for the US company to compete.

Also, exchange rate volatility can make it difficult for companies to plan and budget for future transactions. If they’re entering into contracts that will be settled in the future, and exchange rates are fluctuating, it’s hard to predict what the costs or revenues will be in their home currency.

To manage these risks, companies often use financial instruments like futures, options, or swaps to hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. Hedging can help stabilize costs or revenues, but it also involves costs and risks of its own.

I should probably look up some specific examples to better understand this. Maybe see how some well-known companies have been impacted by exchange rates.

Let me try searching for that.

What is Exchange Rate Risk?
John Spacey, August 24, 2015 updated on March 19, 2021
Exchange rate risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates may affect the value of assets or financial transactions. It is common for exchange rates to be reasonably volatile as they are impacted by a broad range of political and economic events. The following are a few examples of exchange rate risks.
1. Foreign Assets
An individual investor needs to sell their vacation property in a foreign country to help fund their retirement plan. The property has gone up slightly in value in the local market but the country's currency has dropped by 40% over the years. The investor is forced to take a large loss.
2. Foreign Sales
An American luxury brand expands to 27 countries that use 11 different currencies. They report their financial statements in US dollars. After the expansion, the company's net profit becomes volatile from one financial quarter to the next as currencies impact their sales margins.
3. Foreign Debt
An American company issues bonds in Europe to take advantage of a low interest rate environment. They face the risk that the value of the Euro will increase relative to the US dollar before the debt is due for repayment.
4. Foreign Listing
A Chinese company lists its stock on a US stock exchange and must therefore report its earnings in US dollars. The company has a good year with net revenue increasing 25% in the local currency. However, the local currency declined 30% relative to the US dollar. As a result, the company must report declining net revenue in its financial statements.
5. Foreign Procurement
A European automobile manufacture signs contracts with part suppliers in the United States with prices in US dollars. The US dollar rises dramatically on a long term basis, making the parts more expensive in Euro. The manufacture needs to pass on these costs to its European customers by increasing prices. As a result of the higher prices its sales decline.

Exchange Rate Fluctuations
Exchange Rate Fluctuations

Exchange rate fluctuations affect not only multinationals and large corporations, but also small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, understanding and managing exchange rate risk is an important subject for business owners and investors.
There are various kinds of exposure and related techniques for measuring the exposure. Of all the exposures, economic exposure is the most important one and it can be calculated statistically.
Companies resort to various strategies to contain economic exposure.
Types of Exposure
Companies are exposed to three types of risk caused by currency volatility −
Transaction exposure − Exchange rate fluctuations have an effect on a company’s obligations to make or receive payments denominated in foreign currency in future. Transaction exposure arises from this effect and it is short-term to medium-term in nature.
Translation exposure − Currency fluctuations have an effect on a company’s consolidated financial statements, particularly when it has foreign subsidiaries. Translation exposure arises due to this effect. It is medium-term to long-term in nature.
Economic (or operating) exposure − Economic exposure arises due to the effect of unpredicted currency rate fluctuations on the company’s future cash flows and market value. Unanticipated exchange rate fluctuations can have a huge effect on a company’s competitive position.
Note that economic exposure is impossible to predict, while transaction and translation exposure can be estimated.
Economic Exposure – An Example
Consider a big U.S. multinational with operations in numerous countries around the world. The company’s biggest export markets are Europe and Japan, which together offer 40% of the company’s annual revenues.
The company’s management had factored in an average slump of 3% for the dollar against the Euro and Japanese Yen for the running and the next two years. The management expected that the Dollar will be bearish due to the recurring U.S. budget deadlock, and growing fiscal and current account deficits, which they expected would affect the exchange rate.
However, the rapidly improving U.S. economy has triggered speculation that the Fed will tighten monetary policy very soon. The Dollar is rallying, and in the last few months, it has gained about 5% against the Euro and the Yen. The outlook suggests further gains, as the monetary policy in Japan is stimulative and the European economy is coming out of recession.
The U.S. company is now facing not just transaction exposure (as its large export sales) and translation exposure (as it has subsidiaries worldwide), but also economic exposure. The Dollar was expected to decline about 3% annually against the Euro and the Yen, but it has already gained 5% versus these currencies, which is a variance of 8 percentage points at hand. This will have a negative effect on sales and cash flows. The investors have already taken into account the currency fluctuations and the stock of the company fell 7%.
Calculating Economic Exposure
Foreign asset or overseas cash flow value fluctuates with the exchange rate changes. We know from statistics that a regression analysis of the asset value (P) versus the spot exchange rate (S) will offer the following regression equation −
P = a + (b x S) + e
Where, a is the regression constant, b is the regression coefficient, and e is a random error term with a mean of zero. Here, b is a measure of economic exposure, and it measures the sensitivity of an asset’s dollar value to the exchange rate.
The regression coefficient is the ratio of the covariance between the asset value and the exchange rate, to the variance of the spot rate. It is expressed as −
b  =
Cov (P,S) Var (S)
Economic Exposure – Numerical Example
A U.S. company (let us call it USX) has a 10% stake in a European company – say EuroStar. USX is concerned about a decline in the Euro, and as it wants to maximize the Dollar value of EuroStar. It would like to estimate its economic exposure.
USX thinks the probabilities of a stronger and/or weaker Euro is equal, i.e., 50–50. In the strong-Euro scenario, the Euro will be at 1.50 against the Dollar, which would have a negative impact on EuroStar (due to export loss). Then, EuroStar will have a market value of EUR 800 million, valuing USX’s 10% stake at EUR 80 million (or $120 million).
In the weak-Euro scenario, currency will be at 1.25; EuroStar would have a market value of EUR 1.2 billion, valuing USX’s 10% stake will be equal to $150 million.
If P represents the value of USX’s 10% stake in EuroStar in Dollar terms, and S represents the Euro spot rate, then the covariance of P and S is −
Cov (P,S) = –1.875
Var (S) = 0.015625
Therefore, b = –1.875 ÷ (0.015625) = – EUR 120 million
USX’s economic exposure is a negative EUR 120 million, which is equivalent to saying that the value of its stake in EuroStar decreases as the Euro gets stronger, and increases as the Euro weakens.
Determining Economic Exposure
The economic exposure is usually determined by two factors −
Whether the markets where the company inputs and sells its products are competitive or monopolistic? Economic exposure is more when either a firm’s input costs or goods’ prices are related to currency fluctuations. If both costs and prices are relative or secluded to currency fluctuations, the effects are cancelled by each other and it reduces the economic exposure.
Whether a firm can adjust to markets, its product mix, and the source of inputs in a reply to currency fluctuations? Flexibility would mean lesser operating exposure, while sternness would mean a greater operating exposure.
Managing Economic Exposure
The economic exposure risks can be removed through operational strategies or currency risk mitigation strategies.
Operational strategies
Diversifying production facilities and markets for products − Diversification mitigates the risk related with production facilities or sales being concentrated in one or two markets. However, the drawback is the company may lose economies of scale.
Sourcing flexibility − Having sourcing flexibilities for key inputs makes strategic sense, as exchange rate moves may make inputs too expensive from one region.
Diversifying financing − Having different capital markets gives a company the flexibility to raise capital in the market with the cheapest cost.
Currency risk mitigation strategies
The most common strategies are −
Matching currency flows − Here, foreign currency inflows and outflows are matched. For example, if a U.S. company having inflows in Euros is looking to raise debt, it must borrow in Euros.
Currency risk-sharing agreements − It is a sales or purchase contract of two parties where they agree to share the currency fluctuation risk. Price adjustment is made in this, so that the base price of the transaction is adjusted.
Back-to-back loans − Also called as credit swap, in this arrangement, two companies of two nations borrow each other’s currency for a defined period. The back-to-back loan stays as both an asset and a liability on their balance sheets.
Currency swaps − It is similar to a back-to-back loan, but it does not appear on the balance sheet. Here, two firms borrow in the markets and currencies so that each can have the best rates, and then they swap the proceeds.

Economic Exposure | Example | Management
Home Finance Exchange Rates Economic Exposure
Economic Exposure
Economic exposure is a type of foreign exchange risk that results from long-run unanticipated changes in exchange rates affecting future cash flows through their effect on competitive position, sales growth, pricing and cost structure.
Economic exposure affects a company’s cash inflows and cash outflows broadly such that the company’s ultimate valuation is affected. It affects the profitability of a company’s business model and its strategic position.
Economic exposure differs from transaction exposure in that the transaction exposure results in gain or loss on individual transactions which are already executed but not yet settled but the economic exposure stems from unexpected changes in revenues and costs in the long run that result from foreign exchange movements. Economic exposure also differs from translation exposure (also called accounting exposure) because translation exposure affects the accounting income when foreign currency financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to the reporting currency while the economic exposure affects the cash inflows and outflows of the parent and/or subsidiaries itself.
Example
Let’s consider a US company which generates its major revenue in Euros. If in the long run the Euro depreciates against the US Dollar, the US Dollar value of its Euro-denominated revenue stream will fall thereby reducing its free cash flow and hence adversely affecting its shareholders wealth. The opposite applies to a company whose major costs are denominated in foreign currency. Let’s consider Apple, Inc. who must pay Chinese companies in renminbi. If renminbi depreciates with respect to US Dollar, Apple will be required to pay less US Dollars to Chinese companies. It will fatten the company’s free cash flows and its stock price will increase.
Management of economic exposure
Out of all three main foreign exchange exposures, i.e. transaction exposure, translation exposure and economic exposure, economic exposure is the most difficult to manage. It is because the foreign exchange rates are determined by a myriad of factors such as inflation rates, interest rates, fiscal policy, monetary policy, etc. which are outside a company’s control. Unlike economic exposure can’t be managed through derivative contracts such as forwards, futures, options and swaps. However, the impact of economic exposure can be reduced through the following strategies:
Diversifying its revenue stream in terms of the currencies involved. There is a possibility that impact of appreciation in one currency can potentially offset the impact of depreciation in another currency.
Locating its operations in different countries depending on its target markets. For example, setting up plants in different currency zones will naturally hedge the cash inflows and outflows because exposure to revenues will be offset by exposure to costs if both are in the same currency.
Borrowing in foreign currency if significant revenue is from that currency. In this case, a slowdown in revenues due to foreign currency movement will be partially offset by reduction in interest related cash outflows.

How do Exchange Rates Affect a Business?
How do exchange rates affect a business? The impact of foreign exchange markets
Jason Kaye 18th August 2017
How do Exchange Rates Affect a Business?
The ways in which businesses are effected by currencies can be roughly divided into transactional, translational, credit and liquidity risks. All four of these categories can then be subdivided a number of times to fit any and all kinds of businesses. But we’ll be focusing mainly on the transaction side – where the majority of foreign exchange impacts can be seen. Here, we outline a few examples of how foreign exchange markets can be a headwind or a tailwind to UK businesses.
Supplier payments
When paying a supplier, it’s this exchange rate exposure that can make a difference to your business. If, for example, you’re contracted to pay a French supplier for a shipment of goods in six months’ time at a cost of €50,000, every percent of change in the EUR/GBP rate will have a direct impact on your bottom line. At the time of writing, the EUR/GBP exchange rate sits at 0.91, making your final bill £45,500 if paid today. However, should the value of the pound fall by 2.5%, EUR/GBP would rise to over 0.93, lifting your supplier payment to over £46,500 – meaning you’re paying an additional £1,000 for the same shipment of goods. Nonetheless, should exchange rates move in your favour (the pound strengthening in this example) then you’d end up forking out less for your euro payment.
While supplier payments and exporting are some of the more upfront ways in which exchange rates can affect you and your business, there are a plethora of ways currency volatility can trickle into your business. These are namely transactional, translational, credit and liquidity exposures:
Sales forecasts
For multinational companies, sales forecasts can be any of the following: headache, hindrance, tailwind or motivator. Where they become more complicated is when sales are listed in another currency and what looks like a firm beat on your well thought-out sales forecast turns to pennies when the exchange rate moves against you.
Balance sheet hedging
Any finance director or CFO who’s got experience dealing with multinational companies will know that holding assets and liabilities in a variety of currencies can be a burden. When you’re creating or submitting financial documents, balance sheets can be subject to sharp revisions or remeasurements if the value of an asset or liability has changed due to foreign exchange fluctuations. A loan taken out in Japanese yen will look very different on your sterling-denominated balance sheet from one quarter to another if currency markets are volatile, unpredictable and changing.
These are just a few examples of ways in which currency markets can impact individual businesses. For the broader economy, the implications of a volatile currency can be more nuanced.
The broader economy
While the effects of fluctuating exchange rates aren’t immediately obvious for those buying goods on the high street, paying your gas bill or procuring machinery for your new venture, the nature of the UK economy leaves businesses and the wider economy highly sensitive (for better or worse) to movements in the price of the pound. The same might not be said for importers and exporters – who’ll feel the gains/losses of foreign exchange fluctuations almost immediately – and that’s clear in the monthly trade statistics for the UK:
Source: ONS, Bank of England
During periods where the pound’s weakened, for example from 2008-2012 in the graph above, the volume of goods and services exported from the UK has grown. The trouble is, it hasn’t grown sufficiently to outweigh the costs that are incurred through higher import costs – thereby depressing our trade balance figures and preventing a weaker pound from driving economic growth.
How can small businesses/SMEs combat, control and manage the affect of exchange rates?
It’s not the nature of these risks themselves, but how you deal with them that will make a difference to your business. There are a number of different methods and techniques with which to approach currency markets.
Transferring money can be simple – spot contracts and short-term forwards can be a quick, easy and efficient way of moving your funds from one currency to another. But, this may introduce an element of risk to your business as there’s effectively no way of predicting what the exchange rate will be on your future transfers. So how can you know what your profit margins will be in one week, month or even years’ time? For some businesses, using hedging strategies or longer-term forwards can trim some of this risk and more complex payment solutions can be more suited. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you, your business and the way you approach foreign exchange.
Spot transfer
A spot transaction is arguably the simplest way to transfer money across borders. Enquire at any currency specialist to receive a rate quote (this will usually be the interbank rate with a spread applied), once this is booked you send the broker the funds for the trade, which are then sent on in your chosen currency.
Forward contracts
If you want to secure a rate but aren’t yet ready to make a transfer, you can choose a forward contract to fix a rate today for a specified date in the future. The great thing about a forward contract is that you know now exactly how much you’ll get when you’re ready to transfer. It helps you plan and protects you should rates move against you later. However, a forward contract could work against you if rates move in your favour after you have secured a rate. We strongly recommend that you chat through your options with one of our dealers before choosing what’s best for you.
Conclusion
According to our Think Global research conducted last year, just 5% of SMEs currently intend to begin exporting at some point over the next half-decade, which leaves the UK in the bottom five European nations sorted by percent of SMEs exporting. Much of this hesitance to exporting is a direct result of uncertainty that stems from the impact and complications that FX can bring to businesses. It’s overcoming this uncertainty with confidence that’s key to success.
If the UK is to retain its status as an open, global and forward-looking nation, SMEs should approach international trade and foreign exchange markets with greater confidence. Furthermore, over half of all SMEs have experienced a rise in profits as a direct result of exporting, amounting to an average of £287,000 of additional revenue received per year.
The rewards are demonstrably out there, and with an informed, up-to-date and reactive strategy, tackling foreign exchange markets is within reach of every company in the UK, regardless of size, headcount or previous experience.

How Do Exchange Rates Affect International Businesses?
Firms that export goods and import raw materials will be affected by the exchange rate. The benefit of a depreciation (devaluation) is that exports will be cheaper and exporting firms will benefit from it. The cost of importing raw materials, however, will be higher for firms.
What Is The Effect Of Changes In Foreign Exchange Rates?
As a result of the change in exchange rate, the reporting enterprise’s net investment in the non-integral foreign operation is affected more than the monetary and non-monetary items held by the non-integral foreign operation.
How Fluctuations In Exchange Rates Can Influence International Business And Trade?
As a result of a weaker currency, exports increase and imports become more expensive, which reduces the country’s trade deficit. The market can also be adversely affected by constant currency fluctuations, which can cause it to become volatile, as well as affect trade between countries.
Why Is It Important For Businesses To Consider Currency Exchange Rates?
Businesses should consider currency exchange rates for several reasons. Profits can be dramatically impacted by them. A contract is automatically enforceable if it is broken by an individual or business. The number of people with discretionary income will increase, which will lead to more opportunities for businesses.
Why Are Exchange Rates Important To International Business?
Aside from interest rates and inflation, the currency exchange rate is one of the most important factors affecting a country’s economic health. In foreign markets, a higher-valued currency makes imports less expensive and exports more expensive.
How Does An Increase In Exchange Rates Affect A Business?
The economy can be affected by changes in exchange rates. The pound’s decline will benefit a UK company that exports products. The cost of obtaining the same foreign currency, however, will be higher for UK firms that import raw materials.
What Are The Effects Of Exchange Rate Fluctuations?
Changes in exchange rates affect the prices of imported goods, including those that rely on imported raw materials and parts. In addition to affecting investment performance, interest rates, and inflation, exchange rates can also affect the job market and real estate sector as well.
How Do Exchange Rate Affects International Trading Transactions?
As a result of nominal exchange rate depreciation, foreign imports are more expensive than home exports, thus raising the price of imports. As a second mechanism, such a change in relative prices has an immediate impact on imports and exports, and therefore on the balance of trade.

Alright, so I've got these search results about how exchange rates impact businesses. Let me try to make sense of them.

First, there's a lot here about different types of exposure that businesses face due to exchange rate fluctuations. There's transaction exposure, translation exposure, and economic exposure. It seems like economic exposure is the most significant one, affecting a company's future cash flows and market value.

Let me try to understand what each type of exposure means.

Transaction exposure is about the impact of exchange rate changes on existing obligations to receive or make payments in foreign currencies. So, if a company has to pay a supplier in a foreign currency in the future, and the exchange rate changes before that payment is made, that's transaction exposure.

Translation exposure has to do with the way a company's financial statements are affected when consolidating subsidiaries that operate in different currencies. It's more about accounting and reporting.

Economic exposure is broader and longer-term. It's about how exchange rate fluctuations affect a company's overall competitive position and future cash flows. This seems like the most impactful one for a business's long-term health.

The example in one of the documents is helpful. There's a U.S. company with operations in Europe and Japan, and they expected the dollar to weaken, but instead, it strengthened, which negatively affected their sales and cash flows. That led to their stock dropping. So, unanticipated changes in exchange rates can have significant effects on a company's performance and shareholder value.

There's also a section on calculating economic exposure using regression analysis. It's a bit technical, but essentially, it measures how sensitive a company's asset value is to changes in the exchange rate. The regression coefficient indicates the degree of exposure.

In the numerical example, the company has a negative economic exposure of EUR 120 million. That means when the euro strengthens against the dollar, the value of their stake in the European company decreases, and vice versa.

Managing economic exposure seems challenging. The documents mention both operational strategies and currency risk mitigation strategies.

Operational strategies include diversifying production facilities and markets, having sourcing flexibility, and diversifying financing sources. These aim to make the company less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations by spreading risks across different currencies and markets.

Currency risk mitigation strategies include matching currency flows, currency risk-sharing agreements, back-to-back loans, and currency swaps. These are financial instruments and arrangements designed to offset the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations.

Another document talks about how exchange rates affect businesses in terms of supplier payments and sales forecasts. For example, if a company pays suppliers in a foreign currency, changes in the exchange rate can increase or decrease their costs,直接影响 their profit margins.

Moreover, for multinational companies, preparing sales forecasts becomes complicated because revenues in foreign currencies need to be converted back to the reporting currency, and exchange rate fluctuations can make actual results differ significantly from forecasts.

Balance sheet hedging is also mentioned, where holding assets and liabilities in different currencies can lead to remeasurement gains or losses when preparing financial statements.

Looking at the broader economy, the document mentions that the UK economy is sensitive to exchange rate movements. A weaker pound can boost exports but may increase import costs, affecting the trade balance.

For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the impact of exchange rates can be significant, especially for those involved in international trade. The document suggests that uncertainty about exchange rates is a barrier to SMEs engaging in exporting.

In conclusion, exchange rate changes can impact businesses in multiple ways, including costs, revenues, financial statements, and overall competitiveness. Managing this risk requires a combination of strategic planning and the use of financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects.
