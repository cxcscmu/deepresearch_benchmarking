I'm trying to understand why some states are legalizing marijuana. I know that marijuana has been illegal for a long time, but recently, more and more states are changing their laws about it. I think there must be some reasons behind this shift. Maybe it has something to do with medical benefits, or perhaps it's about generating tax revenue. I'm not really sure. I should probably look into this more.

First, I should clarify what legalization means. There are different levels of legalization—some states have legalized marijuana for medical use, while others have gone further and allowed recreational use as well. So, maybe the reasons differ depending on whether it's for medical or recreational purposes.

Let me start by thinking about medical marijuana. I've heard that marijuana can help with certain medical conditions, like reducing pain, relieving nausea for cancer patients, or helping with muscle control issues in people with multiple sclerosis. Maybe states are legalizing it because of these potential health benefits. But I also know that the scientific evidence isn't completely clear-cut. Some studies show positive effects, while others are more cautious. Maybe states are legalizing medical marijuana to allow patients to try it as an alternative treatment, even if the research isn't fully conclusive.

Now, moving on to recreational marijuana. This seems more complicated. Why would states want to legalize something that was previously considered illegal and potentially harmful? One reason I can think of is financial. Legalization could bring in a lot of tax revenue. If marijuana is sold through regulated channels, the state can collect taxes on those sales. Plus, it could save money on enforcement costs, since enforcing prohibition is expensive. Maybe states see legalization as a way to redirect resources from law enforcement to other areas, like education or healthcare.

Another possible reason is reducing the burden on the criminal justice system. Marijuana offenses can lead to arrests and convictions, which can have lifelong consequences for individuals, especially minorities who may be disproportionately affected by drug laws. By legalizing marijuana, states might be trying to reduce these injustices and focus on more serious crimes.

Also, public opinion seems to be shifting in favor of legalization. More people are accepting marijuana use, and younger generations are particularly supportive. Perhaps politicians are responding to their constituents' views and moving to legalize marijuana to align with public sentiment.

Moreover, some states might look at the experiences of other states or countries that have legalized marijuana and see positive outcomes, such as increased business opportunities, job creation, and reduced crime rates related to drug trafficking. Maybe they believe that legalization can lead to a safer and more regulated market, preventing young people from accessing it through illegal means.

On the other hand, there are certainly arguments against legalization. Some people worry about the health effects of marijuana, such as addiction, mental health issues, or impaired driving. There might be concerns about increased usage rates, especially among teenagers, if marijuana becomes more accessible. Additionally, there's the federal law issue, since marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, which can create complications for states that choose to legalize it.

I think it's important to consider both sides, but for now, I'll focus on the reasons why states are choosing to legalize marijuana.

Let me try to organize my thoughts. It seems like there are several key reasons:

1. Medical benefits: Allowing patients access to marijuana for therapeutic purposes.

2. Financial gains: Generating tax revenue from sales and saving on enforcement costs.

3. Criminal justice reform: Reducing arrests and convictions for marijuana-related offenses.

4. Public opinion: Responding to changing attitudes and demands from voters.

5. Regulatory control: Creating a safe and regulated market to prevent illegal activity.

Maybe I should look up some specific examples to see how these factors play out in different states.

Let me pick a state that has legalized marijuana and see what their reasons were. For instance, Colorado was one of the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012. I recall that they had a ballot initiative where voters decided to legalize and regulate its sale and use for adults over 21. I think they saw it as a way to generate tax revenue and boost their economy through tourism.

In fact, I remember reading that Colorado has seen significant tax revenues from marijuana sales. Maybe I should look up some numbers to get a better idea.

Alright, so from these articles, it's clear that Colorado has seen substantial tax revenue from marijuana sales. For example, in 2021, they collected over $423 million in marijuana tax and fee revenue, which is a record for them. Since 2014, when retail sales began, they've collected over $2 billion in tax and fee revenue and over $12 billion in sales. That's a lot of money.

This suggests that financial gains are a significant reason why states like Colorado have legalized marijuana. The tax revenue can be used for various public services, such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and more. It's also likely that this income helps to offset some of the social costs associated with marijuana use.

But beyond financial benefits, there might be other reasons. For instance, legalizing marijuana could reduce the burden on the criminal justice system. In states where marijuana is illegal, there are arrests and prosecutions for possession and distribution, which costs a lot of money and can have lifelong consequences for individuals, particularly minorities who may be disproportionately affected by enforcement.

I should look into whether criminal justice reform is a stated reason for legalization in other states.

How marijuana legalization would benefit the criminal justice system
January 13, 2020

Cody Jorgensen is Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Boise State University. His research interests include developmental and biosocial criminology, policing and forensics, drug policy, and quantitative methods.
The 2020 election is ramping up and the democratic candidates have been laying out their agendas in preparation for the upcoming primary election. The issue of marijuana policy reform is not the cornerstone of any of the leading democratic candidates’ platforms; however, most of them have discussed their plan dealing with the marijuana issue.
For example, Bernie Sanders has laid out a comprehensive plan to reform our current marijuana laws that includes legalizing the substance within the first 100 days in office and vacating/expunging all marijuana-related convictions. Other candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and Amy Klobuchar have taken a similar stance and most of the democratic candidates support the Marijuana Justice Act sponsored by Senator Booker. This proposed legislation would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, expunge marijuana-related convictions, and bar federal funds to states that enforce cannabis laws in a discriminatory way.
Of the leading candidates, Joe Biden is an outlier. He does not support the legalization of marijuana at the federal level. Instead, Biden argues that legalization should be determined by the states. His reluctance seems to be due to his belief that marijuana is a gateway drug. However, research (Jorgensen; Cleveland and Wiebe; Van Gundy and Rebellon) has consistently shown that Biden’s belief is misguided.
On the other hand, President Trump and his fellow members of the GOP remain steadfast in their opposition to marijuana legalization. They tend to favor the status quo or even ramping up enforcement and prosecution of marijuana-related offenses.
Critics of cannabis reform have given several justifications for prohibiting marijuana, including arguments such as the following
marijuana causes more harm to society and the user than alcohol and tobacco
the increased potency of marijuana is dangerous
the addictive properties of cannabis cause abuse
decriminalizing marijuana sends a latent message that people should be using it
drug use is on the rise (especially among youth)
and marijuana is a gateway drug causing the use of harder drugs.
All of these justifications listed above have been debunked by empirical research and are more fiction than fact. As an alternative to misinformation supporting prohibition, this article will present an evidence-based argument for legalizing marijuana and suggests that doing so would be beneficial to our criminal justice system. In short, the Marijuana Justice Act would be good policy.
Marijuana prohibition is undemocratic
According to the latest Gallup poll, a large majority of Americans favor legalizing marijuana. As of 2019, 66% of Americans support legalization. Looking back at long term trends, the data show that attitudes about marijuana and its prohibition have changed dramatically over the past few decades.
When Gallup first measured attitudes about marijuana, only 12% of the population favored legalization. A steady increase in favorable attitudes towards legalization followed with a more dramatic increase beginning in the early 2000s. In 2001, 31% favored legalization and in 2010 that percentage increased to 44%.
There also seems to be a relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward legal cannabis. Gallup data shows that 76% of Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 51% of Republicans favor legalization. Going into 2020, the recreational use of marijuana will be legal in 11 states. This trend began with moves by Colorado and Washington to legalize in 2012.
A likely explanation for the change in marijuana attitudes is that the public understands that cannabis is a less harmful substance than other substances that are currently legal, such as alcohol or prescription drugs. Alcohol is by far a more harmful drug to society and the individual user as compared with marijuana. It follows that criminalizing recreational marijuana use is seen by a large swath of Americans as unjustified or even hypocritical because many Americans drink.
It should also be noted that laws that are viewed by the public as unjustified or illegitimate are not likely to be complied with. Put another way, people are unlikely to voluntarily abide by laws or rules that they view as unwarranted. When the criminal justice system enforces laws that the bulk of the public disagrees with, it harms the credibility of the criminal justice system which, in turn, impedes its ability to accomplish its goals of controlling and reducing crime.

Marijuana prohibition is costly
In 2018, there were more than 663,000 marijuana-related arrests made in the United States. More than 608,000 of those arrests were for marijuana possession only. This means that law enforcement is primarily arresting recreational cannabis users, not dealers. Many of those arrested will end up incarcerated, exacerbating the fact that tax monies supporting the incarceration of non-violent drug offenders are significant. Costs range between $30,000-$35,000 per year to house an inmate.
Furthermore, there are substantial costs involved in making arrests. While calculating the cost of an arrest is difficult and estimates vary widely based on how the cost is calculated, low estimates put the average cost of an arrest around $1,000 (The National Juvenile Justice Network; Drug Policy Alliance) and up to around $5,000 on the higher end. This suggests that between $600,000,000 and $3,000,000,000 is spent simply arresting recreational marijuana users. Those tax dollars could be better spent elsewhere, such as on officers’ salaries or updating equipment. Additionally, the process of making an arrest and taking an offender to jail takes the arresting officer off of the street for a significant amount of time, typically a couple of hours. That lost time could also be better spent with officers out on the street making their presence known and/or engaging with community members.
The economic costs are not the only costs associated with marijuana prohibition. There are also human costs, which may outweigh the economic costs. Having a conviction for marijuana possession on a record is not a trivial matter. This mark of a criminal record can negatively affect people in numerous ways. For example, college students can lose their federal aid for tuition and employees can get fired from their jobs due to a single marijuana-related offense. Having such a record also makes it significantly more difficult to get a job, a loan, or to rent an apartment. These are obviously stressful events that can strain relationships and negatively impact one’s mental well-being.
One of the more damaging effects of an arrest is the harm caused by introducing an otherwise law-abiding pot smoker into the formal criminal justice process. Being processed through the system, from initial contact with police to completion of a sentence, is stressful, frustrating, and often seen as unjust. This is especially relevant for non-violent recreational marijuana users who have done nothing else wrong.
The experience is generally viewed as an excessive punishment that does not fit the crime which often leads to offenders (and people close to them) to lose faith and trust in the criminal justice system. This is important because the system cannot effectively do its job if it does not have the support of the public. In this way, marijuana prohibition can do more harm than good.

Marijuana enforcement is racially biased
Marijuana use is fairly equally distributed across social strata. Whites, blacks, Hispanics, the affluent, and the poor use marijuana at about the same rate. However, enforcement of marijuana laws is not equally distributed across social strata. Instead, minorities and the poor are much more likely to be arrested for simple marijuana offenses. Nationally, African Americans are about four times more likely than whites to be arrested for cannabis.
The disparity is even greater depending on where people live. For example, in Iowa, Washington, DC, and Minnesota, African Americans are eight times more likely to be arrested. This is strong evidence of racial bias and largely stems from the racially biased practice of stop-and-frisk.
Stop-and-frisk tactics have been used in cities throughout the country; however, nowhere has the issue been more salient than in New York City. Throughout the history of the practice used by the NYPD, the overwhelming majority of people stopped-and-frisked were young black and Hispanic men. In the overwhelming majority of these instances, the young men were innocent. In 2013, the way the NYPD had been implementing stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional.
Racial profiling is damning to the criminal justice system for obvious reasons. This is particularly the case for police. Racial bias, whether real or simply perceived, negatively affects the police-community relationship. The relationships police have with minority communities have been fractured in recent years due to racial disparities in enforcement and use of force, the consequences of which certainly hinder the system from doing its job effectively.
For example, the police typically do not solve crimes on their own. Instead, crimes are usually solved because members of the community cooperate with the police and give them information about the crime. Community members tell the police who the suspect is, where they hang out, who they hang out with, etc. When people do not trust the police, they will be unlikely to help them in their investigations, and racial profiling is a primary source of distrust.
Additionally, when the police-community relationship is fractured, people in minority communities may be reluctant to call the police for service. Instead, they might opt to deal with problems or conflicts themselves which could lead to an increase in violence.
The War on Drugs is basically a war on marijuana
In their book Drugs and Drug Policy, researchers Clayton Mosher and Scott Akins examine the evidence showing that the War on Drugs has been a resounding failure. This is not a controversial or speculative statement. There is consensus among criminologists, criminal justice scholars, and drug policy experts that the War on Drugs has not been effective and offers no clear benefit to society. It is also expensive costing around $47 billion per year.
The War on Drugs has not reduced drug use and has not reduced crime associated with drug use and the illegal drug trade. At the same time, this approach has incentivized policing for profit via asset forfeiture laws, increased police militarization through the Pentagon’s 1033 program, and contributed significantly to mass incarceration which has disproportionately affected communities of color.
What is more, the War on Drugs is primarily a war on marijuana since the vast majority of arrests made and resources spent have been focused on marijuana offenses. In recent years, drug arrests in general, and marijuana possession arrests in particular, have been increasing while at the same time the rates of serious crimes have been decreasing.
This increase is unwarranted since marijuana use is not a cause of harder drug use nor is it associated with an increase in crime and violence, as is the case with other substance use, like alcohol or methamphetamine. Marijuana is also not associated with the risk of overdose, unlike heroin and the prescription drugs that are at the heart of the current opioid epidemic. This topic has been extensively studied and the empirical evidence generally shows that the War on Drugs has caused more harm than it has prevented.
An evidence-based alternative to the War on Drugs is harm reduction. Harm reduction aims to reduce the harms associated with substance use by focusing on prevention and rehabilitation instead of enforcement and incarceration. Harm reduction strategies have shown to reduce drug use, crime associated with drug use, the spread of infectious diseases, drug overdoses, etc. For example, therapeutic community programs and drug court programs are far more effective at reducing behavioral problems associated with drug use than typical “get tough” deterrence based approaches which typically have little to no effect on reducing antisocial behavior.
Wasting precious resources on ineffective deterrence-based strategies does not inspire confidence in the system. The money spent on the enforcement of marijuana laws and the sentencing of marijuana offenders would be better spent on rehabilitation and prevention programs.  As such, continuing the failed War on Drugs, marijuana prohibition in particular, is not conducive to the goals of the criminal justice system. It is ineffective, expensive, and it harms the credibility of our legal institutions.

The marijuana economy is worth billions
It is estimated that the illicit marijuana economy is worth around $30-$40 billion dollars. Surely, it is reasonable to think that this industry should be run by American business owners rather than drug cartels and drug gangs. Demand for marijuana will always exist, and whenever an in demand product or service is made illegal, the black market will inevitably provide it. Criminal enterprises that deliver illicit goods and services do not use the law to solve problems and resolve conflicts. They use violence. Recent research has shown that legalizing marijuana reduces violence and trafficking associated with the illegal drug trade thereby reducing the power and wealth of cartels and drug gangs.
On top of reducing drug related crime, legalizing marijuana has shown to be a meaningful avenue of raising tax revenue. For example, Colorado’s legal marijuana industry has brought in over one billion dollars in tax revenue to the state since it abandoned prohibition. A portion of the tax revenue generated by a legal cannabis industry could be earmarked for police agencies, correctional facilities, drug rehabilitation centers, and crime prevention programs.
There are several programs that are not only effective at reducing crime, but are also cost effective as well. For every dollar spent on an evidence-based crime reduction or prevention program, several dollars are saved down the road in enforcement and correctional expenditures. One of the most successful prevention programs known is the Nurse Family Partnership program.
Using tax money generated from a legal marijuana industry to fund this program nationally will not only reduce crime rates, but will save a lot of money in the long term. Another useful way to spend this proposed tax revenue is by paying our police better. The current salaries for newly hired police officers are abysmal in most jurisdictions across America. Increasing base pay for these public servants may entice qualified candidates into police work who were previously uninterested because of the low pay. Additionally, it is not good for our police to be tired and under excessive stress while on duty.
It is fairly common for police officers to work overtime or have a part-time job to make extra money. Having an over-worked, under-paid, and stressed police force is not conducive to a healthy police-community relationship. Paying rank-and-file police officers more could help reduce their stress and fatigue and may help with recruiting excellent candidates that will make good cops.
The common denominator
The underlying theme of the above paragraphs is that marijuana prohibition harms the legitimacy and credibility of the criminal justice system for a variety of reasons: it is undemocratic, racially biased, ineffective, detrimental, costly, and wasteful. When any authority figure is viewed as illegitimate or not credible, people are not likely to support that authority figure nor are people likely to voluntarily comply or cooperate with that authority.
In his book Why People Obey the Law, Yale psychologist Tom Tyler shows that this is a robust and consistent finding across a variety of domains. Such evidence strongly suggests that the criminal justice system must be viewed by the public to be legitimate, and the laws it enforces justified, in order to gain the compliance and cooperation of the public and to function as effectively as possible. Marijuana prohibition damages that legitimacy.
Our criminal justice system is ripe for major reform. Some of the reforms that are needed are those that will maximize the perceived legitimacy of our legal institutions. Given the reasons outlined above, it is argued here that one of the simplest and most effective ways to accomplish that would be to legalize marijuana. Doing so would also be an effective way to fund crime reduction efforts and to ease the financial burden placed on the criminal justice system.
In the end, marijuana use is not completely harmless and the legalization of it is not without risk; however, the harm associated with marijuana use and legalization pales in comparison to prohibition. The Marijuana Justice Act would make good policy and would ultimately be beneficial to the criminal justice system.

This report details a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) funded research project designed to analyze the impact of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on state criminal justice system resources.
Abstract
The goal of this project was to analyze quantitative and qualitative data in 11 targeted states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, and Washington) to address three research questions: 1. what are the impacts of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on criminal justice resources in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon?; 2. what are the impacts on criminal justice resources in states that border the states (Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, and Kansas) that have legalized marijuana?; and 3. what are the impacts of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on drug trafficking through northern and southwest border states (Arizona, California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington)? Quantitative data from seven Statistical Analysis Centers was provided and 35 interviews with law enforcement personnel in seven states were conducted to address the three research questions. Analyses of the available data suggests that: 1. legalizing the recreational use of marijuana resulted in fewer marijuana related arrests and court cases; 2. legalizing marijuana did not have a noticeable impact on indicators in states that bordered those that legalized; and 3. there were no noticeable indications of an increase in arrests related to transportation or trafficking offenses in states along the northern or southern borders. Interviews with law enforcement officials identified a number of concerns about the legalization of marijuana, including the potency of marijuana products, increased marijuana use among youth, the influx of people from out-of-town or out-of-state, and increases in incidents of drugged driving. The project identified a number of challenges associated with the availability and usefulness of marijuana-related data in the states, and the authors suggest that both the quantitative and qualitative data should be interpreted with caution given the limitations of each identified by the project.

State cannabis reform is putting social justice front and center

State cannabis reform is putting social justice front and center

The most recent wave of successful legalization efforts has demonstrated the effectiveness of pro-cannabis reformers to frame cannabis policy as a civil rights and racial justice issue. Between November 2020 and April 2021, seven additional states approved laws to fully legalize adult-use cannabis. Thus far, 18 states plus DC have voted, either by ballot initiative or via the legislative process to do the same. [1]
The structure of the new laws in states likes Virginia, New Jersey, and New York—to name a few—have put centerstage a recognition that the war on drugs was and is a racist institution that purposefully harmed communities of color for decades. Drug reform laws were thus designed to right some of those wrongs and to rehabilitate and empower the victims of the drug war and the communities (both demographic and geographic) from which they hail. Reform advocates have expanded the policy space beyond criminal justice reform to include economic policy. With the community investment opportunities that new revenues will enable, legalization is just the beginning of a cannabis opportunity agenda focused on equity.
New York’s three-pronged approach to equity
The legalization framework in New York illustrates this trend. The main focus of New York’s cannabis reform law, titled the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, is racial and social justice. Each part of the Act addresses specifically how reform will benefit communities and people who have been disproportionally impacted by cannabis criminalization.
The first part New York’s plan is automatic expungement of cannabis-related convictions that are now legal so that people are not left behind in the new legal landscape. The Act expunges convictions for possessing cannabis, cannabis consumption, and other offenses from any point in time. Though the idea of expunging records is not new, only some states have made the process automatic. Illinois and Vermont preceded New York in including automatic expungement but most of the other states, including Michigan and California, that have enacted cannabis reform only authorized expungement or sealing of records by petition. New York previously sealed the records of over 150,000 people with cannabis-related convictions in 2019.
Automatic expungement is crucial for addressing the disproportionate effect of the war on drugs on Black and Latino Americans. This past year in New York City, 94% of those arrested for cannabis-related charges were people of color, even though cannabis consumption varies little by race.  An automatic process also ensures that cannabis reform is effective in reaching all those impacted by criminalization, including people without the resources to petition for expungement. In New York, 107,639 convictions are estimated by the state to be eligible.
Second, New York has also taken steps to ensure that people disproportionately affected by cannabis criminalization have access to the new economic opportunities presented by reform. The primary way that they hope to include such communities is through ensuring that half of all cannabis licenses go to social equity applicants—people who are from communities disproportionately impacted by prior laws, minority and women owned businesses, disabled veterans, and struggling farmers. [2] Other states have adopted similar programs, with varying degrees of success. Massachusetts was the first state to adopt a state-wide social equity plan for licensing and has two programs to provide guidance and prioritize license review for those most impacted by the war on drugs.
But in 2019, three years after passing cannabis reform, only two social equity applicants for cannabis licenses had been approved out of total the 105 provisional and 79 final licenses issued. The legal cannabis market is monopolized by white distributors, with 81% of businesses being owned by white people. The barriers to entry for people of color are high, with some states forbidding those with felony convictions from obtaining a license and setting high application fees. The racial disparity in the legal cannabis market continues the disproportionate impact of criminalization on communities of color. By setting specific goals for equitable cannabis licenses, the New York plan will hopefully ensure more economic opportunities for people affected by cannabis criminalization, particularly Black and Latino New Yorkers.
Third, the plan also prioritizes investment in communities disproportionately impacted, recognizing the long-term effects of the war on drugs. High rates of incarceration for drug-related convictions have contributed to wealth disparities between communities of color and white communities, leading to fewer public resources and a lack of economic opportunities. New York anticipates receiving $350 million in yearly tax revenue and has committed to dedicating 40% to reinvestment. The money will go to the Community Grants Reinvestment funds, which include grants for local governments and community organizations to fund programs in communities disproportionately impacted.
The funds can be spent on a variety of social programs including adult education and mental health and substance abuse treatment. They can also be spent on economic equity programs like job placement and skills services, financial literacy, and community banking. Reinvestment grants can also help address the impacts of criminalization by funding legal services for people with prior cannabis convictions that face barriers to workforce reentry.
How states that legalized early are adopting equity measures
Each of the new states to legalize and prioritize issues of racial justice and social equity seek to build on the efforts—or lack of efforts—from prior states. The earliest jurisdictions to legalize such as Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and DC often discussed issues of race in the initiative campaigns. Explanations, particularly in communities of color, about the effects of the drug war and how removal of criminal penalties would have significant benefits helped build the coalitions that passed those referenda. However, the initiatives themselves were severely lacking in proactively addressing issues of justice and equity. Many of the early legalizing states have subsequently passed reforms including social equity programs for minority cannabis business ownership and record expungement to combine criminal justice and economic opportunity elements into a comprehensive social justice effort.

States like Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and others have recognized something critical to a comprehensive justice conversation: cannabis expungement is not enough. Expungement is important (automatic expungement more so), but expungement only fixes one day in a person’s life: the day he or she is convicted of a crime. Expungement does not inherently fix all of the missed economic, educational, wealth-building, and social opportunities that occurred because of a criminal record.
Several states have recognized that investment in the individuals and communities hit hardest by the war on drugs is essential to addressing this nation’s disastrous history in this area. California will invest $30 million this year, $40 million next year, and $50 million each year after into communities disproportionally impacted, a significant number that nevertheless pales in comparison to the approximately $140 million New York plans to invest yearly. The challenge now for states is to identify how to target such investment and ensuring that there are sufficient revenues to accomplish it. That challenge involves designing tax policy that is sufficient without being punitive. It also involves combining data on arrests and other law enforcement activities with a sensitivity to the fact that the geography of the drug war’s past may not be the same geography of the drug war today. [3]
Limits at the state level and how Congress can strengthen equity
For states seeking to ensure that newly forming cannabis markets include business opportunities for people affected by the drug war, there is a major obstacle: access to capital. Prohibition at the federal level means that borrowing funds to start a small business is not an option. As long as cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, small businesses will largely continue to operate on a cash-only basis. A further squeeze on any small cannabis business is that banking services, if they are available at all, come at costs that only the largest market actors can absorb. There are two ways Congress can fix this and make it possible for license carve-outs to foster small business as intended. One would be to establish clear protections for banks to provide services to cannabis businesses in states where it is legal. The other would be, of course, to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act.
On the community reinvestment side, Congress should pay close attention to the programs states are developing. In particular, New York’s investment commitment is significant. Investment in communities that were targeted in the war on drugs has the potential to touch on many different aspects of racial inequality. Whether it’s unemployment, housing, the racial wealth gap, poor health outcomes or other issues, Congress and the administration can build on successful programs in the states. Cannabis legalization has provided a rare instance of clarity and consensus around a key social justice issue—a need to right historical wrongs. Tax revenue from cannabis sales alone won’t be enough to do the job. But it will create valuable laboratories of equity-building and community reinvestment in the states, the evidence from which Congress can use to make meaningful moves toward equity through its spending powers.
Ultimately, the fight for drug reform in America is a civil rights and racial justice issue. Any serious conversation about social and racial justice in America must include a conversation about our nation’s drug laws and the impact they have had on specific communities. At the same time, as more states reform their cannabis laws, they must take the lead of states like New York and others and prioritize issues of racial justice and equity not just in criminal justice terms, but in the economics as well.
[1] The ballot initiative that passed in South Dakota is currently in a protracted legal battle regarding its constitutionality, and the DC ballot initiative has been blocked from implementation by a congressional appropriations rider.
[2] Social equity applicants are defined as people of low income who have, or have a close relative who has, a cannabis related conviction.
[3] One important challenge that states and other jurisdictions have and will need to work through is avoiding using dated—yet still important data indicators—that could lead to targeting investment funding to neighborhoods that no longer maintain a population targeted by the drug war. A neighborhood that has gone through extensive gentrification would be whiter, wealthier, and possibly older than it was 10 or 20 years ago. And while historic data on arrest rates could suggest that neighborhood should qualify for such support, the economics and demographics of that neighborhood today would not make it a prime target. Similarly, within neighborhoods undergoing gentrification, investment decisions must be made to ensure that those individuals and groups intended to benefit from such programs are the actual beneficiaries of those programs.

Criminal Justice
Criminal Justice
A conviction for possession of a small amount of cannabis can lead to a lifetime of harsh consequences (also called collateral sanctions) and result in denial of student financial aid, housing, employment, and professional licenses. Discriminatory enforcement means these punitive collateral consequences disproportionately affect people of color.
Cannabis legalization is a key component of broader criminal justice reform, and perhaps the most profound change being driven by the cannabis movement is in the area of criminal justice.
As the cannabis reform movement has gained momentum, voters have become increasingly troubled by the long lasting, residual harm the war on cannabis has placed on lives through criminal histories. For most voters, it no longer makes sense that cannabis is treated as a legal product accessible by adults, yet individuals are still denied housing, an education, or employment because of a prior conviction history. Even more troubling is that discriminatory enforcement of cannabis laws has disproportionately sent individuals from Black and brown communities to jail, resulting in these communities being hardest hit by collateral sanctions.
This injustice has opened the door to expungement of criminal records. Most states considering legalization are now also including plans for expungement in their proposed legislation, and states that adopted legalization early on are adding expungement provisions to their existing laws. Illinois’ MPP-drafted legalization law will expunge close to 740,000 records and has been heralded as a breakthrough in criminal justice reform.

From Prohibition to Progress: A Status Report on Marijuana Legalization
August 2021 Update: Get updated information about marijuana legalization, public health, and safety. See the factsheet.
What We Know About Marijuana Legalization in Eight States and Washington, D.C.
On November 6, 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first two states – and first two places in the world – to legalize marijuana for adult use. Two years later Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C. followed suit. In 2016 voters in four additional states – California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada – also approved ballot measures legalizing marijuana. In January 2018, Vermont became the first state to legalize marijuana through a state legislature. More states are expected to legalize in the near future.
Evidence shows that marijuana legalization is working so far. States are saving money and protecting the public by comprehensively regulating marijuana for adult use.
This success has likely contributed to the historically high levels of public support for marijuana legalization in the U.S., which has steadily grown to an all-time high of 64%. The majority of Americans – including 51% of Republicans – now support marijuana legalization.

Social Justice Impacts
MARIJUANA ARRESTS ARE DOWN.
Arrests for marijuana have plummeted in places with legal marijuana – saving hundreds of millions of dollars and sparing thousands of people from being branded with a lifelong criminal record.
STATES ARE ALLOCATING MARIJUANA REVENUES FOR SOCIAL GOOD.
Colorado distributed $230 million to the Colorado Department of Education between 2015 and 2017 to fund school construction, early literacy, bullying prevention, and behavioral health.
Oregon allocates 40% of marijuana tax revenue to its state school fund, depositing $34 million into the fund so far. The state also distributes 20% to alcohol and drug treatment.
Nevada ’s 15% wholesale tax is projected to bring in $56 million over the next two years to fund state schools.
Washington dedicates 25% to substance use disorder treatment, education and prevention. The state also distributes 55% of its marijuana tax revenues to fund basic health plans.
Alaska will collect an estimated $12 million annually, which will fund drug treatment and community residential centers.
California and Massachusetts will invest a share of their marijuana tax revenues in the communities most adversely impacted by drug arrests and incarceration, particularly low-income communities of color, to help repair the harms of unequal drug law enforcement.

Public Health
YOUTH MARIJUANA USE IS STABLE.
Youth marijuana use rates have remained stable, nationally and in states that have legalized marijuana for adults age 21 and older.
According to the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 21.7% of American high school students used marijuana in the past month and this rate has been consistent over the past decade.
In Washington, Colorado and Alaska, rates of marijuana use among high school students largely resemble national rates. These results are promising, suggesting that fears of widespread increases in use have not come to fruition.
In Oregon, Nevada, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., marijuana regulatory programs are not yet established or are so new that they are unlikely to have affected youth use rates in an immediately measurable way. While rates of use vary widely in these states, they have mostly stabilized or declined over the years leading up to legalization.
MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION IS LINKED TO LOWER RATES OF OPIOID-RELATED HARM.
Increased access to marijuana has been associated with reductions in some of the most troubling harms associated with opioids, including opioid overdose deaths and untreated opioid use disorders.
In states with medical marijuana access, overdose death rates are almost 25% lower than in states with no legal access to marijuana, and the reductions in overdose death rates strengthened over time.
Legal access to medical marijuana has been associated with a 23% reduction in opioid dependence or abuse-related hospitalizations and 15% fewer opioid treatment admissions.
An analysis of opioid overdose deaths in Colorado found that after marijuana was legalized for adult use there was a reduction of 0.7 deaths per month in the state and that the decades-long upward trend of overdoses began to decline after 2014, the first year of marijuana retail sales in the state.

Road Safety
LEGALIZATION HAS NOT MADE OUR ROADS LESS SAFE.
The total number of arrests for driving under the influence, for alcohol and other drugs, has declined in Colorado and Washington, the first two states to regulate marijuana for adult use.
THERE IS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION AND CRASH RATES.
Research demonstrates that Colorado and Washington’s post-legalization fatal crash rates have little to nothing to do with marijuana. The crash rates in both states are statistically similar to comparable states without legal marijuana.
Jump to Road Safety data in report (PDF)
Marijuana and the Economy
SALES AND TAX REVENUE ARE EXCEEDING INITIAL ESTIMATES.
Marijuana sales in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and most recently in Nevada, began slowly as consumers and regulators alike adjusted to new systems. Once up and running, however, overall sales and tax revenue in each state quickly exceeded initial estimates.
Sales in California started on January 1, 2018 and no data are available yet. Sales in Massachusetts will not begin until July 2018. Sales in Maine are on hold, pending approval of a bill to implement the state’s regulated marijuana program. In Washington, D.C. no retail cultivation, manufacturing or sales are permitted at this time.
THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS CREATING JOBS.
Preliminary estimates suggest that the legal marijuana industry employs between 165,000 to 230,000 full- and part-time workers across the country. This number will only continue to grow as more states legalize marijuana and replace their unregulated markets with new legal marijuana markets.
However, there is currently a lack of equity and inclusion in the regulated marijuana market. The communities most harmed by marijuana criminalization have struggled to overcome the many barriers to participation in this market.
Some states and cities are implementing rules to help increase equity and reduce barriers to entry in the marijuana industry. For example, Massachusetts is adopting rules aimed at ensuring that people most harmed by marijuana criminalization can participate in the regulated market. Additionally, in California, a prior drug felony cannot be the sole basis for denying a marijuana license. This mitigates the harms to low-income, black, and Latinx people who have borne decades of disproportionate arrests and convictions for marijuana offenses.

Going Forward: Areas of Growth
WE NEED TO REDUCE RACIAL DISPARITIES AND REFORM POLICE PRACTICES.
It is widely known that there are vast racial disparities in the enforcement of marijuana laws. Black and Latinx people are more likely to be arrested for marijuana offenses than white people, despite similar rates of use and sales across racial groups.
In Colorado, marijuana arrests for white people decreased by 51%, but only decreased by 33% for Latinx people and 25% for black people between 2012 and 2014.
The post-legalization arrest rate for black people in Washington is double the arrest rate for other races and ethnicities.
A black person in Washington, D.C. is 11 times more likely than a white person to be arrested for public consumption of marijuana.
Marijuana legalization dramatically reduces the number of people arrested for marijuana offenses; however, it does not end racially disparate policing. Police practices must be reformed to fully remedy the unequal enforcement of marijuana laws. Police departments should:
Adopt model policies that prohibit officers from engaging in racial profiling and educate them on the harms of discriminating based on race.
Promote accountability and transparency by collecting search, citation and arrest data. These data should be compiled, made available to the public, and evaluated for racial disparities so that police policies can be developed to reduce racial disparities in enforcement practices.
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH SAFE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO CONSUME MARIJUANA.
Consuming marijuana in public is illegal in all eight states and Washington, D.C. that have legalized marijuana for adults 21 and older. It is a misdemeanor in Nevada and Washington, D.C., and a civil penalty subject to fines and fees in all other states. This means that people who lack the means to pay the fines and fees, or those without homes or in federally-subsidized housing, risk being jailed for consuming a lawful substance. Public use violations are also disproportionately enforced against people of color, particularly black people.
To address these concerns, several states have permitted social clubs or retail stores for onsite marijuana consumption. However, rollout of these businesses has been slow. It is imperative that these businesses are permitted so that all people have safe places to consume marijuana, free from criminal justice intervention.
WE NEED TO PROMOTE MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION AND PENALTY REDUCTIONS FOR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS.
In several states, marijuana legalization has had the unintended consequence of reducing historically high numbers of youth (under age 18) and young adults (18 to 20 years of age) stopped and arrested for marijuana offenses. However, these reductions are inconsistent from state-to-state. In some circumstances, youth now comprise a growing number of people charged with marijuana offenses.
In Colorado, the number of youth under 18 cited for marijuana offenses increased by 5%.
In 2016, the marijuana arrest rate for Oregon youth was nearly 7 times the adult rate.
In 2015, 98% of all marijuana possession convictions in Washington were of youth.
While the reduction in youth arrests following legalization is a positive step, more reform is needed. California ’s approach is too new to be evaluated, but it appears to be a good step toward reducing youth and young adults’ risk of criminal justice involvement for marijuana-related conduct:
In California, youth under the age of 18 may only be charged with infractions for marijuana offenses. They are no longer threatened with incarceration or financial penalties. Instead, they are required to attend drug awareness education, counseling, or community service.
All marijuana offenses will be automatically expunged from a youth’s record when they turn 18.
The penalties for most marijuana-related activities were either decriminalized or reduced for young adults 18-to-20 years old.

Okay, so from these sources, it's clear that criminal justice reform is indeed a significant reason why states are legalizing marijuana. The overrepresentation of minorities in marijuana arrests is a major issue, and legalization can help reduce these disparities. Also, the financial costs of enforcing marijuana prohibition are substantial, and legalizing it can free up resources for more pressing issues.

Moreover, the war on drugs has been largely ineffective, and focusing on marijuana legalization can redirect efforts towards more productive approaches like harm reduction and rehabilitation.

Now, another aspect I should consider is international perspectives. Maybe looking at how other countries have handled marijuana legalization could provide some insights.

Let me think about Canada, for example. Canada legalized marijuana nationwide in 2018, if I'm not mistaken. I think they did it for similar reasons—reducing the burden on the criminal justice system, generating tax revenue, and recognizing the medical benefits.

Wait, actually, Canada legalized cannabis for recreational use in October 2018. Before that, medical marijuana had been legal since 2001. So, their path to legalization is somewhat similar to some U.S. states.

I should look up some information about Canada's experience with legalization to see what lessons can be learned.

6 Reasons Why Canada is Legalizing Marijuana
Peter Janos 23/09/2020 Education Comments Off 1,027 Views
The legalization of marijuana is a controversial topic these days. Many people argue that it’s harmful and as such shouldn’t be legal, while others believe that legalizing it will actually make it safer for everyone. While marijuana for medical purposes is legal in a variety of different countries, Canada is one of the rare ones that has cannabis legalized for recreational use. So what are the reasons behind the legalization of this plant in Canada?
Well, the answer to this question is not that simple. There are many factors that contributed to the legalization of cannabis in Canada, and we will try to go over them all in this article.
So without further ado, let’s begin!
Reducing the impacts of the “black market”
Source: ventureacademy.ca
The biggest reason in favor of making marijuana legal in Canada is the easier regulation of the market. When it’s regulated by law, every single product has to be reviewed and the prices can’t get out of the hand. This is also a huge boost for the economy, and it helps take the money from the organized criminal groups and narco-cartels. Organized drug trafficking is a huge issue, and the legalization of drugs is a great way to deal with it.
All in all, a lot of research has shown that the legalization of cannabis is able to hurt organized crime more than any law enforcement ever did. This is one of the main reasons for Canada’s decision to make cannabis legal as it helps reduce the impacts of a huge issue.
It’s much safer

When the market is regulated by law, product quality has to be guaranteed. We all know that the black market has a lot of questionable products as there’s nobody to ensure their quality and safety. There are many horror stories of people getting addicted to hard drugs just by smoking pot. While this is highly unlikely, there are still a lot of marijuana products circulating on the black market that contain harmful substances.
Overall, legalization leads to much better regulations when it comes to product safety, quality, and distribution, so it’s a huge reason to do it. People will be using these products no matter if they’re legal or not, so it’s better to have them use it safely and under the government’s supervision.
Other than the quality of the product itself, a law-regulated marijuana market eradicates the need to rely on questionable sources for people’s marijuana needs. With marijuana legalized, people can buy it with no risk of getting into some shady business.
Medical purposes

Recently, there has been a lot of research done on various health benefits of medical marijuana, especially when it comes to cancer treatment. This is why a huge deal of people suddenly started advocating for its legalization. It’s been proven to ease the pain and symptoms of many chronic diseases, and medical cannabis is in no way harmful or toxic.
Like any country that has marijuana completely legalized, Canada started off by legalizing the use of medical marijuana first. This was done back in 2001, but it’s a huge milestone that paved the way for further changes in Canada’s law.
All in all, the medical use of marijuana is an important reason for considering making it legal. The fact that Canada had medical marijuana legalized a long time ago is what created the possibility of making cannabis legal for any kind of use today.
It saves costs and police resources
Source: lmlawgroup.com
Enforcement of anti-marijuana laws can be a quite costly process. It requires a lot of money and effort, and it’s usually not that effective. Also, the police use up a lot of their resources just to deal with these offenses, so making it all legal lets them focus on the more important issues like violence and theft. People will always find a way to do what they want to do, so trying to prevent them from it would be close to tilting at windmills.
What if they suddenly made tobacco or alcohol illegal? Do you think people would suddenly stop drinking and smoking? Of course not! It would be extremely costly to enforce it, and the economy would suffer devastating losses. This is why making it all legal can be such a great way to save funds that go into fighting something that’s impossible to shut down.
It opens a wide range of job opportunities
Source: nytimes.com
Making marijuana legal is a great way to open the door to a completely new industry inside of your country. This will of course create thousands of much-needed jobs since there will now need to be someone to produce, distribute, market, and regulate these processes.
So, if you want to start a marijuana business in Canada, where should you look for supplies? Well, since it’s all legal, there are thousands of marijuana seed suppliers all over the country. Luckily for you, there are websites such as Leafly, Grower’s Network, or Vela in which you can find all the info about good seed banks you need.
Other than that, it can be a huge boost for tourism in the country. Even though the fact that marijuana is legal in Canada is not well-known as of yet, many weed lovers choose to research this before visiting a country. Being able to enjoy your favorite cannabis products can be enough to make you want to travel to this beautiful country, and it’s certainly something to think about when considering the pros of making marijuana legal.
It keeps it away from youth
Source: pexels.com
Legalizing marijuana makes it easier to set clear age limitations that prohibit younger people from consuming it. When paired up with the reduction of the black market, this could help to prevent many teenagers from getting addicted to cannabis. It’s no secret that younger people tend to fall into addiction more easily, and they’re more likely to look for stronger alternatives after they’ve tried marijuana. Legalizing it will make it harder for youth to get their hands on the drug, and also preventing them from „mixing with the wrong crowd“. Of course, the legalization won’t completely resolve this issue, but it’s definitely a good step forward.
All in all, Canada legalized cannabis for both medical purposes and recreational use because it comes with a lot of benefits including keeping the drug away from minors.

There are many good reasons to do so (just study prohibition-era America), but I suggest that that’s not why he did it.
He did it because it’s an easy, populist vote-grab.
Banking regulation (or deregulation), tax policy, immigration policy, what to do with the National Film Board, Bombardier subsidies, all complicated stuff on which we won’t agree.

And it should never be legalised. Just decriminalised. If it's legal, you can't report your neighbour if they smoke in their yard 24/7 while it blows into your house through your windows, forcing you to close your own windows because of their habits. With it decriminalised, you could still report them and have them charged based on some sort of disturbance.

You said that as if he signed an executive order or something. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Parliament of Canada is decriminalising marijuana and allowing recreational use beginning in October 2018.
The reason is that popular opinion no longer supported the status of marijuana as an illegal substance. It will be treated much the same as alcohol - access will be controlled and enforced by the provinces, which will each manage it in their own way.

Very simple.
The Canadian government cannot stand idle by while inferior product, produced in unregulated ways and sold by criminals continue to be consumed in Canada.
Since marijuana is not physcially addictive, you cannot die from an overdose and probably not become crazy enough kill anyone if you have consumed too much - Cannabis is a safe product who’s time has come.
Therefore we will get a safely produced and distributed product that the govenment can collect tax on. (A product far safer than liquor or tobacco - both which have a high propensity to destroy the lives and even kill their users

Cart before horse.
The “reason” for legalizing weed is that we have run out of reasons for it to be illegal.
We know claims of its addictiveness were overstated. We know the “gateway drug” rhetoric was hyperbole.
So now it looks more like alcohol than anything else.
Canadians, in general, are satisfied with that. The law will reflect the will of the people.

For the life of me I can’t understand why it was illegal in the first place. Like alcohol, I think it should be regulated and made unavailable to minors, but like alcohol, it should be made available and marketed and monitored for those that enjoy it. But instead, for decades, we’d rather throw those people in jail. WTF.
Cannabis is unfortunately counter-culture. In a capitalistic consumerist society, it is demonized because it interferes with the Protestant work ethic and the insane desire to make your life better by buying more useless shit. The 60s is a great example of a drug (LSD) negative

It is overwhelmingly supported by us, that’s the reason.
Legalization, firstly restricts it from the hands of teenagers who are the population at risk for the mal-effects of pot.
Secondly, government can make revenue out of taxation which can in return be used for programs preventing drug addiction.
Thirdly, legalization will allow law enforcement to focus on more urgent matters.

Justin Trudeau is the leader of the Liberal Party and one of the promises made in the last election by his party was the legalization of marijuana. The people voted the Liberal Party in on this and other promises in 2015. As the Prime Minister of Canada, he has the mandate of the people for marijuana legalization. It has passed through the House of Commons and the Senate and is now in the final stages of defining the terms with the provinces. The date set for legalizing marijuana is October 17, 2018.

The party the most likely to want to roll back cannabis legalisation would be the conservative party. They are also the most likely contender against the Liberals next election.
That being said, even if they win the next election, I highly doubt they’d try a significant rollback of the legalization: they are more "pro business" than they are "pro traditional values", and there is too much money to be made with legalization.
That being said, they are definitely not -pro- legalization, and we can expect a change in attitude regarding cannabis from the government.

Hypothetically, what would the political repercussions be for Justin Trudeau if Trump manages to get marijuana legalized/deregulated first? Not looking for likelihood, just what would happen.
None at all. Trudeau ran for election on that policy and it is in the final stages of getting passed into law. The Liberal Party has owned the policy, owned up to it, and will put it into place. The resulting law will apply to every province and territory, although the provinces will regulate its application.
If Donald Trump instructed that marijuana be taken off the list of Schedule 1 drugs (those with no known medical use), I understand that the individual states could choose to make it available with less chance of a DEA raid on the State dispensaries.

* There is no argument that can be used to support the prohibition of weed that can't also be used to support the prohibition of alcohol. We don't ban everything that is potentially harmful to us

The government will be able to tax marijuana sales once major producers/suppliers come, and marijuana sales will likely add a bit to the legal economy, instead of the underground economy.

Why Marijuana should be legalized in Canada
DH Vancouver Staff

Dec 19 2017, 8:26 am
We live in a society where nature is illegal. But for some reason, we allow safe injection sites, which promote illegal drug use. We have a booming industry centred around the consumption of alcohol, which is responsible for hundreds of deaths and acts of violence annually. And we have tobacco, one of the largest industries world-wide, responsible for thousands of deaths each year.
ADVERTISEMENT
Yet Mother Nature’s plant, cannabis, is deemed dangerous and immoral.
In many parts of Vancouver, one can walk down the street smoking a joint and no one, not even the police, will look twice. This is how it should be. However, in other parts of North America, you can face harsher penalties and more jail time for a tiny nugget of weed than for first degree murder.
There are more pros to legalization than not.
Cannabis is one of the most versatile plants on the planet. Hemp can be used for cloth, clothing, rope, hair products, building construction materials, even fuel. In fact, cannabis can be used to manufacture over 25,000 products. And at the same time, one single plant takes in four times more carbon dioxide than a tree, in turn producing four times the amount of oxygen.
The rate of deforestation is three times faster than it can be replanted. Trees take an average of upwards of twenty years to reach the growth to be harvested. Hemp has a growing cycle of just three and a half months. When it comes to harvesting and turning the plants into a useable product, one acre of hemp produces the same amount of pump as over four acres of trees. Hemp fibre is also stronger, more versatile and lasts longer than wood products.
Cannabis also has numerous health benefits. Hemp hearts are one of those magical foods packed with numerous good things. They contain essential fats, vitamins and provide a balanced source of proteins.
Hemp hearts aid people who are suffering from:
Diabetes
Depression

If marijuana were to be legalized, the affect it would have on society would be more positive than not. For one, the drug trade wouldn’t be as predominant, thus leading to less gang activity. This includes human trafficking, drug mules and target shootings which regularly end up hurting innocent bystanders. This would also free up the legal system. Court time and jail cells wouldn’t be taken up processing petty cases for people possessing a plant.
In Canada, Stephen Harper’s government has come down hard on marijuana. But the severe laws and consequences we have in this nation are nothing compared to the life-ruining consequences of our Southern neighbour.
Let’s say you’re living in the state of Florida, under the three strike law*. You are a minority, with a little over an ounce of weed on you for personal, medicinal use. Because of racial profiling and a corrupt police force, you are randomly selected for a pat down. The cops find your stash along with your Nikes in your gym bag. You’re booked and taken down to the local station.
The next thing you know, you’re facing twenty five years to life in prison. Your children are going to grow up without a father, in a life of poverty because your wife can’t afford to raise three children on her own.

On the off-chance that you are lucky enough to get parole, under the current system you are marked as a criminal for life. You cannot vote, get a loan or better your life. Any potential employers would do a back ground check and your resume would immediately be disregarded.
This may seem like an exaggerated story, but it is in fact the harsh reality of hundreds of Americans.
The legalization of cannabis would also create an astronomical industry, which in turn means huge tax dollars, which could be used on public education and arts for children rather than fighting a “war on drugs.”
B.C. bud would also create hundreds of jobs. Retailers, cafes, suppliers, harvesters, growers, educational classes and manufactures for paraphernalia. B.C. tourism would also be on the up.

Although the positive reasons to legalize are far more than I’ve touched on, there are, of course, negatives to legalization. A big red flag most people have is that weed is a gateway drug to other harsher drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. This is, in fact, false. By legalizing you eliminate the need for kids to go to drug dealers to get their dope. If you were buying a pack of marijuana cigarettes at your local 7-11, the guy behind the counter wouldn’t be trying to upsell you on the sweet new shipment of crack he got in last week.
With any substance, there will be those members of society who would abuse the privilege and would get behind the wheel after smoking up. While the dangers of driving under the influence of marijuana are still there, waiting at a four way stop for it to turn green is far less terrifying than a drunk driver barreling through a red light at 90 km/hr.
And, of course, there would be those with little regard for others around them, including children. While drug use is a major no in front of kids, there are many unfit parents shooting up with their toddlers in the next room. It is sad to say, but I see parents regularly smoking with babies less than a foot away. It makes me sick
Legalization of marijuana is the next gay marriage. It is a civil right that will be rallied for until the public can grow their own cannabis – for medicinal use or for pleasure.

With every aspect of adult life comes responsibility. If everyone were to be educated and use responsibly, we could all live in a better place where nature is socially acceptable and legal.

Legalization of Marijuana: How We Got Here
September 11, 2013
When thousands of Liberals voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution to legalize marijuana in 2012, they did so based on considerable evidence that the current prohibitionist system is broken, and that policies to regulate the substance must be cost-effective and better both at keeping it out of the hands of young people and keeping it from devastating young lives with exaggerated criminal penalties.
When cannabis was first prohibited in Canada in 1923, it was done without debate or justification. Very little additional government review of the policy was conducted until the late 1960’s when the Canadian Government Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs (Le Dain Commission) was struck. When that Commission completed its extensive four-year mandate in 1972, it concluded that the costs, particularly to young people of a policy of prohibition of simple possession were not justified by the potential for harm of marijuana. The Commission recommended a repeal of the prohibition against the simple possession of cannabis.
Thirty years later, and with little actual change in public policy with respect to marijuana, the Senate of Canada’s Special Committee on Illegal Drugs came to largely the same conclusions in 2002, arguing that the widespread use of cannabis and its related costs to law enforcement (the Committee estimated the annual cost of drug enforcement at between $700-millon and $1-billion, with more than three-quarters of annually reported police incidents relating to marijuana) could not be ignored. It cited research to show that nearly 1-million young people had tried the substance in the previous year, and that the existing system was not deterring that trend.
We know from Statistics Canada that the burden on law enforcement hasn’t lessened since 2002, and that police have recorded more than 475,000 incidents of marijuana-related offences since 2006. That is as close an approximation as is statistically available to the number of marijuana-related arrests in Canada, which constitutes a significant amount of police resources – not to mention compromising future employment opportunities for young people who get saddled with criminal records. On top of this, the Harper Conservatives introduced mandatory minimum sentences for pot-related offences in Bill C-10 in 2012, which will only lead to greater incarceration costs moving forward.
And just last April we learned that UNICEF (the United Nations Children’s Fund) has found that Canada leads the developed world in cannabis use among teenagers – a shocking statistic from which it isn’t hard to conclude that prohibition is failing to keep pot out of the hands of Canadian youth. In fact, UNICEF calls for public policy attention to fix this situation in a manner similar to how Canada has successfully lowered youth tobacco smoking.
Taken all together, we believe it is time to change how we confront marijuana use in Canada. It is time to have an adult conversation with Canadians and in Parliament about this issue- a debate that is mature and driven by facts and evidence.  I believe Canadians are ready for this. Let us know if you agree.

The reason that cannabis is now legal in Canada
It was the Prime Minister's late brother's brush with the law that influenced Trudeau's thinking on pot, and put Canada on the path to legalization
By Shannon Proudfoot October 17, 2018
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s reflected in a sign as he speaks with the media before attending caucus on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Wednesday Oct. 17, 2018. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld)
It’s such a classic story that it’s literally a movie cliché: a young ski-bum type gets caught by the fuzz with a couple of joints rattling around in a tin in one of his pockets. There’s trouble coming to the young man, until his well-connected and well-resourced father swoops in for the rescue, connecting his son with an able attorney and disappearing the problem into thin air.
The young man, in this case, was the late Michel Trudeau, and his brush with the law occurred two decades ago. His powerful father, of course, was former prime minister (and lawyer) Pierre Trudeau. The incident reportedly influenced the thinking of Michel’s older brother, Justin, on marijuana, and eventually he was in a position to do something about it.
The Prime Minister related this family lore in an interview with Vice in April 2017, as his government was readying the legislation that would go on to make marijuana legal in Canada, as of today.
“He was very confident that we were able to make those charges go away,” he said of his father. “We were able to do that because we had resources, my dad had a couple connections and we were confident that my little brother wasn’t going to be saddled with a criminal record for life.”

Trudeau said this incident occurred about six months before his brother’s death in an avalanche during a backcountry ski trip in B.C.’s Kokanee Glacier Park in 1998. Michel was driving back to Montreal after a trip to the West Coast, and he got into an accident on the highway. As police were helping him collect items that had spilled out of his car onto the road, they discovered a Sucrets tin with a couple of joints inside it.
In telling this story to Vice last year, Trudeau framed it as illustrative of the inequality in how minor drug charges had been handled in Canada, and who had the ability to slip out from under them. “That’s one of the fundamental unfairnesses of this current system is that it affects different communities in a different way,” he said.
On Wednesday, when pot went legal in Canada, Trudeau’s government announced that it would craft new legislation that would allow people with simple possession records to request a pardon. “As of today, we have a new regime in which simple possession of marijuana is no longer illegal, and therefore we’ve put forward a process on obtaining pardons that is simplified, that will be free for people who have simple possession of cannabis criminal records,” he said. “This is going to make a real difference for people who have been impacted by the previous regime.”
However, there is no timeline yet for when these pardons will be available, or even when the government will table a bill in the House of Commons.

Alright, so from these sources, it's evident that Canada legalized marijuana for a combination of reasons, including reducing the burden on the criminal justice system, generating tax revenue, recognizing the medical benefits, and addressing social justice issues.

Moreover, the international experience, particularly from Colorado and Washington, seems to have influenced Canada's decision. The success of legalization in these states, in terms of reducing arrests, generating tax revenue, and not increasing youth usage, likely played a role in Canada's approach.

Additionally, the economic benefits, such as creating jobs and stimulating the economy, are also cited as reasons for legalization. It's interesting to note that the cannabis industry is projected to be worth billions, and legalizing it allows for this market to be regulated and taxed, rather than operating in the black market.

Furthermore, there's a recognition that prohibition hasn't worked and has led to the criminalization of otherwise law-abiding citizens, particularly minorities, who have been disproportionately affected by enforcement. Legalization is seen as a way to rectify these injustices and focus law enforcement resources on more serious crimes.

It's also worth noting that the Canadian government is approaching legalization with a focus on public health and safety, implementing strict regulations on production, distribution, and consumption. This includes setting age limits, quality control measures, and advertising restrictions to protect consumers, especially youth.

Overall, the reasons for legalizing marijuana in Canada seem to align with those in the U.S. states that have done so—reducing the harms of prohibition, generating revenue, and promoting social justice.

But I should also consider potential drawbacks or criticisms of legalization. For example, some people argue that legalization could lead to increased usage rates, particularly among youth, or that it could impair public safety if drugged driving becomes more prevalent.

I recall that some studies have shown no significant increase in youth usage after legalization, but it's still a concern that needs to be monitored. Similarly, there are measures in place to prevent drugged driving, such as roadside saliva tests, but it's unclear how effective these will be.

Another potential issue is the corporate influence on the cannabis industry. With big businesses entering the market, there's a risk that small, independent growers could be squeezed out, and that marketing could target vulnerable populations.

Moreover, there are still uncertainties about the long-term health effects of marijuana use, particularly with the increasing potency of modern strains. While marijuana is generally considered safer than alcohol or other drugs, it's not without risks, especially for certain vulnerable populations like adolescents or those with pre-existing mental health conditions.

Therefore, it's crucial that legalization is accompanied by robust public education campaigns and harm reduction strategies to mitigate these risks.

In conclusion, the reasons for legalizing marijuana in various states and countries appear to be multifaceted, encompassing criminal justice reform, financial benefits, public health considerations, and social justice. While there are valid concerns and challenges associated with legalization, the overall trend suggests that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, at least according to the experiences of early-adopting jurisdictions.
