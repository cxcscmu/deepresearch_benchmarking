I'm trying to understand this question about whether war makes states, specifically looking at rentierism and state formation in the Middle East. I'm not super familiar with these terms, so I need to break it down and do some research to get a grasp on what's being asked.

First off, what does it mean for war to "make" states? I think this is referring to the idea that conflict and warfare can lead to the creation or strengthening of centralized governments or states. Maybe it's about how societies respond to the pressures of war by organizing themselves more cohesively under a strong state structure.

Rentierism sounds familiar; I think it has something to do with states that derive significant revenue from the rent of their natural resources, like oil in the Middle East. So, rentier states are those that don't rely as much on taxation from their citizens but instead on external revenues from things like oil exports.

The Middle East is a region with a lot of historical conflicts and a heavy reliance on oil, so it's a pertinent case study for both war and rentierism in state formation.

I need to explore how war and rentierism have influenced the formation of states in the Middle East. Maybe there's a relationship between the two—perhaps war has led to the establishment of rentier states, or maybe rentierism has affected how states deal with war and conflict.

Let me start by defining some key terms to make sure I understand them correctly.

First, "state formation." This refers to the process by which a political entity develops a centralized government with a monopoly on the use of force within a defined territory. It's about how societies organize themselves politically and legally.

Next, "war making." This likely refers to the capacity of a state to engage in armed conflict, both internally and externally. The ability to wage war can be a sign of state strength and legitimacy.

Then, "rentierism." As I mentioned, it's when a state's revenues come primarily from renting out its natural resources or other assets, rather than from taxing its citizens. This can affect how the state interacts with its population and how it develops economically and politically.

Now, I need to consider how these concepts relate to each other in the context of the Middle East.

Perhaps war has been a catalyst for state formation in the region, with conflicts leading to the centralization of power and the establishment of stronger state institutions. On the other hand, rentierism might have hindered state development by reducing the need for states to build broad-based tax systems and, consequently, weakening their ties to the citizenry.

I recall that in the Middle East, many countries gained independence after World War I and II, and their boundaries were often drawn by colonial powers. Since then, the region has seen numerous conflicts and wars, both internal and between states.

Moreover, the discovery and exploitation of oil in the 20th century transformed many Middle Eastern economies, turning them into rentier states. This wealth from oil might have allowed these states to fund their militaries and engage in wars without relying heavily on citizen taxation, which could have implications for state-society relations.

I should look into specific examples to see how this plays out. For instance, Saudi Arabia is a major oil exporter and has been involved in various conflicts, such as the Yemeni civil war. How has its rentier status influenced its ability to engage in war and shape its state structure?

Similarly, Iraq has vast oil reserves and has experienced multiple conflicts, including the Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War. How has rentierism affected state formation in Iraq?

On the other hand, there are countries in the Middle East that are not major oil producers, like Lebanon or Jordan. Comparing their state formations and involvement in wars to that of rentier states could provide insights into whether rentierism is a significant factor.

Maybe I should look at some academic literature on this topic. There must be scholars who have studied the relationship between war, rentierism, and state formation in the Middle East.

Let me try to find some references.

Middle East Conflict
by Jim Haeffele
​How did conflict in the volatile Middle East begin? Will peace eventually prevail? If so, when and how will peace finally come to the Middle East?
The Middle East is one of the world’s continual hotbeds for conflict. In recent years Middle East conflicts have seriously impacted the Western world. The Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the United States and subsequent disturbances in European capitals were spawned by tensions in the Middle East.
Nations today realize that a major Middle East war could easily escalate far beyond that region. As a result, many countries watch what is happening in the Middle East with serious concern. It seems only a matter of time before the next conflict breaks out.
Why is the Middle East so volatile, and why are the tensions there so difficult to resolve?
Middle East conflict history
The modern history of the Middle East began after the end of World War I. Following “the war to end all wars,” the Ottoman Empire that had ruled the Middle East for 400 years came to an end.
The Ottoman Empire of the Turks had, at various times, ruled from the Middle East to Persia and from North Africa to southeastern Europe. The empire was in decline by 1914, and its defeat came at the end of World War I in 1918.
With the breakup of the old empire, a number of new nations were created by Britain and France and approved by the newly formed League of Nations. These nations included Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, Transjordan and Turkey. Egypt was a British protectorate that became independent in 1922.
Political conflicts within these nations continued off and on up to the beginning of World War II. There are still major conflicts among Muslim states today, but when we consider the subject of the Middle East conflict, the most serious conflict is the one between Israel and her neighbors.
The beginning of the modern nation of Israel
On May 14, 1948, the Jewish people in Palestine declared their independence and called their new nation the State of Israel. It was formed when the United Nations General Assembly voted 33 to 13 in November of 1947 to equally divide the region of the British mandate for Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.
The Jewish people had been seeking a place to live in this historic part of the world for over 300 years. In October 1917 the British cabinet authorized the foreign secretary to issue the Balfour Declaration, which granted the Jewish people a national homeland in the Middle East. It was named after Arthur James Balfour, the former foreign secretary and prime minister of Britain.
Even though the Jewish people had been promised a national homeland, the majority in the British government at that time were not in favor of it. Many worked to prevent and undermine the Jewish attempts to settle in Israel. These leaders supported the Arabs’ desire to keep the Jews out of Palestine.
The Jews felt betrayed by the British for going back on their promise. After the Holocaust—the annihilation of 6 million Jews during World War II—became widely known, a national homeland for the Jewish people could no longer be ignored.
It was not long after the formation of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1946 that the modern nation of Israel came into existence.
A Jewish nation prophesied thousands of years in advance
Surprising to many people today, the Bible predicted long ago that the Jewish people would return to be a nation in their ancient homeland. It was over 2,500 years from the time of their national defeat and captivity in 586 B.C. until they became a nation after World War II.
God, through the prophet Zechariah, had foretold this development over two millennia prior.
Addressing conditions in the world before the return of Jesus Christ, God said, “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it” (Zechariah 12:2-3).
True to what God said, Israel has been a center of Middle East conflict, and her enemies have not prevailed. Even though the newly formed State of Israel was immediately attacked by her neighboring countries, the small, poorly armed nation survived against overwhelming odds.
Israel has survived many close calls since it became a nation over 60 years ago. Israel has been greatly outnumbered, but as the prophecy said, “All who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it.”
Why are the Jewish people and the nation of Israel so hated by their Middle Eastern neighbors and by much of the world? Many people do not want to even acknowledge that Israel exists or that it has the right to exist. Arabs and Jews acknowledge in both the Bible and the Koran that they have a common heritage and relationship that goes back to Abraham. Why are these peoples who are related from the past unable to come to peace today? See “ Jerusalem: Why Three Major Religions Claim It ” for answers.
Perpetual hatred of Israel prophesied
One reason for the Middle East conflict lies in the past. Abraham had a son Isaac, who, in turn, had twin sons, Esau and Jacob. Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentils (Genesis 25:34 ). A little later, Jacob deceived his father, Isaac, into giving him the firstborn blessing of Esau by an oath that could not be taken back (Genesis 27:33, 36 ).
Because of these actions by Jacob, Esau hated his brother.
Over 1,300 years later the prophet Ezekiel spoke of the everlasting hatred the descendant peoples of Esau (also called Edom, Genesis 36:8) would continue to have for Jacob, whose name had been changed to Israel.
He said, “Because you have had an ancient [everlasting, center margin] hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity … since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you” (Ezekiel 35:5-6 ). The King James Version translated it “perpetual hatred.”
This hatred today by many Middle Eastern peoples for the Jewish people and the nation of Israel originated in the hatred Esau had for his brother Jacob.
Peace treaties and continuing conflict
Israel today has grown into a regional superpower in an area the size of the state of New Jersey in the United States.
Peace treaties have been reached with Egypt  (1979), Jordan (1994), the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain (2020), but that is not the case with the Palestinians and other nations of the region. As a result, the tensions are always high in this tiny country because of the many threats being made against it.
As Bible prophecy predicted, a focus of this conflict is Jerusalem and especially the Temple Mount. In the Olivet Discourse describing end-time events, Jesus warned, “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near” (Luke 21:20).
Where is this ongoing conflict leading the Middle East and the world?
Future prophecies concerning the Middle East
The prophecies of the Bible predict the Middle East conflict will escalate, with the Middle East becoming a center of war and violence that will end with the second coming of Jesus Christ.
The book of Daniel speaks of a “ king of the South ” coming out of the Middle East and attacking the “ king of the North ,” meaning Europe (Daniel 11:40-41 ). This leader from the north will counterattack very swiftly and take the battle a step further by entering the “Glorious Land” (Israel).
The prophet Zechariah speaks of this time just before the coming of the Messiah. He says, “Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, and your spoil will be divided in your midst. For I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem; the city shall be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city shall go into captivity, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city” (Zechariah 14:2 ).
This will not be just another Middle East conflict. It will be a time of world conflict. As Jesus Christ predicted in His Olivet Prophecy, “For then there will be great tribulation [widespread war and suffering], such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be” (Matthew 24:21).
This time of world war, invasion of the Middle East, and the fall of Jerusalem will precede Christ’s second coming.
“Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as He fights in the day of battle” (Zechariah 14:3).
Peace will bring an end to Middle East conflict
Man has tried by all his known methods to bring peace to the Middle East but without any real success. It will take a higher power to resolve all the issues and bring peace to this region and the entire world. Zechariah went on to say, “And the LORD shall be King over all the earth. In that day it shall be—‘The LORD is one,’ and His name one” (Zechariah 14:9 ).
The immediate future does not look very good for the Middle East, but the prophecies of the Bible predict that in the long term there will be an age of peace and prosperity. Jesus Christ will return to Jerusalem to resolve the conflict there and establish peace for all nations.

This is an excerpt from Regional Security in the Middle East: Sectors, Variables and Issues. Get your free copy here.
It has been argued (Holsti 1996 & 1991) that war in the post-Cold War era has different sources and takes on significantly different characteristics than previous wars. It has also become a common belief that the majority of contemporary wars are less a problem of the relations between states than a problem within states (Melander 1999). Although military considerations remain at the core of states’ security policies, it has been recognised that threats of non-military nature coming from the internal environment of the state could have a significant impact on the security of the state. Yet, domestic strife may lead to regional and international upheaval and invite foreign political and military intervention. The recent Arab uprisings have demonstrated that one of the main sources of regional instability in the Middle East stems from regional states’ domestic environments, while the Syrian conflict clearly shows how civil wars may lead to regional and international instability and invite foreign intervention.
Civil war, nevertheless, is not chronic in all states. It has been suggested (Buzan 1991) that the socio-political cohesion of states is the primary cause of domestic insecurity and that states that are weak in terms of their socio-political cohesion are the primary locale of present and future wars. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate Buzan’s thesis by focusing on state-society relations in the Middle East. In doing so, the chapter is divided into four sections. The first section draws on the state-society literature to provide the basis for understanding the nature of domestic insecurity facing Middle Eastern states. The second section focuses on the weak/strong state/power concept as a way to enrich our understanding of the Middle East’s domestic security problematique. Finally, the last two sections focus on the cases of Iraq and the Arab Spring to demonstrate the relevance of the concept of ‘weak’ state to Middle East security.
The State-Society Relationship
The state-society literature emphasises the domestic realm of the state. This literature distinguishes between state and society and attempts to understand how they interact (Halliday 1988; Migdal 1988). In other words, state and society are viewed as separate entities while the state is understood mainly in politico-institutional terms. In this view, the state is equated with government and hence state security coincides with the security of the regime. Such identification has important ramifications for international relations. For example, according to the state-society approach, there was a difference between the security of the territory of Iraq and its citizens (society), and that of the security of Saddam Hussein and his regime. Hence, national security differs from state/regime security.
The state-society relationship can take three forms: first, state and society are both strong; second, the state is weak but the society is strong; and third, the state is strong but the society is weak. Because strong states which also have strong societies rarely, if ever, face insecurity due to their socio-political cohesion, this paper will focus on the latter two forms of state-society relationship.
Weak States and Strong Societies
Discussing conflict and underdevelopment in the Third World, Joe Migdal (1988, 19) defines the state as:
an organisation, composed of numerous agencies led and coordinated by the state’s leadership that has the ability or authority to make and implement the binding rules for all the people as well as the parameters of rule making for other social organisations in a given territory, using force if necessary to have its way.
According to Migdal, levels of state/social control are reflected in three indicators: compliance, participation, and legitimation.
The state’s struggle for social control is characterised by conflict between state leaders (who seek to mobilise people and resources and impose a single set of rules) and other social organisations applying different rules in parts of the society. The distribution of social control in society that emerges from this conflict (between societies and states) is the main determinant of whether states become strong or weak.
Strong states are able to guide the rules of society without threatening opponents. Here, the ‘rightness of a state’s having high capabilities to extract, penetrate, regulate and appropriate’ the rules of society is unchallenged (Migdal 1988, 20). In other words, a strong state possesses the legitimate authority that provides the official rules that people within the borders must follow. Weak states, on the other hand, are unable to mobilise the population for political purposes and there is often a fragmentation of social control (Migdal 1988, 228). Thus, weak states often employ coercion and various ‘dirty tricks’ to gain control. Midgal’s point is that the stronger the state, the stronger will be its institutional penetration.
For Migdal, the main problem in the Third World is that the state is weak and the regimes are confronted by ‘the rulers’ dilemma’, namely state leaders can only achieve political mobilisation when they have proffered viable strategies of survival to the populace. This requires an elaborate set of institutions. However, by creating strong state agencies, state leaders risk creating powerful sub-organisations, which may become potential power centres they cannot control. Lack of or fragmented social control, the ‘rulers’ dilemma’, and the difficulties of political mobilisation are all conditions that, according to Migdal, weaken the state. Therefore, the political prescription is to make the state stronger.
Strong States and Weak Societies
In contrast to Migdal’s thesis, it has been argued (Muslu 2013) that the lack of democracy in the Middle East should be attributed to the existence of strong states and weak societies, rather than the other way around. In other words, it is due to the existence of a strong and centralised state and the simultaneous lack of or weak presence of an autonomous and independent civil society that is the most significant limiting factor to democracy in the Middle East (Abootalebi 1998). According to Fatih Muslu (2013, 3) state control over its citizens’ behaviours via control of jobs, benefits, and modernisation processes has made democratic, political activism difficult to occur in the Middle East. Establishing a relationship of dependency by controlling socio-economic structure and creating an economic class highly dependent on the state for employment, financing and protection is one of the key factors perpetuating state power in the Middle East (Sivan 1997). This tendency, in conjunction with the clientelistic nature of Middle Eastern political systems reinforces authoritarian values (Ciftci 2010, 1145). Hence, in the absence of autonomous counter mechanisms in place to balance their power, Middle Eastern states have been too powerful in relation to their societies. As Eva Bellin (2004) argues, the primary factor contributing to the robustness of authoritarianism in the Middle East can be determined by the strength of the state and its capacity to maintain a monopoly on the means of coercion.
According to Muslu (2013, 10), the distribution of economic capabilities is the main determinant of social and political life in the Middle East. In fact, states are in control of every domain ranging from the economic to the cultural field. Even the rich classes lack independence from the control of the central state. Against strong and centralised bureaucracies, there is no aristocracy or urbanised bourgeoisie class (Muslu 2013, 9). In Middle Eastern societies, oil revenues, the presence of strong and expanded militaries, the increasing number of state bureaucrats, weak political oppositions, and foreign military and financial support have increased state capabilities and strength over society (Abootalebi 1998, 8). The disproportionate growth in state capabilities has expanded the state’s sphere of influence.
Middle Eastern societies have most certainly witnessed transformative developments but these developments were initiated by populist regimes, which launched intensive industrialisation and modernisation processes and aimed to reinforce their control and legitimacy by instituting and expanding bureaucracy (Ayubi 1990). This massive state-led capitalism penetrated into all segments of society and most urban classes and organisations became materially tied to the state and its patronage (Muslu 2013, 11). Existing social and economic classes have been demolished via successive land reforms, with the development of a new urban class who owes their economic status and prestige to the state (Sullivan 1992, 27–28; Kamrawa and Mora 1998, 895–6). While these ongoing economic and political developments in the region have enhanced the urban classes, tribal and other traditional social organisations have lost their social and political importance (Kienle 2011, 146). In most Middle Eastern countries, civil society organisations have had to deal with the various political and economic restrictions that have diminished their profound impact.
The problem with the above analysis is that strength is understood in terms of the state’s capacity to control its society and minimise or even eliminate societal expression. This implies that if resistance breaks out, then the state has not been so strong after all. Thus, the Arab Spring demonstrated the inability of the Middle Eastern state to manage its society and its weakness in terms of its socio-political cohesion. In other words, the more oppressive the state has been, the more anger created among its populace. Therefore, it was a matter of time before this anger would come out in the form of rebellion and resistance.
Weak/Strong States Versus Weak/Strong Powers
Strength as a state neither depends on, nor correlates with power. Hence, a distinction should be drawn between ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ states, on the one hand, and ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ powers, on the other. The notion of a ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ state refers to a country’s degree of socio-political cohesion (Buzan 1991, 97), while the notion of ‘weak’ or ‘strong’ power refers to the traditional distinction among states in respect of their military and economic capabilities (Handel 1981; Morgenthau 1973; Knorr 1975). Whether a state is weak or strong in terms of its socio-political cohesion has thus little to do with whether it is as weak or strong as a power. Of course, strong states can also be strong powers, such as Israel. On the other hand, strong states can be weak powers, like Egypt, while weak states can be quite strong powers, like Turkey and Iran. As the case of the Soviet Union indicates, even major powers could have serious weaknesses as states. Thus, they are obliged to maintain extensive internal security establishments. The main difference between weak and strong states is the low/high degree of legitimacy facing their governments.
Although no single indicator adequately defines the difference between weak and strong states, there are certain conditions which are expected to be found in weak ones (Buzan 1991, p. 100). First, weak states usually experience high levels of political violence or they are confronted with an ever-existing potential for violence. Second, they are characterised by a significant degree of police control over their citizens. Third, they face major political conflict over which ideology will be used to organise the state (e.g. secularism vs. Islamism or nationalism vs. pan-Arabism). Fourth, weak states lack coherent national identity, or they experience the presence of contending national identities within their territories (e.g. the Kurdish factor in Turkey and Iraq). Fifth, weak states lack a clear and observed hierarchy of political authority. Finally, they experience a high degree of state control over the media.
Within international anarchy, security issues are conditioned not only by the structure of the international system and the interaction of units (Waltz 1979; Jarvis 1989, 281) but also by the domestic characteristics of states (Buzan 1991, 37). In this way, the international and domestic realms of the state are not only of equal importance but, most importantly, they are interrelated. Consequently, security analysis requires a comprehensive definition of the state that binds territory, government, and society together and which links the internal and systemic perspectives mentioned above. Indeed, a third body of thought has attempted to do so by placing state and system into a mutually constitutive relationship (Buzan, Little and Jones 1993). In this way, the state is understood in terms of its territorial, political, and societal nexus and its security is analysed with reference to its three basic components: its idea, its physical base, and its institutional expression (Buzan 1991, 69–96).
The Idea of the State
By employing the idea of the state, one accepts the fact that the state exists primarily on the socio-political rather than on the physical plane. If the essence of the state resides in the idea of it held in the minds of its citizens, then, that idea itself becomes a major object of national security.
The idea of the state, however, might take different forms, and might even be quite different among those who share a common loyalty to a particular state. This notion raises significant security problems. A state without a binding idea among its citizens might be so disadvantaged as to be unable to sustain its territorial integrity. Discussing the idea of the state, one should focus on its two main sources: the nation and organising ideologies (Buzan 1991, 69–82).
The State-Nation Relationship
The importance of nation to the idea of the state is highlighted by the concept of national security itself, which implies that the object of security is the nation. This raises questions about the link between state and nation (Seton-Watson 1977; Gellner 1983). If the territories of nation and state coincide, then nation would define much of the relationship between state and society. However, this is very rarely the case. One is, therefore, obliged to conclude that the relationship between state and nation is a complex one.
According to Barry Buzan (1991, 72–78), the complex relationship between state and nation can be expressed through four models. The first is the nation-state model, which implies that the nation precedes the state and plays a significant role in giving rise to it. The purpose of the state is to protect and express the nation, and ensure the bond between them. The nation, on the other hand, provides the state with a strong identity in the international environment and a strong base of domestic legitimacy enabling it to resist domestic upheavals. Egypt offers a good example of a nation-state.
The second model is the state-nation. This model implies that after coming into existence the state plays a significant role in creating the nation. The United States (US) provides a good example of a state-nation. The purpose of the state is to generate uniform cultural and political elements that in the long-term would produce a national entity that would identify with the state. This may require the absorption of various ethnicities or religions (melting pot) in order to create a single new national one. So long as state-nations fail to solve their nationality problem, they remain vulnerable to instability and internal conflict in ways not normally experienced by states in harmony with their nations.
The third model is the part nation-state. This implies that a nation, like the Palestinians or the Kurds, is divided among two or more states. The idea of the unified nation-state frequently exercises a strong hold on part nation-states, which, thereby, represent a severe source of insecurity both to themselves and to other states. This case offers the maximum level of contradiction to the idea of national security, for it is precisely the nation that makes the idea of the state insecure.
The fourth model is the multination-state. It comprises those states that contain two or more nations within their boundaries. Two sub-types exist within this model: federative states and imperial states. Federative states, like Canada or Switzerland, reject the nation-state as the ideal type. Consequently, separate nations are allowed or even encouraged to pursue their own identities, and attempts are made to structure the state in such a way that no one nationality comes to dominate the whole state structure. Federative states have no natural unifying principle and, consequently, are more vulnerable to separatism and political interference than nation-states. However, there is a belief that political, social, economic, and cultural freedom and development would make this type of state preferable to its citizens than any other alternative.
Imperial states are those in which one of the nations within the state dominates the state structures to its own advantage. The dominant nation may seek to suppress the other nationalities by various means with a view of transforming itself into a nation-state. Turkey offers a good example of this type of state. It may also seek simply to retain its dominance, using the machinery of the state to enforce its position, without trying to eliminate or absorb other groups. The case of Iraq is illustrative of this type of state. In addition, it may adopt a more subtle approach of cultivating a pervasive non-nationalist ideology, such as Islam, which appears to transcend the national issue while in fact perpetuating the status quo.
Imperial states are vulnerable to threats aimed at their national division and their stability depends on the ability of the dominant nation to retain control. If their ability is weakened either by internal developments or by external intervention, the state structure stands at risk of complete collapse. Political threats are, thus, a key element in the national security problem of imperial states.
The above analysis makes it clear that national security in regard to the state-nation link can be read in several different ways and that, consequently, different states will experience very different kinds of insecurity and security in relation to the nationality question. Some states will derive great strength from their link to the nation, whereas for others the tensions between state and nation will define their weakest and most vulnerable point.
Organising Ideologies
Organising ideologies purport to address the bases of relationships between government and society and define the conditions for both harmony and conflict in domestic politics. If these ideas themselves are weak, or ‘if they are weakly held within society; or if strongly held, but opposed, ideas compete within society: then the state stands on fragile political foundations’ (Buzan 1991, 79). A variety of political, economic, religious and social ideologies can serve as an idea of the state. The importance of ideology as an organising principle of the state is highlighted by the conflict between secularism and Islamism in Turkey, between autocracy and democracy throughout the Middle East, between pan-Arabism and nationalism, and between moderate and radical Islamism.
Here a note of caution is required regarding the role of religion as an organising ideology as we need to be aware of the propensity to oversimplify its role in domestic and international affairs. Iran’s international assertiveness is as much due to Iranian-Persian nationalism as it is to the dictates of Shi’ite clerics. The international policies that Iran’s clerics adopt are rarely driven by theological precepts or religious doctrine, but rather political power calculations and a desire to preserve the quasi-theocratic status quo. Similarly, in Iraq, conflict between Sunnis and Shi’ites rarely stems from differences over religious doctrine and practice, but rather from historical and contemporary competition for state power. Sunni and Shi’ite identities are as much ethnic as religious.
Meanwhile, the Kurds, whether in Iraq or Turkey, are ethnically based. Most Kurds are also Sunni Muslims. This is not to suggest that religious identity is synonymous with ethnic identity, as in many circumstances religious identity implies explicitly religious behaviour and belief. However, in many cases the lines between ethnic and religious identities become so blurred that parsing them to assign blame for violence is difficult if not impossible. In both Somalia and Afghanistan, one source of the conflicts there is over which brand of Islam will prevail. But in both cases clan and ethnic differences define the composition of the forces in conflict as much as religious differences do.
Both the idea of the nation and organising ideologies point out that where the idea of the state is weak, a lapse in institutional strength might invite domestic upheavals which may, in turn, threaten the existence of state.
The Physical Base of the State
The physical base of the state refers to its population and territory, including all of the natural resources and wealth contained within its borders (Buzan, 1991, 90-96). The concrete character of the physical base makes threats against it considerably easy to be determined. However, a quite different threat to population can arise from human migrations whether voluntary or forced. This threat works primarily on the societal level, especially when the incoming population is of a different cultural, linguistic or ethnic group.
The Institutions of the State
According to Buzan (1991, 82), to understand the relevance of the institutions of state to security, one needs to ask the question: how does a state in which the ‘idea of state’ is weak or non-existent react to potential and actual domestic upheavals? This question raises the image of a maximal state in which an elite commands the machinery of government, particularly the armed forces and the police, and uses it to run the state in its own interests. In this case, the coherence of the state would be preserved by the use of the state’s coercive powers against its citizens.
The institutions of the state can be threatened by force (rebellion or revolution) or by political action based on ideas that have different institutional implications. When institutions are threatened by force, the natural reaction is defence. The use of armed or police forces may sustain the state institutions but without significant popular mass support, they would be precariously positioned. When institutions are threatened by opposing political ideas, the danger is that their legitimacy will be eroded.
The State-Nation-Religion Nexus and Political (In)Security: The Case of Iraq
Iraq is one of the most religiously and ethnically diverse societies in the Middle East. Roughly, two-thirds of Iraq’s people are Arabs, about one-fourth are Kurds, and the remainder consists of small minority groups. Iraq’s Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and Shi’ites. About three-fifths of the Iraqi population are Shi’ite and about two-fifths are Sunni. Fault lines between communities deepened in the twentieth century as a succession of authoritarian regimes ruled by exploiting tribal, sectarian, and ethnic divisions (Robertson 2016; Polk 2006).
It is estimated that the Kurds are the fourth largest ethnic group in the Middle East and they constitute a separate and distinctive cultural group possessing a strong tribal structure. There are important Kurdish minorities in Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Syria. Iraq’s Kurds are concentrated in the relatively inaccessible mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is roughly contiguous with Kurdish regions in those other countries; a fact that raises the possibility of a unified Kurdistan and simultaneously creates territorial threats to the countries where the Kurds are based.
The Kurds were thwarted in their ambitions for statehood after WWI and the Iraqi Kurds have since resisted inclusion in the state of Iraq. At various times, the Kurds have been in undisputed control of large tracts of territory. Attempts to reach a compromise with the Kurds in their demands for autonomy, however, have ended in failure, owing partly to government pressure and partly to the inability of Kurdish factional groups to maintain a united front against successive Iraqi governments. From 1961 to 1975, aided by military support from Iran, they were intermittently in open rebellion against the Iraqi government, as they were during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, and again, supported largely by the United States, throughout the 1990s (Tripp 2007, 192–239). As a result, the Saddam Hussein regime consistently tried to extend its control into Kurdish areas through threats, coercion, violence, and, at times, the forced internal transfer of larger numbers of Kurds (Tripp 2007, 192–193). Kurdish rebellions in the last quarter of the twentieth century resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Kurds – both combatants and non-combatants – and on various occasions forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee to neighbouring Iran and Turkey (Tripp 2007, 203).
As it was mentioned previously, Iraq’s Arab population is divided between Sunni Muslims and the more numerous Shi’ites. These groups, however, are for the most part ethnically and linguistically homogenous, and both value family relations strongly. Many Arabs, in fact, identify more strongly with their family or tribe than with national or confessional affiliations, a significant factor contributing to ongoing difficulties in maintaining a strong central government.
Although Shi’ites constitute the majority of the population, Iraq’s Sunni rulers have given preferential treatment to influential Sunni tribal networks, and Sunnis have dominated the military officer corps and civil service. Shi’ites remained politically and economically marginalised from the inception of the Iraqi state in 1920 until the fall of Ṣaddam Ḥussein’s regime in 2003 (Tripp 2007 194–196). Since the transition to elective government, Shi’ite factions have wielded significant political power.
Iran’s Islamic revolution in 1979 installed a regime that was clearly anti-Iraqi and had close ties with Syria. Given Iraq’s large and for the most part disfranchised Shi’ite population, Baghdad perceived relations between Syria and Iran as an unprecedented threat. When Khomeini came to power in February 1979, his example inspired many Shi’ites in Iraq to engage in greater political activism. Mass pro-Khomeini demonstrations and guerrilla activity became regular occurrences in Iraq. The regime cracked down on the Shi’ite movement with great ferocity, and hundreds were executed, some 10,000 were imprisoned, and tens of thousands were driven across the border into Iran.
During the Iran-Iraq War, in the northeastern provinces Iranian forces, in cooperation with Iraqi Kurds, threatened the area from Kirkuk to the Turkish border and penetrated into the Iraqi town of Ḥalabjah. They met with stiff resistance in the north, however. Using chemical weapons, Iraqi forces inflicted heavy casualties on Kurdish civilians in and around Ḥalabjah in March 1988 (Tripp 2007, 206). Meanwhile, Saddam’s control of society was strengthened by his continued domination of the country’s internal security services.
The defeat of Iraq in the 1990-1991 Gulf War encouraged the Shi’ite and Kurdish populations to rebel against the regime. In response, the government forces killed many people and caused extensive damage. The attempt by Iraqi forces to reconquer Kurdistan forced more than a million Kurds to flee to Turkey and Iran. Many died from hunger and disease. Only with Western intervention did the Kurdish refugees feel they could return to their homes in northern Iraq. In April 1991, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France established a ‘safe haven’ in Iraqi Kurdistan, in which Iraqi forces were barred from operating. Nevertheless, the Iraqi military launched a successful attack against the Kurdish city of Arbil in 1996 and engaged in a consistent policy of ethnic cleansing in areas directly under its control – particularly in and around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk – that was inhabited predominantly by Kurds (Tripp 2007, 234–239).
Only after the end of the 1990-1991 Gulf War did the Shi’ites rise up against Saddam Hussein’s regime. However, their rebellion was put down with great brutality. Shi’ite leaders were killed and imprisoned, madrasahs were closed, and public religious ceremonies were banned. The US-led coalition did not establish a safe haven for the Shi’ites in southern Iraq, and the regime subsequently put immense resources into excavating several large canals to drain the country’s southern marshes, which had been the traditional stronghold of the Shi’ite.
Following the 2003 US military intervention in Iraq, attempts were made to hand over control of the government to Iraqis (Marr and Al-Marashi 2017, 205–239; Dawisha 2011, 242–276). On January 30, 2005, despite the ongoing violence, general elections were successfully held for Iraq’s new 275-member Transitional National Assembly. A draft constitution approved by a national referendum in October 2005 called for a new legislature. Sunni Arabs voted overwhelmingly against the new constitution, fearing that it would make them a perpetual minority. In a general election on December 15, the Shi’ite United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) gained the most seats but not enough to call a government. After four months of political wrangling, the Shi’ite leader Nuri al-Maliki formed a coalition government that included both Arabs and Kurds but which was largely perceived as being pro-Shi’a.
In November 2010, after an eight-month political stalemate, Iraq’s major political parties entered a power-sharing agreement that paved the way for a national unity government (Marr and Al-Marashi 2017, 240-285; Dawisha 2011, 242–276). However, the power-sharing agreement soon proved unworkable; factional struggles over oil revenues and the control of government institutions continued. In February 2011, the Arab spring reached Iraq. On February 25, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Iraq to protest the country’s high unemployment rate, corruption, and insufficient public services. Iraqi police responded aggressively, attempting to disperse protesters with water cannons and in some cases live fire. The protests caused several provincial governors to step down from their posts. In the aftermath of the demonstrations, Al-Maliki announced new initiatives to meet protesters’ demands, including measures to ensure greater government accountability and fight corruption.
Iraq’s factional stalemate persisted, hindering reconstruction efforts and threatening to push the country back into sectarian conflict. The aggravation of sectarian tensions in 2013 translated into increased violence (Marr and Al-Marashi 2017, 287–311). Radical Sunni militants in western Iraq benefited from the presence of similar Sunni groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War, and weapons and fighters flowed back and forth across the Iraq-Syria border. In April 2013, al-Qaeda in Iraq and some radical elements of the Syrian opposition began operating jointly under the name Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria [ISIS]). By late 2013, ISIL had begun to pose a serious challenge to the Iraqi government’s control in western and northern areas of the country.
The ISIL/ISIS crisis eroded support for Maliki, whose sectarian approach to governing was seen as a major factor in the alienation of Sunnis. The nomination in early August of Haider al-Abadi to form a new cabinet seemed to signal that Al-Maliki’s efforts to retain power were doomed. Indeed, al-Abadi was installed as prime minister on September 8, 2014, and was able to form an inclusive administration. Efforts by Iraqi forces to expel ISIL from Iraq, with the support of a US-led coalition, continued under Abadi, with the group finally being pushed out of most of the country by the end of 2017.
Meanwhile, in September 2017, Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) officials held a nonbinding referendum on independence in the area under KRG control. The referendum was overwhelmingly approved with more than 92% of the vote. The referendum, however, found very little international support, many countries having urged the KRG not to proceed with it in order to avoid further exacerbating the already unstable nature of the region. The Iraqi central government was strongly opposed to the referendum. Within weeks of the vote, the government sent troops to the areas outside the KRG’s borders that were claimed by both the central government and the KRG, resulting in clashes between the two sides. Iraqi forces quickly retook Kirkurk, as well as other disputed areas outside the Kurdish autonomous region. Tensions between the two sides were reduced somewhat in March 2018 by the progress of ongoing negotiations.
The State-Society Relationship and Political (In)Security: The Case of the Arab Spring
The Arab Spring refers to the outbreak of protests in the Middle East that ultimately resulted in regime changes in countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya. The participants in these grassroots movements sought increased social freedoms and greater participation in the political process (Brownlee, Masoud and Reynolds 2015; Lynch 2017). Not all of the movements, however, could be deemed successful. In fact, in many Middle East countries the revolts of the Arab Spring resulted in increased instability and oppression (Bayat 2017; Fisk and Cockburn 2017). In some cases, these protests morphed into full-scale civil wars, as seen in countries such as Libya, Syria, and Yemen.
The series of large-scale political and social movements associated with the Arab Spring began in December 2010 when a Tunisian street vendor – Mohammed Bouazizi – set himself on fire to protest the arbitrary seizing of his vegetable stand by police over failure to obtain a permit. Bouazizi’s sacrificial act served as a catalyst for the so-called Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia (Zartman 2015, 50-79; Fisk and Cockburn 2017). As a result, massive protests broke out in Tunis, the country’s capital, and quickly spread throughout the country. The Tunisian government attempted to end the unrest by using violence against street demonstrations and by offering political and economic concessions. However, protests soon overwhelmed the country’s security forces prompting authoritarian president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had ruled the country with an iron fist for more than 20 years, to abdicate his position and flee to Saudi Arabia. The country’s first democratic parliamentary elections were held in October 2011 when Tunisians chose members of a council tasked with drafting a new constitution. A democratically chosen president and prime minister took office in December 2011. In addition, political prisoners were released and the political police was dissolved. In 2013 new protests began against the interim Islamist-led government, which led to the adoption of a new constitution. On October 2014, parliamentary elections took place; an event that signified the end of the political transition with Tunisia becoming a unicameral parliamentary republic.
The successful uprising in Tunisia inspired activists in other countries in the region to protest similar authoritarian governments in their own nations. Specifically, massive protests broke out in Egypt in late January 2011. The Egyptian government tried and failed to control protests by offering concessions while cracking down violently against protesters. After several days of massive demonstrations and clashes between protesters and security forces in Cairo and around the country, a turning point came at the end of the month when the Egyptian army announced that it would refuse to use force against protesters calling for the removal of President Hosni Mubarak (Fisk and Cockburn 2017). Having lost the support of the military, Mubarak left office on 11 February ceding power to a council of senior military officers.
In the period of euphoria that followed, the new military administration enjoyed high public approval, since the military had played a decisive role in ending the Mubarak regime. However, optimism was dampened when the new administration appeared hesitant to begin a full transfer of power to an elected government and when military and security forces resumed the use of violence against protesters (Danahr 2015, 54; Zartman 2015, 80). Confrontations between protesters and security forces became frequent occurrences. In spite of a multiday outbreak of violence in late November 2011, parliamentary elections proceeded as scheduled and the newly elected People’s Assembly held its inaugural session in late January 2012.
Following the controversial election of Mohamed Morsi in 2012, a coup led by Defence Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi installed the latter as president and he has remained in office since 2014. In response to a subsequent insurgency in Sinai, Egyptian armed forces launched anti-terror military operations in the peninsula. Nevertheless, violence and attacks by insurgents have increased since the ouster of Morsi. Encouraged by protesters’ rapid successes in Tunisia and Egypt, protest movements took hold in Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, and Syria. In these countries, however, outpourings of popular discontent led to protracted bloody struggles between opposition groups and ruling regimes.
In Yemen, where the first protests appeared in late January 2011, President Ali Adb Allah Salih’s regime was weakened when a number of the country’s most powerful tribal and military leaders aligned themselves with the pro-democracy protesters calling for him to step down (Zartman 2015, 116–144; Fisk and Cockburn 2017). When negotiations to remove Ṣaliḥ from power failed, loyalist and opposition fighters clashed in Sanaa, the country’s capital. Ṣaliḥ left Yemen in June to receive medical treatment after he was injured in a bomb attack, raising hopes among the opposition that a transition would begin. Ṣaliḥ returned to the country unexpectedly four months later, however, adding to the uncertainty and confusion about Yemen’s political future.
In 2011, Prime Minister Mujawar and members of the Yemeni Parliament from the ruling party resigned. Political chaos led to the occupation of several Yemeni regions by al-Qaeda and Houthi rebels. In response, Saleh sacked the military leaders and restructured the Yemeni military forces. In November 2011, after the approval of his immunity from prosecution by Yemeni legislators, Ṣaleḥ signed an internationally mediated agreement calling for a phased transfer of power to Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. However, al-Hadi was ousted by Houthi rebels and a violent civil war broke out as a result. The conflict has devolved into tribal warfare causing significant damage to the country’s infrastructure.
Mass protests demanding political and economic reforms erupted in Bahrain in mid-February 2011, led by Bahraini human rights activists and members of Bahrain’s marginalised Shi’ite majority (Zartman 2015, 209–248; Fisk and Cockburn 2017). In response, King Hamad offered economic concessions, released political prisoners and entered into negotiations with Shi’a representatives. However, the protests continued and the King requested the intervention of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). As a result, protests were violently suppressed by Bahraini security forces, aided by a force of about 1,500 soldiers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). By the end of March, the protest movement had been stifled. In the aftermath of the protests, dozens of accused protest leaders were convicted of anti-government activity and imprisoned, hundreds of Shi’ite workers suspected of supporting the protests were fired, and dozens of Shi’ite mosques were demolished by the government. In November 2011, an independent investigation into the uprising, commissioned by the Bahraini government, concluded that the government had used excessive force and torture against protesters. As a result, the Head of the National Security Apparatus removed from his post while the government vowed to act on the recommendations for reform included in the report. To this end, a Committee to implement the recommendations was formed. Today, officially, the country has a constitutional monarchy form of government, but personal freedoms remain limited.
In Libya, protests against the authoritarian regime of Colonel Muammar Qaddafi erupted in mid-February 2011 and they quickly escalated into a violent civil war (Danahr 2015, 325–368; Fisk and Cockburn 2017). When the rebel forces appeared to be on the verge of defeat in March, an international coalition led by NATO launched a campaign of air strikes targeting Qaddafi’s forces. Qaddafi was forced from power in August 2011 after rebel forces took control of Tripoli. After evading capture for several weeks, Qaddafi was captured, tortured, and eventually executed by opposition fighters in Surt in October 2011.
The challenges of governing Libya in the post-Qaddafi era became apparent soon after the internationally recognised provisional government, known as the Transitional National Council (TNC), took power. The TNC struggled to restart the Libyan economy, establish functional institutions of government, and exert control over the many autonomous regional and tribal militias that had participated in the rebellion against Qaddafi. Thus, since Qaddafi’s downfall, Libya has remained in a state of civil war, and two opposing governments effectively rule separate regions of the country. Libya’s civilian population has suffered significantly during the years of political upheaval, with violence in the streets and access to food, resources and healthcare services severely limited. This has contributed, in part, to the ongoing worldwide refugee crisis, which has seen thousands flee Libya, most often by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, with hopes of new opportunities in Europe.
In Syria protests calling for the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad broke out in southern Syria in mid-March 2011 and spread through the country (Danahar 2015, 369–420; Fisk and Cockburn 2017; Lynch 2017, 105–130; Zartman 2015, 291–331). The initial response of the Syrian government was to release some political prisoners, end the Emergency Law, and dismiss the Provincial Governors. This followed by the resignation of the government, as well as the resignation of members of the Syrian Parliament. Nevertheless the protests continued. The Assad regime responded with a brutal crackdown against protesters, drawing condemnation from international leaders and human rights groups. As a result, the Syrian army experienced a large number of defections, which led first to clashes between soldiers and defectors and eventually to the formation of the Free Syrian Army and a full-scale civil war.
A leadership council for the Syrian opposition formed in Istanbul in August, and opposition militias began to launch attacks on government forces. In spite of the upheaval, Assad’s hold on power appeared strong, as he was able to retain the support of critical military units composed largely of members of Syria’s ‘Alawite’ minority, to which Assad also belonged. Meanwhile, divisions in the international community made it unlikely that international military intervention, which had proved decisive in Libya, would be possible in Syria. Russia and China vetoed UN Security Council resolutions meant to pressure the Assad regime in October 2011 and February 2012 and vowed to oppose any measure that would lead to foreign intervention in Syria or Assad’s removal from power. The arrival of a delegation of peace monitors from the Arab League in December 2011 did little to reduce violence. The monitoring mission was suspended several weeks later over concerns for the safety of the monitors.
The Syrian Civil War has lasted for several years, forcing many to leave the country to seek refuge in Turkey, Greece and throughout Western Europe. For a time, the militant group ISIS had declared a caliphate in north-eastern Syria. The group executed thousands of people, and many others fled the region in fear of their lives. Yet, although ISIS has largely been defeated in Syria, the oppressive regime of Bashar al Assad remains in power in the country largely due to the military assistance it has received from Russia.
Lastly, the effects of the Arab Spring movement were felt elsewhere throughout the Middle East and North Africa as many of the countries in the region experienced at least minor pro-democracy protests. In Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, and Oman rulers offered a variety of concessions, ranging from the dismissal of unpopular officials to constitutional changes, in order to head off the spread of protest movements in their countries.
Specifically, in Algeria the 19-year old state of emergency was lifted (Zartman 2015, 145–181). In Jordan, King Abdullah II dismissed Prime Minister Rifai and his cabinet on February 2011 while on October 2011, King Abdullah dismissed Prime Minister Bakhit and his cabinet after complaints of slow progress on promised reforms. In April 2012, as the protests continued, Prime Minister Al-Khasawneh resigned, and the King appointed Fayez al-Tarawneh as the new Prime Minister of Jordan. In October 2012, King Abdullah dissolved the parliament for new early elections and appointed Abdullah Ensour as the new Prime Minister of Jordan.
In Oman, Sultan Qaboos offered economic concessions, dismissed his ministers and granted law-making powers to the country’s elected legislature. In Kuwait, protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and the dissolution of the Parliament, while in Morocco political concessions were offered by King Mohammed VI, including a referendum on constitutional reforms, respect and observance of civil rights, and a commitment to end corruption (Zartman 2015, 182–208).
In Saudi Arabia, economic concessions were offered by King Abdullah and male-only municipal elections were held on 29 September 2011 (Lynch 2017, 225–240). Later, King Abdullah announced his approval for women to vote and be elected in the 2015 municipal elections, as well as to be nominated to the Shura Council. He also committed himself to the expansion of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia; a process that was undertaken by Mohammad bin Salman after his ascension to the position of Crown Prince.
Conclusion
Due to their low degree of socio-political cohesion, weak states face great insecurity at the regime level. This is not only crucial to their own security, but also to that of the regions within which they are located. International anarchy is a decentralised system of order and, therefore, depends for its stability on the stability of its component units (states). Weak states are problematic for international order because their internal politics are often violent, and their domestic insecurity often spills over to disrupt the security of neighbouring states. Moreover, weak states can easily attract competitive outside intervention, as well as serve as targets to opportunistic aggressors.

Book Description:
Think of a map of World War I and chances are that map will be of Europe-but the First World War had just as heavy an impact on the Middle East, shaping the region into what we know it as today. This book gathers together leading scholars in the field to examine this impact, which is crucial to understanding the region's current problems and the rise of groups like the Islamic State.In addition to recounting the crucial international politics that drew fierce lines in the sands of the Middle East-a story of intrigue between the British, Russians, Ottomans, North Africans, Americans, and others-the contributors engage topics ranging from the war's effects on women, the experience of the Kurds, sectarianism, the evolution of Islamism, and the importance of prominent intellectuals like Ziya Gökalp and Michel 'Aflaq. They examine the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, the exploitation of notions of Islamic unity and pan-Arabism, the influences of Woodrow Wilson and American ideals on Middle East leaders, and likewise the influence of Vladimir Lenin's vision of a communist utopia. Altogether, they tell a story of promises made and promises broken, of the struggle between self-determination and international recognition, of centuries-old empires laying in ruin, and of the political poker of the twentieth century that carved up the region, separating communities into the artificial states we know today.

Introduction: the political transformation of the Middle East 1914–1923
Introduction: the political transformation of the Middle East 1914–1923 (pp. 1-18)
T.G. Fraser
The political map of the Middle East in 1923 could not have been more different to what it had been ten years before. Through no wish of their own most of the peoples of the region were under the rule of Britain and France. There were three exceptions to this. Under the commanding hand of Mustafa Kemal the Turks were emerging from the wreckage of their empire to forge a new national identity in their Anatolian heartland and the Egyptians, who had rebelled against British tutelage in 1919, had been granted sovereignty in 1922, albeit as yet limited. In the...
1 The rise of Egyptian nationalism and the perception of foreigners in Egypt 1914–1923
1 The rise of Egyptian nationalism and the perception of foreigners in Egypt 1914–1923 (pp. 19-40)
Amany Soliman
This chapter argues that the perception of foreigners in Egypt was influenced by the rise of Egyptian nationalism. The protection of foreigners by the British occupation, as well as the long standing privileges of the Capitulations, made the khawagat (foreigners) a major concern against the hoped-for Egyptian independent nation state for many of the nationalist activists. However, this chapter tries to show that the negative perception against the foreigners in Egypt, when found, was not due to xenophobia. It was the result of two factors; first: foreign economic dominance and exploitation, and second: the political activities of many foreigners who...

2 The antecedents and implications of the so-called Anglo-Sanussi War 1915–1917 (pp. 41-62)
Jason Pack
This chapter examines the background to – and fallout from – the First world war in Cyrenaica, the former Ottoman province comprising modern day Eastern Libya.¹ within the vast western language historiography of the First world war, this micro-conflict constitutes one of the warʹs least studied theatres. In Arabic, there does not seem to exist a single book-length treatment of the subject. From the British vantage point, this theatre was either understood as the war in the western Frontier Desert or as ʹthe Anglo-Sanussi warʹ. Over the last century the details of the conflict have only been treated in one...
3 British intelligence and Arab nationalism: the origins of the modern Middle East
3 British intelligence and Arab nationalism: the origins of the modern Middle East (pp. 63-76)
Steven Wagner
During 1917–18, Sir Mark Sykes represented the cabinetʹs Middle Eastern policy, working with members of General Allenbyʹs staff in Cairo, including his staff intelligence and the Arab Bureau, which handled political intelligence in the region. These intelligence officers were also responsible for handling negotiations with the Hashemite chief Sherif Husayn of Mecca in 1915. Sykes and these officers had to simultaneously plan victory and Britainʹs postwar interests. Few British officials recognised the inherent contradiction in their promises to Zionists and Arabs between 1917 and 1919. This chapter argues that Britainʹs lack of appreciation for the conflict inherent in its...
4 The First World War and its legacy for women in Iraq
4 The First World War and its legacy for women in Iraq (pp. 77-90)
Noga Efrati
The notion that the First world war was a watershed in gender relations in European societies, has characterised contemporary narratives and, for a long time, also historiography. Women proved their ʹpatriotism and fitness for citizenshipʹ and were rewarded with political and other rights.¹ a similar sentiment can be noted in post-First world war Iraq, if we stretch beyond the generally-accepted 1914–1918 timeline, as some suggest,² and include the 1920 revolt. Iraqi womenʹs leaders portrayed the revolt against the British occupation as a defining moment for women not only manifesting womenʹs nationalist awareness but also demonstrating their willingness to make...
5 From anti-imperial dissent to national consent: the First World War and the formation of a trans-sectarian national consciousness in Lebanon
5 From anti-imperial dissent to national consent: the First World War and the formation of a trans-sectarian national consciousness in Lebanon (pp. 91-110)
Mark Farha
As is indicated in the above quote by Khalil Saʹada (1857–1934), a trans-sectarian spirit of solidarity emanated out of the cauldron of the First world war. Not only did the crippling famine of 1915 claim both Christian and Muslim lives; periodic repression and press censorship had already alienated authors, editors and activists of all confessions during Hamidian and Young Turk rule. This is not to paint a picture of an idyllic trans-sectarian harmony or homogeneity. For the political orientation of the various dissident groups in the period 1876–1920 was fluid, and communal faultlines were evident in the ownership...
6 Historicising hunger: the famine in wartime Lebanon and Syria
6 Historicising hunger: the famine in wartime Lebanon and Syria (pp. 111-126)
Najwa al-Qattan
In October 1916, Nasib ʹArida, a Syrian immigrant and editor of the New York City magazine, al-Funun, bitterly lamented the apparent (at least to him) passivity of the ʹpeopleʹ in Lebanon and Syria in the face of their humiliation during the First world war. ʹArida expressed his outrage by denying such a people a place in historical memory; in fact, he denied them the right to be remembered at all. Nonetheless, he ends on a self-conscious note and ironically references his own stance as an immigrant and poet:
Shroud them,
Bury them,
Lay them in coffins down the deep grave....

7 The patriarch, the amir and the patriots: civilisation and self-determination at the Paris Peace Conference (pp. 127-146)
Andrew Arsan
It has long been a notion held dear by historians that the modern Middle East was born on the negotiation table at Paris, the Frankenstein-like offspring of the feverish horse-trading and double-dealing of British and French diplomats and statesmen. As David Fromkin put it in his oft-cited account of these negotiations, the familiar geopolitical outlines of the region ‘emerged from decisions made by the allies during and after the First world warʹ. The ʹcountries and frontiersʹ of the region, Fromkin argues, following a familiar motif, were artificial conceits ʹfabricated in Europeʹ in ignorance of local conditions, and imposed upon the...

8 A thoroughly modern Caliphate: could legitimate governance for the Middle East in the aftermath of the First World War have been found by looking within? (pp. 147-158)
Louise Pyne-Jones
The First world war marked a momentous turning point for Middle Eastern questions of power and authority. The notion of democracy, as it is understood by current definitions, was only just developing. The newest growth was a regional awakening to nationalism, symptomatic of its ever-expanding international reach. At that time nationalism took on new forms, adopting elements of the nation-states it passed through. In the Arab world, a similar pattern emerged in other nations that were moving away from the reaches of colonialism. However, in this region there was one key factor that stood to oppose the imported European vision...

9 From the Archduke to the Caliph: the Islamist evolution that led to ʹThe Islamic Stateʹ (pp. 159-174)
Aaron Y. Zelin
On the first night of Ramadan in 2014, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the spokesman for the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), announced a step that he described as ʹa dream that lives in the depths of every Muslim believerʹ: the re-establishment of the Caliphate. ʹIt is a hope that flutters in the heart of every mujahid [one who does jihad] muwahhid [monotheist],ʹ he continued. ʹIt is the caliphate. It is the caliphate – the abandoned obligation of the era…We clarify to the Muslims that with this declaration of the caliphate, it is incumbent upon all Muslims to pledge allegiance...
10 Some reflections on whether the Mandates were a slow burning fuse for toxic sectarianism in Arab countries
10 Some reflections on whether the Mandates were a slow burning fuse for toxic sectarianism in Arab countries (pp. 175-190)
John McHugo
This chapter¹ asks a question. To what extent, if at all, is sectarianism in Arab countries attributable to the Anglo-French partition of the predominantly Arabic speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire? was that partition, which took the form of giving League of Nations Mandates to Britain and France over largely Arabic speaking territories in which the majority of the population was Muslim, a fuse which lit the fires of the sectarianism which has subsequently spread across the Arab world?
Three factors link sectarianism directly to the Mandates. The first is the incorporation of the Balfour Declaration into the Palestine Mandate...
11 Oil, state and society in Iran in the aftermath of the First World War
11 Oil, state and society in Iran in the aftermath of the First World War (pp. 191-212)
Kaveh Ehsani
The First world war and its aftermath (beginning with the Soviet Revolution of 1917) were watersheds that revolutionised not only the military organisation of warfare, but also major spheres of public life across much of the world. Among those relations that began to be questioned and altered were the nature of the government and its relation to society, the perceptions and attitudes of ordinary people as well as elites toward politics and political participation, and the re-organisation of the corporate, financial, and industrial structures of capitalism and its modes of regulation. Oil played an important role in these changes, initially...
12 The new Arab intellectuals of the post-First World War period: the case of Taha Husayn
12 The new Arab intellectuals of the post-First World War period: the case of Taha Husayn (pp. 213-224)
Bruno Ronfard
Ardiç, in a study on Islam and secularisation, remarks that ʹmuch of the literature on religion and secularism involves the idea of a fundamental conflict between politics and religion as the basic assumptionʹ¹. Following this logic, Islam and modernity are conceived as incompatible. The aim of this study is to contribute to the literature on ʹalternativeʹ or ʹmultiple modernitiesʹ² by explaining some differences between the modernisation of the Middle East and the model that evolved in Western Europe. It is to understand the modernity in the Middle East as a process of
ongoing reconstructions of multiple institutional and ideological patterns...

13 A tale of two nationalists: parallelisms in the writings of Ziya Gökalp and Michel Aflaq (pp. 225-242)
Michael Erdman
The first stirrings of Arab political nationalism are widely recognised to have occurred during the latter years of the Ottoman Empire.¹ Missionary schools and international trade had opened up the Middle East to the ideas of Romantic Europe, and the creation of nation-states by the European Great Powers was rapidly laying waste to Ottoman sovereignty, if not suzerainty, over the Balkans. Despite this, the vast majority of Arabs in the Middle East would have to wait two or three decades after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 to achieve full-fledged independence. The establishment of British and French Mandates...

14 Women, war and the foundations of the Turkish Republic: the vision of New Womanhood in Halide Edib Adıvarʹs The Shirt of Flame (1922) (pp. 243-254)
Sevinç Elaman-Garner
One of the consequences of the First world war was the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the allied occupation of Istanbul, leading to the Turkish ʹwar of independenceʹ and ultimately the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923. This process of the birth of the new Turkish nation-state also required the birth of a new Turkish subjectivity, one which fitted with the visions of the new modernising nationalist elite and the search for a break from a ʹbackwardʹ past. A major part of this nation-building process was a growing attention to the position of women. The question of what...
15 The limits of soft power: why Kurdish nationalism failed in the French Mandate of Syria
15 The limits of soft power: why Kurdish nationalism failed in the French Mandate of Syria (pp. 255-272)
Laila McQuade and Nabil Al-Tikriti
By 1943 and 1946, Lebanon and Syria, respectively, had gained their independence from the French Mandate of Syria. However, this split of the original mandatory state into two sovereign states had been mapped out well before their official independence. From the inception of the Mandate, Lebanon was to be carved from Syria for independence, due to the Maronitesʹ special relationship with France. The fate of the remaining state of Syria, though, was less concrete. France favoured Syriaʹs minorities, and the Mandate evolved in the shadow of Woodrow Wilsonʹs Fourteen Points and his advocacy of self-determination. For these reasons, several groups...

16 The other jihad: Enver Pasha, Bolsheviks, and politics of anticolonial Muslim nationalism during the Baku Congress 1920 (pp. 273-294)
Alp Yenen
ʹMay the holy war of the peoples of the East and of the toilers of the entire world against imperialist Britain burn with unquenchable fire!ʹ¹ with these words, the Communist International (Comintern) appealed to the anti-imperialist sentiments of Muslim delegates attending the First Congress of the Peoples of East in Baku (in short Baku Congress) in September 1920. Like many lost and forgotten moments and movements during the aftermath of the First world war, the Baku Congress and the ideological climate of anticolonial Muslim nationalism were long dismissed by teleological narratives as marginal and obscure. Even an eyewitness has prominently...
17 A point of order: a battle for autonomy in the First Legislative Council of Transjordan
17 A point of order: a battle for autonomy in the First Legislative Council of Transjordan (pp. 295-312)
Harrison Guthorn
At all times during the Transjordan Mandate, the power of the state was divided between its monarch and its colonial overseers. These two poles of authority controlled the development of Transjordanʹs institutions and jockeyed for control over its future. These competing forces shaped the development of Jordanian governance and the enduring legacy of the Anglo-Hashemite state. The creation of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was the synthesis of Amir Abdullahʹs monarchical machinations tempered by British colonial oversight. However, the Transjordan state could only be successful if it involved the local elite population as well. The ensuing competition for influence and...

18 Drawing the line: Calouste Gulbenkian and the Red Line Agreement of 1928 (pp. 313-332)
Jonathan Conlin
Every map has its legend. The map attached to the Red Line agreement of 31 July 1928 is no exception. The Agreement was signed by an international consortium of oil companies who together owned 95% of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC). Bloodied as they were by previous price wars, the TPC shareholders now undertook to work together. Within the line they would prospect and produce solely through their joint-venture, TPC. In March 1914 TPC partners had met at the Foreign Office and agreed that their collaboration would extend, not only over the oil-rich Ottoman provinces of Mosul and Baghdad, but...

Middle East Crisis
The following article is from The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979). It might be outdated or ideologically biased.
Middle East Crisis
a sharpening of the contradictions after World War II between the forces of imperialism and the forces of progress that resulted from the aggressive actions of the imperialist powers and international Zionism against the national liberation movement of the peoples of the Arab East. One of the acute periods of crisis came with Israel’s aggression against the Arab countries, which began in 1967, supported by the imperialist powers (especially the United States) and the international Zionist circles.
The anti-imperialist and antifeudal struggle that developed throughout the Arab East after the victory of the anti-fascist coalition in World War II led to the emergence of a number of independent Arab states. The United States, Great Britain, and France, despite the existence of imperialistic contradictions between them, acted as a united front against the national liberation movement of the Arab peoples. They began compelling the Arab countries to conclude unequal treaties and agreements; building and reconstructing military, air, and naval bases on the territory of the Arab countries; and attempting to draw the Arab states into various military-political blocs and groups. They also imposed “aid” upon them, planted their agents there on a wide scale, and organized the persecution of patriotic and progressive forces.
Great Britain and the United States also created a permanent center of danger for the Arabs in Palestine, where imperialism and international Zionism, supported by local reactionary circles, sharply intensified national differences to a point where there were open military clashes between the Arab and Jewish populations in the territory, which was administered under a British mandate. As a result, the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution of Nov. 29, 1947, which partitioned the territory of Palestine into two independent states—an Arab state and a Jewish state—was frustrated, and on May 15, 1948, the day after the declaration of the creation of the state of Israel, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948–49 was unleashed. The war enabled Israel, which had the support of the imperialist powers and of international Zionist circles and organizations, to forcibly change its frontiers, which had been defined by the United Nations decision, and to seize considerable territories in Palestine that had been allotted to the Arab Palestinian state.
In May 1950 the United States, Great Britain, and France made the so-called Tripartite Declaration, in which they declared their intention to guarantee the inviolability of the frontiers of the Middle Eastern states and expressed their readiness to supply the Arab countries and the state of Israel with armaments and military equipment, allegedly for the purpose of ensuring their internal security. This declaration, the colonialist nature of which was only too evident, was accepted by Israel alone, since the guarantees stated in it confirmed the results of its war with the Arabs.
On Oct. 13, 1951, the United States, Great Britain, France, and Turkey proposed that the Arab countries participate in the establishment of a “Middle East command,” which would provide for foreign troops to be stationed in the countries of the Middle East and a number of other measures (placing armed forces, military bases, ports, and so on at the disposal of the “allied command” staff). As this obviously neocolonialist plan was rejected by the Arabs, the three powers and Turkey changed their tactics and concluded a number of bilateral military alliances that led to the establishment, with the participation of Iraq, of the Baghdad Pact. However, attempts to draw other Arab countries besides Iraq into the pact proved fruitless, and after the July Revolution of 1958, Iraq withdrew from the pact.
As the liberation movement in the Arab East grew stronger, the imperialist powers attached ever-increasing importance to Israel as a weapon in their anti-Arab policy. The extremism of the governing circles of the Israeli state, its aggressive activity against the Arab countries, and its attempts to create through the seizure of Arab lands a “great Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates” met with the full support of the leading imperialist powers. Israel received a vast amount of financial and military support from the imperialists. Thus, from 1948 to 1966, American aid, reparations from the Federal Republic of Germany, contributions made to Israel by Zionist organizations abroad, and private capital investments in Israel’s economy amounted to about $8 billion, more than half of which came from the United States. All this money, together with large deliveries of all types of armaments, helped to create Israel’s military and economic potential, designed to serve its expansionist policies.
In October 1956, Great Britain, France, and Israel carried out an armed attack against Egypt—which had pursued a policy of genuine independence after its July Revolution of 1952—with the aim of overthrowing the legitimate Egyptian government and forcing Egypt to capitulate before the military, political, and economic demands of the aggressors. This tripartite aggression ended in failure because of the resistance of the Egyptian people and the powerful support they received from the Arab states, the USSR, and other countries of the socialist community, as well as from all peace-loving peoples. In January 1957 the United States announced its program of expansion in the Near and Middle East, known as the Eisenhower Doctrine. However, contrary to its calculations, the doctrine was accepted only by the participants in the Baghdad Pact and Israel. In accordance with the doctrine, the United States and Turkey endeavored to carry out an armed intervention in Syria in autumn 1957, but the Syrian government, with the support of peace-loving forces led by the USSR, was able to prevent this attempt. In the summer of 1958 the United States led its forces into Lebanon, and Great Britain acted similarly in Jordan, an action that appeared to be a preparation for intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq for the purpose of restoring the reactionary regime there, which had been overthrown by the people. However, the determined attitude taken up by the USSR in defense of the Arab nations once again helped to prevent intervention and caused the aggressors to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
The struggle against colonial rule in the western part of the Arab world compelled France to recognize the independence of Morocco, Tunisia (1956), and Algeria (1962). In 1962 the monarchist regime in Yemen was overthrown. Great Britain, fearing that it might lose its supremacy in southern and eastern Arabia and in the PersianGulf region, strove overtly and covertly to eliminate the Yemen Arab Republic; Saudi Arabia participated in this struggle with Great Britain, yet attempts to eliminate the republican regime in Yemen proved unsuccessful. Subsequently, British imperialism was obliged to withdraw its troops from its important military base in Aden and to grant independence to the protectorates of Southern Arabia, on whose territory the People’s Republic of Southern Yemen (1967) was proclaimed.
In order to disrupt the unity of the Arab states and weaken their struggle against imperialism and Zionism, the forces hostile to them aggravated them and endeavored to utilize for their own ends the difficulties facing Arab countries in their economic development and certain differences in their social structures, as well as such problems as the Kurdish question in Iraq, the Iranian-Arab differences in the Persian Gulf area, and the racial conflict in southern Sudan.
On June 5, 1967, Israeli armed forces provocatively invaded the territory of the United Arab Republic, Syria, and Jordan and subsequently occupied a considerable part of their lands. Relying on the support of the United States and other imperialist countries, Israel gave ultimatums to these Arab states; accepting the Israeli demands would have been tantamount to total surrender. However, Israel and the forces of imperialism and world Zionism supporting it failed to accomplish their main goals: to overthrow the progressive regimes in Egypt and Syria, thereby undermining the liberation movement of the Arab peoples; to put an end to the close cooperation between the progressive Arab states and the USSR and other socialist countries, thereby weakening as much as possible its influence on the settlement of problems connected with the Middle East crisis; and to forcibly compel the Arab states to settle, on terms favorable to Israel, the problem of the Palestinian refugees (numbering. 1.5 million in 1970) driven from their lands as a result of the openly chauvinistic policy of the Israeli Zionists.
Israel has persisted in its endeavors to utilize the results of its aggression, although such action might threaten a further outbreak of war. The rulers of Israel, with the support of world reactionism, including Zionist circles, have persistently failed to comply with the demands of peace-loving nations for a settlement of the Middle East problem through the withdrawal of troops from all seized Arab territories and the settlement of a number of other questions relating to the Arab-Israeli conflict as laid down in United Nations resolutions (the Security Council resolution of Nov. 22, 1967, the General Assembly resolution of Dec. 11, 1948, on Palestinian refugees, the resolutions of the Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly of July 4 and 14, 1967, and of the Security Council of May 21, 1968, and July 3, 1969, on Jerusalem, and others).
A divergence that developed in the positions of the imperialist powers acted to some extent as a new factor in the Middle East crisis. France, which in the 1960’s began to follow an independent policy within NATO, condemned the Israeli aggression, imposed an embargo on the export of arms to Israel, and, unlike the other members of NATO, demonstrated an understanding attitude toward the Arab view on the question of a settlement. The positions of the USSR and France on this question drew markedly closer, a fact that had a definitely positive effect on consultations between the representatives of the four powers—the USSR, France, the USA, and Great Britain—which began on Apr. 3, 1969, in New York for the purpose of seeking ways of achieving a peaceful political settlement in the Middle East.
The Middle Eastern problems have, in effect, remained on the agenda of the main organs of the United Nations. When the differences in the Middle East became more acute, emergency sessions of the United Nations General Assembly were convened on three occasions (1956, 1958, and 1967) and emergency special sessions on three occasions (1947, 1948, and 1961). Whenever any problems concerning the Middle Eastern crisis were examined in the United Nations, the Soviet Union and other socialist states always defended the interests of the Arab peoples, enabling them to hold out in their struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and the aggressive ambitions of Israel and international Zionism.
However, the aggressive attitude of the imperialist powers and the expansionist aims of the Israeli ruling circles prevented the forces of peace from reducing tensions in the Middle East to a point where it could have become an area of stable and enduring peace. Israel, assisted by the United States, a number of other imperialistic states, and international Zionist circles, had created by early 1970 a situation in the Middle East characterized by constant armed provocations and by a de facto state of undeclared war against the Arab states. In autumn 1970 bloody incidents were provoked in Jordan for the purpose of crushing the resistance movement of the Palestinian Arabs who were acting against Israel and of creating a pretext for possible intervention in Arab affairs by imperialists and Israeli Zionists. This led to sharp protests from Arab and world public opinion and to an official warning by the USSR against the admissibility of such intervention. Egypt, Syria, and other Arab states are strengthening their armed forces with the support of the socialist countries and offering growing resistance to the aggressors. The struggle for liberation has markedly increased in intensity in the Arab territories occupied by Israel. Solidarity between Arabs is growing ever stronger. The general anti-imperialistic front of the Arabs gained markedly in strength as a result of the revolutions in Sudan and Libya.
On Apr. 17, 1971, the leaders of the UAR (the Arab Republic of Egypt since Sept. 2, 1971), Syria, and Libya decided to combine all their efforts in the struggle against the invaders and to create a triple federation. The creation of the Federation of Arab Republics (FAR) made imperialist and Zionist circles extremely wary.
At the same time Soviet-Arab cooperation in economic, political, and military fields was gaining strength. The Friendship and Cooperation Treaty between the Soviet Union and Egypt was signed on May 27, 1971. A treaty between the USSR and Iraq followed on Apr. 9, 1972. The treaties emphasized the intentions of the parties to lead a persistent struggle against imperialism and Zionism and included clauses preordaining military cooperation by the signatories.
On Apr. 8, 1971, the Twenty-fourth Congress of the CPSU adopted a special declaration in support of Arab peoples, including the Arab people of Palestine. A just settlement in the Near East became a most important and integral part of the peace program confirmed by the congress.
The actions of the aggressors, their reluctance to settle the Middle East crisis through peaceful political means are sharply condemned by the world community.

Alright, I've got this question: "Does war make states? Rentierism and the formation of states in the Middle East." Okay, so I need to explore whether war plays a role in the formation of states, specifically looking at the concept of rentierism in the Middle Eastern context.

First, I need to understand what "rentierism" is. From the search results, it seems that rentierism refers to states that derive a significant portion of their revenue from the rent of natural resources, like oil. So, these are countries that don't rely much on taxation from their citizens but on external revenues from things like oil exports.

Now, the question is linking this concept to state formation and the role of war in that process in the Middle East. So, perhaps war has influenced how these rentier states have formed or how they function.

Looking at the documents, especially Doc 1 and Doc 2, they discuss the history of the Middle East, particularly focusing on the formation of modern states in the region post-World War I. It seems that the Ottoman Empire collapsed after WWI, and the victorious Allied powers,主要是英国和法国，划分了中东地区的边界，建立了新的国家，如伊拉克、黎巴嫩、叙利亚等。

So, perhaps the formation of these states was influenced by the war, as the defeat of the Ottoman Empire led to the redrawing of boundaries and the establishment of new nations under the mandates of the League of Nations.

But how does rentierism fit into this? Well, many of these newly formed states in the Middle East have abundant natural resources, particularly oil. So, their economies became heavily reliant on oil revenues, making them rentier states.

Maybe the war and the subsequent formation of these states set the stage for the development of rentierism in the region. The discovery and exploitation of oil in these countries transformed their economies and political structures, leading to the characteristics associated with rentier states.

Moreover, the involvement of external powers, like Britain and France, in the region's affairs, especially in controlling and exploiting oil resources, could have further shaped the nature of these states.

Doc 2 talks about the state-society relationship and distinguishes between weak and strong states in terms of their socio-political cohesion. It seems that in the Middle East, many states are considered weak in this regard, meaning they have low levels of socio-political cohesion.

But how does this relate to rentierism? Perhaps rentier states, by not needing to rely on taxation from their citizens, don't need to build strong institutions or foster broad-based support from their populations. This could lead to weaker state-society ties and less socio-political cohesion.

On the other hand, maybe rentierism has allowed some states to maintain stability and control through the distribution of wealth, even without strong institutions or broad societal support.

Doc 3 mentions the evolution of state power in the Arab world, including single-party regimes and family rule, which might be relevant to understanding how rentierism has influenced state formation and governance in the Middle East.

Doc 4 provides a historical perspective on the impact of World War I on the Middle East, discussing the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of new nation-states. It also touches on themes like nationalism, sectarianism, and the role of external powers in shaping the region.

Lastly, Doc 5 seems to be an encyclopedia entry on the Middle East crisis, which likely refers to the ongoing conflicts and tensions in the region, possibly rooted in the historical developments mentioned earlier.

So, synthesizing all this information, it appears that war, specifically World War I, played a significant role in reshaping the Middle East by dismantling the Ottoman Empire and leading to the creation of new states. Many of these states became rentier states due to their reliance on oil revenues.

This combination of war-induced state formation and the subsequent development of rentier economies has had lasting impacts on the political, social, and economic structures of Middle Eastern countries, contributing to the region's complexities and ongoing challenges.

In conclusion, war has indeed been a factor in making states in the Middle East, particularly through the aftermath of World War I. Rentierism, arising from the region's abundant natural resources, has further shaped the nature of these states and their relationships with their societies.

\boxed{\text{Yes, war has played a role in making states in the Middle East, and rentierism has significantly influenced their formation and characteristics.}}
