So I'm trying to figure out why people leave their jobs. It seems like a pretty broad question, but I think breaking it down into different categories might help. Maybe start by considering personal reasons, career advancement, work environment, and maybe even external factors. Let me think about each one.

First, personal reasons. People's lives change all the time—they might have family obligations that require them to spend more time at home, or maybe they've decided to pursue further education and need to step back from their current job. Health issues could also play a role, either their own health or a family member's, needing to care for someone. So, personal growth and responsibilities seem like big factors.

Next, career advancement. Sometimes, people feel stagnated in their current role and seek new opportunities where they can grow professionally. Maybe they're not getting the promotions they wanted, or there's no room for advancement in their current company. Alternatively, they might find better opportunities elsewhere that offer higher salaries or more benefits. Competition among companies for talent is fierce, so offers of better packages can lure employees away.

Work environment is another crucial aspect. This includes everything from the company culture, relationships with coworkers and managers, to the physical workspace. If someone doesn't gel with the company culture or has conflicts with colleagues, it can make going to work every day miserable. Poor management, lack of support, or unrealistic expectations can also lead to dissatisfaction. Additionally, if the workplace is uncomfortable or unsafe, that’s a big red flag.

External factors can't be ignored either. Economic conditions, industry changes, and even global events can influence someone's decision to leave their job. For example, during an economic downturn, people might look for more stable positions. Or, in the current climate with remote work becoming more acceptable, people might leave jobs that don't offer flexibility.

I should probably look up some statistics or studies on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe there are common reasons that appear across different industries and demographics. It would be interesting to see if age, gender, or job type plays a role in why people decide to quit.

Let me try searching for some information on this.

Although the reality of an employee deciding to leave a company is a very sad one, it doesn’t mean the company can’t learn from the experience. To start, loop your human resources team in and work to build a collaborative culture across all teams to encourage employees to work together. Boosting employee engagement is a sure-fire way to create an inclusive and welcoming company culture.
This part is for all the employers or managers out there. No matter what, everyone has the ability to make the call when it’s time to leave. The best thing you can do is to listen to your team and create the best environment possible for them. Take these statistics and use them as you plan for the future.

Why Are People Quitting Their Jobs? - Sheer Velocity
September 13, 2021
Why Are People Quitting Their Jobs?
An interesting trend has developed this year, more people are voluntarily leaving their jobs, even as unemployment rates remain higher than their pre-pandemic levels. So why are people quitting their jobs more than ever before?
The reasons for leaving a job are not new. They include more money, dissatisfaction, unfulfillment, lack of upward mobility, and better work-life balance. The pandemic and its remote working mandate has provided an extended period of time for people to rethink what work means to them, how they choose to invest their time, and changed their expectations of how work fits into their lives.
A Microsoft Corp. workplace trends survey found that 40% of Americans are considering leaving their jobs this year. This study is similar to one conducted by Yahoo, that indicated 37% of workers are thinking of leaving their jobs.
According to jobs data for April, more than 4 million US workers left their jobs. With nearly 750,000 of those people working in the hospitality industry. This industry, which was hit hard by the pandemic, has seen many of its workers leave for higher-paying jobs in other industries where they don’t have to work weekends, evenings, and holidays.
A recent piece from Bloomberg speaks to this new trend and how it may benefit both employees and employers. Since the 1980s, voluntary job changes have been declining, regardless of skillset and income. And some economists speculate this is an important reason why wages have not changed much over the past 40 years.
The article cites organizational psychologist Adam Grant and his take on how Americans are languishing. They are risk-averse and aren’t growing emotionally or economically. The lockdown brought about by the pandemic enabled people to realize how long they’ve been stuck in a rut.
The benefit is that many are now taking proactive steps to make a change. This can provide them with higher wages and new skills. Economists believe that industries with higher rates of job change lead to increases in innovation and a more durable economy.
While we are seeing higher rates of people quitting their jobs, history tells us that after a negative experience, we often become even more risk-averse. Does this mean all the talk of quitting is just that, talk? Employers hope so, offering hybrid work schedules and retention bonuses that they hope will tide people over until they settle back into their complacent routine.
According to Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter Economist, “People are leaving for more attractive jobs because there are lots of attractive jobs on offer,” she told Yahoo Money. “The share of signing bonuses has very radically exploded, the share of jobs offering a four-day workweek has also about doubled.”
“There are many jobs where pay is low, and one doesn’t have that much attachment to an employer,” Pollak said. “When suddenly warehousing and trucking and nursing are offering huge bonuses and reducing experience requirements and training requirements, they suddenly become much more attractive.”
According to the Yahoo data, younger generations are more likely to quit, with 46% of Millennials and 36% of Gen Z thinking of leaving versus 31% of Gen X and 21% of Baby Boomers. When asked what would convince an employee to stay, a 10% increase in pay was the top response, followed by better benefits. This supports data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with a new high in earnings expectations in March of this year, at $72,341 annually.
The balance between employee and employer has been altered by the pandemic and keeping top talent is going to be more difficult than ever before. Creating a culture that values employees is a key to reducing turnover rates.

Why Employees Quit: 20 Stats Employers Need to Know
Why Employees Quit Statistics
According to a 2018 study by Mercer, a whopping third of all employees plan on quitting their job in the next 12 months. That number is astronomically high compared to when our our parents and grandparents were our age. This growing amount of turnover is getting more and more expensive for companies. In fact, one study revealed that replacing a high-talented employee will cost a company 200% of the employees annual salary.
So what’s happening?
Let’s start with the millennials, who seem to be leading this charge. We’ve all heard the endless stories about “lazy” millennials, and their extremely poor work ethic. However, I can assure you that is far from the truth. While they are leading the charge for less stressful and more meaningful work environments, they are anything but lazy. In fact, I’d argue that they’re just more aware of the harmful effects of a poor work-life balance.
So, is refusing to put work first before all other aspects of your life so wrong? Is that the definition of lazy?
I think not.
So why are so many people quitting their jobs?
What do the science, case studies and statistics say?
And what should employers do differently to reduce employee turnover?

Takeaways:
Company culture is key.
To retain more and better employees, companies need to take their culture seriously. The environment, rules, and employee peers are taken into great consideration when quitting a job or starting a new one.
Work-life balance is the future.
Work-life balance has never been more important. Employees don’t want to live at work, and be consumed by their job. They want to be trusted to work from home, coffee shop, or any where they desire.
Employee engagement is super important.
Employees want to love their job and their company. They want to know that what they do is valued, and matters.
Millennials know how to be productive.
Unhappy employees are unproductive employees. Millennials are just demanding what Generation X, and baby boomers could not…respect, meaning and happiness.
Money is not the problem.
Of course employees want to make more money, and some studies did show that, but it wasn’t close to being a major concern, especially for millennials.
Conclusion
If you’re reading this article, and you’re an employer like me, stop what you’re doing and make a checklist. Make a checklist of everything you’re going to do to start listening and adhering to your employee’s happiness.
Make the lost, and call a meeting with your team tomorrow on how to implement it.

Why People Quit Their Jobs
Employee retention
Why People Quit Their Jobs
From the Magazine (September 2016)
Paul Garland
Imagine that you’re looking at your company-issued smartphone and you notice an e-mail from LinkedIn: “These companies are looking for candidates like you!” You aren’t necessarily searching for a job, but you’re always open to opportunities, so out of curiosity, you click on the link. A few minutes later your boss appears at your desk. “We’ve noticed that you’re spending more time on LinkedIn lately, so I wanted to talk with you about your career and whether you’re happy here,” she says. Uh-oh.
It’s an awkward and Big Brother–ish scenario—and it’s not so far-fetched. Attrition has always been expensive for companies, but in many industries the cost of losing good workers is rising, owing to tight labor markets and the increasingly collaborative nature of jobs. (As work becomes more team-focused, seamlessly plugging in new players is more challenging.) Thus companies are intensifying their efforts to predict which workers are at high risk of leaving so that managers can try to stop them. Tactics range from garden-variety electronic surveillance to sophisticated analyses of employees’ social media lives.
Some of this analytical work is generating fresh insights about what impels employees to quit. In general, people leave their jobs because they don’t like their boss, don’t see opportunities for promotion or growth, or are offered a better gig (and often higher pay); these reasons have held steady for years. New research conducted by CEB, a Washington-based best-practice insight and technology company, looks not just at why workers quit but also at when. “We’ve learned that what really affects people is their sense of how they’re doing compared with other people in their peer group, or with where they thought they would be at a certain point in life,” says Brian Kropp, who heads CEB’s HR practice. “We’ve learned to focus on moments that allow people to make these comparisons.”
Some of the discoveries are unsurprising. Work anniversaries (whether of joining the company or of moving into one’s current role) are natural times for reflection, and job-hunting activity jumps by 6% and 9%, respectively, at those points. But other data reveals factors that have nothing directly to do with work. For instance, birthdays—particularly midlife milestones such as turning 40 or 50—can prompt employees to assess their careers and take action if they’re unhappy with the results. (Job hunting jumps 12% just before birthdays.) Large social gatherings of peers, such as class reunions, can also be catalysts—they’re natural occasions for people to measure their progress relative to others’. (Job hunting jumps 16% after reunions.) Kropp says, “The big realization is that it’s not just what happens at work—it’s what happens in someone’s personal life that determines when he or she decides to look for a new job.”
Technology also provides clues about which star employees might be eyeing the exit. Companies can tell whether employees using work computers or phones are spending time on (or even just opening unsolicited e-mails from) career websites, and research shows that more firms are paying attention to these things. Large companies have also begun tracking badge swipes—employees’ use of an ID to enter and exit the building or the parking garage—to identify patterns that suggest a worker may be interviewing for a job. Companies sometimes retain outside firms, such as Joberate, to monitor employees’ social media activity for indications that people are scouting for new options. (Among other things, such firms look at whom employees are connecting with.) Joberate CEO Michael Beygelman compares this emerging science to the way that credit scoring can predict which consumers will fail to repay loans. Although some companies hire Joberate to help them anticipate which individual employees might think of leaving, others use the intelligence to zero in on departments or locations with high “likely to leave” scores so that they can work on team building and overall engagement. One large tech company uses it to target people it might lure away from other firms. Some investors use it to identify companies that may soon face turnover in key positions. “If the CIO and the head of sales are both likely to be job hunting, you have to ask what’s up,” Beygelman says.
Lori Hock, the CEO of Hudson Americas, a recruitment process outsourcing company that uses Joberate, values predictive intelligence because it helps her reduce clients’ attrition—and spot things that may be driving it. “Is it a bad manager?” she says. “Is there a training component? Are we undervaluing certain positions? It gives you a nice opportunity to think about what the trigger might have been—and to ask questions before you lose talent.”
“This Is an Early-Warning Signal”
Genevieve Graves studied astrophysics before joining hiQ Labs, a start-up that applies predictive analytics to talent ...
Some firms, such as Credit Suisse, take this tack with employees identified as being at risk of leaving: Internal recruiters cold-call the employees to alert them to openings inside the company. In 2014 the program reduced attrition by 1% and moved 300 employees, many of whom might otherwise have left, into new positions. Credit Suisse estimates that it saved $75 million to $100 million in rehiring and training costs.
Researchers agree that preemptive intervention is a better way to deal with employees’ wandering eyes than waiting for someone to get an offer and then making a counteroffer. CEB’s data shows that 50% of employees who accept a counteroffer leave within 12 months. “It’s almost like when you’re in a relationship and you’ve decided you want to break up, but your partner does something that makes you stick around a little longer,” Kropp says. “Employees who accept a counteroffer are most likely going to quit at some point very soon.”

16 Reasons Employees Leave Their Jobs
16 Reasons Employees Leave Their Jobs
By Indeed Editorial Team
February 24, 2021
There may come a time in your career when you decide to move on from your current job. The reasons for this decision can vary depending on your workplace and personal life. In order for employers to keep employees around, they need to understand why employees want to leave the company. In this guide, we share 16 common reasons employees leave their current job.
Why it's important to know the reasons employees leave
It's important to know why employees leave because when a company has a high turnover rate, this could signify low employee job satisfaction. Hiring new employees to fill these openings requires time and effort, which is why it's useful for employers to find ways to keep their current employees around. By knowing the reasons employees leave, employers can directly solve a reoccurring issue and make a more pleasant work environment for everyone.
Common reasons employees leave their job
These are the top reasons employees decide to quit their jobs:
1. Needing more of a challenge
After working at the same job for a while, you start to get to know all of your tasks and responsibilities quite well. When there's little more to learn in your role, you may start to feel like you are ready for more of a challenge. This is a natural part of growing in your career, especially as you become interested in learning new skills.
2. Looking for a higher salary
When you feel like you're underpaid for the work you do, it may be time to move onto a new job. Likewise, you may be ready to accept more responsibilities and with that comes more pay. As your lifestyle changes or your family grows, you may decide that you need to make more money to afford your living expenses.
3. Feeling uninspired
What started as an exciting opportunity may eventually leave you feeling uninspired over time. Finding a new job is a great way to feel passionate about your work once again. Your current company may not have opportunities for you to do meaningful work, which is why it's important that your next employer's values and mission align with your own.
4. Wanting to feel valued
Feeling replaceable at your job may make you want to search for a position where your efforts are valued more. It feels good to know your work is important and making an impact on the success of the company. Sometimes entry-level positions can make this challenging since you have fewer responsibilities. In this scenario, you may be ready for a higher-level job.
5. Seeking a better management relationship
As you get into your career, you may discover that you get along with some people better than others. This is a perfectly normal part of working at any business, although finding a new job may give you the opportunity to build healthier relationships. If you feel like you need a more supportive manager or supervisor, it may be time to look for a company that values employee-manager relationships more.
6. Searching for job growth and career advancement
If your current employer is limited in the number of promotions or learning opportunities they can offer, you may want to find an employer who has these resources. Having room to grow in your career is an important part of feeling fulfilled. Quality employers offer continued education, like workshops, seminars, lectures or even tuition reimbursement.
7. Needing more feedback or structure
Some people thrive off a more fluid work environment while others need more structure. Consistently feeling unsure about how your manager views your progress and effort is a common reason to look for a new job. An integral part of improving your performance is to get regular feedback from your employer. Find a job where they have regular performance reviews.
8. Wanting a different work environment
Every company has a different kind of work environment. This could be the actual structure of the workplace, such as closed offices, an open layout or cubicles. It can also refer to the company's culture, whether it is more casual, social or professional. You may want a job that offers you a work environment you feel the most comfortable working in.
9. Looking to live somewhere else
There are many reasons you might want to move, such as living expenses or things to do. You may decide that you'd rather live somewhere closer to family. Likewise, many people who work in the city may look for a job in the suburbs when they are ready to start a family. If your job doesn't offer remote work and you want to move, you may need to look for a new job.
10. Feeling conflicted with workplace policies
Many employees enjoy a workplace that offers flexible scheduling and telecommuting opportunities. If you feel like your work policies make it challenging to do this, there are many other companies that offer such benefits. Likewise, you may find that your company's paid-time-off and sick leave policies don't align with your personal needs. These are all common reasons many people quit their job.
11. Thinking that their job has changed
When you first start a job, the employer lays out all of your benefits, perks and responsibilities. As your company evolves, you may realize that your job looks quite different from when you first started. This could mean that some of your perks have been reduced or that you're doing work you didn't apply to do.
12. Wanting a clearer company vision
A central part of finding a meaningful job is working for a company with a clear vision. If your employer's goals and mission statement are unclear to you, you may feel interested in finding a company that has clearer values. This way, you can better understand how your contributions are helping the company meet its larger goals.
13. Needing a better work-life balance
Having time for your friends, family and hobbies is an important part of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You may find that outside of working hours your manager is always contacting you or that you are constantly working overtime. At some point, this can begin to impact your personal time and make you feel burnt out. Looking for a new job that values employee's personal time can help you achieve this balance once again.
14. Seeking a more financially secure company
Things like budget cuts and limited resources can be challenging to work with. As your company experiences financial hardships, you may feel less secure in your role. Finding a job that offers fair wages, room to grow, learning opportunities and regular pay increases can help you feel more confident that your company is doing well financially.
15. Wanting more independence
Some managers use micromanaging as a way to keep track of everything you do. This can make you feel like you need more independence and autonomy in your role. A quality employer is one who trusts their employees and gives them a chance to figure out things on their own.
16. Looking for more recognition
Positive feedback and praise are how managers can make their employees feel more appreciated. Working for a company that rarely gives you recognition can make it challenging to feel motivated each day. Quitting your job and finding one where they give credit to hard-working employees can make you feel more valued.

Alright, I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they say.

First, from the G2 article, there are 60 statistics on why employees quit. It seems like a comprehensive list covering various aspects like career advancement, work environment, and personal reasons. It mentions that lack of growth opportunities and lack of recognition are the main reasons people quit. Also, it highlights the importance of company culture, career development, and remote work options in retaining employees.

The second article from SheerVelocity talks about a trend where more people are quitting their jobs, even during higher unemployment rates. It attributes this to people reevaluating their priorities due to the pandemic, especially regarding work-life balance and personal fulfillment. The article also mentions that younger generations are more likely to consider quitting, seeking better opportunities and higher wages.

The Medium article by Marvin Russell lists 20 stats on why employees quit, emphasizing the importance of company culture, work-life balance, and employee engagement. It also stresses that money isn't the primary motivator for quitting; instead, it's about feeling valued and having meaningful work.

The HBR article delves into the timing of when people decide to quit, focusing on moments when they compare their current situation with their expectations or peers, such as work anniversaries or birthdays. It also mentions that companies are using technology to predict employee turnover by monitoring their online activities and behaviors.

Lastly, the Indeed article provides 16 common reasons employees leave their jobs, ranging from needing more challenges and higher salaries to seeking better management relationships and a clearer company vision.

From all these sources, some common themes emerge:

1. **Lack of Growth Opportunities:** Many employees leave because they don't see prospects for advancement or professional development in their current roles.

2. **Poor Management:** Difficult relationships with managers, lack of support, or ineffective leadership can drive employees to look for better opportunities.

3. **Work-Life Balance:** The desire for better work-life balance, including flexible working hours and remote work options, is a significant factor.

4. **Compensation and Benefits:** While not the primary reason, inadequate pay and benefits can contribute to employees seeking better offers elsewhere.

5. **Company Culture:** A toxic or unsupportive work environment can make employees unhappy and more likely to leave.

6. **Personal Reasons:** Life changes, such as moving to a new location or pursuing further education, can also lead to job changes.

It's interesting to see that while money is a factor, it's not the main driver for employees to quit. Instead, factors like career growth, management quality, and work environment play更为重要的角色。这表明企业在吸引和留住人才时，需要关注员工的全面福祉和发展机会，而不仅仅是薪酬待遇。

此外，随着远程工作的普及和工作方式的转变，员工对于工作灵活性的需求也在增加。公司如果能够提供灵活的工作安排，可能会更有竞争力，有助于降低员工流失率。

总之，员工离职的原因是多方面的，企业需要综合考虑各种因素，采取相应的措施来提高员工满意度和忠诚度。
