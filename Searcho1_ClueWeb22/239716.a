So I have this question about how perception influences communication interactions in positive and negative ways. Hmm, perception is basically how we interpret the world around us, right? And communication is how we exchange information with others. So, perception must play a big role in how we understand and interact with people.

I need to think about this step by step. First, what is perception? It's like our personal lens through which we see the world. It's influenced by our experiences, beliefs, values, and expectations. So, when we communicate with someone, our perception shapes how we interpret their words, tone, body language, and even their intentions.

Now, how does this influence communication positively? Well, if I perceive someone as friendly and approachable, I'm more likely to open up to them and have a comfortable conversation. My positive perception can lead to better engagement and stronger relationships. Also, if I perceive that someone understands me, it can boost my confidence and make me more willing to share my thoughts and feelings.

On the other hand, negative perceptions can really hinder communication. If I perceive someone as hostile or untrustworthy, I might become defensive or withdraw from the conversation. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. For example, if I think someone is judging me, I might become sensitive to their every word and misinterpret their neutral comments as criticisms.

Let me try to think of some specific examples. Suppose I'm in a meeting at work, and my colleague presents an idea. If I perceive them as competent and knowledgeable, I'm more likely to listen attentively and consider their proposal seriously. But if I perceive them as inexperienced or incompetent, I might dismiss their idea without giving it proper thought.

Another example: if I'm talking to a friend, and I perceive that they're busy or distracted, I might feel like they don't value our conversation and become upset. This could lead to unnecessary tension in the relationship.

It seems like perception can create self-fulfilling prophecies in communication. If I perceive someone positively, they might pick up on my friendly demeanor and respond in kind, reinforcing the positive interaction. Conversely, if I perceive someone negatively, they might sense my hostility and react negatively as well, escalating the situation.

I should also consider how perception affects non-verbal communication. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are all crucial in conveying meaning. If I perceive someone's tone as sarcastic, even if they didn't intend it that way, I might take offense. This misinterpretation can lead to negative interactions.

Moreover, perception influences how we filter information. We tend to pay more attention to things that confirm our existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. This is called confirmation bias. In communication, this can cause us to miss important points that don't align with our perceptions, leading to incomplete understanding.

So, in positive terms, if my perception aligns well with reality, and I'm open to different perspectives, communication can be efficient and effective. I can build trust and rapport with others, leading to better collaborations and deeper connections.

In negative terms, if my perception is skewed or biased, it can lead to miscommunications, conflicts, and damaged relationships. It's essential to be aware of our own perceptions and how they might be affecting our interactions.

Maybe I should look into some theories or models that explain this relationship between perception and communication. Maybe there's something like the Perception Cycle or the Communication Process Model that incorporates perception.

Let me try to search for some theoretical background on this.

6.0 Conclusion
f1.0 Introduction

       Communication is the way people can interact, connect, and how people develop an

understanding for how the world works. Communication theory takes this perception of the

world and looks at it from all angles of the interaction. Foss and Littlejohn (2011) provided a

more technical definition of communication theory as “a unified or coherent body of

propositions that provide a philosophically consistent picture of a subject” (pg. 19). There are

three main constructs of communication theory. They are abstractions, constructions, and how

they are immediately tied to action.

   (1.1) Constructs

       Communication theories are abstractions, in the sense that there is never one exact truth

to a theory. According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011), no single theory will reveal the whole

“truth” or be able to address the subject of investigation totally (pg. 19). However, the

development of a theory will showcase the theorists’ perceptual truth of the world. Theories are

constructions by nature, because they allow us a way to look at the world. According to Foss and

Littlejohn (2011), Stanly Deetz said that “a theory is a way of seeing and thinking about the

world. As such it is better seen as the “lens” one uses in the observations rather than as a

“mirror” of nature (pg. 20). Finally, communication theory uses an immediate call to action.

According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011), how we think, our theories, guide how we act; and how

we act, our practices, guide how we think (pg. 20).

   (1.2) Four Concentrations

       In essence, theories contain a set of instructions for reading the world we live in and act

upon. To develop the communication theory further, specifically the Perceptual Complexity
fCommunication Theory, I will target four main concentrations; Philosophical assumptions,

concepts, explanations, and the principles that all help build the communication theory.

2.0 Philosophical Assumptions

       The philosophical assumptions are the basic beliefs that underline the theory. These are

based on philosophy and help build a broad view of the world being discussed.

   (2.1) Philosophy

       The Perceptual Complexity Theory is heavily based upon epistemology. According to

Foss and Littlejohn (2011), this is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge or how

people know what they know (pg. 21). In essence, what we come to know as human beings is

based on our experiences and perceptions. These are two main positions in Perceptual

complexity, empiricism and constructivism. According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011), empiricism

is what we literally see going on and our knowledge stems from that perception. Constructivism

is that people create knowledge in order to function in the world and what a person has made of

the world (pg. 22). An example of both can be shown through a picture taken. Empiricism would

say what they see in the photo, while constructivism would look at the entire entity and say it is a

photo or a picture. How we shape our viewing of reality will affect the meaning behind the

position.

   (2.2) Phenomenological

       Most of the Perceptual Complexity Theory stems from phenomenological perspective.

This means “the way you come to understand the world through direct experiences – the

perception of a phenomenon, whether an object, event, or condition” (2011, pg. 47). This

tradition focuses on the internal, conscious experiences of a person. It looks at the ways in which

a person understands and gives meaning to their life. This makes each individual’s life
fspecifically unique to them. Tom Peter (1987) related uniqueness to management by saying

“your goals should remain the achievement of uniqueness, uniqueness more often comes not

from breakthrough ideas, but from the accumulation of thousands of tiny enhancements” (pg.

286). As humans, our thousands of experiences, no matter how tiny, shape our reality of how the

world works.

3.0 Concepts

       The concepts are the literal terms and definitions that we use to shape, understand, and

interpret the communication behind the Perceptual Complexity Theory. According to Foss and

Littlejohn (2011), to determine concepts, theorists observe many variables in human interaction

and classify and label them according to perceived patterns (pg. 24). The two main concepts of

this theory are Communication and Perception.

   (3.1) Preview

       To the blind eye, communication would seem like a relevantly easy concept to define.

Most would imply and define human communication as talking to another person. However,

communication is the process by which we acknowledge and express our experiences of the

world. Human communication is a circular, irreversible, constant interaction of information,

values, and ideas, verbally or nonverbally, between two or more people.

       [3.1.1] The Process

       Communication is an interactional process. According to Nitcavic (2013),

“Communication is not something that one person does to another. Communication is a

continuous, ever-changing, circular, process of interaction” (p. 7). The goal of this interactional

process is to try to deliver a message through a channel in a certain context in the environment.

According to Nitcavic (2013), the channel refers to the means by which the message gets from
fthe sender to the receiver. The context, or environment, is the place or situation in which the

communication occurs and includes the physical context, social context, the number of people

involved, relationship of participants, surrounding events, rituals, and the noise (pg. 10). There

are two main was to communicate a message; Verbal elements (language as the content) and

nonverbal elements (bodily delivery). This means what the speakers says and how they say it

effects how the message is interpreted by the receiver.

        [3.1.2] Verbal Communication

        Verbal communication is any message sent through language. The channel or medium of

the message does not matter. Verbal communication can be a face to face interaction, over the

phone, through email, or sent through a text message, just as long as language is involved.

Verbal communication is more of a straight forward form of communication, because the

language you use helps the receiver decode the message. The language the participants choose to

use will directly shape the interpretation of the interaction. Additionally, the effectiveness of the

communication process can be weak if the two communicators do not have the same perception

of reality.

        Language can be arbitrary. For example if the communication participants are watching a

football game and discussing the players positions, but the receiver does not know the names of

the individual positions on the field, it could cause many frustrations. It would be confusing for

the receiver if the sender of the information used the denotation of the positions. Instead of

saying the Quarterback, the sender of the information may choose to say “the guy that throws the

ball or hands the ball off to other players.” This provides more description and helps both parties

develop a mutual understanding. Essentially, our prior knowledge based on our experiences and

perceptions shape the language we use, which directly transforms communication.
f       [3.1.3] Nonverbal Communication

       The second way a message can be sent is nonverbally. Nonverbal communication is a

process that must be done in person. Nonverbal communication is based on the body posture,

gestures, face, smells, and anything that does not use language in human communication. It is

constant, because our bodies are always in action, other people can look as us to gain information

about us. If a sender is trying to deliver a persuasive message in business, but has droopy eyes,

wearing raggedy clothes, and smells bad, the receiver will not decode that “persuasive” message

as persuasive, due to the poor nonverbal communication. Additionally, nonverbal

communication is irreversible. Using the same example, once we choose to wear that raggedy

shirt and people form a perception of our life choses, they cannot not form a new first impression

or try to accept the communication as persuasive, because they have already dismissed it.

       Finally, nonverbal communication may to help assist verbal communication. For

example, if you are again trying to describe the Quarterback on the field, you may point directly

to the player in that position. When you say, “the guy that throws the ball or hands the ball off to

other player,” while gesturing a throwing motion, this will help emphasize the communication. It

will provide a further visualization for the language sender chose to use.

       [3.1.4] Complexities

       This interaction communication process is complex due to prior perceptions of sender

and receiver, but also the noise and environment in which the process takes place. According to

Nitcavic (2013), “Noise is anything that interferes with the process. Noise, may be external or

internal to the receiver” (pg. 10). Every environment has different psychological noise that

determines the outcome of the interaction. Noise can be external, such as temperature in the

room, the lighting, décor, other individuals, etc. It can be internal (what is going on within your
fown body), such as the perception or goal the sender and receiver brought prior to the

interaction. For example, if one of the individuals is feeling ill or is having troubles with their

personal life.

        All of these factors hinder the effectiveness of the message traveling across the channel.

According to Affi, Anderson, and Guerro (2011), Activity or inactivity, words or silence, all

have message value; they influence others and these others, in turn, cannot not respond to these

communications and thus are themselves communication (pg. 13). The receiver must shift

through all of the clutter of noise to receive the message, attaching meaning and understanding to

the message, and then communicate back to the original sender.

    (3.2) Perception

        According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011), the capacity to think and perceive is thereby the

main way we come to know about anything (pg. 21. All that you conceptual know and feel is

what the perception is; your experiences. Our experiences also help us shape the relationships we

have with others. Harold Walls, a peer, made a great statement in class saying, “people closets to

you deserve the most politeness, maybe not always your emotions” (H. Walls, personal

communication, Sept 10, 2013). How we adapt our perceptual understanding on others provides

us with the ability to shape our reality. Tom Peters (1987), adds “the reasonable man adopts

himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself” (pg.

297). Tom Peters is essentially implying that we should not try to change the world; rather we

should morph the world to our own ideologies.

    (3.3) Review

        To the blind eye, communication is a simple concept. However, to a knowledgeable and

educated individual, it is a very complex and difficult to fully interpret. According to Foss and
fLittlejohn (2011), the capacity to think and perceive is thereby the main way we come to know

about anything (pg. 21). All that you conceptual know and feel is what the perception is; your

experiences. Our experiences also help us shape the relationships we have with others.

           Harold Walls, a peer, made a great statement in class saying, “people closets to you

deserve the most politeness, maybe not always your emotions” (H. Walls, personal

communication, Sept 10, 2013). How we adapt our perceptual understanding on others provides

us with the ability to shape our reality. Tom Peters (1987), adds “the reasonable man adopts

himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself” (pg.

297). Tom Peters is essentially implying that we should not try to change the world; rather we

should morph the world to our own ideologies. The only true thing we can infer about

communication is that the process is interactional, continuous, ever-changing, irreversible, and

based perception of the two or more people involved in the communication undertaking.

4.0 Explanations

           Explanations are the connections made by the theoretical ideology and helps identify

regularities or patterns in human relationships among many variables.

    (4.1) Attribution

           The Attribution Theory correlates with the Perceptual Complexity Theory by saying

“people make judgments about themselves and other people based on available cues and

emotional factors” (Littlejohn, pg. 85). People tend to not want to take responsibility for how

they think of people, because they believe it is out of their control due to it being their personal

reality.
f   (4.2) Elaboration

       The Elaboration Likelihood Theory adds that the degree to which messages match our

previous attitudes will have an effect on use as well (Littlejohn, pg. 85). Messages that are

already within an individual’s frame of perception and reality will be processed more favorable.

Once a person interprets that they agree with another’s perceptions, they will gravitate to like

that person who delivered the message.

   (4.3) Relationships

       Even though we shift toward others, we must maintain a balance between what we think

and what we think others may think about the same topic. According to Foss and Littlejohn

(2013), this is called the narrow ridge. “You are a person worthy of your own experiences,

opinions, ideas, and feelings, but at the same time you must also acknowledge the full life

experiences of others and allow them to express what is important to them” (pg. 254). Tom

Peters agrees with the narrow ridge concept by relating it to leadership, “the most effective

leaders empower others to act and grow in support of a course that both leaders and followers

find worthy” (pg. 525). Evaluating a communicator’s message and intent is important to form

understanding, but acknowledging that everyone is different is critical to establishing mutual

respect among all peers. All individual are unique and thinking your own view of reality is

what’s true is not self-centered as long as you understand that there is no one truth for the entire

world; only your unique world.

5.0 Principles

       The last section deals with principles, which are the main points of Perceptual

Complexity and provide the guideline for action. According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011),
fprinciples enable you to interpret an event, make judgments about what is happening, and then

decide how to act on the situation (pg. 26).

   (5.1) Interaction

       The main way people form meaning about something is by the conversations they have,

externally or internally, during a human communication episode. According to Foss and

Littlejohn (2011), Peoples actions are based on their interpretations, in which the relevant object

and actions in the situation are taken into account and defined (pg. 190). Taking the situation into

account before the conversation can be very beneficial to the success level of your

communication interaction. Greg Needham made a statement about how the marines take action

on its opponent. He said “in the marines we learned that the best defense is an effective offense.

The main advantage to the attacker over the defender is the attacker knows when the attack is

going to take place” (G. Needham, personal communication, Sept. 17 2013). This theory does

not suggest to literally go attack someone, but being mindful of your communication counterpart

will provide you the ability to communication more effective in any situation.

   (5.2) Dissonance

       Dissonance in the Perceptual Complexity Theory predicts behavior based on the task.

According to Foss and Littlejohn (2011), the greater the amount of effort one puts into a task, the

more one will rationalize the value of that task (pg. 97). This means that when we do something,

we need to put our whole effort into it, because regardless we will find some sort of value in the

completion of it. If there is no effort to improve your personal communication, then only

mediocre patterns will be produced, but they will be perceived valuable to its producer. Tom

Peters also talks about immersing yourself in something to become inspired, such as learning

soccer. “My idea is to get out on the damn field and start kicking that ball. I had an inspiration
fand I didn’t know that much about soccer. I didn’t know there were even two sizes of soccer

balls. So the next time you find an inspiration, get out and start doing something about it (pg.

269). Inspiration in communication can stem from anywhere and we must embrace this to ensure

our integrity as a communicator.

6.0 Conclusion

       Perceptual Complexity is formed on the basis of communication and perception. When

we develop an understanding for our own reality, we can better relate to others world. Foss and

Littlejohn (2011) add that your ideas about what is happening and what you might do about it are

always based on your generalizations about how things work (pg. 423). The world we live in

never stands still, it either gets worse or better. Once we seek to acknowledge the vastness of

reality, we can then begin to form a more valid perception of just what reality is.

Abstract
This article takes a convergent evidence approach to visual communication; how the brain functions in perception, how this relates tofeeling and logical reasoning, and how we respond to our visual world, These are the keyprobative areas implicit in every act of seeing.As new medical imagingtechniques make the brain’s inner workings moreaccessible, we take thefirst rudimentarysteps toward developing a unified theory of how the mind works, and therefore toward understanding how we receive, process, and act on visual information, A neurological approach to perception yields insights into those mechanisms that empower the visual image.

... Brain areas dedicated to reading are most likely subject to such exaptation (Gazzaniga 1998), and the same probably holds true for brain areas dedicated to calculation. Thus, specialized cognitive networks that were already present and functional might have been diverted from their original uses to perform new functions, often by connecting to brain areas with other functions (Barry 2002). This could explain why reading and performing arithmetic operations are cognitively dealt with in a ''slower'' manner than the processing of images.  ...
... This is probably due to the fact that visual perception is the most sophisticated of our senses shaped by evolution, and visual sensory experience is by far the most dominant learning mode. Patterns in the environment are readily and most reliably processed (Barry 2002) and create the templates that we use to map and anticipate reality. The human brain integrates sensory cues of an image into a perceptual whole by synthesizing complex visual information and purposefully disregarding sequential arrangements.  ...

Description
Perception and Communication covers the significant advances in understanding the association between perception and communication.  This book is composed of 12 chapters and starts with an overview of the value of auditory studies and the basic principles of perception and behavior theory. The next chapters deal with the theoretical interpretation of the experiments concerning selective listening to speech and some of the distinctive features of human verbal behavior. These topics are followed by discussions of the role of communication channels in listening; the effects of noise on behavior; the general nature of vigilance; some data on individual differences related to extraversion and decrement in non-vigilance tasks; and the nature of extinction. The closing chapters consider the problems of multi-channeling listening and the selective nature of learning. These chapters also provide a summary of principles of perception and communication.  This book will prove useful to applied psychologists, behaviorists, and researchers.

The Sensual and Perceptual Theories of Visual Communications
The Sensual and Perceptual Theories of
          Visual Communications
Review the previous lesson QUIZ
What is the difference between visual sensation and visual perception?
How are gestalt, constructivism (The sensual theories), different from semiotics
    and cognitive theories?
How do perceptual theories offer higher understanding of visual messages than
  the sensual theories?
1. Sensual Theories: Concern for sensual theories is what the eyes sees; not so much what mind makes of it; sensual theories- Gestalt and Constructivism -
        belief is that direct or mediated images are composed of light objects
        that attract or repel us.
2. Perceptual Theories: Concern is for the meaning we associate with things- what our mind interprets; perceptual theories- Semiotics and Cognitive are
        about the meaning we associate with the images we see. These theories are content driven and see the human mind as complex
Visual Sensation versus Visual perception
Visual Sensation
A stimulus activates nerve cells in a person's sense
            organs (eyes, ears, nose, mouth, touch). Sensations are physical
            responses to stimuli and convey no meaning. sensations are raw data
            that the brain makes meaning from - a stimulus activates our senses; a lower order response
Visual Perception
Visual perception is how the brain processes the information (raw
            data) from the senses. It is the meaning derived from after sensual
            stimuli are received; what we understand form the sensation we experience

Part 1. The Sensual Theories of Visual Communication
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Gestalt --"The
        whole is different from the sum of its parts."
Gestalt was originated by Max Wertheimer, German psychologist-
Gestalt in German
          means "form" or "shape"
Wertheimer says that the eye takes in all visual stimuli and
          the brain arranges the sensations into a coherent image
Gestalt theory says perception is the result of a combination of sensations
          and not individual sensual elements
Discrete elements are combined and understood by four fundamental
          principles of grouping: similarity, proximity, continuation and common
          fate
The focal point of Gestalt theory is the idea of "grouping,"
Grouping is about the method we use to interpret a visual field or situation.
View this for more detail and examples of the Sensual Theory - Gestalt
1 of 91
Gestalt Theory from roger Pitiot
The main factors that determine grouping are:
Proximity
The law of proximity states that objects near
                each other tend to be seen as a unit.
According to this law, you will see arrangement to the
                  right not as a set of rows but rather a set of columns.
                  We tend to perceive items that are near each other as groups.
We see you the arrangement of dots to the right not as a set of rows  but rather a set of columns. We tend to perceive items that are near  each other as groups.
Similarity
items that are similar in some way tend to be grouped together. Visual interest is increased by dissimilarity.
Closure
items are grouped together if they tend to complete a pattern.
Figure/ground
The figure is the object you are perceiving, ground is what
                is in the background. You can only perceive one at a time.
                The brain labels things as near or far, negative or positive
                space. The FedEx logo also is an example look between the second
                E and the x.
Simplicity
items are organized into figures according to symmetry, regularity,
                and smoothness.
Generally on first view we see things in simple terms rather than complex terms
In the image above we see the most obvious- glasses lined up in a row.
we see 2 rather than 3 triangles
Common fate
The law of common fate states that when objects move in
                the same direction, we tend to see them as a unit.
In the image to the right when dots 1, 3, and 5 move up
                  and dots 2, 4, and 6, move down at the same time, the dots
                  moving in the same direction are perceived as a group.
Continuation
The law of good continuation states that objects arranged
                in either a straight line or a smooth curve tend to be seen
                as a unit.
To the right we distinguish two lines, one from a to b
                  and another from c to d, even though this graphic could
                  represent another set of lines, one from a to d and the
                  other from c to b. Nevertheless, we are more likely to
                  identify line a to b, which has better continuation than
                  the line from a to d, which has an obvious turn
Gestalt and Visual Communication
Analysis of an image should start by concentrating on the forms
          that appear. What is the overall impression- the Gestalt?
See a video explaining more about these concepts here http://www.lynda.com/Dreamweaver-tutorials/Gestalt-principles/82822/97990-4.html
Check out these interesting/humorous and strange examples of the gestalt Photos you really need to Look at to Understand from Buzzfeed http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/photos-you-really-need-to-look-at-to-understand
To see more examples of Gestalt and graphic design see http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm
Through the principles of Gestalt we can learn to put together the basic elements into a meaningful
          whole. And to deconstruct an image, we do the same in reverse
Gestalt theory shows our brain as a powerful organ. Our brain is influenced
          or modified by what we have seen in the past and by what we want to see. We bring our preconceived ideas with us.
Gestalt theory has been criticized for describing perceptions and
          not giving explanations about how perceptions give meaning to images. This criticism of the viewed as passive lead researchers to
          the theory of Constructivism
Test your knowledge of Gestalt
Constructivism
Julian Hochberg, a psychology professor at Columbia University used eye tracking machines and saw that an observer's eyes were in constant
          motion while they views an image. The idea is that a viewer constructs the scene with
          quick focal fixations that combine to build a picture. (this is an
          active approach, compared to the passive Gestalt)
Two South Florida researchers found that content, size and placement
          of photos on a newspaper page are more important than whether the image
          is in colour
Impossible objects are examples of how constructivists analyze visual
          works
Constructivism helps to explain why our eye's move while looking at images; however, it's only
          a minor clarification of Gestalt

Part 2. Perceptual Theories of Visual Communications
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Semiotics and Cognitive approaches to visual communications may be
          considered Content-driven or perceptual theories see humans as complex as have the ability to create complex meanings for the things we see
A sign simply is anything that stands for anything else. For example, a check mark on an assignment means correct.
As humans we have a natural desire to make meanings of things we see. One of the ways we make things meaningful is 
          through the creation of and the interpretation of 'signs'.
Each of us is born into a culture that has signs and symbols. As we grow we learn the signs of the culture as well as create our own interpretations. We build our own personal visual libraries.
The more knowledge and experience we have, the more we are able to interpret signs.
in 397 CE Augustine, a Roman philosopher proposed the study of signs;
          Before WWI Ferdinand de Saussure and Charles Peirce developed ideas
          about signs

Semiotics: The Study of Signs - Transcript:
"Semiotics, The Study of Signs. This science was proposed in the early 1900s by Swiss linguist, Ferdinand de Saussure and the American pragmatist Charles Sanders Pierce. Saussure argued that there was no inherent or necessary relationship between that which carries the meaning, the Signifier -usually the word or symbol and the actual meaning which is carried the Signified . For example, the word "Car" is not actually car. The meaning of car can be carried by any random string of letters. It just so happens that in English, that the meaning is carried by the letters C, A, R. Pierce's idea about semiotics distinguished between thre types of signs- Icon, I ndex, and Symbol. Whether a sign belongs in one category or another is dependent upon the nature of its relationship between the Sign itself which he called the Referent and the actual meaning.
An icon is sign that stands for an object by resembling it. Included in this category of signs are obvious examples like pictures, maps, and diagrams and some not so obvious ones like algebraic expressions and metaphors. The essential aspect of the relation of an icon to its object is one of Similarity.
Indexes refer to their objects not by virtue of any similarity relation but rather via an actual causal link between the sign and its object. Smoke is an index of fire. A mark on a fever thermometer is an index of body temperature and so forth. The relation between the sign and its object is actual in that the sign and object have something in common, that is the object really affects the sign.
Finally symbols will refer to their objects by virtue of Law, Rule, or Convention, Words, Propositions and Texts are obvious examples in that no similarity or causal link is suggested in the relation between for example, the word "horse" and the object it refers. As symbols need bear no similarity or causal  link to their object, the signs can be considered by the sign user in unlimited ways independent of any physical relationship to the sign user. This point is of crucial importance and in fact lays the foundation for semiotic view of cognition in humans.
The fact that humans can utilize signs which are arbitrary and need have no existence in their immediate experience is what makes thought possible and distinctly human. Ideas can be brought to mind and manipulated without being directly experienced. Meanings can be expressed in various ways through a variety of science systems -language, music, gestures and so forth. In essence, humans can create via signs a world entirely separate from one of direct experience. We find it hard to imagine a world without traffic regulations, social conventions, basketball games and so forth. These are as real to us as trees and rocks. Yet they as well as our understanding of trees and rocks have come about via interactions of humans individually and collectively through the science structures we call culture."
Three Types of Signs: Iconic, indexical and symbolic
The three types are not mutually exclusive; one picture may
          have all three types represented at the same time
Iconic Signs - Icons
Iconic or icons are the easiest to understand because they
                  look like the thing they represent; examples- desktop icons- a garbage sign for the trash, prehistoric cave
                  painting, the symbol on restroom door
it is easy to see the connection
These icons resemble the thing they represent
Indexical Signs
indexical signs have some logical or common sense connection to
                  what they represent
interpretation may take a little longer than an iconic sign.
We learn these through life experiences
Examples- sundial, footprint on the beach (represents the
                  person), smoke from car exhaust (represents pollution)
These signs have a connection to what they represent but take a little longer and are Learned
Symbolic Signs
Symbolic signs are the most abstract because they are not intuitive. We need to learn these signs.
These symbols have no logical or representational connection between
                  them and what they represent
They are learned through social and cultural influence; for example passed down from generations or learned through media- advertising
Examples-words, numbers, colours, gestures, flags, costumes, company
                  logos, music and religious images are symbols
They can be passed from generation to generation and they can have strong
                  emotions compared to indexical or iconic
We can have our own personal associations with these
The Peace sign- Doves are often associated with peace. See what happened when the Pope releases two doves in January 2014 http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/01/26/peace-doves-released-from-popes-window-viciously-attacked-by-seagull-and-large-black-crow/
These signs don't have a logical connection to what they represent. We learn these through culture.
Images are A Collection of Signs
A  picture is made up  of many different associations; language is linear
          (discursive)- one word follows another; a picture is presentational
signs in a picture are presented in many ways
Roland Barthes called the chain of associations "codes"
Asa Berger suggests 4 types of codes: metonymic, analogical, displaced
          and condensed
Metonymic code
A group of signs that causes the viewer to
              make association or assumptions. We make assumptions about what we see because of the group of things. An advertisement showing all the parts that make a happy family. See the 1950's happy family in the Coca Cola ad here. Coca Cola wants us to believe that if we drink Coca Cola our family will be this picture perfect vision.
Analogical code
A group of signs that cause the viewer to make mental comparisons.
Yellow writing paper might remind the writer of the yellow peel
                of a lemon because of the similar colour.

Displaced code
Codes that transfer meaning from one set of signs to another.
            The CN Tower as a phallic symbol, for example. Liquor, lipstick,
            and cigarette ads frequently use phallic symbols to link their products
            to sex. See Winston's famous campaign. It's what's up front that counts!
Condensed code
Several signs that are combined to form a new sign. particularly images used outside the culture. Editing techniques, mixing together many different types
            of colors, graphics and imagery. Within the culture the message is
            intended for, the condensed code has relevant meaning, But for those
            outside the culture, the images are often confusing, without purpose.            The "inside' group may get the meaning; whereas the "outside" group may not

Cognitive Approach
According to the cognitive approach a person does not just see a light
          structured object, as in gestalt. In the cognitive approach a person uses complex mental operations to derive the meaning of things seen
Carolyn Bloomer identified several mental activities that affect
          visual perception: memory, projection, expectation, selectivity, habituation,
          salience, dissonance, culture and words
Memory
people use pictures as memory aids or mnemonics to
            recall events or verbal passages
Projection
We see pictures in the clouds, or listen to readings of our future
            from tarot cards, or Rorschach test to reveal what our personality
            is. Here a person's mental state is projected on inanimate objects
Expectation
Walk into a classroom and you expect to see desks, blackboard,
            teacher. Having strong preconceived expectations often leads to mistakes in our perceptions
Selectivity
We have a choice what we attend to. Much of what we see is not part of conscious processing. We do
              not think of our own breathing; most visual perception is unconscious.
            We focus on significant details
What the commercial below. The description on the ad is as follows: "Just how attention stealing is the new ŠKODA Fabia? We put it to the  test. Will a crowd gather? Will other drivers slam on the breaks? Watch  to find out. "
Marketers in New Mexico believe that male teens will notice a message when they use the urinal. See The Urinal Speaks (inside link)
Habituation
Habituation occurs when we stop paying attention to something. We may have seen it so much that we no longer notice it. The mind ignores visual stimuli that are part of everyday habitual
            activity. When we walk the same way everyday we may miss the details.
            Too many stimuli in the culture can result in culture shock- making
            a person irritable and tired
Salience
A stimulus with meaning to an individual will be noticed more. Something that is relevant to us will stand out. An expert chess player see more than a novice in a chess game. A scientist sees more under the microscope than we do.
Dissonance
Concentration is limited to one thing at a time. Loud music will
            distract from your studying. Too much information on a TV screen
            can be distracting- CNN Headline News- CP24- so much competing information.
            If something else is on your mind, it competes for attention
Culture
We are affected by the cultural artefacts, rituals and behaviours around us. We are influenced by the norms of the culture. The way people act, dress, eat behave, practice religion impacts
            visual perception. It includes ethnicity, economic status, work,
            gender, age, sexual orientation, geographic location
Words
Thoughts are framed by words. When words are combined with images
            a more impactful message can result
Semiotics and cognitive approaches see the human mind as complex. Meaningful
        connections between what people see and how they use images arise when
        mental process is viewed as a human process, not a mechanical one.

Alright, I've got this question about how perception influences communication interactions in positive and negative ways. I need to think carefully about this because perception is such a fundamental part of how we interact with others.

First off, what is perception? It's basically how we interpret the world around us, including other people's behaviors and communications. Our perceptions are shaped by our experiences, beliefs, values, and expectations. So, when we communicate with someone, our perception of them affects how we understand their messages, both verbal and non-verbal.

Let me consider the positive aspects first. When our perceptions are positive, it can really enhance communication. For example, if I perceive someone as trustworthy and friendly, I'm more likely to open up to them and have a honest conversation. This positive perception can lead to better understanding and stronger relationships. Also, if I perceive that someone is interested in what I have to say, it boosts my confidence and makes me more willing to share my thoughts and feelings.

On the negative side, perceptions can really hinder communication. If I perceive someone as hostile or untrustworthy, I might become defensive or withdraw from the conversation. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts. For instance, if I think someone is judging me, I might become overly sensitive to their comments and misinterpret their neutral remarks as criticisms.

I should probably think of some specific examples to illustrate this. Let's say I'm in a meeting at work, and my colleague presents an idea. If I perceive them as competent and knowledgeable, I'm more likely to listen attentively and consider their proposal seriously. But if I perceive them as inexperienced or incompetent, I might dismiss their idea without giving it proper thought. This could stifle innovation and hurt team dynamics.

Another example: if I'm talking to a friend, and I perceive that they're busy or distracted, I might feel like they don't value our conversation and become upset. This could lead to unnecessary tension in the relationship.

It seems like perception can create self-fulfilling prophecies in communication. If I perceive someone positively, they might pick up on my friendly demeanor and respond in kind, reinforcing the positive interaction. Conversely, if I perceive someone negatively, they might sense my hostility and react negatively as well, escalating the situation.

I should also consider how perception affects non-verbal communication. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice are all crucial in conveying meaning. If I perceive someone's tone as sarcastic, even if they didn't intend it that way, I might take offense. This misinterpretation can lead to negative interactions.

Moreover, perception influences how we filter information. We tend to pay more attention to things that confirm our existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence. This is called confirmation bias. In communication, this can cause us to miss important points that don't align with our perceptions, leading to incomplete understanding.

So, in positive terms, if my perception aligns well with reality, and I'm open to different perspectives, communication can be efficient and effective. I can build trust and rapport with others, leading to better collaborations and deeper connections.

In negative terms, if my perception is skewed or biased, it can lead to miscommunications, conflicts, and damaged relationships. It's essential to be aware of our own perceptions and how they might be affecting our interactions.

Maybe I should look into some theories or models that explain this relationship between perception and communication. There might be something like the Perception Cycle or the Communication Process Model that incorporates perception.

Let me try to search for some theoretical background on this.
