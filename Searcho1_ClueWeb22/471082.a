Alright, I need to figure out why gas prices are so high. I don't know much about this topic, so I'll probably need to do some research. Let me start by understanding what factors might influence gas prices.

First off, gas is short for gasoline, which is made from crude oil. So, the price of crude oil must play a big role in determining gas prices. Maybe there are global events affecting the supply of crude oil. For example, if there's a shortage of crude oil, that could drive up the price.

Also, there's the concept of demand. If more people want gas, and supply stays the same, prices go up. Maybe there's been an increase in demand recently.

I should also consider taxes because governments tax gasoline. If taxes have gone up, that would increase the price at the pump.

Plus, there are refining costs and distribution costs. If it costs more to refine crude oil into gasoline or to transport it to gas stations, that would also affect the final price.

Hmm, maybe I should look into each of these factors one by one.

First, let's check the current price of crude oil. I think I can find that online. Also, seeing how it's changed recently might be helpful.

What Is The Brent Crude Oil Spot Price?
A simple way to understand oil spot prices is by breaking down the meaning of a complex term like ‘Brent crude oil spot price’:
Brent — the type of oil blend, as opposed to another oil blend like West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
Crude oil — the physical asset being brought or sold, in this case, crude oil with minimal processing
Spot price — the present price indicator at which an asset can be purchased or sold on the market
So, when you see a price tag named ‘Brent crude oil spot price’, it refers to the current market price of Brent blend crude oil. The spot price indicates the cost at which Brent crude oil can be brought or sold.
Oil prices are typically quoted per barrel — this is the same for the Brent crude oil spot price.
How Are Crude Oil Spot Prices Determined?
Crude oil is extracted from underground oil reserves. In Brent crude oil’s instance, these reserves are under the seafloor, while WTI crude oil is extracted from reserves located under dry land. That’s the first component of oil prices — the extraction process and machinery required.
Extracting crude oil from below the seafloor requires different machines than digging up oil on dry land. That cost will determine how much the extracting parties sell or refine the oil further before the commodity enters the market.
The location and quality of crude oil then impact the sophistication of refining required. In turn, the technology and resources needed to purify the blend are also factored in and influence a profitable market value for oil extractors and processors.
Aside from the physical groundwork of gathering and processing oil, market regulations are the true price-determinants of crude oil spot prices. Crude oil market regulations control supply and dynamics, thus price, based on factors like:
Politics: Oil availability and the necessary means to access that oil may result in political conflict between domestic and international jurisdictions.
Social & Environmental: Increasing awareness of human behavior’s influence on the environment, resulting in stricter benchmarks to justify the use of long-life-cycle fossil fuels like crude oil. OPEC is an example of an influential organization in the crude oil space.
Economical: Depending on the influence of powerful individuals behind oil supply chains, market regulations may be subject to seemingly unwarranted change, causing violent price swings.
Technological developments and changes in resource distributions along the oil supply chain will also impact crude oil spot prices. The increased focus on renewable energy is already accelerating such changes.
How To Set Up Google Alerts For Oil Price News

An Overview Of Oil Prices
In financial terms, oil is a “fungible” commodity, which means that specific grades of oil are identical for oil trading purposes, regardless of where they were produced.
For example, a contract for 1,000 barrels of WTI crude will be the same product whether the oil was extracted in Texas or North Dakota.
See today’s live Brent crude and WTI crude oil prices in our Oil Price Guide. You can also use complex technical analysis tools and oscillators to aid your trading.
Supply and Demand
As with all commodities, oil prices are driven by supply and demand. However, the global pool of oil and the ease with which oil moves around the world levels some of these price pressures.
The global oil monopoly somewhat limits the influence of any one particular oil producer to completely dominate the world market.
New Resources
From time to time new oil resources come online — like Canadian oil sands or US shale oil — these add to the global supply. New sources can exert a downward force on oil prices, even in times of heavy demand.
Extraction costs are typically higher for new resources, meaning these oils are only competitive in lower-supply, high-price environments.
Consumption Patterns
The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted increasing global demand for crude oil back in 2019, due to:
An increasing world population
Increased energy consumption in developing countries
Growth in transportation, petrochemical, and aviation industries.
Even though Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries are reducing their road transportation oil consumption on a per-vehicle basis, the growing automobile fleet in developing countries far outpaces such reductions.
Global Events
Many unforeseen events can also impact the price of crude oil, driving it up for down. For example:
After the Iranian revolution in the late 1970s, the price of oil rose sharply.
The 2020 outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic saw crude oil plummet to a negative price per barrel. The IEA expects crude oil consumption to be much lower in 2020.

Oil Price FAQs
What is the unit of oil price?
Oil prices are quoted per barrel (bbl). The abbreviation ‘bbl’ indicates one barrel of crude oil, but you may see Gbbl (one billion barrels), as well as Mbbl or Kbbl for one thousand barrels. For example, you can see that Brent crude oil spot prices are quoted by the barrel (bbl), as are West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices on global futures exchanges like NYMEX.
What is today’s Brent crude oil price?
Today’s live Brent crude oil spot price is at $106.86 per barrel. That’s down 6.56% from last week’s price of $114.36 per barrel. Brent crude oil trades six days a week, so based on which day you’re looking at crude oil spot prices, you may be getting the last recorded live price. At local time on Sundays for your chosen exchange, you’ll almost certainly get the last Brent crude oil spot price that the market closed with.
What is today’s WTI crude oil price?
Today’s live Brent crude oil spot price is at $102.42 per barrel. That’s down by 5.34% from the price of $108.20 per barrel one week ago.

Alright, from the search results, I can see that there are various sources providing current crude oil prices. It seems like Brent crude and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) are the two main types mentioned. Right now, Brent is around $109.40 per barrel, and WTI is around $104.29 per barrel. Comparing these to earlier prices, it seems like they've been fluctuating quite a bit recently.

I remember reading somewhere that crude oil prices have been rising because of the conflict in Ukraine. Russia is a major oil producer, and sanctions against them might be disrupting the supply. Maybe that's part of the reason gas prices are high.

But I need to look into this more deeply. Perhaps there are other factors at play here.

Let me think about the relationship between crude oil prices and gas prices. I believe that gas stations set their prices based on the cost of crude oil, plus refining costs, taxes, and their own profit margins. So, if crude oil prices go up, gas prices should follow suit, right?

But I've also heard that gas prices can be influenced by local competition and distribution costs. Maybe in some areas, gas is more expensive because it's harder to get there, so distribution costs are higher.

Also, different states have different tax rates on gasoline. For example, I think California has some of the highest gas taxes in the US, which is why their gas prices are usually higher than elsewhere.

Wait, but the user didn't specify a location. Maybe gas prices vary a lot depending on where you are in the world. Perhaps I should focus on US gas prices, assuming that's what the user is referring to.

Let me check what the average gas price is in the US right now.

CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) — The average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline dropped 2 cents over the past three weeks to $3.39 per gallon.
Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey said Sunday that prices at the pump could start increasing again because crude oil costs are rising.
Nationwide, the highest average price for regular-grade gas is in the San Francisco Bay Area, at $4.74 per gallon. The lowest average is in Houston, at $2.79 per gallon.
According to the survey, the average price of diesel is $3.64 a gallon, down a penny.

U.S. Energy Information Administration - EIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis
January 8, 2020
U.S. average retail gasoline prices in 2019 were slightly lower than in 2018
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update
U.S. regular retail gasoline prices averaged $2.60 per gallon (gal) in 2019, 11 cents/gal (4%) lower than in 2018.  Gasoline prices rose steadily during the first quarter of the year, rising from $2.24 on January 7 to $2.90/gal on May 6, before gradually declining through the rest of the year.  Because the cost of crude oil accounts for about 52% of retail gasoline’s final cost, the price of gasoline generally follows movements in crude oil prices, which followed a similar price path during 2019.
Each Monday, in its Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects and publishes data on retail gasoline and diesel fuel prices for 10 cities, 9 states, 5 regions, and the United States as a whole. Variations in gasoline prices across the country reflect differences in gasoline specifications, state and local taxes, and supply and demand balances in regional markets.
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update
East Coast (Boston, New York City, and Miami). East Coast gasoline moved within a range of $2.22/gal and $2.79/gal, during 2019, and prices in Boston and New York City peaked at the start of the summer driving season on May 6 at $2.84/gal and $2.93/gal, respectively. Prices in New York City averaged $2.62/gal during 2019, $2.59/gal in Boston, and $2.47/gal in Miami. Except for a brief two-month period between April and May, prices in Miami were consistently lower than in New York City and Boston.
Midwest (Chicago and Cleveland). The Midwest covers a large geographic area consisting of many semi-connected markets and widely dispersed refining centers. Prices in Chicago were higher than prices in Cleveland and higher than the Midwest regional average in 44 of 52 weeks during 2019. Gasoline prices throughout the Midwest averaged $2.49/gal during 2019, which is 12 cents lower than the national average. Average prices for the entire Midwest region moved within a range of $2.00/gal to $2.77/gal during the year.
Gulf Coast (Houston). Gulf Coast retail gasoline prices tend to be the lowest in the country, and the region has had the country’s lowest price every year for the past 20 years. The region is home to half of all U.S. refining capacity and produces substantially more gasoline than it consumes. For 45 weeks in 2019, retail gasoline prices in Houston were the lowest of the 10 cities for which EIA collected data. Average gasoline prices for the entire Gulf Coast region moved within a range of $1.89/gal to $2.58/gal during the year.
Rocky Mountains (Denver). The Rocky Mountain’s gasoline demand centers are geographically dispersed and are separated from sources of supply by mountain ranges and large expanses of wilderness and rural lands, which contribute to higher prices in the region. For 2019, the region’s average gasoline prices were the second highest in the country for 39 weeks, but they were also the second lowest for 9 weeks—a duality that reflects the region’s relatively low gasoline consumption and divergent local circumstances. Average gasoline prices for the entire Rocky Mountains region moved within a range of $2.17/gal to $2.98/gal during the year.
West Coast (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle). Gasoline prices on the West Coast tend to be higher than in other parts of the country because of the region’s limited interconnections with other major refining centers and because of gasoline specifications that make it more costly to manufacture. As a result, average gasoline prices in the West Coast have been the nation’s highest for the past 20 years.
West Coast gasoline prices in 2019 were especially elevated because of a combination of local refinery outages and attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities. These events led to average prices in California rising higher than the $4.00/gal mark for only the second time since 2014. Of the 10 cities for which EIA collects data, retail gasoline prices in San Francisco were the highest for all but three weeks in 2019. Average gasoline prices for the entire West Coast region moved within a range of $2.91/gal to $3.71/gal during the year.

U.S. gasoline prices have been rising with crude oil prices
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update
U.S. regular retail gasoline prices averaged $2.85 per gallon (gal) on Monday, March 29, according to EIA’s Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update. U.S. gasoline prices have generally increased since reaching a multiyear low of $1.77/gal in late April 2020, primarily because of higher crude oil prices and higher wholesale gasoline margins.  Prior to this week’s small decline, U.S. gasoline prices increased for 17 consecutive weeks in EIA’s survey, marking the longest consecutive streak of price increases since 1994.
Gasoline prices in the United States are primarily driven by four components: crude oil prices, refining costs, retail distribution and marketing costs, and taxes.  Because gasoline taxes and retail distribution costs generally remain stable, changes in gasoline prices are primarily the result of changes in crude oil prices and refining costs.
Crude oil prices have been steadily increasing since reaching multiyear lows in 2020.  Brent crude oil prices averaged $43 per barrel (b) in November 2020 and have since increased to an average of $67/b in March, based on data through March 22.  Because a barrel contains 42 gallons, the price of petroleum products changes by 2.4 cents per gallon when the price of crude oil changes by a dollar per barrel, all else remaining equal.
Refining margins have been steadily increasing since late 2020, as estimated by the difference between refiners’ acquisition cost of crude oil and wholesale gasoline prices.  Estimated U.S. average wholesale gasoline margins increased from an average of 18 cents per gallon (cents/gal) in November 2020 to 33 cents/gal in February 2021.
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update
Differences in regional petroleum markets and state and local taxes lead to varied gasoline prices across the United States. Each Monday, EIA surveys gasoline prices for 10 U.S. cities, 9 states, 4 subregions, and 5 regions (PADDs ), in addition to providing a national average. Regular retail gasoline prices in 4 of the 10 cities in EIA’s survey are already more than $3/gal. Seattle’s gasoline price surpassed $3/gal in late February 2021. Chicago’s did the same in mid-March. Both of the California cities in EIA’s survey—Los Angeles and San Francisco—have had gasoline prices above $3/gal throughout 2021.

Hmm, the search results are showing different dates and varying gas prices. It seems like gas prices have been around $3.30 to $3.40 per gallon recently, but I'm not sure if that's the current price. Maybe I should look for more up-to-date information.

Wait, one of the sources is from January 2022, which is a few months old. Another one is from December 2021. I need more recent data to understand the current situation.

Let me try searching again for the latest US gas prices.

Gas prices have jumped $1.22 in the last year. Drivers are still hitting the road.
By Kathryn Krupnik, Allison Elyse Gualtieri
October 26, 2021 / 7:36 AM / CBS News
Gas prices are going up, but that doesn't seem to be deterring drivers. Though gas now costs $1.22 per gallon more than it did a year ago, according to industry experts, the American public is still filling its tank.
"With the U.S. economy slowly recovering from the depths of the pandemic, demand for gas is robust, but the supply is tight," AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a news release. "We haven't seen prices this high since September of 2014."
U.S. drivers paid an average of $3.367 per gallon on Monday, according to Gasbuddy, a price tracker. Last year, gas in the U.S. cost an average $2.148.
North Carolina and Florida saw the biggest jumps in gas prices in the last week, up 14 cents per gallon, followed by Arizona at 12 cents and Rhode Island and New York at 11 cents, according to AAA, which calculated the national average at $3.38 per gallon. Drivers in California and Hawaii paid the most, at $4.54 per gallon and $4.26 per gallon.

Still, drivers are hitting the road. Strong demand is hitting U.S. stockpiles hard, while production is still slow because of the pandemic, sending the price of crude oil up, according to AAA.
Industry analyst Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg Survey told the Associated Press on Sunday that the rise comes as the cost of crude oil surges.
Lundberg's survey found the average U.S. price of regular-grade gasoline spiked 13 cents over the past two weeks and the average price of diesel jumped 14 cents to $3.59 a gallon, the AP reported.
Crude oil futures reached $83.76 for West Texas Intermediate and $85.53 for Brent at close Friday, hitting a seven-year high.
While the price of a gallon of gas typically dips after Labor Day, this year's persistent climb prompted President Joe Biden to call for an investigation .

Gasoline prices in the United States of all grades followed similar trends between March 2019 and March 2022, reaching their highest level in March 2022 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to a rise in crude oil prices. These prices were on average at its highest in 2022 since 2018. In contrast, April 2020 recorded an average of 1.95 U.S. dollars per gallon. The continuous inexpensiveness of fuel between March and May 2020 is attributed to low demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Impact of Covid-19 on fuel prices
The cost of gasoline in the United States is dictated by the supply and cost of light crude oil. As crude oil demand halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices plummeted, making gasoline in the U.S. its cheapest in nearly 20 years. In April 2020, gasoline demand in the United States was half of what it was in April 2019. Over one year on, the price of gasoline has reached its highest level in 2022. This inflation was bolstered by the war in Ukraine, which increased uncertainty regarding crude oil supplies as some countries depend on Russian exports of the commodity. Daily regular gas prices in the U.S. had climbed over the four U.S. dollars threshold in March 2022.
Differences in fuel grades
Fuel grades at U.S. gas stations are differentiated by the octane level of the gasoline. Higher grade fuels have higher octane levels, meaning that the fuel can be compressed more in the engine. This enables high-performance engines to create more power. Fuel may also vary from state to state and pump to pump. Some cities also have regulations on gasoline in order to improve air quality. Bio-ethanol is added to gasoline in some cases to meet the renewable fuel standard. The content of bio-ethanol is not regulated but can be around 10 percent.

You may soon be charged $4 for gallon of gas in US due to rocketing inflation – here’s where it’s most expensive

DRIVERS across the US may soon have to shell out $4 for a gallon of gas due to rocketing inflation.
The latest numbers released by the Labor Department showed American consumers are spending an extra $250 a month due to inflation, which has hiked the cost of everything from groceries to fuel.

AAA national retail price for a gallon of gas Credit: AAA
The latest numbers show a seven percent increase in December - the highest inflation rate in 40 years.
As of January 13, 2022, the average price of gasoline across the US stood at  $3.30 for regular 87, according to AAA.
Drivers are paying about a buck more in gas than last year when prices stood at $2.35 a gallon for regular 87.
However, motorists in Hawaii, California, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Connecticut are coughing up more for gas than anywhere in the country.
In Hawaii a gallon of gas is priced at $4.34; drivers in California are paying $4.65; in Oregon $3.91, Pennsylvania $3.52, and Connecticut $3.49, per AAA.
Yet, experts at GasBuddy are predicting a continued rise in pump prices by late February or early March.

“It’s tough to think of it this way but essentially where we are now is the calm before the storm,” Patrick De Haan, the head of petroleum analysis with GasBuddy, told News4 San Antonio.
De Haan predicts that the spike could be driven by demand and a lack of production capacity lifting crude oil prices to $90, or even $100 a barrel.
“GasBuddy had expected that we could see a national average eclipse the $4 a gallon mark some point by Memorial Day,” De Haan added.
The highest recorded average gas price was $4.11 back in July 2008, per AAA.
Inflation is also hammering consumers who use natural gas to warm up their homes.
Nearly half of US households that heat with natural gas will spend 30 percent more than last winter.
Households who rely on electricity for heat will spend six percent more.
“Clearly the prices are higher right now than they have been for a long time,” US Energy Information Administration Stephen Nalley told News4.
“So it’s clearly putting pressure on residents, industry, as well, at home with the higher prices.”

Okay, so from these search results, it seems like gas prices have been rising steadily over the past year, and they're currently around $3.30 to $3.40 per gallon on average in the US. Some states, like California and Hawaii, have much higher prices, up to $4.65 per gallon.

I recall that gas prices can be influenced by various factors, including crude oil prices, taxes, and local market conditions. Since crude oil is a major component of gas prices, and oil prices have been going up recently, it makes sense that gas prices are also increasing.

But I need to understand why crude oil prices are high in the first place. Is it because of the conflict in Ukraine, as I initially thought? Or are there other reasons?

Let me look into the factors affecting crude oil prices.

7 Top Factors That Affect Crude Oil Prices
Top Factors That Affect Crude Oil Prices
By Daffa Zaky October 8, 2019,  2:15 am •  Posted in Commodities
We all know the economic model that indicates when supply is low and demand is high, prices rise (and vice versa). But, supply and demand are just one of the many factors which will have an impact on the price of crude oil. Given the economy, financial markets, and the current state of politics in the US (trade wars, impeachment, etc.), there are several variables that come into play in determining prices of crude oils and other natural resources. So, what are the top factors that affect crude oil prices? At this point in time, these are among the most prominent.
Supply and Demand
There’s no way around it, this is probably the factor which is going to have the greatest impact in considering the top factors that affect crude oil prices, or pricing for any commodity for that matter. The more crude oil that’s being produced, from different regions in the world, the cheaper it is going to cost per barrel. How do supply and demand impact pricing?
Supply is low and demand is low, prices won’t fluctuate much
Supply is low and demand is high, cost per barrel will rise
Supply is high and demand is high, prices will increase/fluctuate accordingly
Supply is high and demand is low, prices should drop.
Of course it isn’t a perfect linear pattern that the supply and demand curve will play at all times, but this is how things typically work in the markets. It’s not just with crude oil, it’s virtually anything (food, clothing, tech, etc.). Therefore, understanding what supply and demand cycles look like, will be a great indicator as to when to buy crude oil, to ensure the lowest pricing.
Trade Wars and Political Wars (Turmoil)
This is more of a recent issue, given President Trump’s ongoing trade wars. China, Mexico, Canada. Then there’s the crisis in the middle East, Iran and Iraq conflict, and other political turmoils. The US always seems to be in the middle of these worldwide events, however, during this President’s tenure, political events and turmoil seem to play a greater role in the pricing of crude oil and goods from around the world in general. Political events, war, peace, and standoffs, are some of the many worldwide events, which will impact the prices of crude oil.
Commodity Price Cycles
OPEC and CME are great indicators of the commodities price cycles, and how the cost of crude oil is fluctuating, at any given point in time. Just looking through history, you can see the dips and hikes in graphs, which suggest that the rise in prices of commodities or drops, will also impact the price that buyers are willing to pay, and sellers will sell crude oil at. This is something that fluctuates daily, therefore, the price per barrel can dip by $10 dollars one day, and the next rise by $100.
Hedgers and Speculation
This is another big factor among the top factors that affect crude oil prices. A hedge is an investment which reduces the risk of adverse price movements in an asset. This is oftentimes used in pricing for crude oil, airlines, and other high risk or volatile industries. The process of hedging is like taking out an insurance policy on the price of crude oil. It’s insurance that even in the risky market, prices will remain around a certain figure.
Then there are speculators. Speculators will drive the prices (of hedgers) up or down. They speculate something is going to cause the demand for crude oil to dip, therefore, the market will react accordingly and sellers will reduce prices per barrel. If speculators indicate a war or possible trade conflict, the country which has power in that specific situation, can increase the price per barrel.
It’s a game of chess, and this is one of the biggest trends which will impact the price of crude oil, and how much buyers are willing to pay, and how low sellers are willing to go, given a specific turmoil or world event that’s taking place at any given time.
Global Recession
Dips in stock markets, Forex trends, reduction in investments, and other global recessional factors, will impact the price of crude oil. In the current economy, we’re in one of the worst bull markets the country’s seen in quite some time. The US impacts other regions of the world, and vice-versa. Major markets, and their financial status, will have an impact on the price of crude oil and other commodities. Depending on how well a particular market is doing, and how well a global currency is doing, prices of commodities will rise and fall accordingly.
Maritime Law
Crude oil is sold and purchased around the world. IMO rules, legislation in production of crude oil, shipping laws, trade wars, and other maritime legislation, can greatly impact the price of crude oil. New regulations go into effect regularly, and there are different regulations that are put in place to ensure the safety of transport, as well as the safety in production of crude oil. Maritime laws at any given point, and international norms (and governing bodies that regulate international sales and trade) have an impact on how prices of crude oil dip and fall at different points in time.
Worldwide Events
Bringing all of these points together, worldwide events, politics, political leaders, and other news cycles, are some of the top factors that affect crude oil prices. Each country wants to maintain the upper hand (both those that produce crude oil and those that purchase in high volumes). Therefore, to some extent, egos come into play as well.
It’s important to understand current events, trends, and the cost of natural resources in general, to understand how prices fluctuate as it relates to the purchase/sale of crude oil, and other natural resources. These are among the top factors that affect crude oil prices, however, depending on a specific event, or recent development in government relations between certain countries, the prices can fluctuate greatly at any point in time as well. Therefore, it’s important to remain abreast on politics, news cycles, and trends (around a particular time of year), to understand how prices of crude oil will fluctuate.

Elements of determining oil prices
The US Energy
Information Administration has identified the factors that affect oil prices:
Elements of Determining Oil Prices
1- The supply is from
OPEC countries, and they number 13 countries and produce about 40% of global
production.
2- The supply is from
outside OPEC, which represents about 60% of the total global supply.
3- Demand from
developed countries.
4- Demand from the
rest of the world, which includes a large percentage that is not covered by
OPEC.
5- Stock levels of
importing countries, the most important of which are US stocks, and they are
issued every Wednesday.
6- The reserves and
stocks of the producing countries.
7- The state of global
financial markets.
8- The price of the
dollar because it is the strongest currency in the world and on the basis of
which the price of oil is determined. Often when the "dollar price"
rises against other currencies, oil prices will drop.
9- Determining the
price of "Brent Crude" and "West Texas Intermediate Crude".
10- Conflicts and trade or military wars that
occur in sensitive areas.

Top Factors That Affect the Price of Oil

Fact checked by

Crude oil is the world's most widely traded and used commodity. 1 Oil and its derivatives still power the bulk of global transportation, and serve as cooking and heating sources in developing countries. 2
Because the world remains so reliant on crude oil, its price is heavily dependent on the pace of economic growth, which affects demand prospects. 3 This relationship is a two-way street, because our dependence on petroleum products in transportation, chemicals and manufacturing means changes in the price of oil can also affect the pace of economic growth. 4
For example, in the early months of 2022, crude oil prices at seven-year highs above $90 per barrel were frequently described as an inflationary threat to growth. 5 That's in stark contrast with crude's plunge in the spring of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The price of April West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures that year fell to -$37 per barrel shortly before expiration, meaning that's how much traders were willing to pay to avoid having to take delivery of about 42 gallons of crude. Global travel and economic activity had dropped off dramatically at the time amid public health restrictions, and the resulting supply surplus strained crude oil storage capacity.
While the negative pricing didn't last long and illustrated some risks particular to futures markets, it showed just how dramatically oil market sentiment can swing in response to changes in economic fundamentals. 6
Below, we'll look in more detail at the key variables in the global oil markets.
Key Takeaways
Crude oil prices can fluctuate widely and rapidly, ranging from negative territory in 2020 to more than $90 per barrel less than two years later.
Crude oil prices react to many variables, including supply and demand prospects and the perceived risk of market disruptions.
Economic growth can drive up the demand for crude oil, while slowdowns tend to lower demand and prices.
OPEC+ is an international alliance of crude oil exporters that negotiates export quotas for members in an attempt to influence global supply.
One reason crude oil prices can be volatile is that supply and demand are relatively inelastic, that is they're slow to respond to price signals, requiring bigger price moves to bring the market into balance.
In the spring of 2020, oil prices collapsed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic slowdown. OPEC and its allies agreed to historic production cuts to stabilize prices, but they still dropped to 20-year lows. 7
Investopedia / Alison Czinkota
Supply
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has sought to influence global oil prices by limiting the supply of crude for decades, with varying degrees of success. In recent years, OPEC's power to set prices was undermined by the development of shale supply in the continental U.S., but reinforced by OPEC's alliance with Russia and other exporters under the OPEC+ umbrella. Governments, oil companies, and speculators, continue to pay close attention to every OPEC+ decision.
OPEC's policies may be affected, in turn, by geopolitical developments. Some of the world's top oil producers are politically unstable.
In the past, supply disruptions triggered by political events have caused oil prices to shift drastically; the Iranian revolution, Iran-Iraq war, Arab oil embargo, and Persian Gulf wars have been especially notable. The Asian financial crisis and the global economic crisis of 2007-2008 also caused fluctuations. 8
Technological innovations and financial conditions can also influence crude oil supply levels by affecting production volumes and costs. For example, advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology have vastly increased the supply of crude extracted from rock, with the so-called shale oil making the U.S. a net exporter of crude oil and related products for the first time since the 1940s in 2018. 9
Demand
Strong economic growth and industrial production tend to boost the demand for oil—as reflected in the increased demand from fast-growing developing nations in recent years. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration :
“Oil consumption in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries declined between 2000 and 2010, [while] non-OECD oil consumption increased more than 40%. China, India, and Saudi Arabia had the largest growth in oil consumption among the countries in the non-OECD during this period.” 10
Other important factors that affect demand for oil include transportation (both commercial and personal), population growth, and seasonal changes. For instance, oil use increases during busy summer travel seasons and in the winters, when more heating fuel is consumed.
Derivatives and Reports
More and more, market participants are buying and selling crude oil not in its physical form but rather through futures and options contracts. For example, airlines and oil producers use derivatives like futures and options to hedge against swings in the price of crude, while speculators use the same securities in hopes of profiting from price moves in crude oil.
Such hedging instruments are important to many oil producers and consumers because oil prices can be so volatile. One reason oil prices are often volatile is that crude oil consumers are relatively slow to change their consumption in response to changes in the price of oil, and producers tend to be similarly slow in adjusting production. With supply and demand relatively inelastic, the price must move more to balance supply and demand at times of disruption for either. 11
Reports on production figures, spare capacity and investment can all affect crude oil prices in the short term, as can perceptions of the risks to supply and overall market sentiment. Some of the most closely followed reports are OPEC's monthly oil report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) oil market report, and weekly inventory data from both the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API).
The Bottom Line
Oil has long been the engine of the world's economy, and even today—as the search for alternative energy sources gains ground—it remains an essential commodity. Carbon-based fuels are widely used in transportation, heating and manufacturing.
While global growth plays a major role in setting oil prices, supply dynamics influenced by political developments as well as technological innovations in crude extraction and alternative energy sources are also important oil market factors.

Factors Influencing Crude Oil Price
Print
Many, many factors can influence the price of crude oil either directly or indirectly. Some of the major factors influencing US crude oil prices are:
US weather – mostly winter, as the demand for heating oil impacts crude oil prices. The Northeastern part of the US is the world's single largest consumer of heating oil.
Geopolitical events - in any oil-producing region of the world where conflicts exist that could potentially interrupt supply.
US dollar vs. foreign currencies - as mentioned previously, a devalued US dollar gives foreign investors more money to buy crude oil contracts and, vice versa, a stronger US dollar discourages foreign investment in crude oil contracts.
US economy - strength or weakness directly impacts the perception of energy consumption. Several economic indicators are released weekly.
World economy - as stated in the introduction, we are now in a truly global economy and what happens in one country can affect all others.
Production & imports vs. demand - reports on domestic oil production & imports vs. consumption can cause prices to vary greatly.
Baker Hughes Drilling Report of active rigs - this oilfield service company keeps track of the total number of rigs actively drilling for oil and gas, and they report the statistics weekly. A rise in rigs means more potential supply coming-on down-the-road. A drop in the rig count could mean less supply down the road.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude vs. Brent North Sea crude - Brent crude oil is presently the global standard and trades in London. Its prices reflect demand in continental Europe which can influence the price of imported crude here in the US.
Weekly Crude Oil & Distillates Inventory Report (Energy Information Agency) - The Department of Energy releases a report every week that gives the current amount of crude oil and distillates in the nation's storage facilities. (Distillates include heating oil, diesel, gasoline, etc.) Increases in the inventory are viewed as an increase in supply, while decreases are seen as an indicator of increased demand. Another key piece of information presented is that of "refinery utilization". The higher the utilization percentage, the higher the demand for crude and vice versa.
OPEC
(link is external)
- The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, was formed in 1960 by the first five members including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela and has 14 members as of May 2017. OPEC members control about 73% of the world's total proved oil reserves and produced 44% of the world's total crude oil in 2016. OPEC has a significant impact on the oil market, managing the oil production, and oil price.
The following videos go into greater detail about the factors which can influence crude oil prices. Please note that some of the statistics might be a bit out of date but please do not worry about that. These are just examples and are meant to teach you about how the various factors influence the market. You will not be responsible for the example details.

One of the world’s primary energy resources, crude oil has always been in high demand and traded in large volumes. This commodity can be refined into various other products, such as petrochemicals, lubricants, gasoline and wax, making it very sought after. The oil markets are highly liquid, translating into tighter spreads and clear chart patterns for traders. However, crude oil prices are very sensitive to geo-political events.
Along with that, the major oil reserves are located in politically unstable regions of the world, such as the Middle East and South America. This is why prices tend to be in a constant state of flux. In order to determine the factors that impacts crude oil prices, one has to understand the relationship between its supply and demand. A rise in demand will lead to an increase in price, provided that the supply remains constant, and vice versa.
Supply Side of Oil Prices
The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
OPEC, an alliance of 15 countries involved in the production and export of oil, contributes about 40% of the global oil supply. The organisation actively controls oil production in the member countries, by setting production targets. OPEC’s oil exports constitute 60% of the total petroleum traded in the international markets. This huge market share makes OPEC an important factor in crude oil prices. Historically, crude oil prices have risen whenever the OPEC countries have reduced production. In particular, actions by Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest oil producing country, can impact oil prices.
OPEC member countries’ production capacities and the extent to which they utilise it, is said to be an indicator of the tightness of the global oil markets. Also important is the projected future supply and demand. OPEC meetings, held in Vienna a few times a year, are where member countries decide on their production quotas. These meetings coincide with huge volatility in oil prices.
In the December 2018 meeting, OPEC decided to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day in 2019. Keeping an eye on how these cuts are brought into effect is a key aspect in assessing the supply side of oil.
Non-OPEC Production
Outside of OPEC, some of the biggest oil producing regions are North America, China, North Sea and regions of the former Soviet Union. These countries, including USA, Canada, China and the UK, make their oil production decisions independently. Oil production in the OPEC countries are carried out mostly by national oil companies, whereas the main players in non-OPEC production are international and investor-owned oil companies.
These countries are price takers, which mean that they react to changes in market prices, rather than controlling production to influence it. Low levels of production in these countries put pressure on the OPEC countries, which can then lead to increasing prices. Increase in supply from non-OPEC countries keeps prices low. Advancements in production technologies in these countries could bring down the high cost of offshore drilling, putting downward pressure on prices.
Demand Side of Oil Prices
Demand from OECD Countries
The Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) comprises of the USA, large parts of the EU, including the UK, and several other advanced nations. By 2010, these countries were consuming 53% of the world’s crude oil supply. The economic structure of each country has an effect on industrialisation and the resulting oil demand.
Developed nations tend to have higher per capita vehicle ownership. Policies that deal with transportation of citizens and goods have an effect on demand for oil for fuel. Demand from highly industrialised nations, like the USA, has an effect on oil prices, the estimates of which are provided by the Energy Information Agency (EIA).
There are fewer subsidies on end-user oil prices in these countries, so market prices are quickly reflected in the price consumers pay.
Demand from non-OECD Countries
Oil consumption in some developing nations has risen over the past few years. Between 2000 and 2010, this consumption grew more than 40% in countries like China, India and Saudi Arabia. Expected levels of economic growth tend to have a significant influence in oil demand.
Oil remains an important source of power generation, as well as of fuel for commercial and individual transportation. Manufacturing activities need oil too. In recent years, China has managed to become the second largest oil consumer in the world. Energy policies also have an effect on the relationship between economic activity and oil prices. An improved economic outlook raises expectations of tightening oil markets in the future, and, as a result, higher oil prices.
Effect of Major Geo-Political Events
Apart from economic activities, other events like wars, natural disasters and political crises impact oil prices. For example, when Hurricane Katrina hit the US coast in 2005, it damaged important supply lines.
In the aftermath of the US-China trade war, manufacturing activities in both nations have been negatively impacted. GDP growth expectations have been lowered for 2019 and 2020, which can impact oil prices. After all, the US and China are the two largest oil consumers in the world.
Sanctions on Iran and decisions regarding renewal of waivers by the US will have a major impact on oil prices in 2019. Also to be considered is the reluctance of Russia to form any long-term alliance with Saudi Arabia, saying that it is content with lower oil prices.
Speculation in the Futures Markets
The oil futures market plays a major role in price discovery, and therefore has a major impact on oil prices. Participants in this market include large corporations, like airline companies, which mostly want to hedge their risks with exposure to changing prices of oil and petroleum-based fuel products.
Other players include banks, hedge funds, money managers and commodity traders, who are actively involved in the energy derivatives markets to capture profits from price fluctuations. Individual traders mostly want to diversify their portfolios and hedge inflation risks.
The Commitment of Traders Report, released by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a weekly report of oil trading activities on various exchanges, is something traders can keep their eye on.
These and many other factors, like stock performances and performance of the US Dollar, show correlations with oil prices. Exchange rates and other economic factors affect oil production and demand, possibly affecting price correlations.

So, from these sources, I can see that several factors influence crude oil prices. The biggest ones are supply and demand, followed by geopolitical events, OPEC policies, and global economic conditions.

OPEC is an organization of 13 oil-exporting countries that produce about 40% of the world's crude oil. They sometimes coordinate their production levels to influence the global supply and, consequently, the price.

Non-OPEC producers, like the United States, Canada, and Russia, also play a significant role, especially with advancements in technologies like fracking, which has increased their oil production.

Demand comes mainly from developed countries in the OECD and emerging economies like China and India. Economic growth in these regions drives oil consumption.

Geopolitical events can disrupt oil supplies, leading to price spikes. For example, conflicts in the Middle East or sanctions on oil-producing countries like Iran can reduce supply and drive up prices.

Additionally, speculation in the futures markets can influence oil prices. Traders and investors betting on future price movements can cause prices to rise or fall based on their expectations.

Now, considering that crude oil prices are a major component of gas prices, these factors indirectly affect how much we pay at the pump.

But there are also other elements that contribute to gas prices besides crude oil costs. Let me think about what those might be.

First, there are refining costs. Crude oil needs to be processed into usable fuels like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The cost of operating refineries, including labor, energy, and maintenance, affects the final price of gas.

Second, there are distribution and marketing costs. Getting the refined product from the refinery to the gas station involves pipelines, trucks, and storage terminals. Each of these steps adds to the cost.

Third, there are taxes. Governments impose taxes on gasoline, which vary by region. In the United States, there are federal, state, and local taxes that contribute to the pump price.

Lastly, there's the gas station's profit margin. Gas stations need to make a profit to stay in business, and their costs, including rent, salaries, and overhead, are factored into the price they charge customers.

So, to sum it up, gas prices are influenced by:

1. Crude oil prices (supply and demand, OPEC policies, geopolitical events, etc.)

2. Refining costs

3. Distribution and marketing costs

4. Taxes

5. Gas station profit margins

Given that, if crude oil prices are high, it stands to reason that gas prices would also be high, assuming other factors remain constant.

But in reality, these factors can interact in complex ways. For example, if there's a surplus of refined product, gas stations might lower their prices even if crude oil prices are high. Conversely, if there's a disruption in refining capacity, gas prices could rise even if crude oil prices are stable or falling.

Also, local市场竞争情况会影响汽油价格。在一些地区，加油站可能更加集中，竞争不那么激烈，因此价格可能会更高。而在其他地区，如果有更多的加油站竞争，价格可能会更低。

此外，季节性因素也会影响汽油价格。在夏季驾驶季节，需求增加，价格往往会上涨。而在冬季，特别是如果天气温和，需求减少，价格可能会下降。

最近，由于全球对环境保护的关注增加，可再生能源和电动汽车的发展也在逐渐改变石油和汽油市场的动态。虽然目前石油仍然是主要的能源来源，但长期来看，这些变化可能会影响未来的油价和汽油价格。

不过，就当前而言，汽油价格仍然主要受上述因素的影响。要理解为什么汽油价格如此之高，需要综合考虑所有这些因素。

也许我应该看看最近的新闻，了解是否有特定的事件导致了汽油价格的上涨。

GAS PRICES 2021: YEAR IN REVIEW
--
                                    If there is one word to describe the turmoil gas prices put us through this year, it’s ROLLERCOASTER. From a low national average of under $2.25 per gallon at the start of the year, to the highest Christmas gas prices ever recorded, it’s safe to say that 2021 brought unexpected, and unwanted, surprises to drivers at the pump.

GAS PRICES 2021: YEAR IN REVIEW
--
                                    If there is one word to describe the turmoil gas prices put us through this year, it’s ROLLERCOASTER. From a low national average of under $2.25 per gallon at the start of the year, to the highest Christmas gas prices ever recorded, it’s safe to say that 2021 brought unexpected, and unwanted, surprises to drivers at the pump.

Gas Prices are Insanely High Right Now, Here's Why
Sophie Webster, Tech Times 19 November 2021, 12:11 pm
Gas prices have surged in the past few months, and on Nov. 17, the Biden administration announced that it had asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate if oil and gas companies were manipulating the prices.
Republicans have countered that it is a "cheap political stunt," and they blamed the energy policies that President Joe Biden implemented.
Gas Price Increase
Experts claimed that the increase in prices is not as easy as what the Biden administration made it out to be. The biggest driver is not oil companies or politicians, Business Insider said.
Instead, the gas price surge is driven by investors' issues in the United States and international producers.
The cost of gas has increased 50% compared to 2020, according to data increased by AAA. That same data shows that the average price of a gallon of gas in the United States is $3.41, but a gallon is even more expensive in some states.
California is the state that has the most expensive gas, as it costs $4.70 per gallon.

Democratic Senator Ed Markey posted on Twitter that Big Oil is fueling climate change and getting money away from struggling individuals with high gas prices while spending massive amounts of money lobbying climate deniers and preventing the government from switching to a cheaper and cleaner alternative.
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, known as the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying arm, blamed the Biden administration for canceling important infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline.
Gizmodo reporter Molly Taft interviewed Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, to talk about the reason why the cost of gas increased. He reportedly said that the simple explanation is the cost of oil and refining it is added to the cost of getting it to the refinery from the gas station.
Aside from that, the cost of running a gas station and the taxes they have to pay are also why gas prices increase.
There are a lot of variables that go into finding out how much each of the costs of the said steps is. However, the price of oil is usually getting the attention due to how much it can change in seconds, according to Forbes.
Crude Oil Prices
Crude oil prices are part of the majority of the price that you see at gas stations. Even a bit of an oversupply or a little less oil on the market can have a shift in global prices.
Contrary to what the fossil fuel supporters say, both oil and gas supply does not have a perfect market.
Internationally, oil production is controlled by a literal cartel known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC.
The coalition of 13 oil-producing giants, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran, influences the production and prices around the world. As of 2018, OPEC controlled 79.4% of the world's oil reserves.
Meanwhile, in the United States, investors in American gas companies have a lot of say on what producers in Texas and other states make.
The gas prices aren't always high. In 2014, gas prices had hit an all-time low. In the summer of 2014, gas prices remained low.

WHICH FUEL PAYMENT TYPE IS RIGHT FOR YOU?
--
                                    When it comes to paying for gas, you might think it’s easy. All you need to do is pull out your card, pump your gas and you’re good to go, right? Well, it’s not really that simple. You should be asking yourself questions like: What kind of card are you using? Does it offer rewards or cash back on fuel purchases? Are you using any tools to find the best priced gas? Should you be taking advantage of cash discounts? Would a credit card save you more money than using a gas rewards debit card?
