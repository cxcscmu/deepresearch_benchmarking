Alright, I need to figure out how police investigate crimes. I don't know much about this topic, so I should probably start by understanding the basic steps involved in a criminal investigation. Maybe I can look up some information online to get a clearer picture.

First, I should consider what happens right after a crime is reported. I think the police must receive a report, maybe from a witness or a victim. Then, they probably go to the scene to collect evidence and talk to people who might know something about what happened.

I remember seeing on TV shows that detectives interview suspects and witnesses. They also analyze evidence, like fingerprints or DNA, to find out who did it. But I don't know if that's exactly how it works in real life.

Maybe I should think about the different types of crimes and see if the investigation process varies depending on the crime. For example, investigating a robbery might be different from solving a murder case.

Wait, perhaps there are standard procedures that police follow for all types of crimes. Maybe there's a specific protocol they have to adhere to.

I should probably look for some reliable sources online to get accurate information. Maybe official police websites or educational resources could provide me with the details I need.

Let me try to outline what I think are the general steps in a criminal investigation:

1. Receiving the report: Someone reports a crime to the police.

2. Responding to the scene: Officers go to where the crime happened to assess the situation.

3. Securing the scene: Making sure the area is safe and preserving any evidence that might be there.

4. Collecting evidence: Gathering physical evidence like fingerprints, blood samples, weapons, etc.

5. Interviewing witnesses and suspects: Talking to people who might have information about the crime.

6. Analyzing evidence: Using forensic science to examine the evidence collected.

7. Building a case: Putting together all the information gathered to identify suspects and build a prosecution case.

8. Making an arrest: If there's enough evidence, arresting the suspect.

9. Prosecution: Working with prosecutors to bring the case to court.

That seems like a basic overview, but I'm sure there are more detailed steps within each of these stages.

I should consider looking into specific techniques police use during investigations, such as surveillance, stakeouts, or using technology like CCTV cameras.

Also, I think police sometimes reconstruct the crime scene to better understand what happened. They might use computer simulations or physical models to analyze the sequence of events.

Moreover, in cases where there are multiple suspects or complex criminal organizations, police might conduct long-term investigations, building relationships with informants and gathering intelligence over time.

I should also think about the legal aspects of investigations. Police have to follow certain rules and regulations to ensure that their methods are lawful and that the evidence they collect is admissible in court.

For instance, they need to obtain search warrants before searching a property, unless there are exceptional circumstances that allow them to do so without a warrant.

Similarly, when interrogating suspects, they have to read them their Miranda rights to ensure that they understand their constitutional protections.

I wonder if different countries have different investigation procedures. Maybe in some places, the processes are more lenient, while in others, there are stricter regulations.

Perhaps I should focus on the investigation process in the United States, as that might be more relevant for my purposes.

Let me try to find some reliable sources to confirm and expand on what I've thought so far.

Police: Criminal Investigations
The Structure Of Criminal Investigations
Criminal investigations can be either reactive, where the police respond to a crime that has already occurred, or proactive, where the investigation may go on before and during the commission of the offense.
The reactive criminal investigation process can be organized into several stages. The first stage is initial discovery and response. Of course, before the criminal investigation process can begin, the police must discover that a crime occurred or the victim (or witness) must realize that a crime occurred and notify the police. In the vast majority of cases it is the victim that first realizes a crime occurred and notifies the police. Then, most often, a patrol officer is dispatched to the crime scene or the location of the victim.
The second stage, the initial investigation, consists of the immediate post-crime activities of the patrol officer who arrives at the crime scene. The tasks of the patrol officer during the initial investigation are to arrest the culprit (if known and present), locate and interview witnesses, and collect and preserve other evidence.
If the perpetrator is not arrested during the initial investigation, then the case may be selected for a follow-up investigation, the third stage of the reactive investigation process. The follow-up investigation consists of additional investigative activities performed on a case, and these activities are usually performed by a detective. The process of deciding which cases should receive additional investigative effort is referred to as case screening. This decision is most often made by a detective supervisor and is most often guided by consideration of the seriousness of the crime (e.g., the amount of property loss or injury to the victim) and solvability factors (key pieces of crime-related information that, if present, enhance the probability of an arrest being made) (Brandl; Brandl and Frank).
Finally, at any time in the process the case may be closed and investigative activities terminated (e.g., victim cancels the investigation, the crime is unfounded, there are no more leads available, or an arrest is made). If an arrest is made, or an arrest warrant is issued, primary responsibility for the case typically shifts to the prosecutor's office. The detective then assists the prosecutor in preparing the case for further processing.
With regard to proactive criminal investigations, undercover investigations are of most significance (Marx). Perhaps the most well-known



type of undercover strategy is the sting or buy-bust strategy that usually involves a police officer posing as someone who wishes to buy some illicit goods (e.g., sex, drugs). Once a seller is identified and the particulars of the illicit transaction are determined, police officers waiting nearby can execute an arrest. Another common strategy involves undercover police officers acting as decoys where the attempt is to attract street crime by presenting an opportunity to an offender to commit such crime (e.g., a police officer poses as a stranded motorist in a high crime area; when a robbery attempt is made, nearby officers can make an arrest). Undercover strategies are controversial primarily because of the possibility of entrapment. Although a multitude of court cases have dealt with this issue, the basic rule is that the police can provide the opportunity or can encourage the offender to act but cannot compel the behavior—a fine line indeed.

POLICE: CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
This entry provides an overview of the criminal investigation process and investigative methods. The focus of the discussion is on definitional issues along with the identification and evaluation of the types and sources of information often used in criminal investigations.
Criminal investigation defined
An investigation refers to the process of collecting information in order to reach some goal; for example, collecting information about the reliability and performance of a vehicle prior to purchase in order to enhance the likelihood of buying a good car. Applied to the criminal realm, a criminal investigation refers to the process of collecting information (or evidence) about a crime in order to: (1) determine if a crime has been committed; (2) identify the perpetrator; (3) apprehend the perpetrator; and (4) provide evidence to support a conviction in court. If the first three objectives are successfully attained, then the crime can be said to be solved. Several other outcomes such as recovering stolen property, deterring individuals from engaging in criminal behaviors, and satisfying crime victims have also been associated with the process.
A useful perspective on the criminal investigation process is provided by information theory (Willmer). According to information theory, the criminal investigation process resembles a battle between the police and the perpetrator over crime-related information. In committing the crime, the offender emits "signals," or leaves behind information of various sorts (fingerprints, eyewitness descriptions, murder weapon, etc.), which the police attempt to collect through investigative activities. If the perpetrator is able to minimize the amount of information available for the police to collect, or if the police are unable to recognize the information left behind, then the perpetrator will not be apprehended and therefore, the perpetrator will win the battle. If the police are able to collect a significant number of signals from the perpetrator, then the perpetrator will be identified and apprehended, and the police win. This perspective clearly underscores the importance of information in a criminal investigation.
The major problem for the police in conducting a criminal investigation is that not only is there potentially massive amounts of information available, but the relevance of the information is often unknown, the information is often incomplete, and the information is often inaccurate. Further, to be useful in proving guilt in court (where beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard), the evidence must have certain other qualities, and certain rules and procedures must be followed in collecting the evidence.

Although a multitude of court cases have dealt with this issue, the basic rule is that the police can provide the opportunity or can encourage the offender to act but cannot compel the behavior — a fine line indeed.
Sources of information and evidence in criminal investigations
As noted earlier, the major problem for the police in conducting criminal investigations is determining the utility of the information (evidence) collected. While much information may be discovered or otherwise available to the police, only a small portion of it may be accurate, complete, and relevant, and hence useful, in establishing the identity (and/or whereabouts) of the culprit. As discussed below, not all types of information are equal in this regard — some types of evidence are usually more useful than others.
Information from physical evidence. Physical evidence is evidence of a tangible nature relating directly to the crime. Physical evidence includes such items as fingerprints, blood, fibers, and crime tools (knife, gun, crowbar, etc.). Physical evidence is sometimes referred to as forensic or scientific evidence, implying that the evidence must be scientifically analyzed and the results interpreted in order to be useful.
Physical evidence can serve at least two important functions in the investigative or judicial process (Peterson et al.). First, physical evidence can help establish the elements of a crime. For example, pry marks left on a window (physical evidence) may help establish the occurrence of a burglary. Second, physical evidence can associate or link victims to crime scenes, offenders to crime scenes, victims to victims, instruments to crime scenes, offenders to instruments, and so on. For example, in a homicide case, a body of a young female was found along a rural road. Knotted around her neck was a black electrical cord (physical evidence). The cause of death was determined to be ligature strangulation via the electrical cord. Upon searching the area for evidence, an abandoned farmhouse was located and searched, and a piece of a similar electrical cord was found. This evidence led the investigators to believe that the farmhouse may have been where the murder actually occurred. Further examination of the scene revealed tire impressions from an automobile (more physical evidence). These tire impressions were subsequently linked to the suspect's vehicle.
Most forensic or physical evidence submitted for analysis is intended to establish associations. It is important to note that physical evidence is generally not very effective at identifying a culprit when one is not already known. Typically the identity of the culprit is developed in some other way and then physical evidence is used to help establish proof of guilt. Possible exceptions to this pattern are fingerprints (when analyzed through AFIS or Automated Fingerprint Identification System technology) and DNA banks. With AFIS technology, fingerprints recovered from a crime scene can be compared with thousands of other prints on file in the computer system at the law enforcement agency. Through a computerized matching process, the computer can select fingerprints that are close in characteristics. In this way a match may be made and a suspect's name produced.
DNA printing allows for the comparison of DNA obtained from human cells (most commonly blood and semen) in order to obtain a match between at least two samples. In order for traditional DNA analysis to be useful, a suspect must first be identified through some other means, so that a comparison of samples can be made. However, emerging technology involves the creation of DNA banks, similar to the computerized fingerprint systems, in order to compare and match DNA structures. There is little question, as technological capabilities advance, so too will the value of physical evidence.
Information from people. Beside physical evidence, another major source of information in a criminal investigation is people, namely witnesses and suspects. Witnesses can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary witnesses are individuals who have direct knowledge of the crime because they overheard or observed its occurrence. This classification would include crime victims who observed or who were otherwise
involved in the offense. Eyewitnesses would also be included here. Secondary witnesses possess information about related events before or after the crime. Informants (or street sources ) and victims who did not observe the crime would be best classified as secondary witnesses.
A suspect can be defined as any individual within the scope of the investigation who may be responsible for the crime. Note that a witness may be initially considered a suspect by the police because information is not available to rule him or her out as the one responsible for the crime.
Besides the basic information about the particulars of the criminal event and possibly the actions of the perpetrator (to establish a modus operandi), another important type of information often provided by witnesses is eyewitness descriptions and identifications. Such information is quite powerful in establishing proof — for the police, prosecutor, judge, and jury — but the problem is that eyewitness identifications are often quite inaccurate and unreliable (Loftus et al.). Research has shown that many factors — such as environmental conditions, physical and emotional conditions of the observer, expectancies of the observer, perceived significance of the event, and knowledge of the item or person being described — can significantly influence the accuracy of eyewitness statements.
Hypnosis and cognitive interviews are two investigative tools available in the interview setting for the purpose of enhancing memory recall, and thus enhancing the accuracy of eyewitness information. Hypnosis is typically viewed as an altered state of consciousness that is characterized by heightened suggestibility (Niehaus). For the police, hypnosis is used as a method of stimulating memory in an attempt to increase memory recall greater than that achieved otherwise. While the use of hypnosis has increased sharply in the 1990s many courts have refused to admit such testimony because of accuracy concerns, or have established strict procedures under which hypnotically elicited testimony must be obtained (e.g., interview must be videotaped, the hypnotist should know little or nothing about the particulars of the case, no other persons are to be present during the interview, etc.). Most problematic is that under hypnosis, one is more responsive to suggestions (by definition) and thus, the hypnotist (intentionally or not) may lead the subject and inaccurate information may result. Once again then, information is produced but it is unknown whether the information is accurate.
Another method used to enhance memory recall among witnesses involves the use of the cognitive interview (Niehaus). A cognitive interview is designed to fully immerse the subject in the situation once again, but through freedom of description not hypnosis. The subject is instructed to report everything he or she can think of no matter how trivial it may seem. The witness may be instructed to recount the incident in more than one order. The intent is to allow for a much deeper level of recollection than the traditional interview. Research has shown that the cognitive interview approach elicits significantly more accurate information than a standard police interview, which typically involves frequent interruptions of explanations and descriptions, includes many closed-ended and short answer questions, and involves the inappropriate or overly strict ordering of questions (Niehaus).
In contrast to interviews of witnesses, interrogations of suspects are often more accusatory in nature. Usually interrogations are more of a process of testing already developed information than of actually developing information. The ultimate objective in an interrogation is to obtain a confession (Zulawski and Wicklander).
For obvious reasons, offenders have great incentive to deceive investigators. Understanding this, there are several tools available to investigators who wish to separate truthful from deceptive information. First is the understanding of kinesic behavior, the use of body movement and posture to convey meaning (Walters). Although not admissible in court, information derived from an understanding and interpretation of body language can be quite useful in an investigation. The theory behind the study of nonverbal behavior is that lying is stressful and individuals try to cope with this stress through body positioning and movement.
Although no single behavior is always indicative of deception, there are patterns (Zulawski and Wicklander). For example, a deceptive subject will tend not to sit facing the interrogator with shoulders squared but will protect the abdominal region of the body (angled posture, crossed arms). Major body shifts are typical especially when asked incriminating questions; and use of manipulators (or created jobs) are also common among deceptive subjects (e.g., grooming gestures), as are particular eye movements (Zulawski and Wicklander).
Much like nonverbal behavior, verbal behavior can also provide information about the truthfulness of a suspect. For example, deceptive subjects tend to provide vague and confusing statements, talk very soft or mumble, provide premature explanations, focus on irrelevant (but truthful) points in an explanation, or may claim memory problems or have a selectively good memory. Of course, interpretations of nonverbal and verbal behaviors in terms of deception must consider individual, gender, and cultural differences in personal interaction.
The polygraph is a mechanical means of detecting deception. The polygraph is a machine that measures physiological responses to psychological phenomenon. The polygraph records blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, and electro-dermal reactivity and changes in these factors when questioned. Interpretation of the resulting chart serves as the basis for a judgment about truthfulness. Once again, the theory is that a person experiences increased stress when providing deceptive information and the corresponding physiological responses can be detected, measured, and interpreted. While this general theory is well founded, the accuracy of the polygraph depends largely on the skill of the operator and the individual who interprets the results of the polygraph examination (Raskin). No one can be forced to take a polygraph and polygraph results are seldom admissible in court. Often investigators threaten suspects with a polygraph examination in order to judge the nature of their reaction to it, or to induce a confession (Raskin).
Other sources of information
Along with physical evidence, witnesses, and suspects, there are a number of other sources that can provide useful information in a criminal investigation. These include psychological profiling, crime analysis, and the general public.
In the last two decades, psychological profiling has received much media attention. It is often portrayed as a complicated yet foolproof method of crime solving. In reality, psychological profiling is not all that mysterious. Psychological profiling is a technique for identifying the major personality, behavioral, and background characteristics of an individual based upon an analysis of the crime(s) he or she has committed. The basic theory behind psychological profiling is that the crime reflects the personality and characteristics of the offender much like how clothes, home decorations, and the car you drive reflects, to some degree, your personality. And these preferences do not change, or do not change very much over time.
In constructing a psychological profile, the characteristics of the offender are inferred from the nature of the crime and the behaviors displayed. The elements of a psychological profile are essentially statements of probability as determined from previous crimes and crime patterns (Holmes). Profiles are best suited and most easily constructed in cases where the perpetrator shows indications of psychopathology such as lust and mutilation murder, sadistic rape, and motiveless fire setting.
The value of a psychological profile is that it can help focus an investigation or reduce the number of suspects being considered. In this respect, a psychological profile is much like most physical evidence; a psychological profile cannot identify a suspect when one is not already known. There has been very little systematic research that has documented the actual impact of psychological profiles on criminal investigations. In an internal examination by the F.B.I. (as reported in Pinizzotto, 1984), analysts examined 192 cases where profiling was conducted. Of these, 88 were solved. Of these 88 solved cases, in only 17 percent did a profile offer significant help. Given the limitations of psychological profiles, it is clear that they are not as useful as media depictions might suggest.
Crime analysis is another potentially powerful source of information in a criminal investigation. Simply defined, crime analysis is the process of identifying patterns or trends in criminal incidents. Various means can be used to reach such ends, from computer mapping technology to computer data banks. The Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VI-CAP) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is an example of an elaborate and sophisticated crime analysis system. When police departments are confronted with unsolved homicides, missing persons, or unidentified dead bodies, personnel in the department may complete a VI-CAP questionnaire, which asks for detailed information regarding the nature of the incident. These data are then sent to the F.B.I. and entered into the VI-CAP computer system, which is able to collate the data and possibly link crimes that occurred in different jurisdictions based on similarities in the crimes. This system, and similar intrastate systems, are designed to facilitate communication and sharing of information across agencies.
Finally, the general public is a potentially useful source of information in criminal investigations. As defined here, the public consists of people who have information relating to a particular crime or criminal but often cannot be identified through traditional methods (like a neighborhood canvass). Crime Solvers (or Crime Stoppers) tip lines and television shows such as America's Most Wanted provide a method of disseminating information and encouraging individuals to come forward with information relating to particular crimes. Although once again, little systematic research has examined the actual effects of such strategies, information that has come from the general public through these sources has led to the solving of many crimes across the county (Rosenbaum; Nelson).
Conclusion
This discussion has provided an overview of the criminal investigation process and the role, function, and utility of various types and sources of evidence within the process. With these understandings, one may be able to better appreciate the complexities of criminal evidence and the criminal investigation process.

Police Investigation Process for Crimes in Singapore (4 Steps) - SingaporeLegalAdvice.com
Police Investigation Process for Crimes in Singapore (4 Steps)
Police Investigation Process for Crimes in Singapore (4 Steps)
Last updated on November 10, 2021
What is a police investigation process like in Singapore? How, when and why do certain cases go to court? If you are being investigated for a crime, your head might be spinning with these questions.
Understanding the police investigation process could lessen your confusion and help you to gain clarity on what to expect while you are being investigated.
Typically, a police investigation involves the following 4 steps, which this article will explain:
Step 1: Receiving a first information report of a crime
Step 2: Conducting interviews and recording statements
Step 3: Gathering of evidence
Step 4: Referring the case to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC)
Step 1: Receiving a First Information Report
An investigation process typically commences upon the police receiving a first information report. This is a document that contains the very first information that the police obtains about the incident, hence its name.
A first information report may be received in writing, for instance, in the form of a letter or message. It may also be received orally, such as a report made by an informant over the phone or at the police station.
Upon receiving a report, the police would consider whether the information in the report discloses a possible offence and if so, whether the offence is arrestable or non-arrestable, before taking further action.
If the first information report discloses a possible arrestable offence
If the offence in question is arrestable, then the police has the power to arrest an alleged offender for it without first obtaining a warrant of arrest.
The Third Column of the First Schedule of the Criminal Procedure Code lays down the offences that are arrestable. For offences found in other legislation, you will have to check that legislation to see if the offence is arrestable.
Examples of arrestable cases include:
Rape
Theft and robbery
Criminal trespass
Assault or use of criminal force to a person with intent to outrage modesty (molest)
If the police has a reason to suspect that the offence is arrestable, it would then investigate the facts of the case as soon as practicable and try to find the offender, arresting him if appropriate.
If the first information report discloses a possible non-arrestable offence
Non-arrestable offences are those for which the police may not make an arrest without a warrant. Thus, for such cases, the police would have to obtain a Warrant of Arrest from the courts before they can arrest a suspect. Examples of non-arrestable offences include voluntarily causing hurt and defamation.
For non-arrestable cases, the police are conferred the discretion to investigate and may refer the case to a mediator of a Community Mediation Centre. The police may also refer the informant, namely the person who had given information about an offence, to a magistrate, who would examine the informant. Thereafter, the magistrate may:
Issue summons to call witnesses;
Direct police officers to investigate the complaint;
Proceed with mediation;
Postpone the matter in favour of amicable resolution of the matter; or
Dismiss the complaint.
Step 2: Interviews and Recording of Statements by the Police
A suspect is typically held in police custody from the point of arrest. During this time, as part of investigations, statements will be recorded. There are two types of statements that may be recorded:
Witness statements; and
Cautioned statements.
If the suspect is under 16 years old, then under the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects, an independent and trained adult will be present with them during the interviews conducted by the police.
It is also possible for a suspect to be released on bail, depending on whether bail is offered, and if one or more bailors put up security for the suspect’s release from custody. Nonetheless, the suspect is expected to and must continue to remain available for investigations, which includes the taking of statements.
Witness statements
Witness statements are governed by section 22 of the CPC, which allows the police to interview any person who may have knowledge about the case under investigation.
While the person being examined is bound to state the truth about the facts of the case, they need not mention things that might expose them to a criminal charge. This means that you would have to tell the police everything you know about the case, except anything that might suggest that you had committed the offence.
Note that at this point, your right to a lawyer is unlikely to have kicked in. In Singapore, an individual’s right to a lawyer arises only after a “reasonable time” after arrest. This is primarily to ensure that the police are able to carry out investigations without interference.
Nonetheless, as it remains unclear what a “reasonable time” is, you should make a request to speak to a lawyer. This is so that your intentions are at least made known to the police, and they may then allow you to engage a lawyer at an appropriate time.
Witness statements can be taken at any time during the police investigation. The procedural requirements of this statement are as follows:
The statement made by the person must be recorded in writing;
The statement must be read to him with interpretation if required; and
The statement must be signed by him.
Cautioned statements
The second type of statement taken is cautioned statements. This generally occurs after the arrest of the suspect and before they are formally charged in court.
The procedure regarding such statements is as such:
The investigating officer has to officially set out the charge the suspect is facing and explain it to him.
The suspect will then be asked if they wish to say anything regarding the charge.
The investigating officer will record anything that the suspect says from then on in answer to the charge, or any silence or refusal on the part of the suspect to make a statement.
The cautioned statement will have to be in writing and read back to the suspect, who will have to sign it. The suspect will also be given a copy of the statement.
If you are being interviewed as the suspect, it is important for you to state your defence when the cautioned statement is being taken. If you fail to do so and state your defence for the first time only at trial, the judge hearing the case may be less likely to believe you. This is especially if a material part of your defence had not been mentioned in the cautioned statement.
Police custody
As mentioned earlier, a suspect will be held in police custody upon arrest. Nonetheless, for an arrestable offence, an arrested person can be detained for only up to 48 hours in any event.
This means that if the police have not established that you have committed an offence by the end of 48 hours, you will be released. However, in the event where the police find later on that you may have committed an offence, you may then be brought to court or be released on bail pending further investigations.

Step 3: Gathering of Evidence
The next step involves the gathering of evidence to establish whether the alleged offence had been committed.
Search and seizure
The police may apply for a search warrant to search premises and seize property that may be connected to a criminal investigation in Singapore. There are two types of search warrants:
A general search warrant, which grants the executing officer broad discretion or authority to conduct a general search of an area and subsequently seize goods, property or documents found during the search; or
A specific search warrant, which allows the executing officer to search or inspect only the area(s) specified (by the court) in the search warrant.
Polygraph test
As part of investigations, the police may require a suspect to take a polygraph, or lie detector, test. During a polygraph test, you will be hooked up to the machine via various attachments to the chest and one hand and arm. You will then be asked a series of questions, and your physiological responses, such as breathing patterns, blood pressure, pulse and skin conductivity will be observed.
Note however that a polygraph test cannot be used as evidence against you in a criminal case. Instead, polygraph tests are typically considered by the authorities when they require more evidence to decide whether to recommend prosecution.
For example, if the police is unsure about whether or not you should be prosecuted, a failed polygraph test may lead them to conclude that you are likely to be guilty. Based on this, the police may then recommend prosecution.
Step 4: Referring the Matter to the AGC
After the police have collected information and made recommendations, the matter will be referred to the AGC for a public prosecutor to review the file. While the police play a crucial role in investigations, it is the public prosecutor who has the power to institute criminal proceedings.
There are a few possible outcomes following the review.
For instance, the prosecutor may decide to not charge the suspect, and instead, give a stern or conditional warning. The warning serves to deter an individual from committing offences in future. It is not a criminal conviction and has no legal effect. That said, records of stern and conditional warnings are maintained by the police.
Note also that a conditional warning comes with conditions that an individual would have to comply with. For example, an individual could be required to not commit any offence for a stipulated period of time. Otherwise, he/she may be prosecuted for the original offence and for any fresh offences committed.
Alternatively, the prosecutor may charge the suspect in court for the offence. This is when court proceedings would formally commence, and you, as the accused person, would have to decide, among other things, whether to claim trial or plead guilty. If you are convicted of the offence, you will then be sentenced accordingly.
How Long Does a Police Investigation Take in Singapore?
You might also wonder how long it takes for a police investigation to be completed. This ultimately depends on the complexity of investigations and the matter in question.
If the police are able to establish the offence quickly based on ample evidence gathered, for example, then the process is likely to take a much shorter time than a case that is lacking in evidence.

What is a Criminal Investigation?

Criminal investigations are usually conducted by police.
A criminal investigation is an official effort to uncover information about a crime. There are generally three ways that a person can be brought to justice for a criminal act. First, and probably the least likely, the individual will be driven by his conscience to immediately confess. Second, an officer of the law can catch him in the act. Third, and most common, a criminal investigation can identify him as suspect, after which he may confess or be convicted by trial.
In most cases, when a crime is committed, officials have two primary concerns. They want to know who committed the crime, and what the motive was. The reason why a person breaks a law is called the motive.
Criminal investigations are conducted to uncover information about a crime, such as a burglary.
The motive does not always come after identifying the perpetrator in a criminal investigation. Sometimes the motive is suspected or known and used to catch the criminal. This is often true with crimes such as kidnappings and murders. Notes or other forms of evidence may be left that reveal why the crime has been committed.
Criminal investigations are usually conducted by police. There are other official agencies that have the authority to investigate and launch criminal charges. In the United States, these include the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS ).

Police and other officials may use a variety of methods to conduct criminal investigations. Sometimes they work with their canine co-workers. They may also use various scientific techniques such as fingerprint and ballistics analysis.
Scientific techniques employed during a criminal investigation may include fingerprint analysis.
A controversial investigation method sometimes employed in the US is the use of informants. Many people disagree with this practice because these individuals are generally criminals who are looking to get out of trouble or to reduce their punishments. It is therefore argued that they can be influenced to say or do whatever will please those investigating the case.
Criminal investigations may be conducted by the FBI.
There are some parts of a criminal investigation that police may not be able to handle. Some cases require investigation techniques that demand specialized knowledge or training that the investigators or their colleagues may not have. This means that the police may have to employ others to help them. This is especially true with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. Although this technique is popular, it is often performed by third-parties.
Criminal investigations include work done at a crime scene.
A criminal investigation does not always yield results. Sometimes suspects are accused only for it to be determined later that they are not guilty. At other times, an extensive criminal investigation may not produce any suspects. This can mean that no one will be punished for the crime that was committed.

Police: Criminal Investigations
Criminal Investigation Defined
An investigation refers to the process of collecting information in order to reach some goal; for example, collecting information about the reliability and performance of a vehicle prior to purchase in order to enhance the likelihood of buying a good car. Applied to the criminal realm, a criminal investigation refers to the process of collecting information (or evidence) about a crime in order to: (1) determine if a crime has been committed; (2) identify the perpetrator; (3) apprehend the perpetrator; and (4) provide evidence to support a conviction in court. If the first three objectives are successfully attained, then the crime can be said to be solved. Several other outcomes such as recovering stolen property, deterring individuals from engaging in criminal behaviors, and satisfying crime victims have also been associated with the process.
A useful perspective on the criminal investigation process is provided by information theory (Willmer). According to information theory, the criminal investigation process resembles a battle between the police and the perpetrator over crime-related information. In committing the crime, the offender emits "signals," or leaves behind information of various sorts (fingerprints, eyewitness descriptions, murder weapon, etc.), which the police attempt to collect through investigative activities. If the perpetrator is able to minimize the amount of information available for the police to collect, or if the police are unable to recognize the information left behind, then the perpetrator will not be apprehended and therefore, the perpetrator will win the battle. If the police are able to collect a significant number of signals from the perpetrator, then the perpetrator will be identified and apprehended, and the police win. This perspective clearly underscores the importance of information in a criminal investigation.
The major problem for the police in conducting a criminal investigation is that not only is there potentially massive amounts of information available, but the relevance of the information is often unknown, the information is often incomplete, and the information is often inaccurate. Further, to be useful in proving guilt in court (where beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard), the evidence must have certain other qualities, and certain rules and procedures must be followed in collecting the evidence.

Alright, I have some information from these articles about how police investigate crimes. Let me try to organize this.

First, it seems like there are two main types of criminal investigations: reactive and proactive. Reactive investigations happen after a crime has been reported, while proactive investigations are more preventative, trying to stop crimes before they happen or as they're happening.

Reactive investigations seem to have a few key stages. It starts with someone reporting a crime, usually the victim. Then, police officers are sent to the scene. Their job is to secure the area, make sure everyone's safe, and start collecting evidence. If they can catch the perpetrator right there, they do. If not, they gather as much information as they can, talk to witnesses, and try to preserve any physical evidence.

After that, if the case seems serious enough or if there are clues that could lead to solving it, detectives might take over for a follow-up investigation. They look deeper into the evidence, interview more people, and try to build a case that can lead to an arrest.

Once they have enough evidence and identify a suspect, they can make an arrest. After that, the case goes to the prosecutors, who decide whether to press charges and handle the trial.

Proactive investigations sound different. They involve things like undercover operations, where police pose as buyers or victims to catch criminals in the act. There are also sting operations and decoy strategies. These are more about preventing crimes or catching criminals in the act, rather than solving crimes after they've happened.

Now, about the sources of information in investigations. It looks like there are several key sources:

1. Physical evidence: This is tangible stuff left at the crime scene, like fingerprints, blood, fibers, weapons, etc. This evidence often needs to be analyzed scientifically to be useful.

2. Witnesses: These are people who saw or heard something related to the crime. They can be primary witnesses who directly observed the crime, or secondary witnesses who have information about events before or after the crime.

3. Suspects: Interrogations of suspects can yield information, though they might not be truthful.

4. Other sources: Things like psychological profiling, crime analysis, and input from the general public through tips and programs like CrimeStoppers.

Each of these sources has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, physical evidence can be very reliable if handled properly, but it might not always lead directly to a suspect. Eyewitness testimony can be powerful but is also known to be unreliable at times.

I should also note that there are legal considerations throughout the investigation process. Police have to follow certain rules to collect evidence properly, and some methods, like interrogations and searches, require specific procedures to ensure that the evidence can be used in court.

Overall, it seems like a criminal investigation is a complex process that involves collecting and analyzing various types of information to identify, apprehend, and build a case against a perpetrator.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Police investigations involve reactive and proactive approaches. Reactive investigations follow a crime report, involving securing the scene, collecting evidence, and building a case through physical evidence and witness accounts. Proactive investigations aim to prevent crimes or catch offenders in the act through strategies like stings and decoys. Both methods require careful handling of evidence and adherence to legal procedures to ensure justice.}} \]
