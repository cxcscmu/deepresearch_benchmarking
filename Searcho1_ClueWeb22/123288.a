Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects seals. I don't know much about this topic off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should probably understand what climate change is and how it impacts the environment, especially in areas where seals live.

I know that climate change refers to long-term changes in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and lead to global warming, causing various environmental changes.

Seals are marine mammals, mostly found in cold water regions like the Arctic and Antarctic. So, their habitats are likely to be affected by climate change, particularly changes in sea ice, ocean temperatures, and food availability.

Let me think about sea ice first. Many seal species rely on sea ice for breeding, resting, and molting. For example, ringed seals create lairs in the snow and ice to protect their pups. If sea ice melts earlier or forms later due to warmer temperatures, it can disrupt their breeding cycles and expose pups to predation or harsh weather.

Also, changes in sea ice can affect the prey species that seals feed on, such as fish and crustaceans. If the ice melts, it can alter the distribution and abundance of these prey species, making it harder for seals to find food.

Moreover, warmer ocean temperatures can lead to changes in ocean currents and productivity, which could further impact the marine food web and seals' food sources.

I should also consider the potential effects on seal migration patterns. If their traditional habitats become less habitable due to climate change, seals might need to migrate to new areas, which could lead to competition with other species or exposure to new threats.

Another aspect is the impact of melting permafrost and rising sea levels on coastal habitats where some seal species may haul out or breed.

I think I need to look up specific examples or studies that illustrate these impacts. Maybe there are particular seal species that have been heavily affected by climate change already.

Let me consider the polar bear situation, which is often cited in discussions about Arctic climate change. Polar bears depend on sea ice to hunt seals, their main prey. As sea ice melts, polar bears have fewer opportunities to catch seals, leading to population declines. So, there's a direct link between climate change, sea ice loss, and the welfare of both seals and their predators.

Wait, but in that case, it's more about how climate change affects predators of seals rather than seals themselves. I need to focus on the seals.

I recall that some seal populations have been increasing in certain areas, perhaps due to reductions in hunting or other conservation efforts. But I wonder if climate change is offsetting those gains.

Maybe I should look into specific regions, like the Arctic or Antarctic, to see how seals are faring there.

Let me start by searching for information on how climate change affects seal habitats, particularly sea ice.

Summary:
The climate crisis is limiting the availability of krill -- small crustaceans that are vital in the marine food chain -- during summer in some areas of the Antarctica. This involves a decrease in the food abundance for female Antarctic fur seals in summer and a decrease in their reproductive success. Moreover, the predation of pups by the leopard seal has also increased due to a lower abundance of penguins, the main prey of this voracious Antarctic predator. However, the impact of the climate crisis on the Antarctic fur seal in winter has been ignored to date, when the cold, wind and ice make it harder to study the Antarctic ecosystems.
FULL STORY
The climate crisis is limiting the availability of krill -- small crustaceans that are vital in the marine food chain -- during summer in some areas of the Antarctica. This involves a decrease in the food abundance for female Antarctic fur seals in summer and a decrease in their reproductive success. Moreover, the predation of pups by the leopard seal has also increased due to a lower abundance of penguins, the main prey of this voracious Antarctic predator. However, the impact of the climate crisis on the Antarctic fur seal in winter has been ignored to date, when the cold, wind and ice make it harder to study the Antarctic ecosystems.
Thanks to satellite tracking, we know how this marine mammal is distributed over the winter months in the Antarctica, as well as its relationship with krill and the Antarctic icefield during this period, according to an article published in the journal Scientific Reports by the experts Lluís Cardona, Manel Gazo, David March, Massimiliano Drago and Diego Rita, from the Faculty of Biology and the Biodiversity Research Institute of the University of Barcelona (IRBio), and Mariluz Parga, from the SUBMON association.
How does the Antarctic fur seal adapt to global change?
The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazelle) -- a marine mammal that only lives in the Southern Ocean -- was intensively exploited by the fur industry during the first half of the 19th century. After a notable recovery, the populations of these pinnipeds are now regressing since 2003.
This predator feeds mainly from krill -- the Antarctic crustacean Euphasia superba -- and fish. Most of their breeding colonies are close to the Antarctic Polar Front but the South Shetland Islands -- surrounded by the polar icefield in winter -- host the most southern population of the species and the only Antarctic one. Now, the study provides answers to many doubts about the importance of environmental factors that regulate the distribution of this population in winter and their link to the ice cycle and krill.
The team conducted the research during the austral summer season of 2019 in the Antarctic research station Gabriel de Castilla, in Deception Island within the archipelago of the Southern Shetland Islands. In the study, the scientific monitoring via satellite tracking focused on juvenile and sub-adult males since they represent more than the 80% of the seals that remain in Antarctic waters during winter, while females leave the Antarctica during this period.
This occurs because during winter, when the breeding season is over, females leave the Southern Shetland Islands and move to warmer areas, near Southern Georgia islands and the South American continent. However, males remain in the Antarctic continent.
Juvenile and sub-adult individuals are those predominating the male populations, as stated in the study. In this species, the relatively late sexual maturity -- after seven years -- and high mortality in adults caused by the cost of defending a breeding area makes male adults to live few years and therefore the male population is skewed towards younger individuals. Female individuals reach sexual maturity when aged three and they undergo a lower adult mortality, so female adults are the most abundant ones.
"Males spend most of the winter time in the Antarctic Ocean, without going to the main land, and they preferentially select areas of less than 1000 meters deep, located about 200 kilometres from the ice borders and with high levels of chlorophyll and a surface temperature below 2ºC," notes Lluís Cardona, lecturer at the Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences and IRBio. "
This coincides with the favourite habitat of the Antarctic krill, the main prey of these otariids. Due to the seasonal dynamics of ice, the krill-friendly habitat moves north during winter and so do the fur seals. As winter progresses, krill migrate deeper into the water and males dive deeper to eat, sometimes up to 180 meters deep," continues Cardona, director of the Antarctic research project Flexseal within the study.
Males and females: an unequal fight for food
These different habitats occupied by males and females during the austral winter could be related to the sexual dimorphism of the species: adult females can reach 20-50 kg and adult males 140 kg. Juvenile and sub-adult males are even bulkier than females. This difference is a major determinant of their thermoregulatory skills and diving performance when adapting a new extreme environment and feed successfully.
"An increased body mass involves more capacity to store oxygen, which allows adult males to dive deeper when searching for food," notes Cardona.
The most important reproductive population of the Antarctic fur seal is in the South Georgia islands, the area that has shown the greatest abundance of krill in the summer during the last two decades. "When this food source decreases, fur seals increase their fish intake but the reproductive success decreases. Therefore, the species can survive without krill but the population of the Antarctic fur seal is less abundant, like in the Kerguelen Islands," says the expert.
Climate change and polar fauna: changes in the horizon
The climate crisis is altering the ecosystems of the Antarctic peninsula and the Southern Ocean. Surviving the global change successfully involves changes in the distribution, abundance and ecology of many species in polar latitudes.
In the context of global change, fur seal males and females are exposed to the environmental changes that affect the Antarctica during the austral summer. However, unlike males, females are also affected by the changes in those areas at latitude 40-50º in subantarctic latitudes.
In some colonies, the climate crisis causes a higher predation of pups by the leopard seal. "To adapt to the external changes, the colonies of the Antarctic fur seal should move south across the Antarctic peninsula, but this is an extremely slow process," notes Cardona.
Regarding the conservation of the Antarctic fur seal, "in the future, we will need to manage properly the krill fishing activities in these areas, and this will require to consider not only the female consumption during summer but also the consumption associated with males of all ages during the four seasons of the year," concludes the researcher.

Abstract
Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) have evolved life history strategies to exploit seasonal sea ice as a breeding platform. As such, individuals are prepared to deal with fluctuations in the quantity and quality of ice in their breeding areas. It remains unclear, however, how shifts in climate may affect seal populations. The present study assesses the effects of climate change on harp seals through three linked analyses. First, we tested the effects of short-term climate variability on young-of-the year harp seal mortality using a linear regression of sea ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence against stranding rates of dead harp seals in the region during 1992 to 2010. A similar regression of stranding rates and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index values was also conducted. These analyses revealed negative correlations between both ice cover and NAO conditions and seal mortality, indicating that lighter ice cover and lower NAO values result in higher mortality. A retrospective cross-correlation analysis of NAO conditions and sea ice cover from 1978 to 2011 revealed that NAO-related changes in sea ice may have contributed to the depletion of seals on the east coast of Canada during 1950 to 1972, and to their recovery during 1973 to 2000. This historical retrospective also reveals opposite links between neonatal mortality in harp seals in the Northeast Atlantic and NAO phase. Finally, an assessment of the long-term trends in sea ice cover in the breeding regions of harp seals across the entire North Atlantic during 1979 through 2011 using multiple linear regression models and mixed effects linear regression models revealed that sea ice cover in all harp seal breeding regions has been declining by as much as 6 percent per decade over the time series of available satellite data.

Introduction
We are currently witnessing significant changes in high latitude ecosystems, manifested most noticeably by rapid declines in the extent of summer ice, significant reductions in perennial ice cover, and declines in sea ice thickness in Arctic and Antarctic regions [1]. Some predictions indicate that annual circumpolar sea ice cover in the Arctic may decline by 20% by 2050 [2], with the possibility of ice-free summers by 2037 [3].
Rapid changes in temperature and ice conditions in Arctic ecosystems pose significant challenges for marine mammals that use sea ice as a platform for breeding and social activity (for reviews, see [4], [5] and [6] ). Research conducted to date has tended to focus on waning summer sea ice and the effects on Arctic marine mammals resulting from changes in marine productivity or habitat availability. Less attention has been paid to how changes in seasonal sea ice in adjacent sub-Arctic regions are changing over time. Perhaps most importantly, few studies actually assess the extent to which ice conditions are changing at the spatial and temporal scales relevant to sub-Arctic pinnipeds that rely on seasonal ice during the critical breeding period.
Harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) rely on seasonal sea ice as a substrate for pupping and nursing their young [7]. Harp seals have evolved to use transient sea ice as a breeding substrate and have adopted specific life history traits to succeed in this ephemeral environment, including a truncated nursing period (ca. 12 days) after which mothers wean their pups [7]. Despite this adaptation, significant changes in the quality and quantity of ice habitat, and the timing of ice availability for breeding seals may have serious consequences for their populations.
During winters, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the dominant pattern in climate variability across the North Atlantic, shaping environmental conditions from Canada to Russia [8]. The NAO index is calculated as the difference in atmospheric pressure between a subtropical high and a polar low [8]. Recent analyses of sea ice dynamics in the breeding habitats of harp seals have revealed that the NAO can greatly effect the quantity and quality of ice available to seals [9] and how persistent these habitats are during spring breakup [10], but no studies have explicitly linked changes in seasonal sea ice driven by NAO variability with effects on seal mortality. In years with reduced ice cover and rapid ice melting, harp seals reportedly suffer significant neonatal mortality [4], [11].
The purpose of the present study was threefold. First, we tested the hypothesis that light ice years in the Northwest Atlantic result in increased neonatal mortality of seals by regressing the number of recorded strandings of dead harp seal pups in the Northeastern United States [12] – an index of natural mortality – against ice cover values from the Gulf of St. Lawrence (the most proximate breeding region) and NAO index values. Building on this relationship, and the established links between ice cover and NAO conditions, we then conducted a retrospective cross-correlation analysis of sea ice and NAO conditions in two breeding regions of harp seals (Figure 1) to assess how changes in ice cover relate to historical observations of neonatal mortality and observed population trends. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that longer-term climate change is affecting the amount of sea ice in the breeding regions of harp seals using linear multiple regression models and linear mixed effects regression models that account for shorter-term variation in ice cover driven by the NAO.

This series of analyses allows us to 1) establish the links between ice cover, NAO conditions and patterns in first year seal mortality over time, 2) provide a novel perspective on previously observed changes in harp seal populations in relation to climate variability and 3) characterize the longer-term warming signal present in sea ice variability in the breeding regions of harp seals across the North Atlantic.
Methods
Study Region and Time Frame
To illustrate the recent links between sea ice cover and seal mortality, we used stranding data for dead harp seal pups extracted from the US Northeastern Region stranding dataset covering marine mammal strandings in the Northeastern US from 1993 to 2010 [12], [13]. We then compared these values with sea ice cover data from the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the same time period using linear regression techniques.
For the retrospective analysis of NAO conditions and sea ice, we considered patterns in sea ice cover in two breeding regions of harp seals – the Gulf of St. Lawrence in eastern Canada, and the White Sea region between Norway and Russia – in relation to historical variability in the NAO (Figure 1 ). These two locations represent the opposite ends of relationships between NAO and sea ice conditions established previously with a shorter time series [9]. We then compared these relationships within a retrospective assessment of published harp seal neonatal mortality data in these regions during 1940 to 2011 [11], [14].
We then conducted a wider examination of sea ice cover across all four breeding locations of harp seals (the above mentioned locations plus the Front off Newfoundland and the West Ice region in the Greenland Sea – see Figure 1) during 1978 to 2011 to assess longer-term trends in sea ice cover across the entire North Atlantic.
Satellite-derived measures of sea ice cover
We employed sea ice coverage data produced by the US National Sea Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado, for 1979 to 2011 during February and March, the breeding season of harp seals. These values were derived from NASA Nimbus-7 Scanning Multi-channel Microwave Radiometer (SSMR) data (1979–1987), Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data (satellites F8, F11, and F13 for 1987–2007 – see [15]) and DMSP F17 SSM/I data for 2009 through 2011 [16]. We used mean monthly ice coverages for both breeding sites for all years up to 2007, when the DMSP F13 satellite was lost, after which we used daily ice coverages and averaged the grid values to produce monthly means of sea ice concentration (%) in spatially-explicit harp seal breeding regions defined previously in [9].
North Atlantic Oscillation Indices
To assess historical changes in climate and sea ice conditions we used winter (December through March) NAO index values (Climate Analysis Section, NCAR, Boulder, USA, Hurrell 1995). These data are based on the difference of normalized sea level pressure between Lisbon, Portugal and Stykkisholmur/Reykjavik, Iceland since 1864.
Sea ice cover and seal mortality
The effects of changing ice conditions on seal neonatal mortality rates have not been investigated consistently over time, although previous studies indicate that when ice conditions are heavy mortality is generally low (e.g. 1.1–1.4%) [17], and when ice conditions are light it is much higher [11]. To establish current links between changing ice conditions and seal neonatal mortality, we conducted a linear regression of satellite-derived values of sea ice concentration in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during February against yearly stranding rates of dead young-of-the-year (YOY) harp seals in the Northeastern United States (JMP 8.0, SAS Institute) - as an index of natural mortality rates. Specifically, we used stranding network data for the northeastern US Atlantic coast (Maine to Rhode Island) from the Northeast Regional Office of NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service Marine Mammal Stranding Network during 1993 to 2010 [12], [13]. Since age class was not identified for many of the stranded animals, we calculated the distribution of standard length for identified YOY seals. We then tallied the number of stranded animals in the database whose lengths were less than 1 standard deviation over the mean length of this sample (year 1 animals) and regressed these data against ice cover for that year in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. A similar regression of NAO index values against stranding numbers of dead seals was also conducted to further link seal mortality with climate variability.
Linking NAO Index Values with Current and Historic Sea Ice Conditions
Satellite-derived values of sea ice concentration were employed to further assess the relationship between winter NAO values and sea ice concentrations identified previously in [10] and [9]. This represents an extension of 5 years to previous time series analyses of ice in the breeding regions of harp seals. We visualized the general trajectory of this time series by fitting a smoothing spline to winter NAO index values using JMP Ver 8.0 (SAS Institute). To confirm previously established linkages between NAO phase and ice conditions, we then conducted a cross-correlation analysis on the NAO and sea ice time series (1979 to 2011) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the White Sea breeding regions using JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute). This analysis provides for strong inference on ice conditions in both locations over the extended historical NAO time series.
Long-term trends of sea ice in harp seal breeding habitats
To investigate the interaction of the NAO with long term trends in ice concentration we initially constructed 3-dimensional wire plots of multiple linear regressions of sea ice concentration against NAO index value, and year for all four breeding regions using the lattice package in R [18]. We statistically assessed ice concentration trends in all four harp seal breeding regions for the months of February and March by fitting a linear mixed effects regression model for each month using the lme4 package in R [19]. These two models included year as a fixed effect and to account for variation caused by the NAO within each region, monthly NAO index values were used as random effects with regions as a grouping factor where: Mixed effects models are advantageous in that they allow modeling and forecasting of non-stationary changes inherent in climate data through the inclusion of predictors as fixed or random effect variables [20].
Results
A total of 365 dead harp seals specifically identified and reported as YOY animals stranded in the Northeastern US during 1993 to 2010. The distribution of standard lengths was normal (Shapiro-Wilk test, p>0.05) and the mean length of YOY animals was 105 cm with a SD of 9.5 cm. Using the upper range of lengths (115 cm) and avoiding animals listed specifically as sub-adults regardless of standard length, we then identified a total of 693 YOY seals in the stranding database and extracted these records for linear regression modeling. The linear regression of seal strandings against ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (the most proximate breeding location) is presented in Figure 2 (A). The regression model revealed a strong negative correlation between ice cover and stranding rates (n = 18, p = 0.008, r 2  = 0.37), where lighter ice conditions correlate with increased numbers of stranded dead seals. The regression of NAO index values and seal mortality (Figure 2 B) revealed a similar but less robust relationship (n = 18, p = 0.09, r 2  = 0.16). See Table 1 for details on both ice cover and NAO regressions.

As predicted, eastern North Atlantic sea ice cover and NAO conditions were out of phase – with heavier ice cover during negative NAO periods and lighter ice cover during positive NAO periods. In contrast, western North Atlantic ice conditions were in phase with NAO conditions – with heavier ice cover during positive NAO conditions and lighter ice cover during negative NAO periods.

The general trajectory of the winter NAO index from 1865 to 2011 is illustrated in Figure 3 (B). During 1949 to 1973, the winter NAO index was consistently negative. During this period ice conditions were heavy in the western North Atlantic, and light in the Northeast Atlantic. Following this, there was an extended positive period of winter NAO averages during 1974 to 2004. Ice conditions in the Northeast Atlantic were light during this period, and heavy ice conditions prevailed during this time in the Northwest Atlantic. These general relationships have been partially described previously [9], [10]. Subsequent to 2004, it appears that neutral to negative winter NAO indices have become dominant (Figure 3 B ).
A series of three-dimensional wire plots that display the linear relationships between sea ice cover in harp seal breeding regions during the month of February as a function of NAO index over our entire time series (1979 to 2011) are presented in Figure 4. The results for March showed similar but less extreme declines of sea ice concentration over time. Both multiple regression models (February and March) were significant (p<0.05), and year was a significant predictor for sea ice concentration in February (p<0.05) and approached significance for March (p = 0.08). The multiple r-squared values for these regressions were low (0.12 and 0.09, for February and March respectively) due to variation in NAO effects on ice cover. These plots are useful, however, as they graphically illustrate the general relationships between sea ice cover and NAO conditions revealed by our mixed effects regression models.

The results of our mixed effects models reveal a statistically significant annual decline of sea ice cover in all four breeding regions during the study period, regardless of variation in NAO conditions. Both monthly model coefficients were significant at the 95% percent confidence interval. February ice concentration declined at a rate of 0.63±0.12% per year from 1979 to 2011 (table 1 ). The model for March revealed a smaller annual decline of 0.41±0.13% over the same time span (Table 2 ). Group level effects fell in line with expected values for each region (Table 3 ), although the influence of the NAO on ice in the West Ice region was negligible.

Discussion
Short-term Climate Variability
The linear regressions of ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and NAO index values against stranding rates of YOY seals in the Northeastern US provide a useful proxy for changes in seal mortality associated with reductions in ice cover driven by NAO variability in the Northwestern Atlantic. Strandings data from the same region have been used previously to assess spatial patterns in stranding rates of ice seals [12], as well as to assess patterns in neonatal mortality rates of right whales (Eubaleana glacialis) in the same region [21]. Indeed, large scale assessments of stranding data in relation to visual survey data from several countries indicate that assessments of stranding rates often outperform visual surveys in determining local diversity, and they are extremely useful for studying spatial and temporal ecology of marine mammal populations, especially for time series greater than 10 years [13]. Our regressions reveal that an increase in first year seal mortality occurs in years with lighter ice cover and lower NAO index values, consistent with earlier qualitative observations reported in the literature [10], [11], [12].
North Atlantic Oscillation conditions greatly affect sea ice dynamics in harp seal breeding regions. When the winter NAO is negative, sea ice cover tends to be below average in the breeding locations of harp seals on the east coast of Canada and this has contributed to significant mortality of neonatal harp seals through a combination of interrupted nursing, starvation, cold stress and crushing by shifting floes when prematurely forced into the water by the rapid melting and break-up of ice [11].
While natural mortality rates for this population (or indeed for any other population of ice seals) have not been produced for the range of ice/NAO conditions captured by our times series, our linear regression of ice cover and stranded dead harp seals in the Northeastern US provides further evidence that young harp seals fare poorly in light ice years.
This is not a recent phenomenon. For example, harp seals were forced to prematurely vacate whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the winter of 1966 [11], a strongly negative NAO year. Ice records indicate that 1966 was a light ice year in eastern Canada [11] and the station-based NAO index value for this year was −1.86. In 1969 the winter NAO value was also strongly negative (−4.89) and sea ice cover in the Gulf of St. Lawrence was the lowest on record [10]. During this year thousands of seals were crushed in moving ice, or were prematurely forced to vacate whelping patches during rapid ice breakup [11]. In 1998 and 1999, both years with low winter NAO indices and light ice conditions, thousands of dead seals washed ashore on the beaches of Cape Breton [22]. Light ice conditions have been observed during 11 of the past 14 years (1996–2011) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and many of these years exhibit significant negative winter NAO anomalies and in many cases high seal mortality [23]. Indeed, in recent years (1996 onwards) the winter NAO has exhibited a greater number of neutral and negative periods (Figure 2 A ), indicating that a switch to a more consistently negative phase - as seen in the 1950s through the 1970s - may be occurring.
Harp seals numbers now appear to be plateauing in the Northwest Atlantic off eastern Canada [24], concomitant with a downward trend in NAO indices and increasingly light ice conditions during 1996 to 2010. In recent years neonatal mortality has been extremely high, and potentially resulted in the loss of entire year classes in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence [4], [23]. The second latest year in our time series (2010) is no exception to this link between NAO index, ice conditions and neonatal mortality. In that year, the winter NAO index value dropped to −4.64, ice conditions were the lightest in the satellite record in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and harp seal neonatal mortality reportedly approached 100% in this region [4].
A Novel Perspective on Fluctuating Harp Seal Populations
There have been dramatic changes in the trajectory of harp seal populations across the North Atlantic over time, and these fluctuations have never been fully explained. Several hypotheses have been offered to explain fluctuations in harp seal abundance across the Atlantic during our study period, including overexploitation, by-catches and changes in prey availability [14], [25]. However, none have addressed climate-related changes in breeding habitat as a significant source of mortality.
A large reduction in harp seal abundance in the Northwest Atlantic occurred during the 1950s through the early 1970s, with estimates ranging between 50 and 66% declines in seal numbers [11], [26]. Our retrospective assessment reveals that during this period the NAO was consistently negative (Figure 2 A ). As sea ice conditions in the Northwest Atlantic are in phase with NAO conditions (Figure 1 ), this period of time would have exhibited consistently light ice conditions. Our retrospective analysis also reveals that 1973 to 2000 was period of consistently positive NAO conditions (Figure 2 A ), during which sea ice conditions in the Northwest Atlantic would have been heavy and more conducive to successful reproduction in harp seals. During this period the Northwest Atlantic harp seal population grew consistently, with estimates surpassing 5 million animals [24].
Contrary to the above relationship in the Northwest Atlantic, sea ice conditions in the Northeast Atlantic (White Sea) are out of phase with the NAO (Figure 1 A ); during positive NAO periods sea ice conditions tend to be light [9]. Harp seals in the Northeast Atlantic declined from approximately 1.5 million seals in the early 1950s to 500,000 in the early 1960s [14]. After this, the population recovered to approximately 800,000 by 1978 [14]. Soon thereafter, survival of neonatal harp seals in the Northeast Atlantic declined, and remained low until the early 1990s. In particular, neonatal mortality during 1986, 1987 and 1988 was extremely high, resulting in an almost complete absence of these year classes when sampled in the 1990s [14]. The period of increasing neonatal recruitment and abundance in Northeast Atlantic harp seals (1960 to 1973) corresponds with the extended negative NAO regime (Figure 2 A) during which sea ice cover was at or above average conditions in the Barents/White Sea region [9]. The period of decreasing recruitment in these animals (1982 to 1992) corresponds with the extended positive NAO regime (Figure 2 A) during which sea ice conditions were in decline or light [9].
Hunting mortality may also affect the population dynamics of harp seals across the Atlantic, especially when viewed as a cumulative stressor on reproductive output of a population. Harp seals are hunted commercially and for subsistence purposes across their range. In the Northwest Atlantic, total landed catches of harp seals during the extended negative NAO regime (1950 to 1972) were relatively high – ranging up to 389,410 seals annually. This hunt focused on newborn whitecoat pups [7]. Landed catches were smaller during the first part of the extended positive NAO regime (1973 to 1982), ranging up to 202,169 seals. However, from 1983 to 1995, catches dropped further to a maximum 94,046 seals per year and the focus of the hunt shifted from whitecoats to older, moulted pups (beaters, aged about 3 weeks to 3 months). Catches increased again during 1996 to 2005, ranging up to 365,971 seals [27]. It should be noted that in some regions the magnitude of hunting mortality has been lower than the level of natural mortality reported in poor ice years, when virtually all pups born (e.g. southern Gulf of St. Lawrence) have reportedly died [4].
The results of our retrospective analysis reveal that harp seal populations across the Atlantic appear to have fluctuated in synchrony with NAO trends and associated ice conditions. As such, we hypothesize that changing ice conditions may have contributed to the population dynamics of harp seals across the North Atlantic, most likely through periods of sustained reproductive failure or success, coupled with hunting and other environmental factors. Further research is required to assess how combinations of removals by sealers and recent (1996 to 2011) ice-induced increases in neonatal mortality will affect current and future harp seal populations.
Long-term Sea Ice Trends in harp seal breeding locations
Our mixed-effects model effectively extracts the long-term warming signal from our time series of sea ice cover values that is dominated by NAO variability. Our model indicates that sea ice in all harp seal breeding regions is in decline regardless of the influence of the NAO, at a rate of approximately 6% per decade in February, and 4% per decade in March (this lower rate of decline likely stems from the fact that the majority of sea ice loss happens in February). This overall decline is less dramatic than recently observed conditions in eastern Canada (2000 to 2010), and it appears that the large scale effects of recent warming at high latitudes may have been obscured in the Northwest Atlantic in part by the effects of a consistently positive winter NAO regime on seasonal sea ice development and persistence during 1980 to 2000.
Our results are the first to illustrate that ice cover in the breeding habitats for harp seals across the North Atlantic has been in decline since the beginning of the satellite record of ice conditions (1979). Along with observed increases in YOY mortality in the Northwest Atlantic harp seal herds indicated above, the consistent decline in seasonal sea ice cover across the North Atlantic has also resulted in a recent sharp reduction in pup production in the White Sea harp seal population [28].
Recent records of harp seals whelping off East Greenland (the West Ice) indicate that some response of the animals to phenological shifts in breeding habitat due to warming may be occurring [4], [29]. In the Northwest Atlantic, however, it appears that many seals have been returning to traditional breeding grounds in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the Front, off Newfoundland, regardless of ice conditions. This observation may reflect a lack of plasticity in their breeding system, which has likely evolved in response to a combination of factors including photoperiod [30], predation pressure [7], [31] and the long-term predictability of sea ice in traditional breeding regions. Further research is required to assess the timing of ice breakup and parturition patterns to determine how harp seals are responding to rapid warming in their breeding regions. It should also be noted that fitted values from mixed effects regression models are generally considered conservative estimates. This is referred to as the “shrinkage effect” [32]. In light of this, our model may underestimate total ice decline in the breeding regions of harp seals over the time of our study.
Harp seals have evolved to use seasonal sea ice as a breeding substrate and have adopted specific life history traits to succeed in this environment. Considering this, they are well suited to deal with natural shifts in climate, including the effects of the NAO on sea ice conditions. However, these animals may not be well adapted to absorb the cumulative effects of human influences (primarily hunting and to a lesser extent by-catch – which can be high in some years [33], [34] ), short-term climate variability and global warming. Other ice-associated seals are also likely to be vulnerable to these combined effects, and share many of the breeding regions and life history traits of harp seals. In particular, hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) may be especially at risk. The Northwest Atlantic stock appears to be stable at present, but the Northeast Atlantic stock, which breeds on the West Ice, off the east coast of Greenland, has declined by 85–90% over the last 40–60 years, prompting a listing of this species as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species [35].

Seal Conservation

Many seal species depend on sea ice for their survival. As global climate change reduces the extent, duration, and thickness of sea ice, these seal species are threatened with extinction.
As global warming worsens, the (un)natural mortality rate of the harp seals worsens, too. Harp seal mothers need large, sturdy ice floes to give birth to their pups since pups do not know how to swim for the first few weeks of their lives.
The 21st century has seen year after year of poor ice, sometimes leading to the drowning of almost all seal pups born in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the main nurseries for harp seals.
In 2016, this ice report was provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), a U.S. agency supported by NASA, NSF, NOAA, and other government agencies:
"Arctic sea ice extent during January averaged 13.53 million square kilometers (5.2 million square miles), which is 1.04 million square kilometers (402,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average. This was the lowest January extent in the satellite record, 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) below the previous record January low that occurred in 2011. This was largely driven by unusually low ice coverage in the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, and the East Greenland Sea on the Atlantic side, and below average conditions in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. Ice conditions were near average in Baffin Bay, the Labrador Sea and Hudson Bay. There was also less ice than usual in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, an important habitat for harp seals."
Other ice seals threateded by climate change include bearded seals and ringed seals. Both species are now listed as threatened in the U.S., due to the threat of climate change to their survival.
Canada's Seal Slaughter vs the Precautionary Principle
Poor sea ice is taking a toll on the seal pups

Even though harp seals are ice seals, that is, they are dependent on thick, large floes of sea ice for whelping, and such floes are decreasing due to climate change, the Canadian government maintains high kill quotas of 400,000 harp seals.
In 2017, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society observed the seals in the pupping season and concluded that, at least some harp seal mothers have delayed implantation to give birth later, in the hope of finding better sea ice floes.
Instead of finding improved pupping conditions, harp seal mothers found the Gulf of St. Lawrence nearly free of ice. Only a few patches of suitable ice could be found in the Gulf, few harp seal pups were seen in the region, and some pups were still in the whitecoat stage later than normal.
The Precautionary Principle of wildlife management, to which Canada claims to adhere, requires that the government avoid policies that may  jeopardize the future of the species, taking the more conservative approach to management, whenever there is uncertainty about how a management policy will affect the population.
According to the DFO's own scientists, M.O. Hammill and G.B. Stenson, "Over the last decade, we have incorporated a level of ice-related mortality into the assessment, but this has been based on expert opinion, with little attempt to define more rigorous parameters." (Changes in ice conditions and potential impact on harp seal pupping, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Research Document 2014/025, August 2014)
Call on the Trudeau government to abide by the Precautionary Principle and ban sealing in Canada.

Seals of the Arctic
Six seal species live in the Arctic region: bearded seals, harp seals, hooded seals, ribbon seals, ringed seals, and spotted seals. Bearded seals, harp seals, and ringed seals are especially vulnerable to disappearing sea ice.
Bearded seals and ringed seals give birth on dense ice packs or on "fast ice", ice usually located over shallow parts of the ocean that is 'fastened' to the ocean floor or shore, such that it does not drift in the wind. They also require snow cover on the ice to build lairs for giving birth.

Harp seals follow the sea ice all year, migrating south from the Arctic  in the spring. The seals give birth off the coast of Norway and Newfoundland and Labrador, in Russia's White Sea, and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence of Canada. The pups begin life unable to swim. Thus they require sturdy sea ice during the birthing season in February and March.
In recent years, thousands of harp seal pups have drowned due to insufficient and broken up sea ice. Unusually poor ice conditions have been reported in 2006, 2007,  and almost each year from 2010 on.

In 2011, the ice floes were in very poor condition. The February 2011 ice cover was the worst in recorded history, but this did not stop the Canadian government (i.e., the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, DFO, led by Minister Gail Shea) from setting an astronomical quota on the killing of harp seal pups.
In the end, a fraction of these seals were killed as a result of the closing of pelt markets.

NOAA Fisheries lists ice seals as threatened, endangered

After two years of study and public comment, the U.S. agency, NOAA fisheries, announced that it was listing four subspecies of ringed seals and two distinct population segments of bearded seals under the Endangered Species Act.
NOAA will list the Beringia and Okhotsk distinct population segments of bearded seals and the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies of ringed seals as threatened. It will list the Ladoga subspecies of ringed seals as endangered.
The reasons NOAA cites for the listings are
• Under the ESA, a threatened species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. An endangered species is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
• Ringed and bearded seals are particularly dependent upon ice and snow for survival. Many aspects of the ringed and bearded seal’s life cycles depend on the availability of suitable ice, and for ringed seals snow cover, at the right time of the year in areas with sufficient food.
• Climate models consistently project diminishing ice and snow cover at least through the current century, with regional variation in the timing and severity of those losses.
• Although ringed and bearded seals are currently numerous in Alaska, NMFS has concluded that the changes in ice, and for ringed seals snow cover, are likely to lead to population declines in the foreseeable future and pose significant long-term threats to the persistence of these seals.
Contrast this with the actions of the Canadian government in managing the ice seals (i.e., harp seals) in its waters: instead of designating the species as protected, it spends millions of taxpayer dollars to massacre the seals.
Seals of the Antarctic
A Weddell seal
Six  seal species live in the Antarctic: Antarctic fur seals, crabeater seals, elephant seals, leopard seals, Ross seals, and Weddell seals.
Crabeater seals, leopard seals, Ross seals, and Weddell seals give birth on sea ice and are thus at risk of exctinction as temperatures warm and the formation of sturdy sea ice becomes less reliable.
As the chart below, from NOAA, shows, Antarctica is losing ice mass at a disturbing rate. Click on the image for a larger view.
In the 1800's and 1900's explorers found large populations of seals in Antarctica. Sealers then proceeded to kill so many seals that populations of some of these species, including the Antarctic fur seal, were driven nearly to extinction. Today these seals are no longer exploited, and their populations have increased.

Other threats to the survival of seals
In addition to the lack of sea ice, some species of seals and other marine mammals are threatened by reductions in the availability of prey. Prey populations are affected by climate change and shorter-term climate effects like El Niño, over-fishing, and ocean pollution. A reduction in the abundance of plankton affects life up the food chain.
Click here for  additional information and a pictorial description of predator-prey effects with grey seals.
Seals are victims of the fishing industry in other ways, too. Seals are injured and die from entanglement in fishing gear. Sometimes, they  are shot by fishermen who consider them a nuisance or competitor.
Seals and sea lions of the United States
Sea lions are also pinnipeds and are in the same family as Cape fur seals. In the U.S., sea lions have been designated as threats to salmon and have been targeted for killing and relocated to zoos by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Read more about this controversy here.
Sea lions and seals in the U.S. have suffered from starvation in large numbers in recent years. This is due to prey migration due to climate change and El Niño. Pollution and toxic algal blooms that result from warming also have sickened and killed seals and sea lions.
Seals are an important part of the ocean ecosystem
Seal conservation is about far more than saving seals and stopping the Canadian seal slaughter. It is about saving marine ecosystems, of which all seals are an integral part.
Historical records from the time Europeans arrived in Newfoundland demonstrate that, without interference from these immigrants,  seal populations much larger than that remaining today coexisted with cod so abundant that ships had difficulty maneuvering through the waters.
Today, conservation issues in the Arctic and North Atlantic region include the effects of large-scale commercial fishing, using such methods as bottom trawling and long-line fishing; global climate change, including changes in ocean currents, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature; increased ship traffic as a result of decreases in sea ice; ocean pollution; and sealing.

How does the climate crisis affect the Antarctic fur seal?

How does the climate crisis affect the Antarctic fur seal?
by University of Barcelona

The climate crisis is limiting the availability of krill—small crustaceans that are vital in the marine food chain—during summer in some areas of the Antarctica. This involves a decrease in the food abundance for female Antarctic fur seals in summer and a decrease in their reproductive success. Moreover, the predation of pups by the leopard seal has also increased due to a lower abundance of penguins, the main prey of this voracious Antarctic predator. However, the impact of the climate crisis on the Antarctic fur seal in winter has been ignored to date, when the cold, wind and ice make it harder to study the Antarctic ecosystems.
Thanks to satellite tracking, we know how this marine mammal is distributed over the winter months in the Antarctica, as well as its relationship with krill and the Antarctic icefield during this period, according to an article published in the journal Scientific Reports by the experts Lluís Cardona, Manel Gazo, David March, Massimiliano Drago and Diego Rita, from the Faculty of Biology and the Biodiversity Research Institute of the UB (IRBio), and Mariluz Parga, from the SUBMON association.
How does the Antarctic fur seal adapt to global change?
The Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazelle)—a marine mammal that only lives in the Southern Ocean—was intensively exploited by the fur industry during the first half of the 19th century. After a notable recovery, the populations of these pinnipeds are now regressing since 2003.
This predator feeds mainly from krill—the Antarctic crustacean Euphasia superba—and fish. Most of their breeding colonies are close to the Antarctic Polar Front, but the South Shetland Islands—surrounded by the polar icefield in winter—host the most southern population of the species and the only Antarctic one. Now, the study provides answers to many doubts about the importance of environmental factors that regulate the distribution of this population in winter and their link to the ice cycle and krill.
The team conducted the research during the austral summer season of 2019 in the Antarctic research station Gabriel de Castilla, in Deception Island within the archipelago of the Southern Shetland Islands. In the study, the scientific monitoring via satellite tracking focused on juvenile and sub-adult males since they represent more than the 80% of the seals that remain in Antarctic waters during winter, while females leave the Antarctica during this period.
This occurs because during winter, when the breeding season is over, females leave the Southern Shetland Islands and move to warmer areas, near Southern Georgia islands and the South American continent. However, males remain in the Antarctic continent.
Juvenile and sub-adult individuals are those predominating the male populations, as stated in the study. In this species, the relatively late sexual maturity—after seven years—and high mortality in adults caused by the cost of defending a breeding area makes male adults live only for a few years, and therefore the male population is skewed towards younger individuals. Female individuals reach sexual maturity when aged three, and they undergo a lower adult mortality, so female adults are the most abundant ones.
"Males spend most of the winter time in the Antarctic Ocean, without going to the mainland, and they preferentially select areas of less than 1000 meters deep, located about 200 kilometers from the ice borders and with high levels of chlorophyll and a surface temperature below 2º C," notes Lluís Cardona, lecturer at the Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences and IRBio. "
This coincides with the favorite habitat of the Antarctic krill, the main prey of these otariids. Due to the seasonal dynamics of ice, the krill-friendly habitat moves north during winter and so do the fur seals. As winter progresses, krill migrate deeper into the water and males dive deeper to eat, sometimes up to 180 meters deep," continues Cardona, director of the Antarctic research project Flexseal within the study.

Males and females: An unequal fight for food
These different habitats occupied by males and females during the austral winter could be related to the sexual dimorphism of the species: Adult females can reach 20-50 kg and adult males 140 kg. Juvenile and sub-adult males are even bulkier than females. This difference is a major determinant of their thermoregulatory skills and diving performance when adapting a new extreme environment and feed successfully.
"An increased body mass involves more capacity to store oxygen, which allows adult males to dive deeper when searching for food ," notes Cardona.
The most important reproductive population of the Antarctic fur seal is in the South Georgia islands, the area that has shown the greatest abundance of krill in the summer during the last two decades. "When this food source decreases, fur seals increase their fish intake but the reproductive success decreases. Therefore, the species can survive without krill but the population of the Antarctic fur seal is less abundant, like in the Kerguelen Islands," says the expert.
Climate change and polar fauna: Changes in the horizon
The climate crisis is altering the ecosystems of the Antarctic peninsula and the Southern Ocean. Surviving the global change successfully involves changes in the distribution, abundance and ecology of many species in polar latitudes.
In the context of global change, fur seal males and females are exposed to the environmental changes that affect the Antarctica during the austral summer. However, unlike males, females are also affected by the changes in those areas at latitude 40-50º in subantarctic latitudes.
In some colonies, the climate crisis causes a higher predation of pups by the leopard seal. "To adapt to the external changes, the colonies of the Antarctic fur seal should move south across the Antarctic peninsula, but this is an extremely slow process," notes Cardona.
Regarding the conservation of the Antarctic fur seal, "In the future, we will need to manage properly the krill fishing activities in these areas, and this will require to consider not only the female consumption during summer but also the consumption associated with males of all ages during the four seasons of the year," concludes the researcher.

3.  A reduction in habitat for arctic seals will reduce the population of arctic seals. This will reduce the capture efficiency for killer whales preying on arctic seals because there will be fewer to capture. A reduction in habitat for arctic seals will lower the carrying capacity for arctic seals because there is less habitat. A reduction in arctic seals, the food for killer whales, will reduce the carrying capacity for killer whales, unless there is a substitute source of food.
4. If there is another source of food for killer whales, the population of killer whales will probably remain the same, if they were at their carrying capacity and their habitat remains the same. If there is another source of food for killer whales, the population of arctic seals will still decrease, because the habitat for arctic seals has decreased, and habitat is independent of predator population.
5.  The seal and killer whale populations represent a peak graph. More than likely, as seal populations increase, killer whale populations will also increase until there are more killer whales and they are eating all the seals. Then, there will be a period when killer whales are dying of starvation, so their population will decline. When killer whale populations decline, there are fewer whales to eat the seals, so the seal population increases, providing lots of food for the whales. The whales increase their population which decreases seal population and the pattern continues.
6.  There are many limitations on any simulation. The computer only uses the parameters in the program, so changes in ocean temperature, weather patterns, salinity changes, food supply, habitat, interaction with other species and presence of plants and zooplankton are not considered. All of those can change and change the results.

Alright, I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they say about how climate change affects seals.

First, there's a ScienceDaily article about how climate change affects Antarctic fur seals. It mentions that climate change is limiting the availability of krill, which are small crustaceans that are a major food source for many marine animals, including seals. So, if there's less krill, that directly affects the food supply for seals.

The article also talks about how changes in sea ice affect seal habitats. Seals rely on sea ice for breeding, resting, and molting. If the sea ice melts earlier or forms later due to warmer temperatures, it can disrupt their breeding cycles and make it harder for them to raise their pups.

Additionally, the reduction in sea ice can lead to changes in the distribution and abundance of prey species, like fish and crustaceans, which seals feed on. Warmer ocean temperatures can alter ocean currents and productivity, further impacting the food web.

Another point is that climate change might force seals to migrate to new areas, which could lead to competition with other species or exposure to new threats. For example, if seals move into areas where they're not typically found, they might face predators they're not adapted to deal with.

The second article is from PLOS ONE and focuses on harp seals and how climate change affects them through changes in sea ice cover. It shows that lighter ice years correlate with higher neonatal mortality in harp seals. So, when there's less sea ice, more seal pups die.

The study also looks at the relationship between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and sea ice cover. The NAO is a climate pattern that affects weather and sea ice conditions in the North Atlantic. The research suggests that negative NAO phases lead to heavier ice cover, which is better for seal survival, while positive NAO phases lead to lighter ice cover and higher seal mortality.

The third document is from harpseals.org, which discusses how climate change is threatening seal species that depend on sea ice, like harp seals, bearded seals, and ringed seals. It mentions that poor sea ice conditions are leading to higher pup mortality because the ice isn't stable enough for seals to give birth and raise their young.

The site also criticizes the Canadian government for maintaining high hunting quotas for harp seals despite the challenges they face from climate change. It calls for a ban on sealing in Canada, arguing that it's inconsistent with the precautionary principle of wildlife management.

The fourth article is from Phys.org and discusses how climate change affects Antarctic fur seals. It reiterates the points about krill availability and sea ice habitat, emphasizing that these changes impact seal feeding and breeding success.

Finally, there's a Brainly.com post where a student is asking questions about how climate change affects seals and killer whales in the Arctic. The answer provided there explains that reduced seal habitat leads to lower seal populations, which in turn affects the killer whales that prey on them. It also discusses how the ecosystem could shift if killer whales find alternative prey.

So, summarizing all this information, climate change affects seals primarily through:

1. **Reduced Sea Ice Habitat:** Seals rely on sea ice for breeding, resting, and molting. Melting ice due to warmer temperatures disrupts these activities and can lead to higher pup mortality.

2. **Decreased Prey Availability:** Krill and other prey species that seals feed on are affected by changes in ocean temperatures and ice cover. Reduced krill populations directly impact seals' food supply.

3. **Altered Migration Patterns:** As habitats change, seals may need to migrate to new areas, which can lead to competition with other species or exposure to new predators.

4. **Increased Predation:** With changes in habitat and prey availability, predators like killer whales may have to adjust their hunting strategies, potentially leading to increased predation on seals.

Overall, these impacts can lead to declines in seal populations and disruptions in the marine food web.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change affects seals by reducing their sea ice habitat, decreasing prey availability, altering migration patterns, and increasing predation, leading to declines in seal populations and disruptions in marine ecosystems.}} \]
