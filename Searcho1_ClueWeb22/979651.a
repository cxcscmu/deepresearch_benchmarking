So I'm trying to understand why homelessness is considered a problem. At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward—people don't have homes, which must be bad. But I think there's more to it than that. Maybe I should try to look into this a bit deeper.

Let me start by trying to define what homelessness is. From what I know, homelessness refers to people who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. That means they don't have a stable place to live, and often end up sleeping on the streets, in shelters, or in other temporary accommodations.

Now, why is this a problem? Well, for one, housing is a basic human need. Maslow's hierarchy of needs places shelter right at the bottom, meaning it's fundamental for survival. Without a home, people can't protect themselves from the elements, can't store their belongings securely, and can't have a private space to rest and recharge. That seems like a pretty big issue.

But beyond just the immediate needs, homelessness can lead to a whole host of other problems. For example, people without homes might have difficulty maintaining good health. They may not have access to clean water, sanitation facilities, or regular medical care. This can make them more susceptible to diseases and health issues.

Moreover, homelessness can affect mental health. Living on the streets can be stressful, dangerous, and isolating. People might experience trauma, anxiety, or depression as a result. It's a vicious cycle because mental health issues can also be a cause of homelessness in some cases.

Education is another area where homelessness can create problems. Children and youth who are homeless often struggle in school due to instability, lack of resources, and the stress of their situation. This can hinder their ability to learn and achieve their full potential.

Employment is yet another challenge. Without a stable address or a place to keep clean clothes and take care of personal hygiene, finding and keeping a job can be difficult. Employers may prefer candidates who have a permanent address, and the lack of these basics can put homeless individuals at a disadvantage.

Also, homelessness can strain public services. Cities might have to allocate more resources to manage encampments, provide emergency services, and address the various needs of homeless populations. This can be costly and may divert funds from other important areas like education, infrastructure, or social programs.

Furthermore, homelessness can impact community safety and quality of life. Some people might feel unsafe around homeless individuals, leading to tensions and conflicts. There can also be issues with public spaces being used for sleeping or storing belongings, which might not be acceptable to everyone.

I think it's also important to consider the root causes of homelessness. In many places, it's linked to poverty, lack of affordable housing, mental illness, substance abuse, and systemic inequalities. Addressing homelessness requires tackling these underlying issues, which can be complex and require comprehensive solutions.

Perhaps I should look into some statistics to get a better sense of the scale of the problem. I remember hearing about homelessness being a growing issue in many cities around the world, but I don't have concrete numbers to back that up.

Let me try to find some data on homelessness. Maybe I can search for global homelessness statistics or look into specific countries to see how widespread the issue is.

Global Homelessness Statistics - Homeless World Cup
GLOBAL HOMELESSNESS STATISTICS
To help our supporters better understand this global problem, we have sought to compile the latest available statistics on the challenges faced by people around the globe.
The last time a global survey was attempted – by the United Nations in 2005 – an estimated 100 million people were homeless worldwide. As many as 1.6 billion people lacked adequate housing (Habitat, 2015 ).
Getting an accurate picture of global homelessness is extremely challenging. Definitions of homelessness vary from country to country. Census data is typically collected based on household and, while most census data takes into account those living in shelters and receiving government aid, census takers struggle to count the “hidden homeless” – those who may be residing in inadequate settlements such as slums, squatting in structures not intended for housing, couch surfing with friends and family, and those who relocate frequently.
AFRICA
BURKINA FASO
Approximately 45% of the country’s 20 million population live below the poverty line. Women, boys and girls aged 6-59 months and the elderly are the most affected by persistent food and nutrition insecurity, especially in rural areas. (World Food Programme, 2018)
EGYPT
95% of the population is concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile River, which represents only about 5% of Egypt’s land area.
27.8% of the population live below the poverty line. (CIA, 2019)
GHANA
Ghana has an urban population of 14 million, 5.5 million of which live in slums (Africa Research Institute, 2016).
Households are often overcrowded; on average there are between 10 and 20 people sharing a room (Habitat, 2016).
In 2018, 66,000 people were displaced due to natural disasters and violence (Internal Displacement, 2019).
IVORY COAST
The housing deficit is estimated at 40,000 units per year, and urbanisation keeps worsening the problem (Habitat, 2019). In 2018 there were 3,900 people displaced by violence and natural disasters (Internal Displacement, 2019).
56% of the population were reported to be living in slums in 2015 (World Bank, 2015).
LIBERIA
In 2016, 50.9% of the population lived below the national poverty line (World Bank, 2019).
In the capital Monrovia, 90% of the population are at risk from sea and river flooding, and two thirds of Monrovians live in unplanned and slum communities (Open DRI, 2018).
People living in rural areas make up 75% of the poor population (Relief Web, 2017).
MALAWI
Malawi’s national poverty rate has risen from 50.7% in 2010 to 51.5% in 2016 (World Bank, 2017). In a country of 18.6 million people, there are around 1.5 million orphans and vulnerable children (Habitat, 2019).
In 2019, Cyclone Idai left roughly 90,000 people displaced as a result of the devastation (Independent IE, 2019).
MALI
In 2017 the poverty rate was 42.7%, with 90% of poor people living in rural areas (World Bank, 2019). In urban areas, the number of people living in slums continues to rise due to rapid urbanisation (The Atlantic, 2018).
More than 80% of the population lack adequate housing (UNDP, 2012). In Bamako alone there are estimated to be around 500 children living on the street (South World, 2018).
In 2018, 126,000 people were displaced due to conflict (Internal Displacement, 2019).
NAMIBIA
Some 252,000 people, or 34% of the urban population, live in slums in Namibia’s cities (Reall ). They are regularly under the threat of natural disasters such as floods, which every year leave thousands of people homeless (Relief Web, 2004).
NIGERIA
There are an estimated 24.4 million homeless people in Nigeria. This is a consequence of many factors, including rapid urbanisation poverty (UNHCR, 2007), and actions by Boko Haram. In 2018 613,000 people were displaced due to natural disasters, and a further 541,000 due to violence and conflict (Internal Displacement, 2019).
70% of Lagos’ population live in informal housing, and many face homelessness due to the authorities’ attempts to curb the capital’s rapid growth (CBC, 2017).
SOUTH AFRICA
The main causes of homelessness in South Africa stem from a significant housing shortage, 28% unemployment, and urbanization (CIA, 2017). As of 2015 there are 200,000 homeless people living on the street alone and massive inequality is rampant, with roughly 79% of the population under the poverty line (DW, 2019).
TANZANIA
Between 2007 and 2016, the country saw a reduction in poverty rate. The number of those living below the poverty, however, has stayed at around 13 million due to high population growth (World Bank, 2019).
There is estimated to be a 3 million unit housing deficit in the country, and income levels of most households are significantly low. 90 percent of the population can afford less than $45 on housing per month (Habitat for Humanity ).
TOGO
2017 estimates state that 47% of Togo’s population live in poverty (World Bank, 2019). According to AJDD, about 100,000 people are homeless in Togo, half of them residing in Lomé solely. Annually, there are 200 new cases of children living on the street in the capital Lomé alone (Harambee Africa, 2019).
51% of the urban population live in slum housing (UNMDG, 2019).
ZAMBIA
Due to rapid urbanisation and poverty, Zambia is facing a serious shortage of housing. UN Habitat estimates that around 70% of the urban population live in informal settlements.
More than 60% of the Zambian population is under the poverty line, living on $2 a day (Habitat for Humanity ).
ZIMBABWE
More than 72% of Zimbabweans live below the poverty line (CIA World Factbook, 2012), and 62% of the households have also been deemed poor (UN, 2011). The country’s unemployment rate was estimated a 11.3% in 2014, this however, is believed to be a huge underestimation, since the country’s conditions prevent from accurate data gathering.
The national housing shortage is estimated at more than 1 million, with more than 1.2 million people on the government’s national housing waiting list.
ASIA AND OCEANIA
AUSTRALIA
According to AHURI, there were 116,427 people experiencing homelessness in Australia as of August 2016. This is an increase of 13.7% since 2011. On any given night, one in 200 people in Australia are homeless (Homelessness Australia, 2017 ).
For different age groups, the biggest number increase in homelessness between 2011 and 2016 is for people aged 25–34, with an increase of 5,813 people (AHURI, 2018 ).
CAMBODIA
Cambodia’s seven largest urban centres are home to nearly 2,700 homeless adolescents who face numerous health and education-related obstacles (The Phnom Penh Post, 2017 ).
Cambodia is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, with regular monsoon flooding in the Mekong and Tonle Sap basin and localised droughts in the plains region. Climate-related hazards have a major impact on the livelihoods of Cambodians already living on the brink of poverty, and an estimated loss of just US$ 0.30 in income per person would double the country’s poverty rate (World Food Programme, 2019 ).
HONG KONG
More than 200,000 of Hong Kong’s population live in “coffin homes”; cupboard-sized subdivided apartment units (The Atlantic, 2017; SCMP, 2016). About 44.7% of the population lives in subsidised housing (THB, 2017).
In 2017, community organisers and academics put the number of rough sleepers at 1,614, almost double the official government number of 874. This is a 14% increase from the previous year’s number of 1,414 (SCMP, 2017).
INDIA
There are an estimated 1.8 million homeless people in India, with 52% based in urban areas. A further 73 million families lack access to decent housing (IGH, 2018; Habitat, 2019).
In 2017, government authorities demolished 53,700 homes, evicting 260,000 people for reasons such as slum-free ‘city beautification’ projects, despite the government’s ‘Housing for All-2022’ scheme (HLRN, 2018).
Nearly 2.9 million people were displaced through natural disasters and violence in 2018 (Internal Displacement, 2019).
INDONESIA
There are approximately 3 million homeless people in Indonesia (Youth Exchange ).
Indonesia is prone to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters. Coupled with rapid urbanisation leaves millions of people vulnerable to losing their homes. In 2018, there were 857,500 newly displaced people due to natural disasters and violence (Internal Displacement, 2019).
Roughly 25 million families live in urban slums, along railway tracks, riverbanks and streets (Habitat, 2019).
ISRAEL
The Association for Civil Rights in Israel estimate the number of homeless people to be around 25,000. However, the number of people helped by the country’s social services is less than 10% of that number, due to their stringent criteria (Times of Israel, 2018).
At least 610 homeless people who the authorities were aware of have died on the street in the last 15 years (Haaretz, 2018).
JAPAN
Official Japanese government data shows the number of homeless people to be at 4,977, but non-profits state the actual number could be twice or three times as much (Japan Times, 2018). From 2016-2017 there were 1,412 people sleeping on the streets of Tokyo alone (ARCH, 2017).
The Tokyo government released a survey in 2018 stating the number of “internet café refugees” to be at 4,000 (Japan Times, 2018).
146,000 people were displaced due to natural disasters in 2018 (Internal Displacement, 2018).
KYRGYZSTAN
Rural families often move to informal settlements on the fringes of Bishkek and other major cities. About 70% of the 6.2 million people in Kyrgyzstan live in substandard housing, and it is not uncommon for three familial generations to be crowded into one room (Habitat ).
80% of children living on the street are a result of internal migration (Humanium ).
In January 2018, Bishkek was hit by a severe cold snap, with temperatures dropping to -30 C. At least 15 homeless people died in just one month (Eurasianet, 2018).
There around 3,500 people living on the streets in Bishkek alone (IWPR, 2016).
PAKISTAN
More than 200 million people live in Pakistan (CIA, 2016 ); 35% of the population live under the poverty line (Daily Times, 2018 ). It is estimated that there are roughly 20 million people lacking adequate housing, with the majority living in slums and other forms of temporary housing (Al Arabiya, 2018).
Poverty is rampant in Pakistan, with 60% of the population, mostly women and children, struggling to find suitable nutrition (Borgen Project, 2018).
PHILIPPINES
A fifth of the population lives below the national poverty line (CIA, 2017). There are around 4.5 million homeless Filipinos with 3 million in Manila, possibly the most in any city in the world (Reuters, 2018).
There are an estimated 250,000 Filipino children living on the street (New Mandala, 2016)
3.8 million Filipinos were displaced due to natural disasters in 2018, with a further 188,000 because of violence (Internal Displacement, 2018).
SOUTH KOREA
The South Korean government classified over 11,000 people nationwide as homeless in 2017, with 1,520 living on the street, 9,330 living in nursing and rehabilitation facilities, and 493 in temporary facilities (Korea Bizwire, 2017).
14.4% of South Koreans, roughly 7.2 million people, live vulnerably below the poverty line (CIA, 2016).
EUROPE
AUSTRIA
According to country’s Social Ministry, there were 15,090 people registered as homeless in Austria as of 2016. This is up from 12,050 in 2014. This number does not include rough sleepers who are not registered. Around 70% of all people experiencing homelessness live in Vienna.
There is also a major crisis in refugee accommodation currently in Austria. In 2015, approximately 85,000 refugees asked for protection. In 2016, 22,000 asylum seekers were still being housed in the Federal Care Scheme. Statistics show that 80% of refugees leaving the Federal Care Scheme (Bundesbetreuung) are at risk of ending up homeless, according to FEANTSA, 2017.
BELGIUM
From one count in 2016, there were 3,386 people experiencing homelessness in Brussels. This is a 96% increase since 2008.
In Flanders in 2014, there were 764 in winter emergency accommodation, 4,694 houseless people including 1,675 children, and 599 people threatened with eviction counted during a one month survey.
In Wallonia, 5,638 people used the emergency accommodation scheme in 2016. (FEANTSA, 2019, p.98)
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Over 2.2 million people were displaced during and after the Bosnian War, making it the most devastating conflict in Europe since the end of World War II. As a result of the war, approximately 99,000 were still living in displacement in 2017 (IDMC, 2018 ).
16.9% of the population live on or below the poverty line (World Bank, 2017 ).
The unemployment rate as of 2017 was 20.5% (CIA, 2019 ).
BULGARIA
In September 2013, 1,370 people were registered as homeless, but the real number is likely much higher since this only accounts for people with government-issued IDs who have signed up in those facilities. The most vulnerable people at risk of homelessness are refugees, the Roma minority, elderly, and young people out of foster homes. (Borgen Project, 2019 ).
More than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are at risk of poverty and social exclusion (Irish Times, 2018 ). The population living below the poverty line is currently 23.4% (CIA World Factbook, 2019 ). Currently 12.9% of people suffer from severe housing deprivation (FEANTSA, 2019 ).
CROATIA
According to the Croatian Network for the Homeless, there are more than 2,000 homeless people in Croatia, half of them located in Zagreb.
FEANTSA – European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless – uses a system called ETHOS – European Typology of Homelessness and housing exclusion – but this is not used in Croatia. If it were, the figure would be closer to 5,000 (Balkan Insight, 2018 ).
CZECH REPUBLIC
It’s estimated, as of 2017, that there are almost 119,000 people at risk of housing loss in the Czech Republic. The estimates for people actually living without a home is 68,500 – 74.4% are male, 23.6% are female (FEANTSA ).
Of this figure, 11.9% are under 18 and 10.3% over 65. FEANTSA conclude that a total of 187,500 people have experienced housing exclusion in the Czech Republic.
DENMARK
Recent data shows an increase in homeless people by 1,600 since 2009. However, the age group that had the most significant rise in homelessness is among 18 to 29-year-olds, due to economic instability and a weak housing market (CPH Post, 2018). In 2017, at least 39 under-18s were found to be homeless, five without their parents (Project Outside, 2017).
The latest count marked 6,635 homeless people in Denmark (Hus Forbi, 2017).
ENGLAND
There has been a recent trend of rising homelessness in England. Over the 2016/17 period, 59,110 people were considered homeless, this is a 9% increase over the 2014/15 numbers. Homelessness among vulnerable groups has also increased by 75% since 2010 (Shelter, 2019).
On any given night, there are 4,000 people sleeping rough (Shelter, 2019).
Households in temporary accommodation has risen from 48,330 in 2011 to 78,170 in 2017 (EOH, 2018).
57% of private renters say they struggle to cover housing costs (Shelter, 2019).
FINLAND
In 2017, there were 7,112 homeless people in Finland, with 411 sleeping rough, 355 in hostels, 516 in institutions, and 5,503 living with family or friends (FEANTSA, 2017).
54% of homeless families are immigrants (FEANTSA, 2017). In 2015, the number of native long-term homeless decreased by 8%, but the number of long-term homeless immigrants had increased 22% (FEANTSA, 2017).
FRANCE
In 2012, around 103,000 adults in French cities used some form of emergency accommodation or soup kitchen. This number includes 30,000 children. Altogether, 141,500 people were homeless in France in 2012, which is almost a 50% increase from 2001 (INSEE, 2012).
GERMANY
It is estimated that there were 860,000 homeless people in Germany, which marked a 150% increase in only two years due to the inclusion of refugees in the estimates. Excluding refugees the number of homeless people sits at 335,000 to 420,000 (EOH, 2017).
More than 15% of the people in assistance programs for homelessness were foreigners (Spiegel, 2013).
Around 50% of poor households spend more than 40% of their disposable income on housing (EOH, 2017).
GREECE
There is no official strategy for gathering information on homelessness in Greece. The UN Human Rights Council reports 21,216 people as homeless (FEANTSA, 2017).
Currently 34.8% of the population, 3.7 million people, are considered to be living below the poverty line (Kathimerini, 2018). The country also has the highest level of unemployment in Europe at 18.5% (Eurostat, 2019)         .
Since the start of the financial crisis evictions have risen by nearly 70%. These are due to court decisions or voluntary abandonments caused by rising housing debts (FEANTSA, 2017).
HUNGARY
A yearly NGO-led survey recorded 10,206 homeless people in Hungary, with 3,422 sleeping on the street and 6,784 in hostels. However, this survey only collects data on people connected to shelters or volunteer teams, so the number could be much higher (FEANTSA, 2017).
Between 2006 and 2010, 131 homeless people died of cold or exposure in the capital. In 2016, the UN considered 46.6% of Hungarians were considered impoverished, living on less than US$300 a month (Borgen Project, 2017).
IRELAND
As of January 2018, 9,104 people were accessing homeless accommodation, a 59% increase in just two years (FEANTSA, 2018).
There are 10,378 homeless people in Ireland as of March 2019, with an increase of 243% of homeless families since 2015 (Focus Ireland, 2019).
In Spring of 2019 there were 128 people found sleeping on Dublin streets (Focus Ireland, 2019).
ITALY
During the economic crisis, the rate of homelessness tripled in Italy. In 2016 there were 50,724 homeless people, an increase of 3,000 since 2011 (FEANTSA, 2017).
Poverty in Italy was at its highest in ten years in 2017, with 5.1 million people living in ‘absolute poverty’ (Reuters, 2017).
40% of  homeless people have been living on the streets for more than 4 years (FEANTSA, 2017).
LITHUANIA
Homelessness has been on the rise in Lithuania. Data shows that homelessness has been steadily rising over the last decade (European Commission, 2018). There were 4,827 homeless people recorded in 2015, with 2,487 living in homeless shelters and 2,340 living in mother and children crisis centres. From 2007 – 2015 homelessness rose by 32% (FEANTSA, 2016).
NETHERLANDS
From 2009 – 2015 The number of homeless people in the Netherlands grown by 13,000 to 31,000, an increase of 74% (NL Times, 2016). 40% of this population were concentrated in the major cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, the Hague, and Utrecht (FEANTSA, 2019).
The Netherlands is one of the two top worst countries for housing inequality in Europe (EOH, 2016).
NORTHERN IRELAND
Over the 2015/16 period 18,600 households presented themselves as homeless, with well over half – 11,200 – judged as passing all four tests for homelessness, a 13% increase since 2012/13 (NI Dep for Communities, 2018).
An average of 13 homeless people per month had their housing applications closed due to death from October 2017 to August 2018 (The Detail, 2018).
NORWAY
The number of homeless people in Norway has dropped from 6,259 in 2012 to 3,909 in 2016 (EOH, 2017). It is thought that a long-term focus on residential social work and viewing homelessness as a housing problem has been essential in reducing numbers (Norway Today, 2017).
POLAND
The Polish government estimated there were around 33,408 homeless people in February 2017, however this data is considered incorrect and the real number may be much higher (FEANTSA, 2019).
In 2017 around 25% of the homeless population had been in the same situation for over 10 years, meaning the average length of homeless durations is on the rise (FEANTSA, 2019).
PORTUGAL
Initial unapproved data from the Social Security Institute shows that there were 4,420 recorded in “active homeless situations” in 2013 (FEANTSA, 2017).
Since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008, the number of homeless people has risen by 30% (Portugal News Online, 2011).
ROMANIA
There is no national homelessness data collection strategy in Romania. The only study was conducted in 2004, when the homeless population was estimated 14,000 to 15,000 people (FEANTSA, 2012). In Bucharest alone, there were approximately 6,000 homeless people, including 1,000 children (Deutsche Welle, 2013).
RUSSIA
Russia’s governmental statistics agency Rosstad has not collected any numbers on homeless people since 2010. The official number from that period – 64,000 – is thought to be far too low, and it is estimated that the real number is roughly 5 million (Euromaidan Press, 2017).
SCOTLAND
From 2017-2018, out of 34,972 applications to local authorities, 28,792 households were assessed as homeless. The number of homeless applications has increased for the first time in nine years (Shelter Scotland, 2019).
In 2016-2017, people under 24 represented 27% of those assessed as homeless (Scottish Government, 2017).
SLOVENIA
Recent reports put the number of homeless people at around 4,000, but this number is thought to be higher as many hide their situation (Slovenia Times, 2016). This could be due to government policy that lists begging and use of public space for sleeping as punishable offences (FEANTSA, 2012).
Homelessness services are not a priority and are less widespread compared to other European countries (EOH, 2018).
SWEDEN
A Swedish national mapping of homelessness took place over one week in 2017, finding 33,250 people homeless, 18% of whom were described as “acutely homeless” (National Board of Health and Welfare, 2018).
Roughly 15% of Sweden’s population, 1.5 million, lives below the poverty line, meaning they lack the level of income to meet minimum living conditions (CIA, 2019).
SWITZERLAND
Although less visible, homelessness does exist. 7% of permanent residents live in poverty in terms of income (BFS, 2015). The poverty rate of foreigners from non-European countries is significantly higher at 11.7% (BFS, 2015).
In April 2019 Zurich-based homeless shelter Pastor Sieber Emergency Sleeping Centre reported its second highest winter occupancy since its opening in 2002, with 4,801 overnight stays (Diakone Schweiz, 2019).
UKRAINE
Unemployment rate in Ukraine is estimated at 9.2% (CIA World Factbook, 2017), and an estimated 3.8% of the population is living below the poverty line, more than 1.5 million people. Since the conflict in Donbas in the eastern region of Ukraine in 2014, 2.7 million persons have been displaced and over 4 million directly affected by continuing hostilities (World Bank, 2018).
WALES
In 2017/18, 11,277 households were assessed as homeless and owed a duty to help secure accommodation. In 2017-18, 9,072 households were threatened with homelessness within 56 days.
At the end of March 2018, there were 2,052 households in temporary accommodation. 801 households were families with children (Welsh Government, 2017/18 ).
NORTH / CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
CANADA
It is estimated that more than 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness in a year, with more than 35,000 Canadians homeless on any given night. Between 13,000 and 33,000 Canadians are chronically homeless. Although there has been a decline in the use of shelters in the last 10 years, the number of seniors (65+) has increased (Homeless Hub, 2016).
Although indigenous people make up 4.3% of the Canadian population, they comprise 28-34% of the shelter population (Homeless Hub, 2016).
75% of homeless people in Canada struggle with mental illness (Fred Victor, 2019).
COSTA RICA
The municipality of San José estimates that more than 1,800 people are homeless. According to the official statistics, around 5,300 families lived in slums in 2009. In 2009, the earthquake left many families homeless and natural disasters pose a serious threat in terms of losing home (Habitat Costa Rica, 2010; The Tico Times, 2014).
GRENADA
Grenada has one of the highest unemployment rates in the Caribbean at 24% (CIA, 2017), and one of the highest extreme poverty rates in the eastern Caribbean at 13% (Borgen Project, 2017).
Grenada’s location leaves it highly vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. In 2004 Hurricane Ivan damaged 80% of the homes and left approximately 60,000 people (more than half of the population) homeless (Relief Web, 2009).
GUATEMALA
In 2014 it was estimated that 59.3% of the population were living under the poverty line (CIA World Factbook ).
The housing deficit in Guatemala exceeds 1.6 million households, and the basic needs for services like drinkable water, sanitation and electricity in rural areas is high (Habitat ).
Displacements due to natural disasters and violence are significant, with 27,000 being displaced by natural disasters in 2018. Although there is a lack of data, it is thought that the main cause of population displacement is due to gang violence and development (Internal Displacement, 2018).
HAITI
People displaced by the 2010 earthquake and hurricanes in the following years still face the effects of being displaced from their homes (Internal Displacement, 2019). Jalousie, one of Haiti’s biggest slums, has a conservative estimate of 80,000 residents, many of whom lost their houses after the 2010 earthquake (The Guardian, 2018).
58.5% of the population, 6 million people, live with less than US$1.23 per day (World Bank, 2012).
HONDURAS
More than 60% of Honduras’ population live in poverty, and in rural areas 20% of people live in ‘extreme poverty’ (World Bank, 2018).
In 2016, the housing deficit was over 1 million units (Habitat ).
In 2015, 27.5% of the urban population lived in slums (UN MDGIs ).
17,000 people were displaced by natural disasters, 950 by violence, in 2018 (Internal Displacement ).
MEXICO
Around 16 million people live in inadequate housing with dirt floors, tin roofs, and mud walls (Habitat, 2019). One third of the population of Mexico are adolescents and roughly half of these, 21 million, live in poverty (Humanium, 2017).
In Mexico City, an estimated 50% of people live in informal, low-income settlements. Ngos in 2012 estimated that between 15,000 and 30,000 people in Mexico City were living on the streets. (Housing Conference, University of Glasgow, 2009; Inter Press Service, 2012).
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
More than 553,700 people were homeless on a single night across the US, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (BBC, 2017).
More than 40 million people were living in poverty, and 18.5 million were living in deep poverty, with reported family income below one-half of the poverty threshold. (UNHR, 2017).
The implications of the great recession are still felt. An estimated 3.2 million jobs were eliminated, and 1.2 million homes foreclosed upon following during the financial crash between 2007-2009 (Portland State University, 2018).
SOUTH AMERICA
ARGENTINA
There are no official sources for the number of homeless people in the capital, but local civic groups put the figure at 8,000 people, with 198,000 people in the city living in ‘extreme poverty’ (AP News, 2019).
Argentina has a housing deficit of 4 million units, in both quality and quantity of housing. In urban areas, 16% of houses lack drinkable water and 45% lack a sanitary sewer system (UN Habitat, 2016).
BRAZIL
In a population of 210 million, it is estimated that more than 50 million Brazilians live in inadequate conditions (Habitat, 2017 ).
According to the Perseu Abramo Foundation, there were 101,854 people living on the streets in 2015 (FPAbramo, 2017 ).
Unemployment was at 12.8% as of 2017, which increased from 11.3% in 2016. The unemployment rate among people aged 15-24 is 30.2%. The population living below the poverty line is 4.2%, although approximately 4% of the population are below the ‘extreme’ poverty line (CIA, 2018 ).
In Rio de Janeiro, the Municipal Office of Social Assistance estimate there are 14,200 people homeless in the city. This marks a 150% increase in three years (Rio Times, 2017 ).
CHILE
A count of people experiencing homelessness was last completed in 2011. The figure reached was 12,255 (OECD ).
The percentage of the population below the poverty line as of 2017 was 8.6% (World Bank ).
COLOMBIA
Colombia has been experiencing violent internal conflicts for more than 50 years. According to the World Food Programme, 7.5 million people have been displaced as a result.
Extreme poverty is still present, disproportionately affecting certain regions and types of population. Ethnic minorities in particular – including indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities – in former conflict zones are paying a heavy price for years of marginalisation. Coastal regions present the most severe deficiencies, with the Caribbean department of La Guajira reaching a peak of 90 percent of rural population with unsatisfied basic needs (World Food Programme ).
PERU
Peru’s poverty rate is at 21.7% according to the World Bank. An estimated 375,000 Peruvians joined the ranks of the poor, which state statistics agency INEI defines as an individual surviving on less than 338 soles ($105) per month. An estimated 6.9 million Peruvians now live in poverty, 44% of whom are in rural Peru (Reuters, 2018 ).
During 2017, relief agencies  estimated that 700,000 people in Peru were made homeless due to landslides and floods caused by unusually heavy rains (LATimes, 2017 ). There are more than 560,000 Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Peru (UNHCR, 2018 ).
VENEZUELA
In Venezuela 90% of the population live in poverty. A rate exacerbated by failed economic policies and a plunge in global oil prices (INE ).
Since 2014 more than 3.4 million Venezuelans have left the country – one of the largest cases of forced displacement in the western hemisphere. On average, in 2018, 5,000 people left Venezuela every day according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the UN migration agency (IOM ). An estimated 2.7 million Venezuelans are hosted in Latin America and Caribbean countries (IOM, 2019).

Homelessness Statistics Are Baffling, But Not Beyond Solving
Impact
Homelessness statistics reveal a problem that’s bigger than us, but not beyond solving
Annie Brannon
September 26
< Back to Blog
It’s estimated that about two percent of the world’s population is homeless. Two percent — it doesn’t sound like much, but when you do the math, that’s nearly 154 million people living on the street, in temporary dwellings, at refugee camps, and in other transitory and often dangerous conditions. Aside from these homelessness statistics, another billion people currently live without adequate shelter, and by 2050, it’s believed that number will reach close to three billion.
In reality, it’s likely that the number of homeless people around the world is even higher than the data suggests. Homelessness statistics, as it turns out, are incredibly difficult to come by, and the last time a global survey was even attempted was in 2005 by the United Nations. For such a prevalent problem, the lack of accurate information — especially from developing nations — presents a serious roadblock in the search for solutions.
Why are homelessness statistics so hard to obtain?
Painting an accurate picture of homelessness on a global level is challenging for many reasons, one of which has to do with the very word itself. Homelessness has many definitions, and they vary depending on the country and cultural concepts that surround it. A UN report titled The State of Homelessness in Developing Countries seeks to address the fluctuations that make it difficult to set a standard of measurement across populations. Here’s how the report defines the different variations of homelessness:
Rough sleeping: Literally lying down on the street, under a bridge or in a public place to sleep at night; temporary, seasonal short or long term.
Pavement dwelling: A regular ‘pitch’ is used over a longer period of time and some very rudimentary shelter of card, cloth or plastic is erected; short to medium term.
Squatting: Staying in the same derelict building on a regular basis; short to medium term.
Living in abjectly poor, often dangerous, dwellings: For example, staying in boats or other floating platforms without security or services and which fails all tests of adequacy; long term or permanent.
Refugee camps: Living without the foreseeable possibility of returning home; long term or permanent.
Other problems surrounding the accuracy of global homelessness statistics include: lack of government resources, the taboo nature of homelessness and the tendency of governments to downplay the issue, and the fact that many homeless people themselves are reluctant to come forward and register due to a combination of shame, insufficient resources, or safety concerns, such as violence and sexual assault.
Even without knowing the exact data, we do know without a doubt that homelessness is a problem of epic proportions. Yet despite the scale, we believe it’s a solvable one.
We’re focused on finding lasting solutions for an ongoing problem.
When you look back at the UN’s definitions of homelessness, the temporary nature of every scenario of homelessness points to a solution. Those living without a home are constantly jumping from one temporary living situation to another, whether it’s squatting from building to building or creating a makeshift tent on the street. Even homeless shelters and government-run housing programs are temporary, short-term approaches. To address the daunting global homeleness statistics, we need lasting solutions that focus less on providing temporary fixes and more on permanent resolutions.
Natural disasters, for example, are a major contributing factor to the temporary living conditions and subsequent homelessness that many people face. These devastating events destroy homes and resources, often leading to the adoption of relief shelters as permanent residences. While relief is much needed in the short term, people in these zones are at a much higher risk for injury and death due to the lack of withstanding shelter during and after such a disaster.
Haiti, a Caribbean country, has been hit by natural disaster after natural disaster throughout its history due to the location in prime hurricane and tropical storm territory. In January of 2010, the 7.0 magnitude earthquakes were the most devastating disasters to hit Haiti in generations, claiming the lives of approximately 300,000 people. The damage of vital infrastructure like communication systems and roads, as well as three major universities  left the country in crisis for years. To make matters worse, that same year hurricane Tomas hit, further worsening the state of the country amidst attempts to rebuild. Years later, Haiti is still recovering as the problems caused by these storms perpetuate.
Haiti holds a special place in the hearts of our team — it’s the reason why our founder, Brett Hagler, created New Story in the first place. On his first trip to the country, he saw families living in inadequate conditions; surviving in tents and other temporary dwellings that offered little to no protection from the elements. He knew this problem was bigger than big, and yet he was compelled to solve it. Returning home, he shared his experience and raised enough money to build t one home. The success of this one home, and then another, compounded to develop a clear vision for the transparency-focused, scalable nonprofit that we are today.
Again, short term relief is vital for immediate survival, but temporary solutions are not a long-term fix. The key to limiting natural disaster-induced homelessness is building structurally sound, disaster-resistant homes and communities that will ultimately minimize the after-effects of natural disasters in the future.
For these reasons, every New Story community is built by local workers using concrete and cinder block materials atop a strong foundation. In addition, part of our strategy involves a focus on participatory design, where families are invited to give feedback on the homes before they’re built. This is a critical step as it enhances our ability to build smarter and meet the needs of these families, ultimately increasing the likelihood that these communities will last for years to come.
Since building in Labodrie, Haiti, a powerful hurricane swept across the country putting home designs to the test. Thankfully, all of the homes withstood the disaster, and most importantly, so did every single one of the individuals living inside.
Tackling homelessness together, one step at a time.
It’s easy to be overwhelmed by global homelessness statistics, but we believe the problem — no matter how large — is a solvable one. We know we can change temporary solutions to long-term ones, and this is what drives us at New Story to find new ways of innovating and improving everything from building methods and technology to the way nonprofits operate as a whole.
Even through our best efforts, this is not a problem we can solve alone. That’s why we look to teach and share our innovative housing breakthroughs with other nonprofits and government organizations with a similar mission. So together, we can all build better, faster, more long-term housing to end global homelessness. It’s also why we look to you — and why we give the option to donate either to innovation to enable more breakthroughs or home building, where 100 percent goes directly to building homes for families in need today.
Homelessness statistics reveal a significant global problem, but with your help, it’s not beyond solving.

Global Poverty & Homelessness Statistics 2021
April 4, 2021 0
To help people better understand this global problem, we have sought to compile the latest available statistics on the challenges faced by people around the globe.
The last time a global survey was attempted was by the United Nations. This was in 2005.
An estimated 100 million people were homeless worldwide.
As many as 1.6 billion people lacked adequate housing (Habitat, 2015).
Getting an accurate picture of global homelessness is extremely challenging. Definitions of homelessness vary from country to country.
Census data is typically collected based on household and, while most census data takes into account those living in shelters and receiving government aid, census takers struggle to count the “hidden homeless”.
Those who may be residing in inadequate settlements such as slums, squatting in structures not intended for housing, couch surfing with friends and family, and those who relocate frequently.
This means that very likely, the available data on homelessness is severely underreported, and there are many more homeless people that countries report.
We’ve compiled data from the top countries on each continent with the highest and rising numbers on poverty and homelessness.
The data is based on sources from the World Bank, World Food Programme, Habitat, Open DRI, Relief Web, CIA World Factbook, UNDP, Habitat for Humanity, UN, and more. Full credits in the YouTube video description.
Africa
Zimbabwe
More than 72% of Zimbabweans live below the poverty line and 62% of the households have also been deemed poor.
The country’s unemployment rate was estimated a 11.3% in 2014, this however, is believed to be a huge underestimation, since the country’s conditions prevent from accurate data gathering.
Zambia
More than 60% of the Zambian population is under the poverty line, living on $2 a day
Liberia
In 2016, 50.9% of the population lived below the national poverty line.
People living in rural areas make up 75% of the poor population.
Ivory Coast
56% of the population were reported to be living in slums in 2015.
The housing deficit is estimated at 40,000 units per year, and urbanisation keeps worsening the problem.
Malawi
Malawi’s national poverty rate has risen from 50.7% in 2010 to 51.5% in 2016. In a country of 18.6 million people, there are around 1.5 million orphans and vulnerable children.
Asia & Oceania
Pakistan
More than 200 million people live in Pakistan. 35% of the population live under the poverty line.
It is estimated that there are roughly 20 million people lacking adequate housing, with the majority living in slums and other forms of temporary housing.
India
There are an estimated 1.8 million homeless people in India, with 52% based in urban areas. A further 73 million families lack access to decent housing.
Nearly 2.9 million people were displaced through natural disasters and violence in 2018.
Philippines
A fifth of the population lives below the national poverty line. There are around 4.5 million homeless Filipinos with 3 million in Manila, possibly the most in any city in the world.
Europe
Bulgaria
More than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.
The population living below the poverty line is currently 23.4%.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
16.9% of the population live on or below the poverty line.
Greece
Currently 34.8% of the population, 3.7 million people, are considered to be living below the poverty line.
Northern & Central America
Guatemala
In 2014 it was estimated that 59.3% of the population were living under the poverty line.
Honduras
More than 60% of Honduras’ population live in poverty, and in rural areas 20% of people live in ‘extreme poverty’.
In 2016, the housing deficit was over 1 million units.
In 2015, 27.5% of the urban population lived in slums
Haiti
58.5% of the population, 6 million people, live with less than US$1.23 per day
Jalousie, one of Haiti’s biggest slums, has a conservative estimate of 80,000 residents, many of whom lost their houses after the 2010 earthquake.
South America
Venezuela
In Venezuela 90% of the population live in poverty. A rate exacerbated by failed economic policies and a plunge in global oil prices.
Since 2014 more than 3.4 million Venezuelans have left the country – one of the largest cases of forced displacement in the western hemisphere.
On average, in 2018, 5,000 people left Venezuela every day.
An estimated 2.7 million Venezuelans are hosted in Latin America and Caribbean countries
Colombia
Colombia has been experiencing violent internal conflicts for more than 50 years.
According to the World Food Programme, 7.5 million people have been displaced as a result.
Extreme poverty is still present, disproportionately affecting certain regions and types of population.

Figure 1. Picture of homeless tents in Los Angeles city
Date of Publication: August 2019
Year of Publication: 2019
Publisher: The Millennium Alliance for Humanity and the Biosphere
Author(s): Gioietta Kuo
Before we discuss the global phenomenon of homelessness we need to understand one of the driving forces behind it which is the relentless rise of our population.  Already in 2019 the world is supporting an unsustainable 7.7 billion with an annual rise of 1 %. The future prospect is nothing but horrific: 8.6 billion in just 10 years time 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.5 billion in 2100.  Is the world livable by then? [1][2]
It goes without saying that all the ills of overcrowding from global overpopulation will become more and more evident. The UN estimated in 2005 there were 100 million homeless people worldwide. Homelessness has become an emerging urgent crisis and affects every county in the world. [3]
Based on national reports, it’s estimated that no less than 150 million people, or about 2 percent of the world’s population, are homeless to some extent. However, about 1.6 billion, more than 20 percent of the world’s population, may lack adequate housing. Obtaining an accurate picture of homelessness globally is challenging for many reasons. Habitat for Humanity has shown that 1.6 billion people lived in “inadequate shelter”  [4].
The characteristics and causes of homelessness around the world are complex and varied since each country has a varied economic and political history.  Solutions to this problem are also very complex. Homelessness is the result of a series of economic and social factors in the labour market, in housing policies, in social security, in education, in physical and mental healthcare and training policies and in the changes in family structure. Poverty is a principal reason which strangely afflicts even the most prosperous countries in the world.
First we list some notable data of interest:[5]
This is a list of countries (not all 195) by the homeless population present on any given night.
HOMELESSNESS BY COUNTRY
We shall concentrate here only on several industrialized countries.
USA
The following statistics are alarming: 564,708 people in the U.S. are homeless [6].  According to a recent report, over half a million people were living on the streets, in cars, in parks, in homeless shelters, or in subsidized transitional housing during a one-night national survey last January.
Many major cities are affected by people experiencing homelessness, which is growing every day. Prosperous centers like Seattle, Los angeles, San Francisco, Denver, New York, Washington and Austin, which has even legalized homeless living on the streets, are jarred by the sight of such human suffering.
Unsheltered homeless are those ‘sleeping rough’ (e.g. sleeping in parks). Figures correspond to ‘point-in-time’ estimates obtained by counting homeless people in late January.
2016 DATA
sheltered homeless       372,571
unshelterd   homeless 176,357
——————————————–
Total                             549,928
Los Angeles [7]
A recent count of the homeless population revealed that it had risen 12% over the last year, to nearly 60,000 people.  Apart from soaring rents, low wages and stubbornly local high unemployment the opioid crisis has also had an impact on more people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The roots of these problems are deep in the failures of our society.
I am giving a rather detailed  composition of homelessness in Los Angeles since it is the top region of homelessness in US.
Figure 2. Salvaging In Skid Row, Los Angeles
Figure 3. Trash in side walk in Los Angeles
Detail Facts About the 2019 Homeless Population
Of course, not every city will have the same causes, this list shows some of the general demographics of those experiencing homelessness in LA county. In Los Angeles County: [7]
9% are under age 18.
31% are female.
15% are in family units (often headed by a single mother}.
16% are physically disabled.
28% are chronically homeless.
15% of homeless population have substance abuse disorders.
25% of homeless population suffers from serious mental illness.
7% of homeless population were victims of domestic/intimate partner violence.
7% are veterans
34%  are African Americans
In addition, increased poverty rates amongst its population is a pervasive factor in fueling homelessness in LA county[8].  What is shocking in the sharp rise since 2018.
According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, in 2019, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 persons may be found homeless on any given night in Los Angeles County, more than 44,000 of them on the streets.
San Francisco[9]
Over the last 2 years the homeless population increased 31% to about 9,700 this year.  It is driven in part by a lack of housing and a roaring technology silicon valley economy which has widened the gap in income inequality.  The total number of people experiencing homelessness in greater San Francisco area in May 2019 is more than 25,000.
San Francisco city does not have more homeless people than other cities. Relative to the cities’ populations, the over 6,000 people that are homeless in San Francisco city is higher than in New York City, but lower than in Los Angeles, Seattle, and Washington D.C.
The reason San Francisco city has the second largest homeless ratio after Los Angeles  is because the bay area has a much smaller land area.
CHINA
There are over 1.351 billion people living in China. Out of that 1.3 billion, 200 million are considered to be homeless. [10]
Homelessness is not a social problem normally associated with China however, it appears to be growing, particularly among the population of migrants and those victims of earthquakes and other natural disasters who have moved into China’s cities.
In China, you may see some homeless people on the streets but it is not explicitly common because the Chinese authorities are very strict with them. But this does not mean that there are very few homeless people in China. Another reason why it is not commonly seen is the perception of homelessness as a shame and a taboo in the Chinese society[11].
In 2011, there were approximately 2.41 million homeless adults and 179,000 homeless children living in the country. However, one publication estimated that there were one million homeless children in China in 2012.[12]
DANGEROUS HEALTH WARNING
Often the living environment of people experiencing homelessness can cause concern for many health reasons. Due to the lack of toilet facilities and people gathering near distribution centers, trash tends to pile up in areas where many people are living outside  (see figure 3). Unfortunately, this creates a perfect breeding ground for rats. Fleas carried by rats cause the deadly disease of typhus. Already over 100 cases have been found in October 2018 [13][14].
Public health expert Dr. Drew Pinsky [15] has warned that Los Angeles faces imminent BUBONIC PLAGUE outbreak which the US  has not seen for nearly a century. Bubonic plague is the black death responsible for wiping out 1/3 of population of Europe in the Middle ages. It is carried by rats, transferred by fleas to pets and from pets to humans. It is curable by antibiotics if caught early.
D.CONCLUSION
As the world is quickly using up its diminishing resources and population is rising inexorably, it is no wonder that the number of people experiencing homelessness is fast increasing. In this article, we have concentrated exclusively on the cold statistics of homeless numbers, ignoring a very important fact –  which is the humanity aspect of the whole polemic. We should look at the problem from the perspective of someone experiencing homelessness: the hunger, the thirst, the wind, the rain, the cold, the heat, the trash, the lack of healthcare and basic washing facilities, the total discomfort of not having a home and the dejection and helplessness that is sadly visible on their faces.  The list is long.
Figure 4 Homeless Mother with Child.
One can but cry for the mother, being unable to provide a home for her child.
What can be done? S an Francisco  for example, spends more than $300 million a year fighting homelessness. Yet it’s not working – at least not enough. Amid a housing shortage, rampant drug addiction and a failing mental healthcare system, the everyday crisis on our streets has intensified.
As we have listed in Section B, there are many reasons for homelessness which stem from failures of our society. Since the causes are varied, so the solutions are complex.  We need a sensible combination of political, social, mental health and huge financial resources. Is this happening on the scale required? Here are some of the complex social challenges we are faced with solving if we are to make an impact in the homeless crisis.
Every day, more than 115 people in the United States die after overdosing on opioids. The misuse of and addiction to opioids—including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl—is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare. The US is in a opioid crisis.  Mexico is dominated by drug cartels. They make use of the porous Mexico – USA border to infiltrate the country with massive amount of drugs to make many people addicted. How can all these mentally afflicted people be treated? The scale of the resources necessary to cope with the problem is gigantic.
Income inequality is a rising problem all over the world. One percent of population has access to half the wealth the middle class remains stagnant and the bottom of the population remains in poverty. Short of an extreme recession or a convulsive war, the economy will not be easily changed.
Poverty  and lack of education for working skills is driving people into the streets.  Lack of affordable housing and wages are too low for those in poverty. For the fourth year, The San Francisco Chronicle is leading the SF Homeless Project, a consortium of media organizations focusing on the seemingly intractable problem of homelessness. Progress has been made, but problems remain.
Of course, one has to heed the warnings of public health doctors about impending horrific diseases like Typhus and Bubonic plague.  But do we have to wait for such disasters before helping those suffering helpless people?

How Many Homeless People Are There in the World?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 24, 2020
Paul Bradbury/OJO Images/Getty Images
There are an estimated 100 million people in the world who are homeless, according to a United Nations report from 2005. The division of this statistic varies between countries, ranging from a few thousand homeless citizens to over one million.
Some nations have a much smaller homeless population than others. Lithuania has fewer than 2,000 homeless citizens, as of 2014, and in Sweden, the number is 17,800.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered some information about homelessness around the world. It seems like homelessness is a significant issue globally, affecting millions of people. The United Nations estimated back in 2005 that there were about 100 million homeless people worldwide, but I also read that the actual number might be higher because it's tough to get accurate statistics.

One of the main challenges in understanding homelessness is that different countries define it differently. Some places might only count people sleeping on the streets, while others include those living in shelters or temporary accommodations. This makes it hard to compare data across countries and get a precise global number.

From the documents, I see that homelessness is a problem in both developed and developing countries. For example, in the United States, there are hundreds of thousands of homeless people, with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco having particularly high numbers. In India, the estimate is much higher, around 78 million homeless people. Even in countries like Sweden and Lithuania, which have relatively lower numbers, homelessness is still an issue.

It's interesting to note that poverty is a primary driver of homelessness globally. Economic disparities, lack of affordable housing, and insufficient social support systems contribute to people ending up without a place to call home. Additionally, factors like natural disasters, conflicts, and mental health issues play a role in displacing people from their homes.

I also came across mentions of how homelessness affects different demographics, such as families with children, veterans, and those with substance abuse or mental health problems. It seems like addressing homelessness requires a multifaceted approach that tackles not just the immediate need for shelter but also the underlying causes.

One document mentioned that many countries lack comprehensive strategies to combat homelessness, and there's a need for more investment in affordable housing and social services. It's clear that homelessness is a complex issue that requires coordinated efforts from governments, NGOs, and communities.

In summary, homelessness is a substantial global problem affecting tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of people worldwide. Accurate statistics are hard to come by due to varying definitions and reporting methods, but it's evident that poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social support are key contributors. Tackling this issue will require comprehensive approaches addressing both the symptoms and root causes of homelessness.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Homelessness is a significant global problem affecting millions, driven by poverty, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate social support.}} \]
