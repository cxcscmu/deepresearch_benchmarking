Alright, so I've got this question: "Why don't young people vote?" It seems like a straightforward question, but I'm guessing there might be multiple reasons behind it. I need to think about this carefully and maybe do some research to get a better understanding.

First off, I should define what we mean by "young people." Is this referring to teenagers, or people in their twenties, or both? In many countries, the voting age is 18, so I'll assume it's targeting individuals who are just old enough to vote, maybe up to their early twenties.

Now, why wouldn't they vote? One immediate thought is that they might not be interested in politics. A lot of young people I know seem more focused on their studies, careers, or personal lives. Politics might not be a priority for them. But is that the whole story?

Maybe they feel disconnected from the political process. Perhaps they think that their vote doesn't matter, or that politicians don't represent their interests. There's probably some truth to that. Political campaigns often target older voters who have higher turnout rates, so young people might feel overlooked.

Another possibility is that they lack information about how to vote or when elections are happening. Maybe they're not aware of the registration process or the importance of voting in local elections, which can have a big impact on their daily lives.

I should also consider whether there are any structural barriers preventing young people from voting. For example, some places require voter ID, which young voters might not have or find difficult to obtain. Or perhaps they're students living away from home, which can complicate voting logistics.

Moreover, there might be a generational shift in attitudes towards politics. With the rise of social media and instant access to information, young people consume news differently than older generations. Maybe they get their information from sources that aren't traditionally associated with politics, so they don't feel engaged with mainstream political discourse.

I should look into some statistics to see if there's any data supporting these ideas. Maybe there are studies or reports that explain why youth voter turnout is lower compared to older age groups.

Let me try to find some information on this. I'll start by searching for "youth voter turnout statistics."

Half of Youth Voted in 2020, An 11-Point Increase from 2016
April 29, 2021
Our analysis of youth voter turnout nationwide finds wide variation between states and underscores the importance of electoral laws and policies that help grow voters.
We estimate that 50% of young people, ages 18-29, voted in the 2020 presidential election, a remarkable 11-point increase from 2016 (39%) and likely one of the highest rates of youth electoral participation since the voting age was lowered to 18. Our new estimate is based on newly available voter file data in 41 states—AK, DC, HI, MD, MS, NH, ND, UT, WI, WY do not have reliable vote history data by age. This analysis replaces our earlier estimate, released immediately after Election Day, which estimated a 5 to 11 point increase in youth voter turnout compared to 2016 based on data available in that moment.
In recent weeks, we released youth voter turnout in all available states by region: West/Southwest, South, Midwest, and East/Northeast. Those analyses offer more details on several notable states and have now been updated with the latest data. Our estimates of youth voter turnout rates in more than 80% of states are in some ways a tribute to young people’s commitment to political engagement and action in 2020, and their impressive ability to navigate a changing electoral landscape during a global pandemic. The data also allows us to zoom out, look at trends in youth voter participation, and draw some conclusions about what is and isn’t working to broaden and diversify the youth electorate. We pay special attention to laws and election administration policies that affect the ease of casting a ballot in each state—from voter registration to vote-by-mail, which can always impact youth voter turnout but may have had especially large effects in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic shifted election processes across the country.

Youth Voting Increased Across the Country
Half of eligible young voters cast a ballot in 2020. However, as is the case in every election cycle, youth voter turnout rates varied widely across the country: New Jersey (67%), Minnesota (65%), Colorado (64%) and Maine (61%) had the highest statewide youth turnout rates, while South Dakota (32%), Oklahoma (34%), Arkansas (35%), and New Mexico (39%) had the lowest.
Numerous interconnected factors shape whether youth electoral participation is high or low. These include the competitiveness of elections, how much (or how little) campaigns and organizations reach out to young people, the state’s civic culture and civic education policies, the demographic composition of the youth population, and state voting laws — which are discussed in greater detail below — that can either facilitate voting or pose barriers for youth. Because there’s no single reason why youth voter turnout may be high or low in a state, and no silver bullet if it’s the latter, it is crucial to examine these and other factors that may be at play in order to expand the electorate.
Turnout in 2020 was much higher than in 2016, when we estimate (using the same methodology) that 39% of young people cast a ballot. This sizable, 11-point increase builds on young people’s momentum from 2018, when youth turnout was record-setting for a midterm year. State-by-state turnout increases between 2016 and 2020 were 9 percentage points on average, but also varied widely. The largest increases in youth voter turnout were in New Jersey (+22), Arizona (+18), and California and Washington (both +17). Notably, with the exception of Arizona, all of those states automatically mailed absentee ballots to all registered voters without voters having to request them. No states saw a decrease in turnout, and in only one state (Louisiana) did the youth voter turnout rate remain flat, at 42%, between 2016 and 2020.
Turnout of Newly Eligible Voters Stronger, but Still Lagging
We also estimate that voter turnout among young people ages 18-19 was 46%. This age group deserves special attention because they are the newest eligible voters, so their electoral participation, or lack thereof can provide a window into how well—and how equitably—we are preparing and priming youth to participate in democracy. Additionally, voting is a habit that, when formed and practiced early, is likeliest to persist later in life. But, by the same token, when preparation for voting is inequitable early in life, those inequities can also persist.
Historically, youth ages 18-19 have voted at lower rates than their slightly older peers, and that was once again the case in 2020. However, some states managed to close the gap; in California and Washington, remarkably, voter turnout was actually higher among youth ages 18-19. But in still other states the difference was stark: in South Dakota, where 32% of young people under 30 voted, just 12% of 18- and 19-year-olds cast a ballot. As we mark the 50-year anniversary of the 26th amendment that lowered the voting age to 18, these voter turnout differences by age are a reminder that challenges to achieving equitable participation remain. They also point to the importance of a Growing Voters framework that focuses on how the education system, election administrators, and other stakeholders can ensure that we start preparing young people to vote long before they turn 18.
Electoral Laws and Policies Shaped Youth Voter Turnout
Each state has its own election laws and methods of administering elections that can affect voter participation, and the ease of registering and casting a ballot may have taken on even greater importance in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These policies may especially affect youth turnout; many young voters are new voters who need to register for the first time and who may be unfamiliar with the process. Young people also tend to move more frequently, which may mean they have to reregister and potentially learn an entirely new set of deadlines and procedures.
Understanding the effect of electoral policies on youth turnout is especially relevant at a time when the U.S. Congress is considering HR1: For the People Act of 2021. This bill would standardize some election laws across the country and nationally establish: automatic voter registration (AVR), online voter registration (OVR), same-day or Election-Day registration (SDR), early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, pre-registration, and requirements for voter registration programming in high schools. No state currently has all of these provisions in place. But by looking at youth voter turnout in states that already had a majority of these policies in place in 2020, we can examine whether they are associated with higher participation and the potential for HR1 to expand the youth electorate.
We divided states into those with a majority of the electoral policies in HR1 and those with few of the policies, and we found that, on average, states with more of these policies had higher youth turnout. States with four or more of the HR1 policies had a combined youth turnout rate of 53%, compared to 43% turnout from states with less than four policies. It appears likely that a number of policies complement each other to create a system and culture of voting that is more conducive to youth participation, and the lack of them may have the opposite effect. That said, it remains to be seen whether the way these policies are implemented at the state level, and the way they might be implemented thanks to HR1 at the federal level, would lead to similar effects.
One area of election policy not included in HR1, but uniquely critical in 2020, was each state’s rules regarding vote-by-mail. Many states changed or expanded mail-in voting in response to the pandemic, and the electorate’s preferred voting method changed drastically. According to the Survey on the Performance of American Elections, the percentage of voters (of all ages) who cast ballots by mail grew to 46%, more than doubling from 2016. The share of voters who cast ballots on Election Day fell from 60% in 2016 to 28% in 2020.
States took different approaches to mail-in voting in 2020. Some states automatically mailed a ballot to all registered voters—a practice that was already the norm in some states like Colorado and Washington. Others automatically mailed ballot applications. In other states, voters had to request a mail-in ballot, and at the more restrictive end of the spectrum, some states did not allow using the pandemic as a valid “excuse” for voting by mail.
On average, youth voter turnout was highest (57%), and had the largest increases over 2016, in states that automatically mailed ballots to voters. States with the most restrictive vote-by-mail laws, conversely, had the lowest youth turnout: an average of 42%. As some states consider whether to keep some of the changes to ease mail-in voting that they made in 2020, or to eliminate them altogether, lawmakers would do well to keep in mind the positive correlation between these policies and young people’s voter participation.
Implications for 2022 and Beyond
Whether through national legislation like HR1 or through decisions by state legislatures, the permanence or changes to voting laws and processes will be a key factor in 2022 and in future election cycles. Young people have now voted in record numbers in both 2018 and 2020; that means there’s a record number of young people on the voter rolls, but many will need to update their registration, which can especially be a challenge in states without online or automatic registration. It’s not a given that the rise in youth voting will continue without concerted efforts from lawmakers, educators, organizers, and other stakeholders to ensure that young people are prepared and encouraged to vote.

Youth Voting Trends
Youth Voting Trends
The health of any democracy depends on informed and engaged citizens. This section discusses the trends and the research done to understand why young Canadians tend to vote less than older Canadians, and how civic education can help get more young Canadians to the polls.
Trends in Overall Voter Turnout
For several decades, there was a downward trend in overall voter turnout. Before the 1990s, voter turnout was at 70% or higher in most federal elections. The voting rate declined in the years after that, and reached a record low of 59% in 2008.
Voter turnout graph - Text version
Those trends started to reverse in 2011, and the results for 2015 were even more positive. Overall, voter turnout reached 68.3% in 2015 and only slightly decreased to 67% in 2019.
In 2015, voter turnout for youth (aged 18 to 24) increased the most of any age group: compared with 2011, over half a million more young Canadians voted.
But, in 2019, youth voter turnout decreased by 3.2 percentage points. Could it signal a downward shift in the trend? Or could it be a sign that participation is stabilizing?
Voting Trends by Age
One thing has remained true in the last decade: there is a significant turnout gap between younger and older demographics. In 2015, the turnout for young voters was more than 20 percentage points lower than that for people in the 65 to 74 age group.
In 2019, the gap between these age groups increased, with youth at 25 percentage points lower than the 65 to 74 age group.
Voting is habit-forming
If a person votes in their first election, they will probably be a life-long voter. On the other hand, if someone does not vote in their first election, they will probably not pick up the habit later in life.
This graph represents the results of a study conducted with three cohorts of eligible voters between 1965 and 2011.

Why are fewer young people voting?
Elections Canada has commissioned several research studies to better understand why many young people are not showing up to the polls. This research is part of Elections Canada’s ongoing efforts to understand how barriers to voting are evolving.
From the 2015 National Youth Survey, the agency found two major barriers that prevented youth from voting: motivation and access. The survey found that compared to older voters, Canadian youth
are less interested in Canadian politics
feel less strongly that voting will make a difference
believe that the government does not care what they think
tend to see voting as a choice rather than a duty
In terms of access, the survey discovered that youth
were less likely to receive a voter information card
were less aware of the ways to register and vote
perceived the voting process as too difficult (getting to the polls, proving their identity)
The research suggests that a key factor in overcoming these barriers is increasing the interest level and political knowledge of future voters.
The Value of Civic Education
Given all this research, Elections Canada knows that when it comes to preparing future voters to take part in civic life, education matters. In the 2015 National Youth Survey, young people who voted were much more likely to say that
they learned about government and politics in high school
they took part in a mock election
Creating future voters who are engaged and prepared to vote will require families, schools, government and others to work towards this goal. Our democracy depends on it!

Youth voter turnout in presidential elections in the U.S. 1972-2020
Published by Erin Duffin , Mar 19, 2021
In the 2020 presidential election, about 55 percent of voters aged between 18 and 29 participated in the election -- a significant increase from the previous election year, when about 44 percent of youths voted in the election. The highest youth turnout rate was in 1972, when 55.4 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the election.

The youth vote in the United States is the cohort of 18–24 year-olds as a voting demographic. [1] Many policy areas specifically affect the youth of the United States, such as education issues and the juvenile justice system. [2] The general trend in voter turnout for American elections has been decreasing for all age groups, but "young people's participation has taken the biggest nosedive". [3] This low youth turnout is part of the generational trend of voting activity.  Young people have the lowest turnout, though as the individual ages, turnout increases to a peak at the age of 50 and then falls again. [4] Ever since 18-year-olds were given the right to vote in 1972, youth have been under represented at the polls as of 2003. [1] In 1976, one of the first elections in which 18-year-olds were able to vote, 18–24 year-olds made up 18 percent of all eligible voters in America, but only 13 percent of the actual voters – an under-representation of one-third. [1] In the next election in 1978, youth were under-represented by 50 percent.  "Seven out of ten young people…did not vote in the 1996 presidential election… 20 percent below the general turnout." [5] In 1998, out of the 13 percent of eligible youth voters in America, only five percent voted. [1] During the competitive presidential race of 2000, 36 percent of youth turned out to vote and in 2004, the "banner year in the history of youth voting," 47 percent of the American youth voted. [3] In the Democratic primaries for the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the number of youth voters tripled and even quadrupled in some states compared to the 2004 elections. [6] In 2008, Barack Obama spoke about the contributions of young people to his election campaign outside of just voter turnout. [7]

History of the Youth Vote[edit]
Initially, the framers of the U.S. Constitution and state voting laws were skeptical of the role of young people in American politics. States uniformly set 21 as the voting age, although Connecticut debated lowering it to 18 in 1819. In general, young Americans were expected to be deferential to their elders, and John Adams famously cautioned that expanding suffrage would encourage "lads from twelve to twenty-one" to demand the right to vote. [8]
Yet as the suffrage expanded to non-property-holders in the early 1800s, young people came to play a larger role in politics. During the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, youths often organized Young Men’s clubs in support of the Democratic, National Republican, Whig, or Anti-Masonic parties. [9] Presidential campaigns often organized torch-lit rallies of thousands of marchers, and analyses of these club rosters show that members were often in their late teens and early twenties. [10] The demands of popular democracy – which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters – led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that the Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of "the shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age." [11]
In the mid-to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their "virgin vote" when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. [12]
Around the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party’s reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time "virgin voters," whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. [13] As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning.[citation needed] Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote.
Sustained interest in lowering the voting age began during World War II when Congress passed legislation allowing young men to be drafted at the age of eighteen. While a few individual states began to allow 18-year-old voting before the Civil Rights Extension Act of 1970 and 26th Amendment (1971) lowered the voting age to eighteen, efforts to lower the voting age generally garnered little support. [14]
By the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people had shown themselves to be vital political actors and were demanding more of a role in American public life. The qualities associated with youth – young people's idealism, lack of "vested interests," and openness to new ideas – came to be seen as positive qualities for a political system that seemed to be in crisis. Rising high school graduation rates and young people's increasing access to political information also spurred re-evaluations of 18-year-olds' fitness for voting rights. In addition, Civil Rights organizations, the National Education Association, and youth-centered groups formed coalitions that coordinated lobbying and grassroots efforts aimed at lowering the voting age on both the state and national level. [14]
Since 2004, young American voters have shown a greater and greater propensity to vote in favor of Democratic candidates over their Republican counterparts, with growing sympathy for more and more progressive ideals as of 2020. [15] [16]
Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States[edit]
This article may primarily relate to a different subject, or place undue weight on a particular aspect rather than the subject as a whole.Specifically, Many of these subsections contain information of a general nature, without many details on how the youth vote specifically is affected. Please help by spinning off or relocating any relevant information, and removing excessive detail that may be against Wikipedia's inclusion policy.(June 2015)
The lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States.
Voting process[edit]
The voting process has two steps.  An eligible voter – a U.S. citizen over the age of 18 [17] – must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting.  The voting process is regulated by each state individually and therefore varies from state to state. [18] The process of registering to vote is different depending on the state. [18] Pre-registration is available to youth under the age of 18 in 20 states and Washington D.C. [19] Potential voters may also register on Election Day – or on the day on which they vote early – in 10 states and Washington, D.C. [20] This may be done at the polling place or at an election official's office. [20] Residents of the 40 states which do not allow same day registration require potential voters to register by a deadline, typically from eight to 30 days out from the election. [20] Over half of the states in the U.S. offer some sort or online voter registration. [21] This consists of the same process as a paper registration form, only it is digital and sent to election officials to review over the web.  This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002. [21] There are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote. Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington, D.C.  This must be done in person at a designated polling place. Early voting period lengths vary from state to state. [22] If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot. In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot. [22] In 27 states and Washington, D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse. In five states, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington, hold elections almost entirely by mail. [22] Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes.
Two party system[edit]
The winner-take-all system in the United States has fostered a two-party system and limits the success of third party candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority. [5] In 1992, Ross Perot, a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the 18–24 year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group. [5]
Frequent change of residence[edit]
Between the ages of 18 and 24, youth have the potential to graduate high school, move away to college and change residences multiple times as they begin their career.  As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence. [5] College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside. [5] The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18–24 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change. [5]
Lack of candidate contact[edit]
According to a 1998 study, young people at the time were complaining that those in politics did not communicate with them. [5] Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote.  For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters.  The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group. [3] "Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters," therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote. [1]
Volunteering efforts[edit]
Though many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic. [3] Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities.  In this way, youth can make a difference in their communities and are able to see change immediately when seeing the larger picture of a movement, including the political aspect, may be more difficult or intangible. [5]
Efforts to encourage youth vote[edit]
Organizations[edit]
A variety of organizations worked to encourage young people to vote. [23] By 2018, Rock the Vote, a platform used by grassroots campaigns, [3] [5] [23] had registered over 7 million votes and gained over 350 partners directing people to its online registration tool. [24]
Another organization working on registering young voters nationwide is The Civics Center, a sister organization of Rock the Vote. It has launched a campaign that engages with over 1,000 schools nationwide.

Campaign strategies[edit]
Because the youth population is so large, many campaigns try to gain their support during elections. [3] Efforts to capture the youth vote include registration drives, outreach, and specifically youth-friendly policy platforms.  An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the "Reggie the Rig" drive by the Republican National Committee in the 2004 election.  With a goal of registering three million new voters, the "Reggie the Rig" bus traveled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of potential youth voters at once. [3] During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation. [3] The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. [3] This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns.  New technology, especially the internet, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth.  It has been found that "young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics." [1]
Young adults are "over-represented among all computer and Internet users" – three-fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day. [1] As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media sites. Websites such as Facebook and YouTube not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates. [28] If the use of technology were to be fully integrated into politics, the youth and adult groups would be equally active in politics. [1] Online news media, in particular, is believed to have a positive impact on young citizens due to its interactivity. [29] It not only provides them with the information they need to form their political beliefs, become more informed regarding democracy, and to gain a better understanding of current issues, but it also provides them with a platform to discuss these ideas with other individuals, not only on a more localized scale but also on a global scale. [29]
Legislation[edit]
In the United States, there has been legislation passed to help youth access the vote.  The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), often called the "motor-voter" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency. [5] The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application. [5] Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day. [5]
Two cities in Maryland, Takoma Park and Hyattsville, allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections. [30]

Answer:
2. increased each election year
Explanation:
In the United States, Youth voter turnout is what we call the number that is determined by how many people that are between 18-24 years old voted in the elections, in the 2000 election the youth voter turnout was a rough 20%, this means that only 20% of the total elegible people to vote between the ages of 18-24 actually voted, the youth voter turnout has been increasing slowly but steadily over the years reaching a peak in 2018 with a 31% youth voter turnout.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one to see what I can find out about why young people don't vote.

The first document is from CIRCLE, which seems to be a research center at Tufts University focusing on youth political participation. The title mentions "half of youth voted in 2020, an 11-point increase from 2016." That's interesting; it suggests that youth voter turnout has been increasing recently. But I need to understand why it was lower in the past and what factors might still be discouraging some young people from voting.

Looking at the key points:

- Half of young people voted in 2020, which is a significant increase from 2016.

- There's wide variation between states in terms of youth voter turnout.

- The article discusses the importance of electoral laws and policies in affecting youth voter turnout.

- It mentions that some states automatically mail ballots to all registered voters, which seems to correlate with higher youth turnout.

So, it seems like voting policies and election administration can play a big role in whether young people vote or not. Maybe in some places, the voting process is more accessible and convenient, leading to higher turnout.

The second document is from Elections Canada, discussing youth voting trends in Canadian elections. While it's not directly about the US, it might offer some comparative insights. It shows that there was a decline in overall voter turnout in Canada until 2011, but then it started increasing, similar to the US trend mentioned in the first document.

Key points:

- There's a turnout gap between younger and older demographics in Canada as well.

- Voting is habit-forming; if someone votes in their first election, they're likely to continue voting.

- The research identifies motivation and access as major barriers to youth voting.

- Civic education is highlighted as a key factor in increasing political interest and knowledge among youth.

This suggests that both motivational factors (interest in politics, feeling that voting matters) and practical barriers (access to registration, understanding the voting process) are important considerations.

The third document is from Statista, providing statistics on youth voter turnout in US presidential elections from 1972 to 2020. Looking at the data, there have been fluctuations, but overall, it seems that youth turnout peaked in 1972, dropped in the following decades, and has been increasing somewhat in recent elections, especially in 2018 and 2020.

This trend aligns with what was mentioned in the first document. It would be useful to see if there are specific factors that contributed to the increase in recent years.

The fourth document is a Wikipedia page on the youth vote in the United States. It provides a historical overview of voting age and youth political participation in the US. It mentions that initially, the voting age was set at 21, but there were efforts to lower it to 18, especially during World War II when young men were being drafted at age 18.

Key points:

- There has been a general trend of decreasing voter turnout across all age groups, but youth turnout has declined more sharply.

- Youth have been underrepresented at the polls compared to their proportion in the eligible voting population.

- In recent elections, particularly in 2008 and 2012, youth turnout has increased, especially among certain demographic groups.

- The page also lists various organizations and campaigns that aim to encourage youth voting.

This provides a good contextual background but doesn't delve deeply into the reasons for low youth turnout.

The fifth document is from Brainly, which seems to be an educational Q&A site. It's answering a multiple-choice question about youth voter turnout since the 2000 election. The correct answer is that youth voter turnout has generally increased each election year.

While this is a straightforward answer, it doesn't provide any insight into why youth don't vote or what factors affect their participation.

Overall, from these search results, it seems that youth voter turnout has been increasing in recent years, contrary to the initial assumption that young people don't vote. However, historically, youth have had lower turnout rates compared to older age groups, and there are various factors that contribute to this.

To answer the question "why don't young people vote?", I need to look beyond just the statistics and understand the barriers and motivations related to youth voting behavior.

From the second document, Elections Canada identifies two major barriers: motivation and access.

Motivation factors include:

- Lack of interest in politics

- Feeling that voting doesn't make a difference

- Believing that the government doesn't care about their opinions

Access factors include:

- Not receiving voter information

- Lack of awareness about registration and voting processes

- Perceiving the voting process as too difficult

Additionally, the Wikipedia page mentions that political candidates often focus their campaigns on more reliable voting groups, which excludes youth, thereby creating a cycle of neglect.

Other factors that might discourage youth from voting could include:

- Transience: young people move more frequently, which can complicate voter registration and updating addresses.

- Student status: those attending college or university might face challenges in voting absentee or registering in their school district.

- Perception of irrelevance: feeling that political issues don't affect them personally or that candidates don't address their concerns.

- Peer influence: if their social circle isn't politically engaged, they may be less likely to vote.

- Lack of civic education: insufficient understanding of the voting process or the importance of voting.

However, it's also important to note that in recent years, there has been an increase in youth voter turnout, suggesting that some of these barriers are being addressed or that there are motivating factors specific to certain elections.

For instance, the first document mentions that states with more favorable voting policies, such as automatic voter registration and mail-in ballots, tend to have higher youth turnout. This suggests that making voting more accessible can encourage more young people to participate.

Moreover, the Brainly answer indicates that youth voter turnout has been increasing each election year since 2000, which contradicts the initial premise of the question. Therefore, it's crucial to consider the trend over time and not just assume that young people don't vote.

Perhaps a more accurate question would be: "What factors have historically discouraged youth from voting, and what changes have led to increased youth voter turnout in recent elections?"

To answer this, I need to explore both the barriers that have traditionally kept youth from voting and the factors that have contributed to the recent surge in youth participation.

First, looking at the barriers:

1. Lack of interest in politics: Many young people may not follow politics closely or feel disconnected from the political process. This could be due to a perception that politics is irrelevant to their lives or that politicians don't represent their views.

2. Belief that voting doesn't make a difference: Some youth might feel that their individual vote won't impact the outcome of an election, especially in large-scale races like presidential elections.

3. Complexity of the voting process: Navigating voter registration, understanding ballot initiatives, and knowing where and when to vote can be confusing, particularly for first-time voters.

4. Practical obstacles: Issues like inflexible work schedules, transportation problems, or lack of identification can prevent young people from voting.

5. Alienation from the political system: Feelings of disillusionment or mistrust in government can discourage youth from participating.

On the other hand, factors that have likely contributed to increased youth voter turnout in recent elections include:

1. Increased awareness and mobilization efforts: Organizations and campaigns specifically targeting young voters have worked to educate and encourage them to participate.

2. Use of technology: Social media and online platforms have made it easier to reach young people with voting information and to engage them in political discussions.

3. Salient issues: Certain elections may feature issues that resonate strongly with young people, motivating them to vote. For example, concerns about climate change, student debt, or healthcare reform.

4. Changes in voting policies: Reforms such as early voting, mail-in ballots, and online voter registration can make voting more convenient for busy young adults.

5. Role models and influencers: High-profile figures, including celebrities and public personalities, advocating for youth voting can inspire young people to participate.

Given these points, it's clear that a combination of motivational and practical factors influences youth voting behavior. While there have been historical barriers that have kept youth turnout lower than other age groups, there are signs of improvement and increasing participation in recent elections.

Therefore, to answer the original question, "Why don't young people vote?" – it's not entirely accurate to say that they don't vote; rather, they have historically had lower turnout rates due to a variety of barriers, but these rates are improving, likely due to increased efforts to engage and motivate young voters, as well as changes in voting policies that make it easier for them to participate.

\boxed{\text{Young people have historically had lower voting turnout due to barriers like lack of interest, perceived irrelevance, and practical obstacles, but recent efforts to engage and make voting more accessible have led to increased participation.}}
