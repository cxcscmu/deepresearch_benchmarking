Alright, so I need to understand how local governments work. I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I know that governments are responsible for managing various aspects of our society, and local governments handle things at the community level. Maybe I should start by figuring out what exactly local governments are and what their roles are.

First off, I think local governments are the level of government that is closest to the people. They manage things like schools, roads, parks, and other community services. But I'm not sure about the specifics. Perhaps I should look into the different types of local governments and how they are structured.

I've heard terms like municipalities, counties, cities, and towns. Are these all considered local governments? Maybe I need to clarify the differences between them. Also, I know that in some places, there are special districts for things like water or fire protection. Do those fall under local government as well?

Let me try to organize my thoughts. I think local government refers to any governing body below the state or provincial level. So, in the United States, for example, after the federal government and the state governments, local governments are the next layer down. They have authority over specific geographic areas and are responsible for providing certain public services to their residents.

But how are local governments formed? Are they created by the state governments, or do they have independent authority? I feel like I need to research the relationship between state and local governments to understand this better.

Also, I'm curious about how local governments are funded. Do they rely on property taxes, sales taxes, fees, or a combination of these? And how do they decide where to allocate their budgets?

Another aspect is the political structure of local governments. Who runs them? Mayors, city councils, county commissioners? How are these officials elected, and what are their responsibilities?

I should probably look into some examples to get a clearer picture. Maybe examine how a city government works compared to a county government. Are there overlapping jurisdictions, and if so, how do they coordinate?

Moreover, I'm interested in understanding the decision-making processes in local governments. How are policies制定的？公众如何参与？是否有听证会或委员会？

我还想知道地方治理中面临的挑战是什么。比如财政约束、人口增长、基础设施维护等。他们是如何应对这些挑战的？

也许我可以查找一些资源来帮助我更好地理解这个问题。可能需要看看书籍、在线文章或者观看一些教育视频。

让我先尝试在网上搜索一下“how local government works”看看能找到什么信息。

Lesson Summary
What is Local Government?
What is local government? The definition of local government is the government of a town, city, or county. Towns, cities, and countries exist as divisions within a state. In other words, local government is subordinate to both the state and federal governments.
Different states have varying laws that deal with how local governments are formed, as well as how they function. For instance, some states give a great deal of authority to counties, while others provide countries with almost no real political power.
Local governments are the governments that ordinary people have the most direct control over. This is due to the fact that communities have much smaller populations than states or countries.

What Does the Local Government Do?
Local governments are responsible for the day-to-day activities of the community. Here are some common local government responsibilities:
Running the police department
Running the local schools
Running the trash collection service
Running the fire department
Issuing and collecting property taxes
Animal control
Passing ordinances (local laws)
Plowing snow
Maintaining roads (responsibility often shared with the state government)
Zoning property
Issuing certain types of licenses and permits
Maintaining parks, beaches, and other public spaces
Running municipal utilities
Running libraries
How Does Local Government Work?
How does local government work? Cities, towns, and counties work in different ways in different states. However, generally speaking, local governments receive most of their funding via property taxes. This is a tax levied against property owned by a person or business. (It is important to note, however, that tax assessors do not work for local governments. State taxes are the responsibility of state governments.)
Local Government Structure
Almost all local governments are led by elected officials who act in a similar way as governors, congressmen, and presidents. On rare occasions, a state government may take over the government of a city or town when there is widespread corruption, bankruptcy, natural disasters, or other similar circumstances. In these cases, local control is eventually handed over back to the city or town. The specific structure of a local government varies, depending of the laws of the state. Usually, however, most local governments contain an executive branch, legislative branch, and judicial branch.
Local Government and State Government
All local governments must abide by the laws of their states. Just as U.S. states can not violate federal law, municipal governments are not allowed to partake in activities that violate the laws of the states in which they exist. For instance, the mayor of New York City can not appoint the district attorney of Manhattan. This can only be done by the voters of the borough of Manhattan or the governor of the state (when there is a vacancy).
Most states offer funding and other types of support to local communities. This involves funding for education, public services, the police, et cetera.
Local Government and Federal Government
Local governments must also abide by the U.S. Constitution and federal law. While this may seem like common sense, there have been many instances in U.S. history when local governments have undertaken actions that violate federal law. For instance, many local communities have tried to ban certain books. Federal courts have ruled that these actions violate the First Amendment of the Constitution.
Local governments may receive funding and assistance from the federal government. For instance, after 9/11, many local police departments received anti-terrorist training and supplies from Washington.

City Government
City government definition and function:
Cities are communities that have a large number of people. City governments govern their respective cities and act in a similar fashion to state and national governments. The three largest cities in the United States are New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Most cities have three branches of government: the executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch. The executive branch is headed by a mayor. The legislative branch is composed of a city council or other similar body. Mayor and councilmembers are usually elected. Municipal courts usually deal with things such as wills or traffic violations. Most major criminal and civil matters are dealt with by state courts.
Large cities can have enormous bureaucracies that are larger than those of some countries.

Jenny has masters' degrees in public health and public administration.
Local governments operate at the municpal, county, or city level and include bodies of elected and non-elected officials who are citizens. Learn the definition of a local government and how it's structured to fit into the federalist system of the United States government. Updated: 12/20/2021
What Is Local Government?
Have you ever been waiting at the bus stop and noticed the sanitation workers cleaning up your neighborhood and collecting garbage? These people work for the local government. Your teachers at school, the cafeteria workers, and the people who create the public park you play in before dinner -these are all local government workers!
Local government is the smallest form of the three types of government. The federal government oversees the entire country, and the state government oversees an entire state. Meanwhile, the local governments oversee the smaller areas that make up a state, like cities and towns. Mayors, city council members, and county commissioners, among other officials, help lead local governments. These are usually elected positions.

The Structure of Local Government
There are two basic levels of local government:
A county government oversees the larger county.
A municipal government oversees a smaller municipality (usually located within a county), such as a town, city, or village.
Let's take a look at an example. Chicago is a city with its own city government, and this city is located within Cook County, which has a county government.
Local governments can also be divided up into special districts that have specific purposes. One common example is the school district. A school district often covers several cities and towns, and it acts like its own municipality with appointed and elected officials.
Federalism in the United States
The United States is a federalist system of government, where powers are divided between the federal (national) and state governments. The state gives power and sets limitations for local governments. While each level of government (state, local, and federal) has its own set of responsibilities, they also carry out many of the same jobs.
In some cases, the local government has to carry out a federal or state law or mandate. For instance, the federal government passed the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act saying that school lunches and food sold in school had to be healthy. The federal government set the rule, but local school districts look over the ingredients in the food served, order fruits and vegetables, set the menu, and make sure schools are following the law.

Meeting of Jyväskylä 's city council in 1925
Local government is a generic term for the lowest tiers of public administration within a particular sovereign state. This particular usage of the word government refers specifically to a level of administration that is both geographically-localised and has limited powers. While in some countries, "government" is normally reserved purely for a national administration (government) (which may be known as a central government or federal government ), the term local government is always used specifically in contrast to national government – as well as, in many cases, the activities of sub-national, first-level administrative divisions (which are generally known by names such as cantons, provinces, states, oblasts, or regions).  Local governments generally act only within powers specifically delegated to them by law and/or directives of a higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises a third or fourth tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government.
The question of municipal autonomy is a key question of public administration and governance. Local elections are held in many countries. The institutions of local government vary greatly between countries, and even where similar arrangements exist, the terminology often varies. Common designated names for local government entities include state, province, region, canton, department, county, prefecture, district, city, township, town, borough, parish, municipality, shire, village, ward, local service district and local government area .

Africa[edit]
Egypt[edit]
Local government traditionally had limited power in Egypt's highly centralized state. Under the central government were twenty-six governorates (sing., muhafazah; pl., muhafazat). These were subdivided into districts (sing., markaz; pl., marakaz) and villages (sing., qaryah; pl., qura) or towns. At each level, there was a governing structure that combined representative councils and government-appointed executive organs headed by governors, district officers, and mayors, respectively. Governors were appointed by the president, and they, in turn, appointed subordinate executive officers. The coercive backbone of the state apparatus ran downward from the Ministry of Interior through the governors' executive organs to the district police station and the village headman (sing., umdah; pl., umadah).[citation needed]
Before the revolution, state penetration of the rural areas was limited by the power of local notables, but under Nasser, land reform reduced their socioeconomic dominance, and the incorporation of peasants into cooperatives transferred mass dependence from landlords to government. The extension of officials into the countryside permitted the regime to bring development and services to the village. The local branches of the ruling party, the Arab Socialist Union (ASU), fostered a certain peasant political activism and coopted the local notables—in particular the village headmen—and checked their independence from the regime.[citation needed]
State penetration did not retreat under Sadat and Mubarak. The earlier effort to mobilize peasants and deliver services disappeared as the local party and cooperative withered, but administrative controls over the peasants remained intact. The local power of the old families and the headmen revived but more at the expense of peasants than of the state. The district police station balanced the notables, and the system of local government (the mayor and council) integrated them into the regime.[citation needed]
Sadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.[citation needed]
Mali[edit]
In recent years, Mali has undertaken an ambitious decentralization program, which involves the capital district of Bamako, seven regions subdivided into 46 cercles, and 682 rural community districts (communes). The state retains an advisory role in administrative and fiscal matters, and it provides technical support, coordination, and legal recourse to these levels. Opportunities for direct political participation, and increased local responsibility for development have been improved.[citation needed]
In August–September 1998, elections were held for urban council members, who subsequently elected their mayors. In May/June 1999, citizens of the communes elected their communal council members for the first time. Female voter turnout was about 70% of the total, and observers considered the process open and transparent. With mayors, councils, and boards in place at the local level, newly elected officials, civil society organizations, decentralized technical services, private sector interests, other communes, and donor groups began partnering to further development.[citation needed]
Eventually, the cercles will be reinstituted (formerly grouping arrondissements) with a legal and financial basis of their own. Their councils will be chosen by and from members of the communal councils. The regions, at the highest decentralized level, will have a similar legal and financial autonomy, and will comprise a number of cercles within their geographical boundaries. Mali needs to build capacity at these levels, especially to mobilize and manage financial resources.[citation needed]
Nigeria[edit]
Main article: Local government areas of Nigeria
Nigeria as a federal republic operates three tiers of government: federal (or central), states 
and local government. The country's constitution provides for each local government (which exists in a single tier countrywide), and its development areas and autonomous communities created by individual state legislation to have democratically elected local government heads. There is a ministry (or bureau) of local government and chieftaincy affairs in each state charged with the responsibility of administration at that level. Nigeria has a total of 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs). [1]
South Africa[edit]
Main article: Local government in South Africa
South Africa has a two-tiered local government system comprising local municipalities which fall into district municipalities, and metropolitan municipalities which span both tiers of local government.
Asia[edit]
Afghanistan[edit]
Afghanistan was traditionally divided into provinces governed by centrally appointed governors with considerable autonomy in local affairs. There are currently 34 provinces. During the Soviet occupation and the development of country-wide resistance, local areas came increasingly under the control of mujaheddin groups that were largely independent of any higher authority; local commanders, in some instances, asserted a measure of independence also from the mujaheddin leadership in Pakistan, establishing their own systems of local government, collecting revenues, running educational and other facilities, and even engaging in local negotiations. Mujaheddin groups retained links with the Peshawar parties to ensure access to weapons that were doled out to the parties by the government of Pakistan for distribution to fighters inside Afghanistan.[citation needed]
The Taliban set up a shura (assembly), made up of senior Taliban members and important tribal from the area. Each shura made laws and collected taxes locally. The Taliban set up a provisional government for the whole of Afghanistan, but it did not exercise central control over the local shuras.[citation needed]
The process of setting up the transitional government in June 2002 by the Loya Jirga took many steps involving local government. First, at the district and municipal level, traditional shura councils met to pick electors—persons who cast ballots for Loya Jirga delegates. Each district or municipality had to choose a predetermined number of electors, based on the size of its population. The electors then traveled to regional centers and cast ballots, to choose from amongst themselves a smaller number of loya jirga delegates— according to allotted numbers assigned to each district. The delegates then took part in the Loya Jirga.[citation needed]
The warlords who rule various regions of the country exert local control. The transitional government is attempting to integrate local governing authorities with the central government, but it lacks the loyalty from the warlords necessary to its governing authority. More traditional elements of political authority—such as Sufi networks, royal lineage, clan strength, age-based wisdom, and the like—still exist and play a role in Afghan society. Karzai is relying on these traditional sources of authority in his challenge to the warlords and older Islamist leaders. The deep ethnic, linguistic, sectarian, tribal, racial, and regional cleavages present in the country create what is called "Qawm" identity, emphasizing the local over higher-order formations. Qawm refers to the group to which the individual considers himself to belong, whether a subtribe, village, valley, or neighborhood. Local governing authority relies upon these forms of identity and loyalty.[citation needed]
Armenia[edit]

Bangladesh[edit]
Main article: Local government in Bangladesh
Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions, [2] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Sylhet, Rangpur and Mymensingh Division .
Divisions are divided into zila. There are 64 zila in Bangladesh, each further divided into upazila or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into mahallas. There are no directly elected officials at the divisional or district levels, although elected chairs of subdistricts also sit on district councils. [3] Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates. [4] [5]
Dhaka is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The cities with a city corporation, having mayoral elections, include Dhaka South, Dhaka North, Chittagong, Khulna, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Barisal, Rangpur, Comilla and Gazipur. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a mayor and councilors for each ward, include Mymensingh, Gopalganj, Jessore, Bogra, Dinajpur, Saidapur, Narayanganj, Naogaon and Rangamati. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.
Brunei Darussalam[edit]
The administrative divisions of Brunei mainly consist of daerah, mukim and kampung or kampong. They are organised hierarchically, with daerah being the first level and kampong the third level. All the administrative divisions are under direct governance of the government through the Ministry of Home Affairs. There are four districts in Brunei: Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong and Temburong. The administrative level of mukim lies below the district. At present, there are 38 mukims, with 17 in Brunei-Muara, 8 in Tutong, 8 in Belait and 5 in Temburong District. A mukim is headed by a penghulu. A village (Malay: kampung or kampong) is the lowest administrative level in Brunei and headed by a ketua kampong or village head. Its population varies from a few hundreds to tens of thousands.

Municipality (Palestinian Authority): Depends on size of locality. Localities that serve as the centers of governorates and populations over 15,000 have 15-member councils. Localities with populations over 15,000 residents have 13-member councils and localities with populations between 4,000 and 15,000 have 9-member councils.
Village Council (Palestinian Authority): Localities with populations between 800 and 1,500 have 3-member councils while those between 1,500 and −4,000 residents have 7-member councils.
Philippines[edit]
Main article: Local government in the Philippines
See also: Philippines § Regions and Provinces
The Local Government Code of 1991 provides for the three levels of Local Government Units or LGUs in the Philippines: (1) the province (2) city and municipality, and (3) the barangay. The country remains a unitary state and the National Government continues to have strong influence over local government units.
A province is led by a governor along with the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Provincial Council) composed of board members. A mayor leads a city or municipality while the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) and the Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Council) constitute the legislative branches of a city and municipality, respectively. A barangay is headed by the Barangay Captain and the Barangay Council.  Barangays can be further divided into puroks and sitios but their leadership is unelected.
The 1987 Philippine Constitution also provides for the existence of autonomous regions. The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is the only autonomous region in the Philippines.  There was an attempt to institute an autonomous region in the Cordillera, but that failed and instead the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was established.
Local governments have limited taxing authority. Most of their funds come from the national government via the Internal Revenue Allotment
Saudi Arabia[edit]
There are three levels of local government in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: the city council, the municipal council and the municipality.
The city council is the highest level of local government. The municipal councils began in 2005 and is the second level of local government. The municipality is the third level of local government. There are 178 municipalities across the kingdom. The first began in Jeddah during the Othmanic period. Each municipality is run by its city's mayor. As a collective the kingdom's municipalities make up the Ministry of Municipality and Rural Affairs (MoMRA).

Andorra[edit]
Andorra is formed by seven parishes (parròquies, singular – parròquia); Andorra la Vella, Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, Escaldes-Engordany, Ordino, Sant Julià de Lòria .
Some parishes have a further territorial subdivision. Ordino, La Massana and Sant Julià de Lòria are subdivided into quarts (quarters), while Canillo is subdivided into 10 veïnats (neighborhoods). Those mostly coincide with villages, which are found in all parishes. Each parish has its own elected mayor who is the nominal head of the local government known as a comú in Catalan.
Belarus[edit]
Main article: Regions of Belarus
At the top level of administration, Belarus is divided into six regions and the city of Minsk, which has a special status being the capital of Belarus. Minsk is also the capital of Minsk Region .
At the second level, the regions are divided into raions ("districts").
Bulgaria[edit]
Main articles: Provinces of Bulgaria and Municipalities of Bulgaria
Since the 1880s, the number of territorial management units in Bulgaria has varied from seven to 26. [7] Between 1987 and 1999 the administrative structure consisted of nine provinces (oblasti, singular oblast ). A new administrative structure was adopted in parallel with the decentralisation of the economic system. [8] It includes 27 provinces and a metropolitan capital province (Sofia-Grad). All areas take their names from their respective capital cities. The provinces subdivide into 264 municipalities .
Municipalities are run by mayors, who are elected to four-year terms, and by directly elected municipal councils. Bulgaria is a highly centralised state, where the national Council of Ministers directly appoints regional governors and all provinces and municipalities are heavily dependent on it for funding. [9]
Croatia[edit]
Main articles: Counties of Croatia, List of cities in Croatia, and Municipalities of Croatia
Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb, the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities.[10]
Czech Republic[edit]
Main articles: Regions of the Czech Republic and Districts of the Czech Republic
The highest tier of local government in the Czech Republic are the thirteen regions (Czech: kraje, singular kraj) and the capital city of Prague. Each region has its own elected Regional Assembly (krajské zastupitelstvo) and hejtman (usually translated as hetman or governor ). In Prague, their powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.
The regions are divided into seventy-six districts (okresy, singular okres) including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status). The districts lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration. [11] A further reform in effect since January 2003 created 204 Municipalities with Extended Competence (obce s rozšířenou působností); also obce III. stupně – third-level municipalities, unofficially also called "little districts" (Czech: 'malé okresy') which took over most of the administration of the former district authorities. Some of these are further divided between Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (obce s pověřeným obecním úřadem, shortened to pověřená obec, pl. pověřené obce; "second-level municipalities").  In 2007 the borders of the districts were slightly adjusted and 119 municipalities are now within different districts.
Denmark[edit]
Main articles: Regions of Denmark and Municipalities of Denmark
For local government purposes, Denmark is divided into five regions (Danish: regioner ), with their most important area of responsibility being the public health service. They are also responsible for employment policies, and some regions are responsible for public mass transit. Regions are not entitled to levy their own taxes, and they rely entirely on central state funding (around 70%) and funding coming from the municipalities (around 30%). Regions are led by directly elected councils (regionsråd ). They consist of 41 members each.
The regions are further divided into 98 municipalities (kommuner ). Elections for the municipalities are held on the third Tuesday of November every four years.
Estonia[edit]
Main articles: Counties of Estonia and Municipalities of Estonia
A town hall of Viljandi
Estonia is divided into 79 municipalities (omavalitsus ), and each municipality is a unit of self-government with its representative and executive bodies. Furthermore, the country is also divided into fifteen counties (Estonian: maakonnad ), each of which were used to be led by a county governor (maavanem ), who represents the national government at the regional level. This although changed with 2017 administrative reform .
Finland[edit]
Main articles: Regions of Finland, Sub-regions of Finland, and Municipalities of Finland
Sastamala Town Hall in Vammala, Sastamala, Finland
The most important administrative layer of local government in Finland are the 311 municipalities, which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, property tax, state subsidies, and other revenue.
In addition to municipalities, there are two intermediate levels of local government. Municipalities co-operate in seventy-four sub-regions and nineteen regions. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. However, the autonomous province of Åland has a directly elected regional council, and the Sami people have a semi-autonomous Sami Domicile Area in Lapland for issues on language and culture.
France[edit]
Main articles: Decentralisation in France and Administrative divisions of France
According to its Constitution of 1958, France has 3 levels of local government:
13 Régions (including Corsica) and 5 Régions d'outre-mer (Réunion, Martinique, Mayotte, Guadeloupe and French Guiana ). Corsica is not referred to as a "région" but simply as a "collectivité territoriale", that merely means "local government area".
96 départements and 5 départements d'outre-mer (Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte and French Guiana). Paris is both a commune and a département.
There are 36,679 municipalities (in French: Communes ).
However, in addition to the constitutional clauses of 1958, there now exist specificities:
Intercommunalities are now a level of government between municipalities and departments.
There exist 2 "pays d'outre-mer": French Polynesia and New Caledonia. The expression "pays d'outre-mer" is convenient as it can be understood in French as both "overseas country" and "overseas county/traditional area" (as evidenced by Pays de la Loire that is a home région, not a home "country"). French Polynesia works as an autonomous région, whereas New Caledonia has a sui generis local government status with specific institutions and even more autonomy.

Since 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen regions subdivided into a total of 325 municipalities and communities. The regions have their own elected governors and regional councils, however there are seven decentralized administrations, which group from one to three regions under a government-appointed general secretary. There is also one autonomous area, Mount Athos .
Hungary[edit]
Main articles: Counties of Hungary and Subregions of Hungary
For local government, Hungary is divided into 19 counties. In addition, the capital (főváros ), Budapest, is independent of any county government
The counties are further subdivided into 174 subregions (kistérségek ), and Budapest is its own subregion.
There are also 23 towns with county rights (singular megyei jogú város ). The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective county instead of being independent territorial units.
Iceland[edit]
Main article: Municipalities of Iceland
The Municipalities of Iceland are local administrative areas in Iceland that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as kindergartens, elementary schools, waste management, social services, public housing, public transportation, services to senior citizens and handicapped people. They also govern zoning and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the constitution of Iceland .
The municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as mayors (bæjarstjóri / borgarstjóri) in the mostly urban municipalities but "commune manager" (sveitarstjóri) in the rural or mixed municipalities.
Ireland[edit]
Main article: Local government in the Republic of Ireland
The Republic of Ireland's local government is laid out by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. With a few exceptions, local government is two-tier. At the lowest level are the municipal, metropolitan or borough councils, which are elected during local elections. These councillors from the relevant county then together form the council, termed either County or City and County Councils. For example, the 4 municipal districts in Westmeath County each elect their own councils, who together form Westmeath County Council. Many functions are performed by the Chief Executive, who is appointed by the Minister for Local Government.
The exceptions to the above is the county of Dublin and the cities of Cork and Galway, the later two's councils are directly elected with no lower council. Dublin county is made up of four local area authorities, each elected directly. There are thirty-one local authorities.
The main sources of funding for local government in Ireland are local property and motor tax revenues, payments from the Exchequer, charges for goods and services, and state grants. [12]
Isle of Man[edit]
Main article: Local government in the Isle of Man
Local government on the Isle of Man is partly based on the ancient parishes. There are four types of local authorities: a borough corporation, town commissioners, village commissioners, and parish commissioners.
Italy[edit]
The Italian Constitution defines three levels of local government:
Regions: At present 5 of them (Valle d'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Sardinia and Sicily) have a special status and are given more power than the others. The constitutional reform of 2001 gave more power to regions.
Provinces: They mostly care to roads, forests, and education. They had more power in the past.
Communes: The Mayor and staff, caring for the needs of a single town or of a village and neighbouring minor towns or villages.
Major cities also have an extra tier of local government named Circoscrizione di Decentramento Comunale or, in some cities (e.g. Rome) Municipio .
Latvia[edit]

Lithuania[edit]
Main articles: Counties of Lithuania, Municipalities of Lithuania, and Elderships of Lithuania
This article needs to be updated. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(June 2013)
Lithuania has a three-tier division of local government: the country is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys) that are further subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – savivaldybė, plural – savivaldybės) which consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – seniūnija, plural – seniūnijos ).
The counties are ruled by county governors (Lithuanian: apskrities viršininkas) appointed by the central government, and effectively oversee the two lower tiers of local government.
Municipalities are the most important administrative unit of local government. Each municipality has its own government and council, with elections taking place every four years. The mayor, who is a member of the council, is elected directly by the residents in a majority vote. [13] The council appoints elders to govern the elderships.
Elderships, numbering over 500, are the smallest units of local government. They provide public services such as registering births and deaths and identifying individuals or families in need of welfare.
Malta[edit]
Malta is a unitary city state divided into 68 municipalities (local councils ), according to the constitution of the Malta.
Netherlands[edit]
Main articles: Municipal politics in the Netherlands and Provincial politics in the Netherlands
The Netherlands has three tiers of local government: national, provincial, municipal and water board.
The Netherlands is divided into twelve provinces (provincie, pl. provincies ). They form the tier of administration between the central government and the municipalities. Each province is governed by a provincial council, the States-Provincial (Provinciale Staten, abbr. to PS ). Its members are elected every four years. The day-to-day management of the province is in the hands of the provincial executive, the States Deputed (Gedeputeerde Staten, abbr. to GS ). Members of the executive are chosen by the provincial council. The size of the executive varies from one province to another. In Flevoland, the smallest of the Dutch provinces, it has four members, while most other provinces have six or seven. Meetings of the provincial executive are chaired by the King's Commissioner (Commissaris van de Koning(in), abbr. to CvdK ). The King's Commissioner is not elected by the residents of the province, but appointed by the Crown (the King and government ministers). The appointment is for six years and may be extended by a second term. The King's Commissioner can be dismissed only by the Crown. King's Commissioners play an important part in the appointment of municipal mayors. When a vacancy arises, the King's Commissioner first asks the municipal council for its views as to a successor, then writes to the Minister of the Interior recommending a candidate.
Municipalities (gemeente, pl. gemeenten) form the lowest tier of government in the Netherlands, after the central government and the provinces. There are 415 of them (1 January 2012). The municipal council (gemeenteraad) is the highest authority in the municipality. Its members are elected every four years. The role of the municipal council is comparable to that of the board of an organisation or institution. Its main job is to decide the municipality's broad policies and to oversee their implementation. The day-to-day administration of the municipality is in the hands of the municipal executive (college van burgemeester en wethouders, abbr. to (college van) B&W), made up of the mayor (burgemeester) and the aldermen (wethouder, pl. wethouders ). The executive implements national legislation on matters such as social assistance, unemployment benefits and environmental management. It also bears primary responsibility for the financial affairs of the municipality and for its personnel policies. Aldermen are appointed by the council. Councillors can be chosen to act as aldermen. In that case, they lose their seats on the council and their places are taken by other representatives of the same political parties. Non-councillors can also be appointed. Unlike councillors and aldermen, mayors are not elected (not even indirectly), but are appointed by the Crown. Mayors chair both the municipal council and the executive. They have a number of statutory powers and responsibilities of their own. They are responsible for maintaining public order and safety within the municipality and frequently manage the municipality's public relations. As Crown appointees, mayors also have some responsibility for overseeing the work of the municipality, its policies and relations with other government bodies. Although they are obliged to carry out the decisions of the municipal council and executive, they may recommend that the Minister of the Interior quash any decision that they believe to be contrary to the law or against the public interest. Mayors are invariably appointed for a period of six years. They can be dismissed only by the Crown and not by the municipal council.
Water boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) are among the oldest government authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form the foundation of the whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is what led to the creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden ). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives.
Norway[edit]
Norway's regional administration is organised in 19 counties (fylke), with 18 of them subdivided into 431 municipalities (kommune) per 1 January 2006. The municipal sector is a provider of vital services to the Norwegian public, accounting for about 20% of Norwegian GNP and 24% of total employment. Norway had 435 municipalities of varying size in 2003, each administered by an elected municipal council. They are grouped into 19 counties (fylker), each governed by an elected county council. Each county is headed by a governor appointed by the king in council. Oslo is the only urban center that alone constitutes a county; the remaining 18 counties consist of both urban and rural areas. County and municipal councils are popularly elected every four years. The municipalities have wide powers over the local economy, with the state exercising strict supervision. They have the right to tax and to use their resources to support education, libraries, social security, and public works such as streetcar lines, gas and electricity works, roads, and town planning, but they are usually aided in these activities by state funds.
Portugal[edit]
Main articles: Autonomous regions of Portugal, Districts of Portugal, Municipalities of Portugal, and Freguesias of Portugal
Currently, mainland Portugal is divided into 18 districts (in Portuguese, distritos ). Each district takes the name of their respective capital city.  Insular Portugal, comprising the two Atlantic archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira, is organized as two autonomous regions (in Portuguese, regiões autónomas ).
Each district and each Autonomous region is divided into municipalities (in Portuguese, municípios) which, in turn, are subdivided into parishes (in Portuguese, freguesias ).
Since 1976, when the two Autonomous regions of Portugal were established, the Azores and Madeira are no longer divided into districts.
Poland[edit]
Main articles: Administrative divisions of Poland and Voivodeships of Poland
Poland has three levels of subdivision. The territory of Poland is divided into 16 voivodeships (provinces); these are further divided into 379 powiats (counties or districts), and these in turn are divided into 2,479 gminas (communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both gmina and powiat.
Each voivodeship is jointly governed by the National-government appointed voivode and a locally elected sejmik (provincial assembly), which appoints an executive board led by a voivodeship marshal .
Russia[edit]
Main articles: Subdivisions of Russia, Federal subjects of Russia, and Municipal divisions of Russia
The Russian Federation consistes of eighty-five federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation.  However, two of these federal subjects — the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol —are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly ). But they do differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.
The modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:
administrative districts (raions)
cities/towns and urban-type settlements of federal subject significance
closed administrative-territorial formations
Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:
selsoviets (rural councils)
towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance
city districts
Spain[edit]
Main articles: Local government in Spain, Municipalities of Spain, and Comarcas of Spain
Spain is divided into 17 autonomous communities, which in turn are divided into 50 provinces. There are also two autonomous cities: those of Ceuta and Melilla. Finally, each province comprises a number of municipalities.
Each administrative entity is given powers, structure, and boundaries by a law that was passed by the Prime Minister .
Law 7/1985, [14] passed by the former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González Márquez (socialist), lays down the procedure of the Local Government. Every city in Spain used this Law until 2003. This year, the former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar López (conservative), passed a Law (57/2003) [15] to modernize organic rules of those cities which had more than 250,000 inhabitants, and other important cities (like capital cities of provinces with at least 175,000 inhabitants). Also, it exists two other important Laws for specifically Madrid (Law 22/2006) [16] and Barcelona (Law 1/2006). [17] The main governing body in most municipalities is called Ayuntamiento (in the less populated municipalities an alternative local organization system called open council, "concejo abierto ", is used). The Ayuntamiento in turn is formed by the Plenary (el Pleno, the collective formed by the city councillors) and the Mayor. The number of members that compose The Plenary varies depending on city's population (for example, since 2007 Valencia has 33 members and Pamplona has 27). The name given to the members of the Plenary is councillor (concejal ). Those councillors are elected between city's inhabitants every four years by direct vote. After being elected, councillors meet in a special Plenary session to determine who will be elected, between them, as city's Mayor. In the next days after the election, the mayor chooses some councillors to set up the executive governing body (Junta de Gobierno or Comisión de Gobierno ). After that, and for the next four years, city's mayor and the Junta de Gobierno will govern over the city according to their competences (urbanism, some taxes, local police, licenses for specific activities, cleaning services, etc.). Meanwhile, councillors in the Plenary but not part of the Junta de Gobierno (the opposition) will oversee Mayor's rule.
The autonomous community of Catalonia is divided in 4 provinces and more than 900 municipalities. Between these two tiers, there are 41 comarques (singular, comarca ), roughly equivalent to 'district' or 'county'. The comarca is a commonwealth, or union, of municipalities with competences in several fields (Law 6/1987 of the Parliament of Catalonia).
Sweden[edit]
Main articles: Municipalities of Sweden and County councils of Sweden
Every fourth year general elections are held in Sweden to elect members of the national parliament, 20 county council assemblies and 290 municipal assemblies. As the parliament elects the national government, the local assemblies elect their executive committees and their boards. Members in local committees and boards are elected proportionally by the political parties in the assemblies, giving all the major parties representation. The parties usually cooperate well on the local levels.
The county councils (landsting) are responsible for health care and usually provide transportation.
The municipalities (kommuner) are responsible for:
social services, childcare, preschool, elderly care
primary and secondary education
planning and building
health protection, water, sewerage, refuse, emergency services
On a voluntary basis, the municipalities provide sports, culture, housing, energy as well as commercial service.
The activities are financed by income taxes. Swedes pay around 20% of their taxable income to the municipality and around 11% to the county council. (The national government is financed by VAT and payroll taxes and fees.)

United Kingdom[edit]
The system of local government is different in each of the four home nations of the UK. In total there are 426 local authorities in the UK. 346 of these are in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 32 in Scotland and 22 are in Wales.
England[edit]
Main article: Local government in England
See also: Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England
The most complex system is in England, the result of numerous reforms and reorganisation over the centuries.
The top-level of sub-national administration within England until the end of March 2012 consisted of the nine regions. The regions were used by central government for various statistical purposes, and Government Offices and assorted other institutions including Regional Development Agencies. Regional Government Offices, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Ministers were all abolished by the Cameron ministry in 2010. Only the London region which is a sub-region compared to the other regions of England has a directly elected government.  Only one regional referendum has been held to date to seek consent for the introduction of direct elections elsewhere — in the northeast of England — and this was overwhelmingly rejected by the electorate.
The layers of elected local government vary. In different areas the highest tier of elected local government may be:
counties, which may be
single-tier unitary authorities, or
divided into districts (also known as boroughs in some areas)
districts, which are separate unitary authorities in some areas
metropolitan districts (also called metropolitan boroughs) in some areas which are similar to unitary authorities, but have joint boards with other districts in the same metropolitan county
Greater London, which is divided into 32 London boroughs and the City of London
In most areas there is a lower tier of government, civil parishes, with limited functions. Most civil parishes are in rural areas, but if the parish is a town the parish council may be called a town council. In a few cases the parish is a city, and the parish council is called a city council .
Metropolitan counties, and a few non-metropolitan counties, no longer have elected councils or administrative functions, and their former functions are performed by districts. Such counties remain ceremonial counties .
Northern Ireland[edit]
Main article: Local government in Northern Ireland
Since 1 April 2015 Northern Ireland is divided into 11 districts. Local government in Northern Ireland does not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Scotland[edit]

Local government in Scotland is arranged on the lines of unitary authorities, with the nation divided into 32 council areas .
Wales[edit]

Wales has a uniform system of 22 unitary authorities, variously styled as county, county borough, city or city and county local authorities. There are also communities, equivalent to parishes.
North America[edit]
Canada[edit]
Main article: Local government in Canada
Canada has a federal system with three orders of government. The largest is the federal government, followed by the provincial and local governments. [18] Municipal governments are separately elected. They must follow laws and guidelines as set out by their province, but are allowed to pass additional by-laws and acts unique to them.
Mexico[edit]
Mexico is a Federal Republic made up by 31 states and a federal district. Each state is divided in municipios, while the federal district is divided in sixteen delegaciones. Twenty-nine states of Mexico were created as administrative divisions by the constitution of 1917, which grants them those powers not expressly vested in the federal government; Mexico's two remaining territories, Baja California Sur and Quintana Roo, achieved statehood on 9 October 1974, raising the total to 31. Each state has a constitution, a governor elected for six years, and a unicameral legislature, with representatives elected by district vote in proportion to population. An ordinary session of the legislature is held annually, and extraordinary sessions may be called by the governor or the permanent committee. Bills may be introduced by legislators, by the governor, by the state supreme court, and by municipalities (a unit comparable to a US county). In addition to the 31 states, there is also one federal district comprising Mexico City, whose governor serves as a member of the cabinet. Many state services are supported by federal subsidies.
The principal unit of state government is the municipality. Mexico's 2,378 municipalities are governed by municipal presidents and municipal councils. State governors generally select the nominees for the municipal elections. Municipal budgets are approved by the respective state governors. Until 1997, the president appointed the mayor of Mexico City. Political reforms allowed the first open elections in 1997, and Cuauhtémoc Cardenas Solórzano became Mexico City's first elected mayor.
United States[edit]

Local government in the United States refers to governmental jurisdictions below the level of the state. Most states have at least two tiers of local government: counties and municipalities. In some states, counties are divided into townships. There are several different types of jurisdictions at the municipal level, including the city, town, parish, borough, village, reservations and boundaries.  The types and nature of these municipal entities varies from state to state.

Local government is the third type of government in Australia, after Federal and State.
New Zealand[edit]
Main article: Local government in New Zealand
New Zealand has a local government system comprising two complementary sets of local authorities— regional councils and territorial authorities. There are 78 local authorities consisting of:
11 regional councils, which cover much of New Zealand’s land area, and
67 territorial authorities (comprising 53 district councils, 12 city councils and 2 other councils).
Six of the territorial authorities are unitary authorities, which also have the powers of a regional council. They are Auckland Council, Nelson City Council, the Gisborne, Marlborough and Tasman district councils, and Chatham Islands Council.
Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas territorial authorities are based on community of interest and road access. Within a regional council area there are usually many city or district councils, although city and district councils can be in multiple regional council areas.
South America[edit]
Argentina[edit]
Argentina is a federation of 23 provinces and the federal capital of Buenos Aires. During the 19th century there was a bitter struggle between Buenos Aires and the interior provinces, and there has long been an element of tension regarding the division of powers between the central government and provincial bodies. The federal government retains control over such matters as the regulation of commerce, customs collections, currency, civil or commercial codes, or the appointment of foreign agents. The provincial governors are elected every four years.
The constitutional "national intervention" and "state of siege" powers of the president have been invoked frequently. The first of these powers was designed to "guarantee the republican form of government in the provinces." Since the adoption of the 1853 constitution, the federal government has intervened over 200 times, mostly by presidential decree. Under this authority, provincial and municipal offices may be declared vacant, appointments annulled, and local elections supervised. Between 1966 and 1973, all local legislatures were dissolved and provincial governors were appointed by the new president. A restoration of provincial and municipal government followed the return to constitutional government in 1973. After the March 1976 coup, the federal government again intervened to remove all provincial governors and impose direct military rule over all municipalities. Since 1983, representative local government has been in force again.
Until 1996, the President appointed the mayor of Buenos Aires, and by law, the president and Congress controlled any legislation that affected the city. Constitutional reforms that year led to an elected mayoral position, and a 60-member Poder Legislativo (legislative power).
Brazil[edit]
Main article: Municipalities of Brazil
Brazil is a federation consisting of 27 federative units: 26 states and one Federal District. Government exists at three levels: federal, state, and municipal. The states are subdivided into 5,570 municipalities, while the Federal District has no municipalities (divided into administrative regions instead) and has powers of both a state and a municipality..
Municipal government consists of an executive branch headed by a mayor (Prefeito/Prefeita ), and a legislative branch (Câmara Municipal), serving four-year terms. Municipalities are enshrined in the constitution of 1988 as entities of the federation; their responsibilities are distinct from the other two levels in theory, [19] but overlap in practice (eg. education, health, transportation). [20] With their broad powers, municipalities may create their own constitutions, termed organic law, and cannot be overruled by state governments. [20]
Elections at the municipal level follow a similar, partisan system to state and federal elections, but take place in different years. Municipalities may have anywhere from 9 to 55 members of the Câmara Municipal, depending on the population. [21] There is no minimum or maximum population requirement for municipalities: while the average population of a municipality in 2005 was 30,099, Borá, São Paulo state (the least populous) had only 823 inhabitants, while São Paulo (the largest) had 10.9 million inhabitants. [20] Municipalities within a state may choose to merge or separate with approval in a plebiscite and enacting of a state law. [22]
Paraguay[edit]
Paraguay is divided into 17 departments, which are subdivided into districts, which, in turn, comprise municipalities (the minimum requirement for a municipality is 3,000 persons) and rural districts (partidos). A governor, elected by popular vote, runs each department. Municipal government is exercised through a municipal board, chosen by direct election, and an executive department. In the principal cities and capitals, the executive department is headed by a mayor appointed by the minister of the interior; in other localities, the mayor is appointed by the presidents of the municipal boards. Police chiefs are appointed by the central government.
Peru[edit]
Peru is divided into 25 regions and the province of Lima. Each region has an elected government composed of a president and council that serve four-year terms. [23] These governments plan regional development, execute public investment projects, promote economic activities, and manage public property. [24] The province of Lima is administered by a city council. [25] The goal of devolving power to regional and municipal governments was among others to improve popular participation. NGOs played an important role in the decentralisation process and still influence local politics. [26]
Uruguay[edit]
Uruguay's administrative subdivisions consisted of nineteen territories called departments and governed by intendencias, which were subordinate to the central government and responsible for local administration. They enforced national laws and administered the nation's social and educational policies and institutions within their territories. These territories had limited taxing powers, but they could borrow funds and acquire property. They also had the power to establish unpaid five-member local boards or town councils in municipalities other than the departmental capital if the population was large enough to warrant such a body.
Executive authority was vested in a governor (intendente), who administered the department, and in a thirty-one-member departmental board (junta departmental), which carried out legislative functions. These functions included approval of the departmental budget and judicial actions, such as impeachment proceedings against departmental officials, including the governor. At the municipal level, a mayor (intendente municipal) assumed executive and administrative duties, carrying out resolutions made by the local board (whose members were appointed on the basis of proportional representation of the political parties). The governor was required to comply with and enforce the constitution and the laws and to promulgate the decrees enacted by the departmental board. The governor was authorized to prepare the budget, submit it for approval to the departmental board, appoint the board's employees, and, if necessary, discipline or suspend them. The governor represented the department in its relations with the national government and other departmental governments and in the negotiation of contracts with public or private agencies.
Like the governor, the members of the departmental board and the mayor were elected for five-year terms in direct, popular elections. A governor could be reelected only once, and candidates for the post had to meet the same requirements as those for a senator, in addition to being a native of the department or a resident therein for at least three years before assuming office. Departmental board members had to be at least twenty-three years of age, native born (or a legal citizen for at least three years), and a native of the department (or a resident for at least three years).
The board sat in the capital city of each department and exercised jurisdiction throughout the entire territory of the department. It could issue decrees and resolutions that it deemed necessary either on the suggestion of the governor or on its own initiative. It could approve budgets, fix the amount of taxes, request the intervention of the Accounts Tribunal for advice concerning departmental finances or administration, and remove from office—at the request of the governor—members of nonelective local departmental boards. The board also supervised local public services; public health; and primary, secondary, preparatory, industrial, and artistic education. Although Montevideo was the smallest department in terms of area (divided into twenty-three geographic zones that generally coincided with the electoral zones), its departmental board had sixty-five members in 1990; all other departments had thirty-one-member boards and a five-member executive council appointed by the departmental board, with proportional representation from the principal political parties.

Levels of Government:  How Federal, State, and Local Government Work Together
posted in: Elections| 0
There are 3 levels of government in the U.S.: federal, state, and local.  All levels of government must obey the U.S. and State Constitutions.  The U.S. Constitution gives the federal government certain powers and assigns all other powers to the state governments.  State governments establish the local governments within their territories and delegate certain powers to them.
Each level of government is divided into 3 branches: the legislative branch (makes the laws), the executive branch (carries out the laws), and the judicial branch (applies the laws to specific court cases and interprets the laws).
The federal government produces currency, regulates taxes, establishes federal welfare programs and foreign policy. It oversees the defense of the country and makes laws that affect the nation as a whole.  The federal government ensures cooperation of state and local governments by providing funds to operate federal programs, such as affordable health insurance, building roads, airports, highway systems, and pollution control.
The state government oversees affairs within state borders. It raises income taxes and oversees state welfare programs, such as Medicaid.  It also controls the state criminal code, maintains state roads, and carries out federal laws and programs at the state level. State and local courts hear cases and interpret the state constitution and laws.  State and local governments work together to operate schools and ensure they meet state standards.
Local Government – Counties/Cities & Towns. States are divided into areas which carry out state laws within a specific geographic location.  Cities, town, and counties are granted specific powers by the state. In Virginia, counties and cities are separate units, independent of each other. However, towns are part of a county. Citizens of each county, town, or city elect representatives to govern them.  A county has a board of supervisors. Towns or cities have mayors and councils to oversee the delivery of public services.  Local government responsibilities include managing most public services, such as parks, libraries, schools, police, and fire services.  Local governments solve common problems, such as funding police and fire departments and education. They also work to lessen air pollution

Okay, so I've read through these documents about local government. Let me try to make sense of all this information.

First, I need to understand what local government is. From Doc 1, it says that local government is the government of a town, city, or county, and it's subordinate to the state and federal governments. So, it's the level of government that's closest to the people, handling day-to-day services and local issues.

Doc 2 talks about local government in simpler terms, explaining that it's like the city, town, or county government, with mayors, city councils, and other officials who are elected by the people living there. It also mentions that local governments have to follow both state and federal laws.

Doc 3 seems to be a study guide for fourth-grade social studies, focusing on local government. It reinforces that local government is the smallest level, below state and federal, and that it's involved in things like schools, roads, and parks.

Doc 4 is a Wikipedia article, which provides a more comprehensive overview of local government around the world. It mentions that local government structures vary greatly between countries, but generally, they have limited powers compared to higher levels of government.

Doc 5 is from the League of Women Voters, and it explains the different levels of government in the U.S., focusing on how federal, state, and local governments work together.

So, to sum up, local government is the tier of government that deals with local issues and services, operating below the state and federal levels. It's responsible for things like schools, roads, parks, and other community services. Now, I need to understand how it works in practice.

From Doc 1, it lists some common responsibilities of local governments, such as running the police department, managing local schools, collecting property taxes, and maintaining public spaces. It also mentions that local governments have three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial, similar to higher levels of government.

Doc 2 emphasizes that local governments are the most directly controlled by ordinary people because of their smaller size, and that they have to abide by both state and federal laws.

Doc 3 reiterates that local governments manage public services and are accountable to their constituents through elections.

Doc 4 provides a global perspective, showing that while the specifics vary, the concept of local government exists worldwide, with various names and structures.

Doc 5 explains how federal, state, and local governments interact, with the federal government providing funds for local programs and the state governments establishing local governments and delegating powers to them.

I think it's important to understand how local governments are structured and how they get their authority. Doc 1 mentions that local governments receive most of their funding through property taxes, but notes that tax assessment is handled by state governments.

Doc 2 touches on the idea that local governments are the most accessible level, where citizens can have the most direct impact.

Doc 3 highlights that local governments are responsible for implementing federal and state laws at the local level, like ensuring school lunches meet federal standards.

Doc 4 explains that in federal systems, local government is often a third or fourth tier, while in unitary states, it might be a second or third tier.

Doc 5 clearly outlines the division of powers, with the federal government handling national issues, the state government overseeing state-wide matters, and local governments managing local affairs, all working together through funding and delegation of responsibilities.

I'm also interested in how local governments are organized in different parts of the world. Doc 4 provides examples from various countries, showing the diversity in local government structures. For instance, in the U.S., it's a three-tier system, while in other countries, it might be different.

Given that, perhaps I should look into how local government works in a specific context, like in Virginia, since Doc 5 mentions it.

Wait, Doc 5 is about Virginia's local government, specifically mentioning that counties and cities are separate units, and towns are part of a county. That seems interesting and a bit different from what I thought.

So, in Virginia, there are counties, cities, and towns, each with their own governing structures. Cities are independent and not part of any county, while towns are part of counties. Counties have a board of supervisors, and cities and towns have mayors and councils.

This seems like a good starting point. Maybe I should focus on understanding the differences between counties, cities, and towns in Virginia.

Additionally, Doc 5 mentions that local governments are responsible for public services like parks, libraries, schools, police, and fire services. It also notes that they work together to fund these services and address issues like pollution.

I wonder how decision-making works in local governments. Are there specific processes for passing laws or allocating budgets?

From Doc 1, it seems that local governments have legislative bodies like city councils or county commissions that pass ordinances and manage budgets.

Doc 2 mentions that local governments are led by elected officials who act similarly to governors, congressmen, and presidents.

Doc 3 talks about the three branches of local government, with the executive led by a mayor and the legislative by a city council.

Doc 4 confirms that local governments have executive, legislative, and judicial branches, though the specifics vary.

Doc 5 explains that local governments have mayors and councils that oversee the delivery of public services and manage local affairs.

I think understanding the roles of mayors and city councils would be helpful. Maybe I should look into that.

A mayor is typically the chief executive of a municipality, responsible for overseeing the administration and enforcing laws. The city council is the legislative body that makes ordinances and appropriates funds.

In some places, there might be a council-manager form of government, where a professional city manager handles the day-to-day operations, and the mayor and council set policies.

I recall that some cities have strong-mayor systems, where the mayor has more executive power, while others have weak-mayor systems, where the mayor has mostly ceremonial duties and the city council holds more power.

Perhaps I should see what type of system is in place in Virginia.

Looking back at Doc 5, it mentions that cities and towns have mayors and councils, but doesn't specify the type of system.

Maybe I need to look for more specific information on Virginia's local government structure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a general overview of different types of local government structures.

Let me consider doing another search.

What Are Four Types of Local Government?
By Staff Writer Last Updated April 11, 2020
Witold Skrypczak/Getty Images
The four types of local governments are counties, townships, special districts and municipalities. Generally, counties cover the largest area. These governments are typically charged with enforcing state laws inside its boundaries. This involves peacekeeping, taxation, road and bridge repair, marriage and death records and property deeds.
Townships are not found in all states, and their responsibilities vary based on their locations. Special districts have distinct functions. One example is the local school district, which oversees education within a particular geographic location. Municipalities are cities, towns or boroughs that have been identified by their states. Typically, municipalities are run by mayors or city managers.

Characteristics and Types
Although there are special-purpose local government bodies (e.g., school boards in the United States), more important are those that carry out a broad range of public activities within a defined area and population. Almost all such local government bodies share certain characteristics: a continuing organization; the authority to undertake public activities; the ability to enter into contracts; the right to sue and be sued; and the ability to collect taxes and determine a budget. Areas of local government authority usually include public schools, local highways, municipal services, and some aspects of social welfare and public order. An important distinction among types of local government is that between representative bodies, which are elected locally and have decision-making authority, and nonrepresentative bodies, which are either appointed from above or, if elected locally, have no independent governing authority. While most countries have complex systems of local government, those of France and Great Britain have served as models for much of the rest of the world.
The French system is among the most nonrepresentative. Its basic structure, codified by Napoleon I, developed out of the need of revolutionary France to curtail the power of local notables, while hastening government reform. It stresses clear lines of authority, reaching from the central government's ministry of the interior through the centrally appointed prefect of the department to the municipality, which has a locally elected mayor and municipal council. The prefect, being both the chief executive of the department and the representative of the central bureaucracy, provides the channel of centralization, with wide authority to overrule local councils and supervise local expenditures. Variants of this system are found throughout Europe and in former French colonies.
The British system of local government, which has been the model for most of that country's former colonies, including the United States, is the most representative of the major types. Largely reformed in the 19th cent. and extensively restructured in the 1970s, the system stresses local government autonomy through elected councils on the county and subcounty levels. This system was marked by less central government interference and greater local budgetary authority than in other systems. However, in 1986, six major county governments were abolished by Parliament, while the powers of others were restricted. A special feature of the British system is its use of an extensive committee system, instead of a strong executive, for supervising the administration of public services.
Despite differences among states, local governments of the United States follow the general principles of the British system, except that a strong executive is common. The county remains the usual political subdivision, although it has retained more authority in rural than in urban areas, where incorporated municipalities (see city government) have most of the local power. In both rural and urban areas the local government's relationship to the state is a complex one of shared authority and carefully defined areas of legal competence. Local governments are pulled two ways, increasingly reliant on state and federal funding to carry out their expected duties, while fearful of losing their traditional degree of local control.

Jenny has masters' degrees in public health and public administration.
Local governments operate at the municpal, county, or city level and include bodies of elected and non-elected officials who are citizens. Learn the definition of a local government and how it's structured to fit into the federalist system of the United States government. Updated: 12/20/2021
What Is Local Government?
Have you ever been waiting at the bus stop and noticed the sanitation workers cleaning up your neighborhood and collecting garbage? These people work for the local government. Your teachers at school, the cafeteria workers, and the people who create the public park you play in before dinner -these are all local government workers!
Local government is the smallest form of the three types of government. The federal government oversees the entire country, and the state government oversees an entire state. Meanwhile, the local governments oversee the smaller areas that make up a state, like cities and towns. Mayors, city council members, and county commissioners, among other officials, help lead local governments. These are usually elected positions.

The Structure of Local Government
There are two basic levels of local government:
A county government oversees the larger county.
A municipal government oversees a smaller municipality (usually located within a county), such as a town, city, or village.
Let's take a look at an example. Chicago is a city with its own city government, and this city is located within Cook County, which has a county government.
Local governments can also be divided up into special districts that have specific purposes. One common example is the school district. A school district often covers several cities and towns, and it acts like its own municipality with appointed and elected officials.
Federalism in the United States
The United States is a federalist system of government, where powers are divided between the federal (national) and state governments. The state gives power and sets limitations for local governments. While each level of government (state, local, and federal) has its own set of responsibilities, they also carry out many of the same jobs.
In some cases, the local government has to carry out a federal or state law or mandate. For instance, the federal government passed the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act saying that school lunches and food sold in school had to be healthy. The federal government set the rule, but local school districts look over the ingredients in the food served, order fruits and vegetables, set the menu, and make sure schools are following the law.

Alright, so from these new documents, I'm getting more information about the types and structures of local government.

Doc 1 lists four types of local government: counties, townships, special districts, and municipalities. It explains that counties cover the largest area and are responsible for enforcing state laws, while townships are not present in all states and have varying responsibilities. Special districts have specific functions, like school districts, and municipalities include cities, towns, and boroughs, often led by mayors or city managers.

Doc 2, from Infoplease, provides a more detailed look at local government characteristics and types. It compares the French and British systems, noting that the French system is more non-representative, with a strong central authority, while the British system is more representative, with elected local councils having significant autonomy. The U.S. system follows the British model but incorporates a strong executive role.

Doc 3 is similar to the earlier documents, explaining local government in simple terms suitable for kids, emphasizing that local governments handle day-to-day services and are led by elected officials like mayors and city council members.

Doc 4 offers a list of facts about local government, touching on variations across different countries, such as Egypt, Mali, Bangladesh, and Israel. It highlights the decentralized nature of local government and how it operates under the oversight of higher levels of government.

Doc 5 appears to be flashcards summarizing key points about local government structures, particularly focusing on counties and municipalities in the U.S., distinguishing between the supervisor system and the council-executive system.

From these documents, I can see that local government structures vary significantly around the world, but in the U.S., they typically operate under a system that combines elements of representation and executive authority, often modeled after the British system but with American adaptations.

I think I have a better grasp now of what local government is, its responsibilities, and how it fits into the broader framework of government at the state and federal levels. It's clear that local government plays a crucial role in delivering essential services and managing community affairs, all while operating within the parameters set by higher levels of government.

I should probably explore more specific aspects next, like how local governments are funded, how they make decisions, and some of the challenges they face. Maybe I'll look into case studies or examples from particular cities or counties to see these concepts in action.
