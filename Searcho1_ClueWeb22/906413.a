So I have this question: "Why do people break the law?" It seems like a simple question, but I think there's a lot more to it than meets the eye. I mean, laws are made to maintain order and safety in society, right? So why would anyone want to break them?

First off, I guess I should understand what laws are and their purpose. Laws are rules established by a authority, like a government, to regulate behavior within society. They cover a wide range of actions, from criminal activities like theft and murder to more minor infractions like speeding or littering. The idea is that by having these rules in place, society can function more smoothly and fairly.

But not everyone follows these laws. Some people choose to break them, and there must be reasons behind that. I think there are various factors that contribute to why people decide to engage in illegal activities. Maybe it's because they don't agree with the law, or perhaps they feel pressured by circumstances to break the law.

Let me try to brainstorm some possible reasons. One reason could be financial gain. A lot of crimes, like theft or fraud, are motivated by the desire for money. People might feel that they can't make enough money through legitimate means, so they turn to illegal activities to supplement their income.

Another reason might be peer pressure. Especially among young people, the influence of friends can be strong. If someone's friends are involved in illegal activities, they might feel pressured to join in to fit in or avoid being ostracized.

Also, some people might break the law out of desperation. For example, someone who is homeless and hungry might steal food because they have no other way to feed themselves.

Then there's the issue of mental health. People with certain mental illnesses might not understand the consequences of their actions or have impaired judgment, leading them to break the law.

Additionally, some laws might be seen as unjust or oppressive by certain groups, so they might choose to protest or resist by breaking those laws. This is often referred to as civil disobedience.

I also think that easy access to opportunities to commit crimes can play a role. For example, if someone lives in an area with lots of unlocked houses, they might be tempted to burglarize them because it's easy to do so.

Moreover, the justice system itself can sometimes contribute to people breaking the law. If the penalties for certain crimes are perceived as too harsh, some people might feel that they have nothing to lose by committing more crimes.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe there's research or theories in sociology or psychology that explain why people break the law.

For example, many of the friendliest citizens break the speeding law when they witness someone else get away with speeding. This shows that if one citizen speeds, another one will want to also speed since the first citizen did not get caught. Another reason that supports Trippett’s argument is that many normal people are harassed into breaking the law and do not even realize it. For example, if you are going the speed limit and someone honks their horn at another citizen, their natural instinct is to go faster, which would break the law. This shows that a citizen will follow the law, but those around him will not and influence him to break it.

How Did Jim Crow Laws Impact Society

Although laws are put in place to protect the citizens on which it is enforced, no system of government is perfect. There are times in which laws are passed that have a controversial effect on society, be it the segregation of race or religion, or the NSA spying on US citizens. Based on this, it can be concluded that civil disobedience is a peaceful way to express the unjustness of a law in hopes of change.

Why People Break the Law
Posted on June 28, 2014
Why do people break the law? That is a question that society has been asking for centuries, and it’s still relevant today. I often wonder this because I see people break laws every time I get in my car and drive down the road, every time I stand in line at a store, and in life in general. There are many reasons why laws are broken, but some reasons are more popular than others, and I am determined to see what those are. Whether one commits blue collar/street crimes, or one commits white collar and/or green collar (environmental) crimes, the law is the law.

I often wonder why people choose to obey some laws and not others. I often wonder about what society would be like without laws. All of these wonders, my curiosity, and my desire to answer (or at least attempt to answer) as best as I can has propelled me to research this subject.

Throughout centuries many theories have been studied to understand why people commit crimes and why they engaged in anti-social behavior. It may sound simple but scientist and criminologist have struggled to answer this question. There is not a central reason that leads a person to engage in a criminal behavior but there are numerous of factors that contribute for one person to break the laws. Several theories have been analyzed and studied by criminologists but the criminal justice system not only relies in one theory why people commit crimes. I believe that the sociological, psychological and biological factors lead people to commit crimes. And that this factor plays such as important role in the offender life. At the beginning the theory of crimes was dominated by the church and the state they thought that people engage in criminal behavior because they were possessed. Therefore, people are not responsible for behavior or crimes, because they cannot control their behavior. They did not act by choice but by an evil possession or entity that lived inside; no free will. The demonology theory does not apply because today the members of the church are committing crimes.  There has been many case the nuns became pregnant and the priests abused children. However, I consider that externals factor contribute to the breaking of laws. Factors such as poor parenting skills, society and your childhood development

Why Do People Commit Crimes?
Here is an intorduction to a Sociological essay I recently completed for my University studies on the social reasons why people commit crimes.

Why Do People Commit Crimes?
People commit crimes for a variety of different reasons. Maybe they would like some material gain which they could otherwise not afford, or perhaps they find their life mundane and repetitive and need some excitement. This question, if answered correctly, can have a massive impact on society as a whole. As with the new right and many other sociological theories, sociologists can have a big impact upon the laws and ideas which govern us. For example, family tax credits. These were brought about as the new right believed the family to be an integral part of society.
	Before I attempt to answer why people commit crimes, we have to decipher what type of crimes people commit. There are many different types of crime, and each has different reasoning behind it. Anti-utilitarian crime is perhaps the most seen in our everyday lives, such as graffiti and theft for no material gain. There are also 'Career Criminals' who commit crime on an everyday basis as means to get what they otherwise could not afford and to support themselves in society.
	There are also many sociological perspectives that approach this question in various ways. The functionalists see crime as a 'Safety valve'. For example, they suggest that if there is no crime, how do you know that there is a problem? Crime then from a functionalist view, is useful as it shows that there is a problem and it needs to be addressed. According to Merton, the American dream causes people to experience pressure to deviate from social norms in order to achieve success in terms of material wealth, even if this means turning to crime. Merton refers to this theory as a 'Strain to Anomie' or Strain Theory. However, the point remains that why is it that some people commit crime, when others do not.
	People are said to deviate because the disciplines and authority of society are so flawed that they offer few restraints or moral direction (Rock '07). This is an example of Anomie. Anomie is one theory of explaining why people commit crime. Anomie means an absence, breakdown, confusion or conflict in the norms of society and is most widely recognised with the work of Durkheim and Merton.  Merton's work shifts the meaning from Durkheim's as a cause of suicide, and places it on deviating from the socially accepted means of material gain. In his classic study 'Social structure and Anomie' he developed anomie and provided an answer for why people commit crime. He proposed that people deviate from the accepted means of material gain as the economic resources in society enables only certain privileged groups to succeed. As they are all chasing the 'American Dream' then, they turn to various forms of individual deviance which seems to offer an alternative means to the same desired end (Merton '38).

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why do people break the law?" It seems pretty straightforward, but I suspect there's more depth to it than meets the eye. Laws are meant to maintain order and ensure safety in society, so why would anyone choose to break them?

First, I need to understand what laws are and their purpose. Laws are rules established by authorities, like governments, to regulate behavior within society. They cover a broad spectrum, from serious offenses like murder and theft to lesser infractions like speeding or littering. The idea is that these rules help society function smoothly and fairly.

But not everyone abides by these laws. Some people choose to break them, and there must be reasons behind that choice. I think there are various factors that contribute to why people decide to engage in illegal activities. Maybe they disagree with the law, or perhaps they feel pressured by circumstances to break it.

Let me try to brainstorm some possible reasons. One major reason could be financial gain. Many crimes, such as theft or fraud, are motivated by the desire for money. People might feel that they can't earn enough through legitimate means, so they turn to illegal activities to supplement their income.

Another reason might be peer pressure. Especially among young people, the influence of friends can be powerful. If someone's friends are involved in illegal activities, they might feel pressured to join in to fit in or avoid being ostracized.

Desperation could also be a factor. For example, someone who is homeless and hungry might steal food because they have no other way to feed themselves.

Additionally, mental health issues can play a role. People with certain mental illnesses might not understand the consequences of their actions or have impaired judgment, leading them to break the law.

Some laws might be seen as unjust or oppressive by certain groups, so they might choose to protest or resist by breaking those laws. This is often referred to as civil disobedience.

Moreover, easy access to opportunities to commit crimes can be a temptation. For example, if someone lives in an area with lots of unlocked houses, they might be tempted to burglarize them because it's easy to do so.

Also, the justice system itself can sometimes contribute to people breaking the law. If the penalties for certain crimes are perceived as too harsh, some people might feel that they have nothing to lose by committing more crimes.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe there's research or theories in sociology or psychology that explain why people break the law.
