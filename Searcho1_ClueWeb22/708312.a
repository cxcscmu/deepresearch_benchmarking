So I've got this question about how cultural perceptions of time influence international business. I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I know that different cultures have different attitudes towards time, and that can probably cause some issues when people from those cultures try to work together in a business setting. I need to figure out how these differences affect international business and maybe come up with some examples to illustrate that.

First, I should probably understand what is meant by "cultural perceptions of time." I think it refers to how different societies view and manage time. Some cultures might be very rigid and stick strictly to schedules and deadlines, while others might be more flexible and not see tardiness as a big issue. That could lead to misunderstandings in business dealings, right? Like, one party might get frustrated if the other is always late to meetings or doesn't meet deadlines.

I recall there's a concept in anthropology called monochronic and polychronic time. Maybe that's relevant here. Monochronic time is when people do one thing at a time and stick to schedules, whereas polychronic time is when people handle multiple things at once and are more flexible with time. If that's accurate, then businesses operating in monochronic time cultures might expect strict adherence to schedules, while those in polychronic cultures might be more laid back about time.

Let me see if I can find some information to confirm this. I'll probably need to look up some resources on cultural dimensions and international business. Maybe there are some famous examples of companies struggling with time perceptions in different markets.

Wait, perhaps I should start by understanding the dimensions of culture that affect business practices. I think there's something called Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. I remember hearing about that in a management class. It includes things like power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, and uncertainty avoidance. Is time perception part of that?

Actually, I think there's a dimension called "time orientation" or something similar. Maybe it's not in Hofstede's model. Let me check.

Long-term orientation and short-term orientation are cultural time orientations significant in a person's motivation. Learn about these concepts' definitions developed by Geert Hofstede and discover a detailed example of a situation that illustrates its importance. Updated: 09/17/2021
Definitions and Key Concepts
Geert Hofstede developed the concepts of short-term and long-term orientation, which we'll be exploring in this lesson. In fact, he developed five cultural dimensions: individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance index, long-term orientation and power distance. His original research of cultural dimensions involved a study of IBM employees from across the world.
Long-term orientation is when you are focused on the future. You are willing to delay short-term material or social success or even short-term emotional gratification in order to prepare for the future. If you have this cultural perspective, you value persistence, perseverance, saving and being able to adapt.
Short-term orientation is when you are focused on the present or past and consider them more important than the future. If you have a short-term orientation, you value tradition, the current social hierarchy and fulfilling your social obligations. You care more about immediate gratification than long-term fulfillment.
You should note that the concepts of long-term orientation and short-term orientation address the different ways cultures view time and the importance of the past, present and the future. Cultures demonstrating a short-term orientation will be more concerned with the past and present and will focus their efforts and beliefs on matters related to the short-term, while cultures demonstrating a long-term time orientation will be more concerned with the future and focus their efforts on future-orientated goals.

Why Is This Important?
Knowing about a person's cultural time orientation - whether they're short-term orientated or long-term orientated - is crucial information in management and in negotiations because it plays a large factor in motivation. Organizations and managers who know the time orientation of their employees will be able to fashion appropriate motivating incentives that align with their orientations, such as a bonus - a short-term incentive - or an additional contribution to an employee's retirement fund, which is a long-term orientated incentive. Cultural time orientation is also a crucial bit of information in cross-cultural negotiations, as illustrated in this example.
Additional Activities
Short-term vs Long-term Thought Questions
Research  Project
Use the Internet to read about Hofstede's work and find how various countries rank in his studies.  Which three countries are the most short-term oriented?  Which three countries are the most long-term oriented?  Are there similarities between the three short-term oriented countries?  If so, what are those similarities?  Are there similarities between the three long-term oriented countries?  If so, what are they?  Write a report that discusses Hofstede's work and what you have just discovered.
Group Discussion
Form a group of several people (say 4 to 6) and have each person answer the following questions:
Are you generally focused in life on the short term or the long term?
Regardless of which focus you have, how do you display this focus in how you live your life and make decisions?
Why do you believe you have developed this type of focus for your life?
Discussion Question
Hofstede's work, although with IBM employees, focused on variations between country cultures.  Do you think a company in a country will have the same short-term or long-term focus the country has?  For example, if UhOh Company is started in Old Xland and Old Xland has a short-term orientation, does UhOh Company have to have a culture that is also short-term oriented?  Why or why not?  If not, how could a company get its employees to change to a new orientation?  Discuss this with some other people without providing your thoughts and see what answers they give you.
Example Answer: Honda has plants in Japan and the US.  Japan is very long-term oriented, so the employees work to build their future and the company's future, ensuring their long-term financial needs are met.  However, people working for Honda in the US are more focused on what can be earned today to take care of immediate needs.  There is much less thought of the future, whether that future is for the person or for the company.  It would be extremely difficult to get a Japanese worker to think short-term and difficult to get a US worker to think long-term because of the culture in which they grew up.

Geert Hofstede's Dimensions of Culture
                                  and
                   Edward T. Hall's Time Orientations


Hofstede's "dimensions of culture" were derived mainly from his extensive organizational
anthropology research in the late 1970s and early 1980s – the scores are general comparisons of
values in the countries and regions he studied and can vary greatly within each country. Although
Hofstede's work is somewhat dated and has rightly been criticized on a number of grounds the
dimensions are useful in understanding that members of various societies are likely to behave in
different ways in a given situation.


Power Distance Index (PDI)             is defined as “the extent to which the less powerful members
of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed
unequally”. (Hofstede, 1994, p. 28) A High Power Distance ranking indicates that inequalities of
power and wealth exist within the society and that the less powerful members of the society accept
this situation. A Low Power Distance ranking indicates the society de-emphasizes the differences
between citizen's power and wealth. In these societies equality and opportunity for everyone is
stressed.


Individualism (IDV)           Hofstede defines this dimension as follows: “individualism pertains to
societies in which the ties between individuals are loose: everyone is expected to look after himself or
herself and his or her immediate family." A High Individualism ranking indicates that individuality and
individual rights are paramount within the society. A Low Individualism ranking typifies societies of a
more collectivist nature with close ties among its members. In these societies "…people from birth
onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive in-groups, which throughout people’s lifetime continue to
protect them in exchange for unquestioning loyalty.” (Hofstede, 1994, p. 51)


Masculinity (MAS)          focuses on the degree to which ‘masculine’ values like competitiveness and
the acquisition of wealth are valued over ‘feminine’ values like relationship building and quality of life.
A High Masculinity ranking indicates the society values assertive and aggressive 'masculine' traits.
A Low Masculinity ranking typifies societies in which nurturing and caring 'feminine' characteristics
predominate.


Uncertainty Avoidance Index (UAI)                   focuses on the level of tolerance for uncertainty and
ambiguity within the society. A High Uncertainty Avoidance ranking indicates the country has a low
tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity. This creates a rule-oriented society that institutes laws, rules,
regulations, and controls in order to reduce the amount of uncertainty. A Low Uncertainty
Avoidance ranking indicates the country has less concern about ambiguity and uncertainty and has
more tolerance for a diversity of opinions. This is reflected in a society that is less rule-oriented, more
readily accepts change, and takes more and greater risks.


Long-Term Orientation (LTO)                 (formerly called "Confucian dynamism") focuses on the
degree the society embraces, or does not embrace, long-term devotion to traditional values. A High
Long-Term Orientation ranking indicates the country prescribes to the values of long-term
commitments and respect for tradition and where long-term rewards are expected as a result of
today's hard work. A Low Long-Term Orientation ranking indicates the country does not reinforce
the concept of a long-term, traditional orientation and people expect short-term rewards from their
work.

f                      Edward T. Hall's Time Orientations
Anthropologist Edward T. Hall’s concept of polychronic versus monochronic time orientation describes
how cultures structure their time. The monochronic time concept follows the notion of “one thing at a
time”, while the polychronic concept focuses on multiple tasks being handled at one time, and time is
subordinate to interpersonal relations. The following table gives a brief overview of the two different
time concepts, and their resultant behaviour.

While Hall's publications 1 indicated countries or societies in each group, he did not conduct systematic
research to provide scores for individual countries or regions on a 'dimension' similar to Hofstede's
work. Direct observation of behavior in a society will readily identify the time orientation that is likely to
predominate in an organization.

Abstract
Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to critically examine, theoretically and empirically, the two time orientation dimensions – long‐term orientation (LTO) and future orientation (FO) – in the national culture models of Hofstede and GLOBE, respectively.
Design/methodology/approach
Following Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck's past‐present‐future theoretical lens, the Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO measures are analysed to understand the conceptual domain covered by these two dimensions. Next, the authors empirically examine the relationship of Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO with secondary data from Hofstede, GLOBE, and the World Values Survey.
Findings
This paper shows that Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO dimensions capture different aspects of time orientation of societies. In particular, Hofstede LTO focuses on past (tradition) versus future (thrift) aspect of societies, GLOBE FO practices capture the present versus future (planning) practices of societies, and GLOBE FO values reflect societal aspirations and preferences for planning.
Research limitations/implications
A specific implication of these findings is that the three dimensions of time orientation are not interchangeable since they represent different characteristics of societies. A wider implication for researchers is to ensure high level of precision in and congruence among construct labels, definitions and measures to avoid confusion and misapplication of cross‐cultural concepts.
Practical implications
In an increasingly globalized world, a clear understanding of societal time orientation will help managers deal more effectively with their counterparts in other countries.
Originality/value
The key contribution of this paper is in identifying and clarifying, both theoretically and empirically, the anomalies in the labels, definitions and measurement of Hofstede long‐term orientation and GLOBE future orientation national culture dimensions. It also shows a useful way forward for researchers on how to use these national culture dimensions to explain other phenomena of interest to cross‐cultural scholars.

Abstract
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically examine, theoretically and empirically, the two time orientation dimensions - long-term orientation (LTO) and future orientation (FO) - in the national culture models of Hofstede and GLOBE, respectively. Design/methodology/approach - Following Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck's past-present-future theoretical lens, the Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO measures are analysed to understand the conceptual domain covered by these two dimensions. Next, the authors empirically examine the relationship of Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO with secondary data from Hofstede, GLOBE, and the World Values Survey. Findings - This paper shows that Hofstede LTO and GLOBE FO dimensions capture different aspects of time orientation of societies. In particular, Hofstede LTO focuses on past (tradition) versus future (thrift) aspect of societies, GLOBE FO practices capture the present versus future (planning) practices of societies, and GLOBE FO values reflect societal aspirations and preferences for planning. Research limitations/implications - A specific implication of these findings is that the three dimensions of time orientation are not interchangeable since they represent different characteristics of societies. A wider implication for researchers is to ensure high level of precision in and congruence among construct labels, definitions and measures to avoid confusion and misapplication of cross-cultural concepts. Practical implications - In an increasingly globalized world, a clear understanding of societal time orientation will help managers deal more effectively with their counterparts in other countries. Originality/value - The key contribution of this paper is in identifying and clarifying, both theoretically and empirically, the anomalies in the labels, definitions and measurement of Hofstede long-term orientation and GLOBE future orientation national culture dimensions. It also shows a useful way forward for researchers on how to use these national culture dimensions to explain other phenomena of interest to cross-cultural scholars.

... Second, following previous work (Venaik, Zhu, & Brewer, 2013), we investigate the Hofstede and GLOBE frameworks as distinct aspects of temporal orientation and find evidence suggesting that the effect of the different conceptulizations on innovation process activities are not equivalent. Validating differences between these two temporal orientation frameworks is not trivial.  ...
... Sharing an emphasis on a time that lies ahead, Hofstede's LTO and GLOBE's future orientation display face validity of a common conceptual root. However, despite similarities between the two dimensions, distinct emphases are implicit in the two research programs (Venaik et al., 2013 ). Hofstede's LTO highlights thrift and perseverance (Hofstede, 2001: 359), while GLOBE's future orientation draws attention to planning and delayed gratification (Ashkanasy et al., 2004).  ...
... Future oriented societies, which display a high propensity to save, intrinsic motivation, and tendency to sacrifice present gratification for long-term success (Ashkanasy et al., 2004) provide a fruitful context for progressing through the development stage of innovation. Despite their conceptual similarity, we argue that GLOBE's future orientation emphasizes aspects of time orientation that are distinct from those emphasized in Hofstede's LTO (Venaik et al., 2013). Consequently, while we hypothesize that GLOBE's future orientation also positively affects innovation, we contend that it does so through different mechanisms.  ...

... The index is based mainly on IBM employees and covers 111 countries, of which we use 86 countries in this study (Hofstede, 2001;Falk et al., 2018). Different from economic time preference, thrift time preference focuses on the past and present (tradition and fulfilling social obligations) versus the future (perseverance and thrift) aspect of societies (Hofstede, 2001; Venaik et al., 2013). Therefore, more long-term-oriented people value virtues higher related to the future than the past and present (Hofstede, 2001).  ...
... Economic time preference measures immediate and delayed financial rewards using a representative sample (Falk et al., 2018), whereas thrift time preference measure past (tradition and fulfilling social obligations) versus future (perseverance and thrift) and Google time preference measures seeking for information about the next year compared to the last year. We use thrift time preference as it is commonly used to represent time preference, although it does not file under what we usually imagine under time preference, and its validity is questioned (Venaik et al., 2013; Hanushek et al., 2020). Moreover, Google time preference provides cost-efficient information on time preference for a considerably larger number of countries (112 instead of 76 for economic time preference).  ...

... Time orientation has a long history in the philosophy and psychology literature; as such it is also a commonly cited aspect of national culture [90]. It can be thought of as a delineation of the past, present, and future [91, 92], as well as the difference between a monochronic and polychronic time system [93]. (Punctuality is a third aspect of time orientation [94], which is not relevant for this study.)  ...

... Following Schein's (2017) multi-layer organizational culture framework as the theoretical underpinning, the theoretical framework that evolved from our work proposes a holistic theoretical illustration of how tourism and hospitality family firms can translate family-level values into firm-level business processes in enhancing financial performance. The rationale suggests that long-term-oriented values and entrepreneurial spirit provide a family firm with a better understanding of a pragmatic futuristic viewpoint instead of a conservative historical event (Venaik et al., 2013). This subsequently leads to the higher commitment of managers and employees to the success of the family firm above their individual interests and ultimately leads to superior financial performance (see Fig. 1).  ...

Alright, so I've got these search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's something about Hofstede's cultural dimensions, specifically long-term orientation versus short-term orientation. It seems like long-term orientation is about focusing on the future, being patient, saving, and adapting, while short-term orientation is about valuing the present and past, fulfilling social obligations, and seeking immediate gratification.

Then, there's another document that talks about Hofstede's dimensions and Edward T. Hall's time orientations, which are monochronic and polychronic. Monochronic is about doing one thing at a time, being strict with schedules, while polychronic is about handling multiple things simultaneously and being more flexible with time.

Another article is about comparing Hofstede's long-term orientation with GLOBE's future orientation, suggesting that they measure different aspects of time orientation in cultures.

From these, it seems like there are different ways to look at how cultures perceive time, and these perceptions can impact business practices.

Now, thinking about international business, differences in time perception could lead to misunderstandings or inefficiencies if not managed properly. For example, in a monochronic culture, being punctual and sticking to schedules is crucial, whereas in a polychronic culture, relationships and flexibility might be more important than strict adherence to time.

Similarly, in long-term oriented cultures, there might be more patience for slow-building relationships and long-term investments, while in short-term oriented cultures, there could be a greater emphasis on immediate results and quick returns.

So, in international business, companies need to be aware of these differences and adapt their approaches accordingly. For instance, when negotiating with partners from a polychronic culture, being rigid about meeting times might be seen as disrespectful or inefficient.

Alternatively, in a long-term oriented culture, building trust and relationships might be more important than rushing into business deals, whereas in a short-term oriented culture, getting things done quickly might be prioritized.

Moreover, in terms of management styles, a culture with high power distance might expect hierarchical decision-making and respect for authority, while a culture with low power distance might prefer more egalitarian and participative management.

Also, uncertainty avoidance could influence how comfortable people are with risk and ambiguity in business decisions.

So, it's clear that cultural dimensions, including time perceptions, play a significant role in international business. Companies need to understand these dimensions to effectively communicate, negotiate, and manage operations across different cultures.

Maybe I should look for some real-world examples to illustrate this.

The Perception of Time in different cultures
Not everyone in the world views the concept of time in the same way. In fact, some cultures don’t
even make time a part of their lives. Some cultures are wary of time passing by, while others run their
lives by the clock.
We identify three types of culture:
(1) present orientated, with little attention to what has happened in past and what the future will bring.
(2)past-orientated cultures have a high sense of their traditions, , traditionalism and aristocracy and
family.
(3) future-orientated cultures like making strategies and they focus on their future success.


For companies time is considered as an endless challenge they have to compete with..There is also a
cultural difference in how they deal with time. Some cultures tolerate or even expect delays in
appointments. But for example in Germany, Finland, USA and China time has a high value and has to
be precisely organized to keep business running. Any delay or disturbance would influence the whole
schedule of a manager. It might be helpful for the waiting person to get informed about any delay.

        In France it is similar but punctuality depends on the importance of the person. If the delay is
not more than 15 minutes, it is acceptable to wait.
        The Americans are used to work if necessary 70 hours a week just to reach their targets as
fast as possible. They want to have more money, bigger house, they want to be more famouse.. But
on the other hand they forget sometimes to care about their health and free time. Time pressure can
cause stress and if it becomes “negative stress” – that’s stress which can’t be managed – people get
sick and unproductive.
        A similar behaviour is reflected in German culture. . Time is considered as very rare and
expensive. That’s why time has to be well/perfectly organized. Keep somebody waiting is very rude
and impolite.

       Japan’s time perception is based on cultural norms and values. In Japan, working is
everything. There is no fine line between work and play like there is in the US. Their workday does not
have a rigid starting and ending time. They have been socialized to work as hard as they can and
never take breaks for personal reasons. The Japanese actually experience physical pain when have
nothing to do. They always have to keep busy, take as many work days as possible and as little
vacations as possible. They put the accent to planning , they also can´t stand delays. Japanese are
very loyal to their employer and they are used to work for one employer for their all life. The Japanese
also have a low tolerance of tardiness. Their trains are considered to be on time if the delay is less
than one minute. In Europe it is from 1 to 14 minutes.

In lesser developed countries such as Mexico, time and money are independent quantities. Just
because you have a lot of free time does not mean you must fill it up with work. There are not as many
job opportunities as in more developed countries, They live at their own pace and it is not dictated by
the machines and norms.
Mexicans agree that time is for enjoying their life. Letting time go is not a sin as it is for the US and
Japan. Being late for an appointment is not as important as your social relations. Their favourite word
is „manana“ which means tommorow or sometimes in the future..So cooperating with these countries
is not so easy for us. We must be very patient.

To describe planning in different cultures,
France, China and Finland are close behind each other on the Time horizon scale. This means that
they are more long-time orientated than in contrast the Germans who are planning in shorter periods
and least the Americans who manage their planning in very short terms. They often plan just quarterly
because of the fast moving market conditions in the States. If we look at Hong-Kong plans are made
for decades in advance. This means the are willing to wait for 10-20 years until their investments will
return into profit, but these are then “super profits”.

Introduction
This
lesson examines how different cultures perceive and manage time and how this affects
international project/programme purpose activities.
1. The use of time.
Time
  is a fundamental aspect of human experience. Different
  cultures, however, think about time and use time in very different ways. The pace of life, the allocation of time, the
  economy of time, the scheduling of tasks, the metaphors of time and perceptions of
  temporal dimensions convey powerful messages about how a culture functions within itself
  and with the outside world.
The
  simple situation of showing up twenty minutes late to a project/programme purpose meeting, for example,
  carries little importance in some cultures. In
  others, however, punctuality is considered so vital that unannounced lateness can lead to
  project/programme purpose deadlock and failure. For
  example, in International
  Dimensions of Organizational Behavior the
  researcher Nancy Adler cites the case of an
  American engineer working in the Middle East.T he American was surprised by his Bahrainian action sponsor/beneficiary’s
  reaction when he announced that, due to unforeseen problems, the plant under construction
  would not be ready to open until six months after the originally scheduled date. The Bahrainian replied simply, “We have lived
  for thousands of years without this plant; we easily can wait another six months or a
  year. This is no problem.”
In
  order to understand such behavioral nuances, cultural orientations to time can be examined
  according to three key criteria:
i.
  In terms of degree of focus: cultures gravitate to single-focused or multi-focused
  notions of time.
ii.
  In terms of expectations of punctuality and urgency: cultures are fixed or fluid.
iii.
  In terms of temporal orientation: cultures prefer to look to the past, the present or
  the future.

2. Single-focus cultures: Linearity.
The
first set of criteria for evaluating a culture’s orientation to time is its degree of
focus.
Single-focus
cultures concentrate on one task or issue at a time and are committed to developing and
respecting schedules and set deadlines.
Single-focus
cultures are less concerned about the relationship through which a task will completed
than defining and completing the task itself. Plans
and schedules tend to be detailed, followed quite strictly and rarely changed. Work-flow is organized according to the
step-by-step performance of tasks. Meetings
tend to be highly focused, with a set agenda and a time frame for each item.
3. Multi-focus cultures: Multiple activities.
In
  multi-focus cultures, the sequential ordering of tasks is uncommon.
Instead,
  such cultures prefer to involve various people at the same time within a framework of
  multiple engagements and simultaneous transactions.
As
  such, multi-focus cultures are very flexible. They
  consider reality to be more important than man-made appointments and schedules, sometimes
  ignoring precise time commitments. Moreover,
  the best investment of time is the completion of a human transaction, and multi-active
  people do not like to leave conversations unfinished.
Multi-focused
  cultures are adept at pursuing simultaneous tasks and building enduring relationships. They often consider focused, linear task completion
  and meeting deadlines unconvincing, arbitrary and unnecessarily inflexible. They prefer to complete tasks through the strength
  of relationships rather than with detailed plans. When
  important tasks or relationship issues arise unexpectedly, a multi-focus person usually
  attends to matters immediately.

      things done at once.

      may be reconsidered relative to circumstances.
Single-focus
  values characterize the way cultures of predominantly Northern European heritage function,
  including the United States.Fully
  industrialized Asian cultures have generally adopted a single-focus approach to time.
Latin
  European, Latin American, Middle Eastern and some less industrialized Southeast Asian
  cultures are predominantly multi-focused.
5. Fixed time cultures: Punctuality and urgency.
The
  second set of criteria for evaluating a culture’s orientation to time is its sense of
  punctuality and urgency.
Fixed
  time cultures are characterized by punctuality and a sense of urgency. Time is valued highly: meetings are expected to
  start on time, and schedules and deadlines are taken literally. Time is a commodity to be invested and managed with
  care.
As
  such, time management is an explicitly defined skill that is applied in both professional
  and personal life. Since they consider time a valuable commodity,
  fixed cultures try to save time in as many ways as possible, or, more precisely, to
  allocate time in as productive as way as possible.
For
  example, an manager in Boston, Massachusetts recently founded a organization that provides
  Internet-based time billing and travel expense applications designed to ease
  administrative burdens of filling out time sheets and recording expenses manually for
  independent professionals such as freelancers. Such
  solutions are particularly attractive in fixed cultures because they allow an individual
  to use time more efficiently: with the time saved by simplifying the billing process,
  independent professionals who use this service now have more hours available each week to
  dedicate to income-generating tasks rather than administrative ones.
This
  budgeting of time implies that there is always something to do in fixed cultures. For this reason, speed of action is also valued. It is preferable in fixed cultures to achieve a
  task in less time, because the time saved can be attributed to other tasks, including
  leisure.
Fixed
  cultures perceive that time passes quickly and reason in short units. When an individual from a fixed culture uses the
  adverb “soon”, for example, he is more likely thinking in terms of minutes,
  hours and days, rather than long units such as months and years.
6. Fluid cultures: Patience and flexibility.
In
  cultures with a fluid time orientation, punctuality and urgency are defined in less rigid
  terms.
Meetings
  are scheduled, but lateness is not considered irresponsible, and keeping someone waiting
  or canceling at the last minute carry little or no negative symbolic significance.
Schedules
  are established, but delays are expected, and it is understood that deadlines and other
  temporal commitments cannot always be respected.
In
  other words, time is perceived to be an organic, flowing process. Instead of budgeting time, using time or dividing
  time into fixed categories, people in fluid cultures pass time in natural terms. Nature guides temporal perception through the
  example of the agricultural seasons: a time for sowing, a time for reaping and a time for
  rest.
The
  agricultural seasons are prolonged periods that last several months, with annual cycles. The urgency that industrial “seasons”
  impose – measured in minutes, hours and days – carries significantly less
  meaning in fluid cultures.
This
  approach to time is more accepting of unforeseen circumstances and intrusions of personal
  life into the professional sphere. As in nature, events generally follow certain
  patterns and cycles, but anomalies are not only tolerated, but even welcomed, allowing the
  discovery of new knowledge and understanding that are beneficial for the project or
  relationship.
7. Comparison of fixed and fluid time.
(Include table)

    Culture
Time
    is valuable commodity to be budgeted, efficiency means more time for other things.
Meetings
    expected to begin on time.

    deadlines followed precisely.
Tasks
    broken down into short-term assignments and milestones.
Time
    passes in minutes, hours and days.
Time
    is an organic, flowing process that follows the prolonged cycles of the agricultural
    seasons.
Meetings
    begin when people are ready.
Schedules,
    deadlines adapted to circumstances.
Projects
    advance according to the time needed. Delays
    tolerated.
Time
    passes in months and years.
Full
industrialization is not necessarily a sign of a culture’s fundamental acceptance of
fixed time values. As such, Latin
European, Latin American, Asian and Middle Eastern cultures are, to varying degrees,
industrial powers, but their respective cultural orientations to time are predominantly
fluid.
Northern
European societies embrace fixed time values, although precision and punctuality are more
important than speed. Other cultures of predominantly Northern European
heritage – especially the United States – also have a fixed view of time,
although saving time and urgency are more important than punctuality as an end to its own.
8. Past-, present- and future orientation.
Finally,
the third set of criteria for evaluating a culture’s understanding of time is its
orientation to the past, present or future.
Past-oriented
cultures
In
past-oriented cultures, the past is always the context for evaluating the present. High value is placed on nurturing a collective
memory and on respecting established traditions. Strong
family traditions and ancestor worship reinforce this effort on an individual level. Plans and ideas follow traditional patterns of the
thinking and tend to have long time frames if they introduce relatively significant
change. Precedent guides decision-making,
organizing and controlling. Staff are hired
according to well-established criteria, including loyalty and adherence to accepted norms,
policies and procedures. Leaders are
expected to carry the vision of the past into the future, and change is not valued for its
own sake.
Present-oriented
cultures
Present-oriented
cultures turn to the current situation for guidance. As such, short-term goals and quick results are
preferred. Organizations in such cultures will
formulate short-term plans, divide and coordinate resources based on present demands and
select and train employees to meet current goals.
Future-oriented
cultures
Future-oriented
cultures spend the present planning for tomorrow. In order to achieve long-term results,
future-oriented cultures are willing to sacrifice short-term gains. Organizations in such cultures will divide and
coordinate work and resources to meet these long-range goals and projections. Recruitment and professional development will be
directed at needs anticipate far beyond the immediate circumstances.
9. Comparison of
past-, present- and future-oriented cultures.
Past-oriented culture
Present-oriented
    culture
Future-oriented culture
Change
    and action evaluated according to tradition, history and precedent.
Change
    and action evaluated according to short-term benefits.
Change
    and action seen as investment for future benefits.
Cultures
with long collective memories are inevitably drawn to their past glories and
accomplishments. What worked yesterday, works
today.
Societies
of recent creation, or for which past memories are bitter, tend to focus on the present
and short-term future. The long-term future is
considered risky, because there are too many unforeseen variables.
A
culture, which looks to the future, is necessarily more patient, foregoing short-term
benefits and accepting sacrifices today in exchange for growth and stability tomorrow,
assuming the forecasts made today are reliable.
10. Mixed perceptions of time.
Industrialization
and the realities of modern life mean that most cultures have more than one temporal
direction, although one orientation is often dominant.
Asian
cultures look to the past and the future at the same time. In addition to respecting age-old traditions and
ancestors, these societies emphasize the goals and achievements of the past when
considering the present and future. However,
they will also give considerable thought to long-term plans. Asian annual reports, for example, explain a organization’s history and
philosophy, but also lay out project/programme purpose plans that may stretch out 100 or 250 years into the
future. These societies function reason
according to a temporal continuum that reaches from long in the past into long in the
future.
Pragmatic
and disinterested in what happened yesterday, American culture is primarily oriented
towards the present and short-term future. An
American annual report generally states only the activity for the past year. Future goals are limited to the next five years,
primarily because market conditions can change so radically within five years. American project/programme purpose seizes opportunities and reacts
to demand and so it must stay vigilant in the present and near-term future.
European
cultures display all three tendencies. Their long histories mean that organizations often have
both organizational and national traditions to be honored and to learn from. At the same time, privatization and globalization
place pressure on European organizations to be more reactive in the short-term. Yet, Europeans’ historical perspectives often
help them to be more patient than Americans. And,
due in part to the complexity of labor legislation, project/programme purpose plans need to take into
consideration the long-term impact of the proposed strategies.
Time
orientations in South American cultures are similar to those in Europe, although future
orientation is used perhaps used to postpone difficult decisions more often than elsewhere
in the world.
The
Middle East is also similar to Europe in temporal orientation, although the cultural
attraction to the past is particularly strong in a region with such an illustrious past. Future orientation can be seen in the efforts of
certain countries in the region to prepare for a post-petroleum economy.

Summary
Different
cultures perceive and manage time in a variety of ways that convey powerful messages about
how a culture functions within itself and with the outside world. This has a profound impact on project/programme purpose activities. Pace of life, the allocation of time, the economy
of time, the scheduling of tasks, the metaphors of time and perceptions of temporal
dimensions are all components of a culture’s attitudes towards time. This lesson will introduce three sets of
variables of analyzing time as a part of culture: the degree of focus, expectations of
punctuality and orientation to past, present and future.

Glossary
1. Milestones :
fixed time and single-focus cultures divide long-term plans into shorter goals, thereby
increasing the chances of completing the overall project on-time and according to
specifications.
2. Human
transactions :
multi-focus cultures give priority to relationship-building over task completion and
adherence to linear project/programme purpose planning.
3. Seasons :
fluid cultures tend to think of time in terms of natural cycles – sowing, harvest and
rest..
4. Short-term :
present-oriented cultures believe that the best strategy for achieving long-term success
is by focusing on the current health and growth of project/programme purpose activities.
Learning
Objectives
Ø To
study the fundamental variables for determining a culture’s orientation to time: the
degree of complexity, expectations of punctuality and orientation to past, present and
future.
Ø To
consider the implications of shared attitudes towards times in terms of pace of life, time
allocation, the economy of time, the scheduling of tasks, the metaphors of time and
perceptions of temporal dimensions.
Q&A
Question
1: Are teams from single-focus and multi-focus cultures necessarily incompatible?
Answer
1: No. Once aware of the differences in their
attitudes towards time, teams from single-focus and multi-focus cultures can be assigned
to responsibilities which stand to benefit most from either organizational rigor or
sustaining flexibility. Multi-focus
individuals are more willing to accept the entropy from which new ideas lead to new
products and services. Single-focus teams can
then be assigned to structure those ideas into viable project/programme purpose projects and to acorganization
the development process according to careful task- and milestone-oriented scheduling and
budgeting.
Question
2: Does a culture’s orientation to time affect its response to certain products and
services?
Answer
2: Yes. Societies that have a single-focused,
fixed notion of time are significantly more receptive to products and services which help
people to save time and to use time more efficiently. In some cases, these products and services actually further accentuate a
culture’s obsession with time, such as the effect that the Internet and mobile
technology has had on American professionals and consumers: never have time-conscious
Americans had so many tools on their hands for increasing their productivity and for
managing their time with such precision. Cultures
with a more fluid understanding of time are slow to embrace these new solutions and may
even view them as intrusions.
Question
3: What is the effect of shareholder pressure on a organization’s temporal orientation?
Answer
3: Shareholders demand accountability on a regular basis such that publicly held organizations
must respond to immediate and short-term needs regardless of the dominant temporal
orientation of the country in which they are based. Moreover,
since significant blocks of shareholders may be based in a foreign culture, such as major
pension funds, the pressure exerted on a organization can be greater than local shareholders,
who may have traditionally been more patient.

The concept of time across cultures - Build your base for success
The concept of time across cultures
Jan-Willem Verstraten International Business September 18, 2016 0 Comment
The concept of time varies greatly across cultures. In America time is a limited resource, “Time is money”, while a Chinese proverb states the opposite: “When God made time, he made plenty of it”. Can you see how this might lead to a business conflict?
The strategy for our international business endeavors should be adapted based on the culture we deal with. We distinguish three time concepts: linear time, multi-active time and cyclic time.
Linear time
Linear time cultures (America, Switzerland, Austria, Britain, Scandinavia and the Netherlands) place a high emphasis on schedules. Their days are structured and the focus is on the task at hand, doing one thing at a time. Their schedule looks like this:
These cultures view time as a limited resource. Time is money. They believe that you become more successful if you get more work done. Because of this time is strictly controlled. They move forward as quickly as possible with an action and task-orientated mindset.
Interruptions are not preferred and taking a phone calls during a meeting is considered rude. Punctuality, especially for the Swiss and Germans, is very important and lateness is not tolerated.
They feel that the future is not entirely unforeseeable. After all, they work hard in the present on the tasks necessary to achieve their future goals.
In business it is expected that a quick decision can be made. No decision is seen as a lack of progress and therefore a waste of time.
Multi-active time
South American cultures and countries bordering the Mediterranean have a multi-active view of time. They value personal interaction over schedules; they will ignore the passing of time if human interactions will be left unfinished. As a result, they don’t mind being flexible in their schedule.
Imagine the confusion that can arise when a linear-orientated Swiss and a multi-active orientated Italian are working together. The Swiss, with the watch as a national symbol, will have a hard time understanding that the Italian is an hour late. The Italian, on the other hand, doesn’t see the problem: he was in an ongoing conversation.
Multi-active orientated people prefer to do multiple things at the same time. They pretend to have a schedule, especially when a linear-orientated person is around, but the focus is on the present instead of the schedule.
As you can see in the figure above they do not try to control time. They react to the events as they come during the day. In other words, they are less interested in following a schedule and only move forward when ready. Their focus is on feelings, relationships and people.
Cyclic time
Cyclic time cultures (most Asia and African countries), view time as plentiful. They don’t try to control time; they allow events to unfold naturally.
Time is viewed as repetitive: each day the same routine happens, day in day out. This view also shows in their way of doing business.
The decision making process in cyclical cultures can stretch over a long period of time, every option is considered. From their perspective there is no rush, time is plentiful. And since time goes around in a circle, the same opportunities will be presented again later, when they have more knowledge.
As you can see in the figure above every option is considered, they go around the decision in a circle. They might seem to go for option D, but after more consideration they might decide for a combination of A and C.
Imagine a linear-orientated American doing business with a cyclic-orientated African businessperson. After days of negotiating the American is expecting a decision. The African can’t do this without considering all the options and taking time. The American will see this waiting period as wasteful and expensive. The African will likely not understand this frustration, an African proverb: “A ripe melon falls by itself”.
There might be confusion understanding China’s cyclical view of time. The Chinese are more punctual; they arrive on time and often thank people for their time. They don’t want to ‘steal’ anyone’s time. Because of this they also announce soon after the meeting has started that they will have to be going. However, they will not leave until the business is done. It is said out of politeness towards the other people’s time. This is not typical cyclical behavior.
As a result, you might expect a quick decisions making process. But, the Chinese take their time and want to consider every option.
As you can see, the concept of time varies greatly across cultures. Your cultural understanding will help you to achieve successful business relationships.

How Different Cultures Experience Time and Adhere to Schedules
A look at sequential versus synchronous time
Image by pixabay.com
Introduction
In 1997, Dutch organizational theorist Alfonsus (Fons) Tompenaars and British business philosopher Charles Hampden-Turner published Riding the Waves of Culture, in which they identified the now-famous seven cultural dimensions for which they are now known. These dimensions are:
Universalism versus particularism
Individualism versus communitarianism
Specific versus diffuse
Neutral versus emotional
Achievement versus ascription
Sequential time versus synchronous time
Internal direction versus outer direction
In this article we will look at the cultural dimension described as sequential versus synchronous time, which details how different cultures adhere to time constraints such as punctuality, planning, maintaining events in chronological order and multitasking.
For those readers who travel internationally, understanding how time is perceived by other cultures is crucial, especially in regards to business.
We go back and forth between being time’s master and its victim. James Gleick
How Countries Adhere to Time
In Germany, you can set your watch by the arrival and departure of trains. A business associate in Frankfurt once told me that if she has an appointment at 9:00 AM, she makes sure to arrive at 8:57 AM.
The reason is that it takes one minute for her client to beckon her to come into his office, one minute to walk to the office and one minute to enter, sit down and settle into the chair. This would ensure that the meeting can start promptly at 9:00 AM as scheduled. Her logic was obsessively precise.
If you are ever in Brazil and you are invited to a party at 8:00 PM, you can show up punctually at that time if you want to see your hosts in their bathrobes and are willing to help in the setup of the get-together. Get ready to help inflate balloons, and make sure there is plenty of beer in the cooler since the invited guests will not be arriving until at least 8:45 PM or later.
In some Latin American countries, clients oftentimes ask salespeople to call on their mobiles once they are in the car driving to the appointment. Clients want a heads-up that the salesperson is indeed en route. In the face of elastic time, this is a pragmatic way for the client to avoid waiting for the salesperson, and for the salesperson to make sure the client is there when he/she arrives. Basically, this is a tactful way to avoid making excuses on both sides.
In the U.S. being late by five minutes is acceptable. Ten minutes, you are pushing it. Fifteen minutes is considered impolite. Even people attending social gatherings place importance on punctuality.
If the gathering is going to last for two hours, most hosts and guests want to make sure schedules are kept since most attendees have other plans for after the event. Time is viewed as valuable, and those attending the event want to be considerate of others’ time-related needs.
These examples show how different cultures view the passing of time. For those to whom time represents a series of passing events, in a linear, orderly and programmed fashion, are described as Sequential. On the other hand, those cultures where past, present, and future are interconnected, where time is much more elastic, even cyclical, are considered Synchronous.

Time is an idea and a perception, and therefore not an object. As such, time is highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a social construct, time allows members of a culture to coordinate activities between each other and for individual members as a way to manage daily activities.
However, although people can contemplate time on the basis of past, present, and future, each of these stages is not weighted with the same importance by different cultures. Hence, Sequential cultures see time as a string of events that represent equal building blocks. Activities are placed linearly along that string, in a logical and efficient way.
Time is the rope that keeps these events in line. For members of sequential cultures, keeping up with the passing of time is paramount in order to not be late and to accomplish planned tasks. It is under these guidelines that time controls people’s lives. For these cultures, time can then be said to be inflexible, unyielding and inelastic.
On the other hand, synchronic cultures view time inflexible and elastic terms. Time represents a construct in which many activities can occur simultaneously.
There are no clearcut paths to accomplishing goals and conducting activities. Therefore, members of these cultures can switch between activities as needed. These persons can also switch direction at a moment’s notice allowing for a more creative view of time.
This notion, that time is viewed and perceived differently has important implications for those living abroad as well as within a business context. On a personal basis, those that perceive time sequentially will find it difficult to adjust living in countries where time is elastic or even circular and therefore not based on consecutive and chronologically adhered events.
The opposite also holds true. People from synchronic cultures need to adjust their time perception in order to navigate through the scheduling and time constraints that a Sequential country places on events.
Within a business context, the time allocated to complete a task can either be precise as in the case of all Sequential countries or only meant as a guideline as it would be in Synchronic cultures. This difference in interpretation can cause confusion and misunderstanding.
Business contracts can be affected as well. Business people from a Synchronic culture will aim to have long contracts with few or no time constraints, while their Sequential counterparts will look for contracts with time frames that can be controlled. In other words, a one-year contract, a 5-year contract and so forth.
Business appointments within a synchronic cultural context should be viewed more as an intention to meet at a particular time. However, the actual meeting can be rescheduled for earlier or later and meetings do not end until the goals of the meeting are completed.
Sequential cultures set a time block to accomplish goals and once that time allocation expires, new times for subsequent meetings are agreed upon. The reason for this is obvious; there are other meetings previously scheduled and other tasks to complete.
Often times members of Synchronic cultures will use time elasticity and the notion that goals must be accomplished once a meeting starts as a negotiating tactic when dealing with Sequential culture members. There have been reports of American businesspeople negotiating contracts in China during which the final decisions are held until it is time for the guest to return home.
Chinese negotiators know that American businesspeople experience time pressures and inflexible schedules. The gamble is that the American business person will acquiesce to last-minute demands in order to stay within the allocated blocks of time previously set.
The concept of time perception as it relates to cultures was identified by Alfonsus (Fons) Trompenaars, a Dutch organizational theorist and Charles Hampden-Turner a British business philosopher and researcher. They identified a total of seven cultural dimensions that allow those who understand them improve their cross-cultural communication skills.
The following are the seven cultural dimensions conceived by Trompenaars and Hampden-Turner.

Okay, so from these search results, I can see that there are different ways cultures perceive time, and these perceptions can significantly impact international business interactions and operations.

First, there's the concept of single-focus versus multi-focus cultures. Single-focus cultures, like those in Northern Europe and the U.S., tend to handle one task at a time and adhere strictly to schedules. In contrast, multi-focus cultures, such as those in Latin America and the Middle East, handle multiple tasks simultaneously and are more flexible with time.

Then, there's the idea of fixed versus fluid time cultures. Fixed time cultures value punctuality and urgency, seeing time as a precious commodity to be managed efficiently. Fluid time cultures are more adaptable, viewing time as an organic process and being more accepting of delays and changes.

Additionally, there's the orientation towards the past, present, or future. Past-oriented cultures value tradition and history, while present-oriented cultures focus on immediate benefits, and future-oriented cultures prioritize long-term planning and investment.

These different time perceptions can lead to misunderstandings in international business. For example, a manager from a fixed time culture might expect strict adherence to deadlines, while a counterpart from a fluid time culture might be more relaxed about schedules, leading to potential conflicts.

Moreover, in negotiations, a businessperson from a future-oriented culture might be willing to delay short-term gains for long-term benefits, whereas someone from a present-oriented culture might prioritize immediate results.

Understanding these cultural differences is crucial for effective communication and collaboration in international business. It can help managers adjust their approaches, set appropriate expectations, and build stronger relationships with partners from different cultural backgrounds.

I think the key takeaway is that time is not perceived uniformly across cultures, and being aware of these differences can prevent misinterpretations and enhance business relationships.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Cultural perceptions of time significantly influence international business by shaping attitudes towards schedules, punctuality, task management, and long-term planning, leading to potential conflicts and the need for adaptability in cross-cultural interactions.}} \]
