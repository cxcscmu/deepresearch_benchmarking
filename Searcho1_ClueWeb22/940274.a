As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and arguments related to whether internet access should be considered a human right.

First, let's define what a human right is. Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior, and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is inherently entitled simply because they are a human being.

Now, considering internet access in this context, we need to evaluate whether it meets the criteria to be considered a human right.

Argument in favor:

1. Access to information: The internet is a powerful tool for accessing information and knowledge, which is essential for education, personal development, and informed decision-making. In today's digital age, many aspects of life, including education, healthcare, and employment, rely heavily on internet access.

2. Freedom of expression and communication: The internet facilitates free speech and allows people to communicate and connect with others across the globe. It plays a crucial role in enabling the exercise of fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression, assembly, and association.

3. Economic opportunities: Internet access opens up new avenues for economic growth and development. It enables individuals and businesses to reach wider markets, access resources and services, and participate in the global economy.

4. Social inclusion: The internet helps bridge geographical and social divides, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting understanding and tolerance. It provides a platform for marginalized communities to voice their concerns and advocate for their rights.

Arguments against:

1. Not universally essential: While internet access has become increasingly important, it is not yet universally essential for survival or well-being. Basic human needs such as food, water, shelter, and healthcare take precedence over internet access.

2. Infrastructure limitations: In many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries, there are significant infrastructure challenges that make widespread internet access difficult to achieve. Declaring it a human right could put undue pressure on governments and service providers to prioritize internet access over other critical needs.

3. Potential for abuse: Internet access can also facilitate the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and other harmful content. Without proper regulation and oversight, it could lead to negative consequences for individuals and societies.

4. Dependency and digital divide: Over-reliance on the internet may create new forms of dependency and exacerbate existing inequalities. Those without access may be further marginalized, creating a digital divide that perpetuates social and economic disparities.

In conclusion, while internet access offers numerous benefits and has become an integral part of modern life, whether it should be considered a human right is a matter of ongoing debate. It is essential to strike a balance between promoting access to this valuable resource and ensuring that basic human needs are met for all.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, internet access is not currently recognized as a human right, but it is increasingly considered essential for participation in society.}} \]
