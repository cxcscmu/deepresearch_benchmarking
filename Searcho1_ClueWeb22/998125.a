Alright, I've got this question about interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interprofessional approaches in healthcare. I need to figure out what the differences are between these terms. Hmm, they all sound similar, but there must be some key distinctions. Let me start by trying to understand each term individually and then see how they relate to each other.

First off, interdisciplinary. I think this has to do with different disciplines working together, maybe in research or in providing patient care. But what exactly does that mean? Maybe I should look up the definition of interdisciplinary.

What Does Interdisciplinary Approach Mean?
An interdisciplinary approach is a comprehensive process that encompasses mutual involvement between specialists representing their field of study to deliver quality healthcare to patients with medical and/or rehabilitative needs. Primary objectives underlying an interdisciplinary approach is consolidating professional experience, knowledge, and skills from each team member. The combined effort helps facilitate treatment, expedite recovery, and minimize healthcare costs.

WorkplaceTesting Explains Interdisciplinary Approach
In healthcare, a solid network of medical and/or rehabilitative experts who collaborate, coordinate, develop, and implement practical solutions designed to integrate a patient back into the community is pivotal. The role of each specialist contributes to the outcome reflected by the level of cooperation, input, persistence, and support demonstrated from an interdisciplinary team (IDT). For these reasons, insurance care providers including Medicaid and Medicare services, uphold the foundation of an interdisciplinary approach provided by healthcare organizations as a benchmark for patients receiving cost-effective, optimal medical attention and/or rehabilitation.
However, research studies show that an interdisciplinary approach can pose certain drawbacks such as personality clashes, communication barriers, and emotional intelligence deficits. To establish common ground, team parties must balance technical expertise with rapport where perceived differences in goals, methods, and strategies do not override patient care.
Individuals that sustain traumatic injuries are prompted to find healthcare providers based on their coverage plan where interdisciplinary approach programs and services is the most viable alternative towards recovery. Case studies prove that there is a better success rate following interdisciplinary approach assists in helping people undertake activities of daily living (ADL) and return to work.

What Is an Interdisciplinary Team? Definition, Importance and Advantages
By Indeed Editorial Team

The changing characteristics of the population and healthcare system have led to a shift to interdisciplinary teams. Interdisciplinary teams are an approach to healthcare that integrates multiple disciplines through collaboration. These teams can help ensure that patients receive the best care and also improve how medical facilities function. In this article, we discuss interdisciplinary teams, compare them to multidisciplinary teams, examine their importance in healthcare today, look at some advantages of interdisciplinary teams and analyze some elements that contribute to a successful team.
What is an interdisciplinary team?
In healthcare, an interdisciplinary team comprises professionals from various disciplines who work in collaboration to address a patient with multiple physical and psychological needs. An interdisciplinary team is not just a group of experts implementing separate treatments on a patient. They complement one another's expertise and actively coordinate to work toward shared treatment goals. An example of an interdisciplinary team would be a trauma team treating a patient after a motor vehicle accident. The surgeon, emergency room physician, nurses, therapists, lab specialists and imaging specialists all work together for the shared goal of the patient's treatment and recovery.
In devising a coordinated care plan, an interdisciplinary team might ask the following patient-centered questions to improve the quality of care:
What are the patient's symptoms and needs?
Who can address the patient's needs?
What interventions can lead to a good outcome?
What are the goals of each intervention?
What's the difference between an interdisciplinary team and a multidisciplinary team?
Interdisciplinary teams differ from multidisciplinary teams in that the latter does not employ an integrated approach to treatment. They work in parallel rather than in integration, each within their respective disciplines to devise their own care plans. Though applied simultaneously, each plan works independently of the others. For instance, a patient who sustains a traumatic amputation of their index finger may receive treatment from a hand specialist, a neurosurgeon, an occupational therapist and a prosthetist. Each may have their own goals for the patient and apply treatments without consultation with the others.
Why are interdisciplinary teams important in healthcare?
There are several factors that have contributed to the rising need for interdisciplinary teams in healthcare, including:
An increasingly aging population: Advances in medicine have allowed people to live longer, resulting in a greater number of people with multiple complex chronic health issues. These geriatric patients often require the care of multiple specialists.
Increased specialization in healthcare: There have been a growing number of specialists in healthcare, each focusing on a narrow aspect of their field. As a result, individual healthcare providers may be unable to satisfy all the medical needs of their patients. Interdisciplinary teams help to resolve this fragmentation.
A growing body of medical knowledge: Successful patient care now requires a larger capacity of learning and skill, making specialization more necessary.
There are now more patients with multifaceted health issues requiring treatment from multiple healthcare providers, and interdisciplinary teams help to ensure there is consistency and continuity in the care they receive. They can also streamline treatment by preventing duplicate assessments by separate providers, resulting in a more accurate and complete patient record.
Advantages of interdisciplinary teams in healthcare
Interdisciplinary teams can provide several advantages to patients and healthcare professionals alike. These include:
Improved care and outcomes
Healthcare professionals in separate disciplines can provide unique insights into a patient's condition. If a physician, cardiologist, endocrinologist and team of nurses work together to treat a patient, each is likely to notice symptoms specific to their specialty. Individually, they can each treat one aspect of the patient's condition. Working together, however, they can provide comprehensive treatment that addresses the patient's multifaceted symptoms, thus improving the possibility of a good recovery.
Fewer errors
Medical errors such as misdiagnoses, overlooked symptoms and inappropriate pharmaceutical drug combinations can be dangerous and even fatal to a patient. Often, such errors result from a patient seeing multiple providers, each applying a specialty-specific treatment plan that might not consider prescriptions and diagnoses given by another doctor. Interdisciplinary collaboration can reduce error occurrence by helping to establish a more complete record that views the patient's symptoms holistically.
Faster treatment
An interdisciplinary approach promotes awareness of individual needs within the team and encourages communication so that other members have the information they need to apply another aspect of the treatment plan. For example, if the orthopedist needs lab results before they can determine a definite diagnosis, the lab specialist can notify them when the results arrive, preventing any idling of vital data. Eliminating waiting time in this way can help patients receive faster care.
Improved efficiency
The combination of faster treatment and reduced errors helps to streamline operations. Accurate treatment leads to less need for further testing or examinations, and faster treatment contributes to sooner surgeries and subsequent discharges from the hospital. The improved efficiency benefits both medical institutions and patients in that hospitals can admit more new patients, while patients enjoy the reduced costs associated with shorter stays.
Improved morale
Because interdisciplinary teams emphasize collaboration, it focuses on acknowledging every team member's contribution and knowledge. This can help members to feel more valued, thus boosting their engagement and desire to contribute. It can empower the patient as well, whom the team should encourage to be involved in the decision making.
Elements of a successful interdisciplinary team
Successful interdisciplinary teams may vary in member composition and expertise, but they often share certain qualities that allow them to provide top-quality integrated care for patients, such as:
Patient-focused practice
A successful interdisciplinary team has the patient's needs foremost in their minds. The team involves the patient and their family or carer in every decision and aspect of care. This helps ensure not only that they are meeting the patient's needs but also that the patient feels heard and valued.
A clear end goal
The end goal is what all the elements of the care plans should work toward. It may be to improve a patient's function, to return them to a normal quality of life or to save their life. Knowing what the end goal is can define the team's purpose, direct all the team members in the right direction and inform the treatments they consider and implement.
Effective communication
Each team member has their own set of knowledge and skills and must be able to convey specialized data about the patient to other members. This requires verbal skills for describing symptoms and treatments clearly, nonverbal skills for helping listeners receive your information and written skills for communicating in charts and correspondence. Also, communication with the patient and their family is necessary to establish care goals that meet the patient's needs.
Teamwork
In successful teams, each member acknowledges and respects the abilities of their colleagues but may also be willing to take on responsibilities to help or contribute to others' roles. This requires that everyone understand the extent of their knowledge and areas of overlap with others' disciplines, respect others' perspectives and acknowledge they can learn from others' disciplines.
For example, nurses and physicians are both likely to be knowledgeable about physiological symptoms. Though the physician may be more experienced or specialized, they can trust the nurses to know how to treat the symptoms and recognize the greater exposure nurses have to patients may give them insight the physicians don't have.
Shared leadership
In the interdisciplinary approach, the role of the leader can be a fluid designation. Often, the team acknowledges that the member with the most experience or knowledge in a situation should lead the others in its management. For example, for a patient with a muscular injury, nerve pain and a history of mental illness, the leadership position might shift as the team goes from treating orthopedic to neurological to psychological symptoms.

An interdisciplinary approach to caring
On this page
What is it?
Why is it important?
How can you adopt an interdisciplinary approach to caring for older people?
What is it?
An interdisciplinary approach involves team members from different disciplines working collaboratively, with a common purpose, to set goals, make decisions and share resources and responsibilities. 1
A team of clinicians from different disciplines, together with the patient, undertakes assessment, diagnosis, intervention, goal-setting and the creation of a care plan. The patient, their family and carers are involved in any discussions about their condition, prognosis and care plan. 2
In contrast, a multidisciplinary approach involves team members working independently to create discipline-specific care plans that are implemented simultaneously, but without explicit regard to their interaction. 3
Depending on the resources of the individual health service, a combination of the two approaches may be used when caring for older people.
Why is it important?
Older people in hospitals often have a number of different diagnoses and consequently have multiple and complex needs. Compared to younger age groups, a greater proportion of older people require an interdisciplinary approach to their care in order to deal with complex multimorbidity, social and psychological issues. 3
The best possible outcomes for older people are achieved through a consultative, collaborative approach to care that actively involves the patient, their family/carers and an interdisciplinary team. 1
An interdisciplinary approach can help avoid risk averse thinking by weighing up the risk against benefits for the patient.
An interdisciplinary approach can improve patient outcomes, healthcare processes and levels of satisfaction. 4,5 It can also reduce length of stay 6,7 and avoid duplication of assessments, leading to more comprehensive and holistic records of care. 8
The opportunity for discussion created by interdisciplinary care planning can be used for the patient, their family and carers to develop their ongoing plan. 3
How can you adopt an interdisciplinary approach to caring for older people?
The care team need to work together, utilising an interdisciplinary approach, to provide and implement a care plan that meets the patient’s goals and needs.
All health care professionals have a shared role in providing person-centred care for older people.
Elements integral to a successful interdisciplinary approach
Leadership
Positive leadership and management give clear direction and vision for the team through:
Promoting an atmosphere of trust where contributions are valued and consensus is fostered.
Ensuring that the necessary resources, infrastructure and training are available, as well as a mix of skills, competencies and personalities amongst team members. 9
Person-centred practice
Well-integrated and coordinated care that is based on the needs of the patient can contribute to reducing delays to provision of care and duplicating assessment. 1
Involving the patient in all aspects of their care empowers them to speak up and contribute to decision-making.
Formulating shared standardised interdisciplinary care plans and records of care to contribute to holistic and comprehensive person-centred care.
Teamwork
An interdisciplinary approach relies on health professionals from different disciplines, along with the patient, working collaboratively as a team. The most effective teams share responsibilities and promote role interdependence while respecting individual members’ experience and autonomy. 9
Ensure team members have clear goals, and an understanding of their shared roles and responsibilities within the team structure. 5
Participate in joint assessment, diagnosis and goal setting.
Recognise the overlap in knowledge and expertise of staff from different disciplines. 8
Encourage team cohesiveness and creativity through team commitment and the identification of mutual goals. 5
Encourage less experienced team members to ask questions which may give rise to creative ideas and alternative perspectives. 5
Establish teams with members from diverse disciplines to foster higher overall effectiveness, and hold regular team meetings which are associated with higher levels of innovation. 10
Communication
Communication across disciplines, care providers and with the patient and their family/carers, is essential to setting the goals that most accurately reflect the person’s desires and needs.
Involve the patient’s GP or pharmacist to increase the success of the intervention. 11
Communicate openly to encourage genuine collaboration. A breakdown of communications between health professionals is a common factor in hospital errors and adverse events. 4,12
Document assessments and ensure clinical handover documents are completed thoroughly and stored in a central place.

In an effort to provide effective and efficient care to patients with chronic health conditions, the U.S. healthcare system has done much to redesign its delivery system. Developing an approach to meet the high demands of patients and to best utilize resources has become necessary. The result is the common use of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach. This approach provides better care than an individual plan that traditionally has just involved doctor and patient.
When properly implemented, this multidisciplinary team approach provides positive measurable outcomes. With a diverse group of healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, health educators, social service and mental health providers there is more certainty that all of the needs of the patient will be met.  The most important member of the multidisciplinary team is the patient. He or she is at the center of the team. This approach is holistic health care that focuses on all aspects of a patient’s life that might impact treatment success (Drake, 2005).
Multidisciplinary teams, as the name implies, are teams of people from different disciplines that come together for a common purpose. The MDT approach is used in a variety of different setting including healthcare, education, mental health and criminal justice.  The concept is that it is best to address an issue or problem from all angles. For a patient in a healthcare setting this means a holistic approach focusing on a variety of life domains. The MDT is typically used in difficult, multifaceted cases and situation where a comprehensive response has the best chance of accomplishing the goals. Simple or uncomplicated cases may not require this approach.
The group of professionals that make up an MDT come from diverse disciplines.  They begin by providing a comprehensive assessment through their individual expertise and then, in consultation with one another. The team approach promotes coordination and communication and can offer the patient a “one stop” effort as opposed to many separate evaluations, interpretations and plans. Any differences in opinion or approach can be discussed and resolved as a group, among the professionals and with the patient. This avoids having the patient interpret and decide upon differing viewpoints alone
The MDT professionals can change from case to case depending of course on the diagnosis and social or personal situation of the patient. In general, the team will include medical professionals from various disciplines, homecare professionals if needed, social service and mental health professionals, nutrition and health educators. The benefits to the professionals is the opportunity to  enhance  skills and knowledge of individual team members by providing a forum for learning more about the strategies, resources, and approaches used by various disciplines.
It is a built in consultation component. It also provides the professionals with ongoing support which can be invaluable as they deal with many difficult situations and cases.  As a member on an MDT, the professionals work together to develop a plan of action, or a treatment plan and then combine their efforts towards initiating treatment.  The patient is involved in every aspect and is encouraged to involve family and supports as well, as this support can improve outcomes long term.
While the team approach has many benefits, it can also be complicated to coordinate schedules and response of busy health professionals, who may need to participate on MDT’s for any number of cases. It can be costly to spend time meeting, requiring highly paid and again busy health professionals to come together for a case discussion. Assuring that all professionals make the time to participate can be a challenge.
The team approach involves patient satisfaction, building a community support system, patient follow-up, all in addition to the coordinated medical services. The team can follow a patent from the hospital back to their home and can from diagnosis, through treatment. This model of treatment has become increasingly popular with a variety of chronic conditions including diabetes, heart disease, cancer and mental health treatment.
Research has shown that for patient with Type II diabetes, a multidisciplinary approach can actually lead to the improvement of glycemic control and improved quality of life. A 2004  National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline for type 1 diabetes in adults (2004) says,  that a range of  professional skills are  needed for the  best service delivery model. An MDT is specifically recommended and it is suggested that the team have professionals in education, nutrition, and medical and mental health care (Codispoti, 2004).
In cases of breast cancer, the   MDT includes: oncologists; surgeons; nurses; nutritionists; counselors; and other cancer specialists. With the complexity of cancer care, these specialized healthcare professionals help to provide a continuum of care through diagnosis, treatment, and recovery.    There are many studies that have explored the collaboration among the oncology specialties and team members. Multidisciplinary approaches to breast cancer can help to ensure that women with early-stage breast cancer receive all the benefit of adjunctive treatments.
For patients with heart failure, a multidisciplinary approach can reduce costs by reducing hospitalization and improving the patient’s compliance with medical care and follow-up. The multidisciplinary response in studies that concluded this result, involved in part, a component for simply calling on patients after discharge from the hospital to review the treatment course and answer questions (McAlister, 2004). This type of outreach on the part of the health care industry can identify potential problems before they exacerbate a situation. Patients or family members can benefit greatly from support and reeducation on the disease, course of treatment and importance of compliance. A little support can make an enormous difference.
To fully understand the benefits of treatment and the team approach, it is important tot look at all variables. Research into patient outcomes requires a multidisciplinary approach involving review of both medical and nonmedical disciplines For example, a patient may have received excellent diagnosis and education on his or her illness, but be unable to follow-through due to mental health issues or family issues that sabotage treatment (Freeman, 2004).
The MDT that includes professionals from mental health and social services may identify these issues and address them with built in supports and referrals for services that can assist the patient and their family with the critical follow through. This may involve referrals to transportation services to assure that a patient is able to keep follow-up appointments, health benefit entitlement programs so the patient can afford the prescriptions ordered, or a referral for counseling to address the coexisting depression that may be causing the patient to have difficulty with follow through.
In behavioral health the multidisciplinary approach is well established. For patients with severe and persistent mental illness, the need to collaborate and coordinate among professionals is clear. The doctor prescribing the psychotropic medications, healthcare professionals treating the chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, as well as mental health counselors and nutritionists are routinely involved in care. As many of these patients also have difficulties in other life areas, it is imperative that social services staff be involved to assure that the living environment is stable, which increases the likelihood of compliance (Dziegielewski, 2004).
The benefits of a multidisciplinary team for the patient are enormous. This approach assures the patient and family that the healthcare professionals are all talking to one another; everyone knows what everyone else is doing. This method means that the ill patients is not required to be responsible for sharing information that he or she may not fully understand. It takes the burden off of the patient and places it on the healthcare professionals, who are better able to deal with it and use the information correctly.
The MDT approach can be thought of as a circle, with the patient in the middle and the professionals, both medical and nonmedical, around him or her providing support and care (Dziegielewsk, 2004).  Ideally, the patient will also have family and social supports as part of the team as well. This approach is growing in popularity and use throughout healthcare setting.
It acknowledges the complexities of human beings and the need to treat illness from all possible avenues. It also acknowledges the vast improvements in healthcare, and the understanding of how medical, nonmedical, educational and social attention all improves the outcomes for patients. While attending to patients individually can have positive results, working together improves outcomes.

Alright, from these search results, I'm starting to get a clearer picture of what interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interprofessional approaches mean in healthcare. Let me try to summarize what I've understood so far.

First, interdisciplinary seems to involve different disciplines working together collaboratively, sharing their expertise to achieve a common goal. It's like they're integrating their knowledge and working as a unified team. For example, in treating a patient with multiple complex needs, doctors, nurses, therapists, and other specialists would work together, coordinating their efforts and making decisions collectively.

On the other hand, multidisciplinary appears to be slightly different. From what I read, a multidisciplinary team consists of experts from various fields who work independently but simultaneously on the same patient. Each specialist contributes their own treatment plan without necessarily integrating it with others. So, it's more like parallel work rather than integrated work.

Now, interprofessional seems to be related but perhaps broader. I think it might involve professionals from different professions collaborating to provide care, similar to interdisciplinary but maybe not limited to disciplinary boundaries. Maybe it's a more general term that includes both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches.

Let me see if I can find more specific definitions or examples to clarify these terms.

From the first search result, it defines interdisciplinary approach in healthcare as a process where specialists from different fields work together to provide quality care to patients with medical and rehabilitative needs. The key seems to be the consolidation of their experiences, knowledge, and skills to facilitate treatment and recovery.

The second search result from Indeed.com explains that an interdisciplinary team in healthcare is one where professionals from various disciplines collaborate to address a patient's multiple physical and psychological needs. It emphasizes that they work together towards shared treatment goals, rather than working in isolation.

Comparing this to a multidisciplinary team, it says that in a multidisciplinary approach, each specialist implements their own care plan independently, without necessarily integrating it with others. So, while both approaches involve multiple specialists, the level of collaboration and integration differs.

The third search result is from a medical dictionary, defining a multidisciplinary approach as involving multiple specialties working together to establish a diagnosis or effect a therapy. It seems similar to the interdisciplinary approach, but perhaps without the same level of integration.

The fourth search result is from the Victorian government's health website, which discusses an interdisciplinary approach to caring for older people. It mentions that in contrast to a multidisciplinary approach, where team members work independently, an interdisciplinary approach involves collaborative goal-setting and shared care plans.

This suggests that the main difference lies in the degree of collaboration and integration among team members. Interdisciplinary teams work together more closely, sharing responsibilities and making joint decisions, whereas multidisciplinary teams work separately, each focusing on their area of expertise.

Now, regarding interprofessional, I haven't found a direct definition in these search results yet. Maybe I need to look for more information specifically about interprofessional approaches.

Let me perform another search to focus on interprofessional approaches in healthcare.

"Interprofessional" vs "interdisciplinary"?
Hi everyone. Had a disagreement today with a professor about what the difference was between the meaning/use of the terms "interprofessional" vs "interdisciplinary". Tried looking for literature that defined the two and identified the differences, but it is still confusing. Can they be used in place of one another or are there different meanings?

Mostly semantics... and nothing important to argue about.
Inter-professional means that you are using several professionals (RN, MD, Pharm, etc) that are collaborating with each other. It can be pretty simple - you can have a patient that is accessing difference services and they may speak to each other to agree on a care plan.
Inter-disciplinary is a model - it's not just random professionals speaking to each other - also known as multidisciplinary. This model is inclusive to difference disciplines (nursing, medicine, psychosocial/social justice) to better the patient's health. The model tends to be holistic and expanded through different points of care. So when you have a Multi-D rounds - you are discussing the patient's health and future health where every aspect of care is part of the care plan.
Multidisciplinary isn't just a collaboration of random professionals but a system which creates good outcome for patients by utilizing different healthcare disciplines.
Interdisciplinary can also be an academic term when two areas of academic interest cross and fill a gap of knowledge. So information technology and nursing would be Nursing Informatics. Geopolitics and health would be Global Health. Public Policy and health would be Health Policy etc.
I'm sure you would find that academic literature has different uses of the terms as well.

In common usage they are interchangeable.
If you want to be really picky about the semantics, "interdisciplinary" refers to the combination of more than one area of knowledge. "Interprofessional" connotes the working relationship of people who have differing areas of professional expertise.
Nobody other than a grammarian (or maybe a nursing instructor) is going to bother making the distinction.

BYOL now: Bring your own laptop to work
We were told to start bringing our own laptops to work (only affects the nurses), download Cerner, and they can do something else to make it to where we can access and document on our laptops as our computers will no longer be available. We have 10 nurses sharing 4 desktop computers at the nursing stations. We have zero way of scanning medications from now on. Our hospital also closed our IT department due to “too many employees calling and it costs the hospital $9 each time.” Thoughts? I find it ridiculous because I feel unsafe with any of this. Providers still have their own computers and still put in orders as usual, but nurses have no way of refreshing the screen and if I go and look up orders on our 1/4 desktops, it takes me away from my patient on pressors, etc.

“We didn’t spend the night because we saw you were his nurse”
“We trusted that you would watch over our son tonight.”
“Thank you for your hard work”
Grandpa: “my son had wonderful things to say about you. Thank you for being here tonight”
They hugged me as they cried over their loss, and thanked me and my coworker tonight. They said they thanked God we were on because they knew their son would be in good hands.
And we tried. We tried so hard to save him. The doctor tried so hard, and he cried on the phone when he delivered the bad news.
And for only the second time in my career, I cried. Hard. With the family as we hugged each other. We cried together for 30 minutes, because all of us were devastated that their son passed.
And I’m still crying…
Sorry…I just needed to let it out. I care, but I’ve never been affected to this extent.

Being on call is a joke
I'm on call from 7A- 7P today. I will definitely be called in at some point, so I'm dressed and just waiting for the call. I'm making $3/hr to be on call.  In order to get my 13 year old neighbor to keep her schedule open for the day and be my back up babysitter, I'm paying her $5/hr.  The only reason I'm able to get her at this low rate is because she's 13 years old.  Amazing how my hospital values my time less than I value hers.

Similarly, you may ask,  what is an interdisciplinary team?
interdisciplinary team a group of health care professionals from diverse fields who work in a coordinated fashion toward a common goal for the patient. intraprofessional team a team of professionals who are all from the same profession, such as three physical therapists collaborating on the same case.
Beside above,  what is a benefit of using interdisciplinary teams? Interdisciplinary teams have been used in healthcare for many years with positive results. Each individual brings their personal knowledge, specific skills and knowledge as well as their ongoing education to the team, making it much more effective than a single individual.
Furthermore,  what is an interdisciplinary healthcare team and why is it effective?
An interdisciplinary approach relies on health professionals from different disciplines, along with the patient, working collaboratively as a team. The most effective teams share responsibilities and promote role interdependence while respecting individual members' experience and autonomy.
What makes a good multidisciplinary team?
Multidisciplinary and multiagency working involves appropriately utilising knowledge, skills and best practice from multiple disciplines and across service provider boundaries to redefine, re-scope and reframe health and social care delivery issues, and to reach solutions based on an improved collective understanding

IPE vs. Multidisciplinary Education: What’s the Difference for Clinical Simulation (w/ Downloadable Tool) | HealthySimulation.com
February 12, 2020 By Dr. Kim Baily
IPE vs. Multidisciplinary Education: What’s the Difference for Clinical Simulation (w/ Downloadable Tool)
Defining interprofessional education (IPE) and distinguishing the term from multidisciplinary education is challenging since so many different definitions for both terms are found in the literature. However, the distinction is important when it comes to healthcare simulation — maybe so much so that we might even need a new term! Here guest author Dr. Kim Baily PhD, MSN, RN, CNE, previous Simulation Coordinator for Los Angeles Harbor College and Director of Nursing for El Camino College, explores the two terms and what they mean for medical simulation.
Also, don’t forget to download the free tool from IPEC below!
Usha Asirvatham, Denise Foy, and Torrey Laack from the Mayo Clinic Multidisciplinary Simulation Center presented a wonderful workshop at the recent IMSH 2020 meeting which focused on the meaning of these terms. They compared the difference between the attitudes, knowledge, behaviors of Interprofessional (IP) and multidisciplinary care teams.
Sponsored Content:
Attitudes
Multidisciplinary: Each person is focused on own discipline specific plan of care. Some disciplines are thought to be more suitable for team leadership roles.
Interprofessional: A biopsychosocial model which includes team discussions on group processes in addition to patient care. Team development is encouraged and supported and there is shared leadership.
Knowledge
Multidisciplinary: Knows core patient care functions of other disciplines but knows own discipline well. Recognizes team leader and others’ responsibilities.
Interprofessional: Knows training and competencies of other disciplines. Is able to articulate role overlap and unique contributions.
Behaviors:
Multidisciplinary: Own assessment and treatment plans. Evaluates progress on their own.
Interprofessional: Joint assessment and treatment plans. Identifies role overlaps in an attempt to avoid duplication and enhance coverage.
The presenters suggested that multidisciplinary care is hierarchical where everyone is working on the same problem within their own silos. Members have limited knowledge of other disciplines & roles and there is limited communication between members. For example, a pulmonologist, an infection control specialist and a cardiologist may all care for the same patient with pneumonia but have limited communication between themselves. In addition, there is no direct communication between themselves (all physicians) and other professions such as nursing or respiratory and there may be limited understanding of the roles of other professions.
Sponsored Content:
On the other hand, Interprofessional Practice is less hierarchical, although not all levels of staff may be considered equal. Everyone is working on the same problem with overlapping disciplinary boundaries and members learn from, with and about each other. Members understand each other’s disciplines. Interprofessional practice is more than bringing people together; it is about the process of critical thinking and problem solving beyond disciplinary boundaries.
They discussed an even newer term called “Transdisciplinary Practice” (Editor’s Note: see our recent article on Translational Simulation) which is defined as “beyond all but connected to all”. Everyone is working on the same problem by transcending boundaries with non traditional perspective. There is no hierarchy or territory; all members are equal and leadership is shared among members. There is a conscious effort to clarify roles and input from other disciplines is intentionally sought. Communication between the team members is continuous, seamless dynamic and effective.
The World Health Organization defines interprofessional education (IPE) as follows: “When students from two or more professions learn about, from, and with each other to enable effective collaboration and improve health outcomes”. Interprofessional collaboration is defined as: “When multiple health workers from different professional backgrounds work together with patients, families, [careers], and communities to deliver the highest quality of care.”
IPE Collaboration
The good news is that although the exact definition of interprofessional may be varied (and changing) the Interprofessional Professional Education Collaborative (IPEC) was formed in 2009 to create competencies and resources (including scenarios and evaluation tools) related to interprofessional Education. The goal of the organization is to help prepare future health professionals for enhanced team-based care of patients and improved population health outcomes. IPEC identified 4 competencies:
Work with individuals of other professions to maintain a climate of mutual respect and shared values. (Values/Ethics for Interprofessional Practice)
Use the knowledge of one’s own role and those of other professions to appropriately assess and address the health care needs of patients and to promote and advance the health of populations. (Roles/Responsibilities)
Communicate with patients, families, communities, and professionals in health and other fields in a responsive and responsible manner that supports a team approach to the promotion and maintenance of health and the prevention and treatment of disease. (Interprofessional Communication)
Apply relationship-building values and the principles of team dynamics to perform effectively in different team roles to plan, deliver, and evaluate patient/population-centered care and population health programs and policies that are safe, timely, efficient, effective, and equitable. (Teams and Teamwork)
With funding from the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, the IPE PORTAL collection of peer-reviewed educational resources and materials supporting IPE instruction, which are mapped to the IPEC Competencies, was launched in December 2012. These resources are available to everyone. By design IPEC facilitates efforts to coordinate authentic educational experiences across disciplinary boundaries in supplying credible educational resources that are validated by content experts for use with learners from multiple health professions. Access to these educational materials can be especially useful for regional campuses that may not have other disciplines on the same campus.
Modules range from case-based resources, evaluation tools, and multimedia resources to presentations, lab guides, references, and tutorials. Primary topic listings include communication skills, curriculum development or evaluation, health education, and evaluation of clinical performance. Additional topics cover ambulatory education, assessment; cognition, human learning, and problem solving, counseling, evidence-based medicine, health care quality improvement, health care systems, patient safety and medical errors, physician-patient relationship, professionalism, teaching skills, and veterans’ health and wellness.
Each case study includes supporting documents such as Simulation Case Overview, Teaching Points, Slide Introduction, Surgical History and Physical Exam, Debriefing Checklist and Evaluation Form. Examples of some of the many scenarios include: Prevention and Management of Operating Room Fire: An Interprofessional Operating Room Team Simulation Case, Promoting Affirmative Transgender Health Care Practice Within Hospitals: An IPE Standardized Patient Simulation for Graduate Health Care Learners, Rehab Concepts and Discharge Dispositions: Workshop for Medical Students and Identifying and Managing Intraoperative Arrhythmia: A Multidisciplinary Operating Room Team Simulation Case.
IPE Competency Self-Assessment Tool
IPEC also offers an IPE Competency Self-Assessment Tool. This instrument was designed to assess competencies related to collaborative practice at the healthcare degree program level through individual student self-assessment. Specifically, the tool measures students’ self-efficacy on items based on the 42 core competency statements developed by IPEC.
Download the IPE Competency Self-Assessment Tool Here!
Results can help inform curriculum planning, track the effects of degree programs on interprofessional competency, and provide data that can be used within and between institutions to compare programmatic outcomes. The original validity study with a sample of 481 students at a single institution demonstrated good factor structure and internal consistency. Subsequent research (a multi-year study with a multi-institutional sample) led to a revised, shorter instrument whose items clustered around two strong factors.
IPE plays a critical role in preparing healthcare practitioners to improve overall team dynamics and communication and ultimately to improve patient care and prevent patient error.

There are hardly any instruments to measure teamwork behaviors from an individual approach. This applies both in interprofessional teams or not, and in teams involved in health, social care, and other areas. The Individual Behavior Analysis (IBA) scale measures efficacious behavior in work teams. It is one of the few instruments proposed in the literature to measure personal skills necessary for teamwork. Only a previous exploratory analysis of the scale was informed in another study. This article analyzes its internal structure using different confirmatory factor analyses and its internal consistency, with a sample of 815 employees working for Spanish social organizations in the geriatric field, both private and public. The results of the definitive version adapted to Spanish, referred to as Individual Behavior Analysis −25, indicate a good fit of the model to the data and good reliability. Factor analysis confirmed the existence of two factors: Communication skills and Acceptance, with good internal consistency coefficients. This scale is a useful instrument for assessing, based on the reviewed literature, two of the most important individual skills an efficacious team should have.

Health care is increasingly delivered through team-based, collaborative strategies with interprofessional education as an important mechanism for building interprofessional practice competencies. This paper describes an Interprofessional Seminar on Integrated Primary Care (IS-IPC) designed to meet this educational need with interprofessional team-based learning as the foundation of an iterative process such that education and practice inform one another. The IS-IPC can be used to educate an interprofessional group of learners about key topics relevant to working together in integrated primary care. The IS-IPC describes steps in developing an interprofessional seminar, common challenges, and their solutions in creating interprofessional learning experiences, and eight foundational content modules containing an outline and curricular resources. The IS-IPC facilitates interprofessional educator partnerships at the local level and can be customized to fit the local environment, pedagogical philosophy, and learning objectives.
... One barrier that was prevalent in all sites was the conflict between delivering RCC and quality care. The tension between these two models of care is not altogether surprising given the medical model's focus on standardization of care and the RCC model's emphasis on individualization of care (Bensing, 2000; Steffen, Zeiss, & Karel, 2014). Further staff training about the practical implications of delivering RCC may be useful in improving resident quality by helping to alleviate perceptions of conflict between the two models of care.  ...

Improving interdisciplinary team functioning can improve care outcomes, through clinical team members' ability to understand the diverse, and occasionally competing, values and perspectives of residents, families, and staff from various disciplines, and effectively integrate these diverse perspectives to promote RCC (Interprofessional Education Collaborative Expert Panel, 2011; Steffen et al., 2014).  ...

A growing number of healthcare organizations have moved from traditional, institutional nursing home models to ones that emphasize culture change, or resident-centered care (RCC). In 2006, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) began implementing a number of changes to VA nursing homes, now called Community Living Centers (CLCs), to provide veterans with a more resident-centered and homelike environment. This study aimed to understand the barriers CLC staff face when delivering RCC. Ten CLCs were included on the basis of their performance levels on RCC and quality of care. Semistructured interviews that focused on facility efforts in RCC and quality were conducted with all levels of staff. Interviews were systematically content coded. We found similarities and differences in barriers reported at high- and low-performing sites. Staff across all performance levels cited 5 main categories of barriers to delivering RCC: staffing, resources, acuity of residents, RCC and quality of care conflicts, and regulations. Staff in high-performing sites reported fewer barriers to RCC, although 1 barrier cited was difficulty coordinating RCC across departments. Staff in low-performing sites reported additional categories of barriers related to administrator turnover/lack of guidance, CLC culture/staff morale, and difficulty working with residents and families. As RCC continues to spread, it is important to anticipate the barriers to implementing these practices. Particular focus on regulatory, leadership, organizational, workforce, and process factors may help organizations avoid or reduce barriers to RCC. Given their training and skill set, mental health providers may be uniquely situated to assist staff in overcoming these barriers.

Interprofessional teams organize health care for geriatric patients with complex, chronic problems. The interprofessional team provides care in which several disciplines coordinate assessment and treatment, so that problems can be dealt with consistently and comprehensively. Interprofessional teams are characterized by a nonhierarchical organization, in which responsibility for the effective functioning of the team is shared by all team members. Interprofessional teams go through a process of development that is described in this article, which also outlines the advantages and challenges of this approach. Educational and training resources are provided, and a case study is used to demonstrate this interprofessional approach.
... This approach accentuates the individual patient at the centre of care while also integrating families, caretakers, and the community context in which care is provided and received, encouraging awareness for social determinants of health (De Los Santos, McFarlin, & Martin, 2014;Oelke, Thurston, & Arthur, 2013). The critical strengths of delivering health service through interprofessional teams have been demonstrated in geriatric medicine, counselling psychology, and primary care (Cox, Adams, & Loughran, 2014;Reeves, Perrier, Goldman, Freeth, & Zwarenstein, 2013; Steffen, Zeiss, & Karel, 2014). Particularly in geriatric care, interprofessional collaboration has been associated with reduced costs, decreased readmission and office visits, and increases in patients' levels of social interaction (Leipzig et al., 2002;Sommers, Marton, Barbaccia, & Randolph, 2000).  ...

While supported by the Affordable Care Act, in the United States, interprofessional training often takes place after healthcare providers graduate and are practicing in the field. This article describes the implementation and evaluation of an interprofessional training for graduate-level healthcare trainees. A group of interprofessional healthcare faculty provided a weeklong interprofessional immersion for doctoral-level healthcare trainees (n = 24) in Pharmacy, Counselling Psychology, Nursing, and Family Medicine residents. Healthcare faculty and staff from each profession worked side-by-side to provide integrated training utilising the Interprofessional Education Collaborative core competency domains. Trainees were placed into small teams with representatives from each profession; each team observed, learned, and practiced working within teams to provide quality patient care. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected to identify the effect of the training on trainees’ self-reported team skills, as well as the extent to which the trainees learned and utilised the competencies. The results suggest that after completing the training, trainees felt more confident in their ability to work within an interprofessional team and more likely to utilise a team-based approach in the future.
... Mental health practitioners, including health service psychologists, are increasingly required to develop competencies in flexibly applying treatment strategies for older adults in a variety of settings(Karel, Knight, Duffy, Hinrichsen & Zeiss, 2010;Scogin & Shah, 2012;Sorocco & Lauderdale, 2011). The growing integration of mental health into primary care and other facets of healthcare also require competencies for interprofessional teamwork, especially when treating older adults with chronic health conditions (Steffen, Zeiss & Karel, 2014). A number of important professional development resources are available for trainees and established practitioners.  ...
Psychotherapy and Behavioral Health Interventions for Older Adults
Chapter

The science and practice of evidence-based psychotherapy and related mental health interventions for diverse older adults are vital parts of healthcare. These interventions can have far-reaching effects on individuals, families and society. This chapter provides a broad overview of psychological treatments for aging individuals as among the more intensive of behavioral health interventions offered by health service psychologists and other providers. Grounded in evolving biopsychosocial conceptualizations of mental and physical health in older adults, empirical support continues to build for specific forms of individual, group, couples and family psychosocial interventions. The field urgently needs stepped-care approaches that prescribe psychotherapy within a continuum of interventions for geriatric mental and physical health concerns. Developments in social psychology and behavioural neuroscience along with technological advances all shape current treatment conceptualization, efficacy and effectiveness research, dissemination practices and opportunities for professional growth in this area.
... The curricula should include exposure to normal development in aging and to the prevention, assessment, and treatment of behavioral health conditions in older adults. An emphasis in the curricula on team-based practice and integrated care would serve to educate students about evidenced-based approaches to the treatment of older adults, while also promoting the profession's objective to play a larger role in interprofessional practice within health systems (American Psychological Association, 2013a; Steffen, Zeiss, & Karel, 2014). Such resources may be of value within internship sites, as well.  ...

Professional psychology faces an urgent crisis, which the following facts paint in stark relief. Adults over age 65 will rise to 20% of the U.S. population over the next 15 years and already account for a third of the country's health care expenditures. Up to 8 million older adults experience mental health and substance use conditions in a given year, yet most psychologists receive no training in their assessment and treatment. No more than an estimated 4%, or 3,000, psychologists nationwide specialize in geropsychology; a ratio approaching 3,000 to 1. A small group of advocates within the profession have sounded the alarm and worked to strengthen geropsychology as a specialty, but this has had very limited impact on the actual supply of psychologists qualified to provide services to this population. In 2012, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee released a report on the crisis regarding the mental health and substance use workforce for older adults. Drawing on that report, a team composed of geropsychologists, along with psychologists who served on the IOM committee, identifies in this article priority areas for workforce development. The authors assess the progress of psychology in each of these areas and offer a set of recommendations for future efforts by this profession to develop its own workforce and to strengthen the ability of other caregivers to address the behavioral health needs of older adults. Strengthening its own workforce and responding to the needs of this population is imperative if psychology is to maintain its relevance as a health profession and meet its ethical obligations to an increasingly diverse society.

Patients with cancer are expected to call an oncological emergency unit when they are unable to manage symptoms of their disease and side effects from treatment at home. Responding to calls from patients with different problems in a team of registered nurses and medical doctors requires interprofessional collaboration and learning. Therefore, this study aimed to explore conditions for team-based collaboration and learning when responding to calls from patients diagnosed with cancer in a specific setting of an oncological emergency unit. Using a frame of qualitative description three focus groups with 16 healthcare professionals from an oncological emergency unit at a Danish University Hospital were conducted. The verbatim transcribed text was analyzed using content analysis, and reported according to the COREQ guidelines. Two main themes emerged: 1) ‘Availability – a precondition for learning and collaboration’ and 2) ‘Sense of responsibility and distribution of roles’. The study demonstrated that interprofessional collaboration and learning were affected by intra and interprofessional and contextual factors. In addition to an awareness of personal attitudes, the environment and the distribution of responsibility and roles as essential preconditions for accomplishing teamwork need to be explicitly articulated if the team-based learning and collaboration are to succeed.

Okay, so from these search results, I'm getting a clearer understanding of the differences between interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interprofessional approaches in healthcare.

First, let's tackle interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary.

From the first search result, it seems that in a multidisciplinary approach, different specialists work independently but simultaneously on the same patient, each contributing their own treatment plan without necessarily integrating it with others. On the other hand, an interdisciplinary approach involves specialists from different fields working together collaboratively, sharing their expertise to develop a unified care plan.

So, in multidisciplinary care, it's like each专业 works in their own lane, while in interdisciplinary care, they work in the same lane, combining their knowledge and efforts.

Now, moving on to interprofessional. I found a Reddit discussion where someone was trying to differentiate between "interprofessional" and "interdisciplinary." According to one of the responses, "interprofessional" refers to the collaboration of professionals from different fields, like doctors, nurses, pharmacists, etc., working together. "Interdisciplinary" is more about the combination of different areas of knowledge.

Another search result from the Mayo Clinic mentions that in a multidisciplinary team, specialists from different disciplines work independently, while in an interdisciplinary team, they work together collaboratively, sharing responsibilities and making joint decisions.

So, it seems that interdisciplinary and interprofessional are quite similar, but perhaps interprofessional is broader, encompassing not just disciplinary knowledge but also professional roles and responsibilities.

Let me see if I can find a more authoritative source to define these terms.

In the medical dictionary, "multidisciplinary" is defined as involving multiple specialties working together to establish a diagnosis or effect a therapy. So, again, multiple disciplines working together, but perhaps not necessarily in an integrated manner.

In contrast, "interdisciplinary" is not directly defined in the dictionary I checked, but based on the context from other sources, it seems to involve a higher level of integration and collaboration among different disciplines.

Now, regarding interprofessional, I found a presentation from the Mayo Clinic that distinguishes between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches, but doesn't directly define interprofessional. Perhaps interprofessional is a broader term that includes both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches.

Another search result from HealthySimulation.com discusses interprofessional education (IPE) and distinguishes it from multidisciplinary education. They mention that IPE involves students from different health professions learning together to improve team-based care and population health outcomes.

The Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) has defined four competencies for IPE: values and ethics, roles and responsibilities, interprofessional communication, and teams and teamwork.

So, in the context of healthcare simulation, IPE is about preparing future health professionals to work effectively in teams.

This suggests that interprofessional is about different professions working together, which aligns with the earlier definitions.

But how does this differ from interdisciplinary?

Perhaps interdisciplinary is more about integrating different disciplines' knowledge and approaches, while interprofessional is about different professions collaborating, which may or may not involve deep integration of disciplines.

Wait, but in healthcare, professions often correspond to disciplines, like medicine, nursing, pharmacy, etc. So, maybe in practice, the terms are used interchangeably.

Another search result provides a table comparing interprofessional and multidisciplinary healthcare teams. According to this table, interprofessional teams have a biopsychosocial model, involve team discussions on group processes, and have shared leadership, whereas multidisciplinary teams are more hierarchical, with each member working in their own silo.

So, it seems that interprofessional teams are more collaborative and less hierarchical.

Now, to summarize:

- Multidisciplinary: Different specialists work independently but simultaneously, each with their own treatment plan.

- Interdisciplinary: Specialists from different fields work together collaboratively, integrating their knowledge and skills to develop a unified care plan.

- Interprofessional: Professionals from different health professions work together collaboratively, focusing on team-based care and shared responsibilities.

Perhaps interprofessional is a type of interdisciplinary approach, but specifically referring to different professions working together.

Alternatively, interdisciplinary could encompass interprofessional, but also include collaboration between different academic disciplines within the same profession.

For example, in nursing, there might be interdisciplinary collaboration between nursing researchers specializing in different areas, like public health and mental health, without necessarily involving different professions.

But in healthcare delivery, interprofessional and interdisciplinary might be used interchangeably.

Given that, in the context of healthcare delivery, especially in managing complex patient cases, an interprofessional team approach seems to be favored, as it promotes better communication, coordination, and holistic care.

The benefits include improved patient outcomes, reduced errors, faster treatment, and improved efficiency.

Challenges include coordinating schedules, potential conflicts among team members, and the need for strong leadership and communication skills.

In conclusion, while multidisciplinary teams involve multiple specialists working independently, interprofessional (or interdisciplinary) teams involve these specialists working together collaboratively to provide comprehensive and integrated care to patients.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Interdisciplinary involves integration of different disciplines working together towards a common goal, while multidisciplinary involves specialists working independently but simultaneously. Interprofessional refers to different professions collaborating in a team, often used interchangeably with interdisciplinary in healthcare.}} \]
