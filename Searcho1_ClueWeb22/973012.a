I'm trying to understand why some people might not want to get vaccinated. It seems like a confusing situation because vaccines are designed to protect us from diseases, but still, there are people who choose not to get them. I need to think about this carefully.

First, I should probably look into what vaccines are and how they work. Maybe some people don't understand how vaccines work, so they're scared or unsure about getting them. I think it would be helpful to educate myself on the science behind vaccines.

Let me start by searching for information on how vaccines work.

How Do Vaccines Work?
By Stephanie Pappas published June 01, 2010

Vaccines are like a training course for the immune system. They prepare the body to fight disease without exposing it to disease symptoms.
When foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses enter the body, immune cells called lymphocytes respond by producing antibodies, which are protein molecules. These antibodies fight the invader known as an antigen and protect against further infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a healthy individual can produce millions of antibodies a day, fighting infection so efficiently that people never even know they were exposed to an antigen.
Unfortunately, the first time the body faces a particular invader, it can take several days to ramp up this antibody response. For really nasty antigens like the measles virus or whooping cough bacteria, a few days is too long. The infection can spread and kill the person before the immune system can fight back.

That's where vaccines come in. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Vaccine Education Center, vaccines are made of dead or weakened antigens. They can't cause an infection, but the immune system still sees them as an enemy and produces antibodies in response. After the threat has passed, many of the antibodies will break down, but immune cells called memory cells remain in the body.
When the body encounters that antigen again, the memory cells produce antibodies fast and strike down the invader before it's too late.
Vaccines also work on a community level. Some people can't be vaccinated, either because they are too young, or because their immune systems are too weak, according to the CDC. But if everyone around them is vaccinated, unvaccinated people are protected by something called herd immunity. In other words, they're unlikely to even come in contact with the disease, so they probably won't get sick. When it comes to vaccines, sometimes it can pay to follow the crowd.

Endah Nina Kurniawati says:
I think the vaccine is really important for us now to decrease the COVID-19 virus. I think its better to prevent the spread of the virus since there’s no medicine found to cure the COVID-19
ELLYS LASTIUR SITORUS says:
I think a good knowledge for us. Actually we’re scary about the bad effect but the government had already thought about how  through this pandemic into a normal condition, that’s why the government suggest us to take the vaccine, as a good citizen has to follow it.
Enna says:
it’s a good information for all. Everyone has right to get the vaccine or not. But prevent our family from the disease is more important.
Dyah Chandra says:
i think people have their right to speak up whether they want to vaccinate or not because everyone has their own condition.
Mardiana Trinirnawati says:
if you love yourself and your family, please do get the vaccine
Iriani Yuliar Antika says:
I think the vaccine is the best way to against covid-19. We can protect ourselves, our family, and the people around us from covid-19. I hope the world gets better and we can back to normall. Thanks
leea says:
I kinda of one of those who is vaccine hesitancy. Because I’m not sure that the vaccine with do its work. but then again, it depends on the human body immunity and all.
Lulus Istiningsih says:
I think we should not be afraid of getting vaccine because it will protect ourselves from corona virus. The government must did the research first before they inject it to us.
Damaris says:
Pandemic situation is not easy for everyone, so vaccine one of a particular thing we can do to break the spread of the viruses, lets hope that the world heal soon and we can back to normal life and be a better place. -finger cross
vivin suta yuliane says:
this is a good website that lets us know a lot of new vocabulary related to many topics. It also provides exercises to measure our vocabulary comprehension related to the topics discussed.
Tatik Sutinah says:
It’s your choice and decision for having vaccinated or not, but since this is a contagious virus and you could put other people at risk, so please get vaccinated then… for you all other people
Novi Tasari says:
It’s a great website. Now, I got a lot from this discussion. It’s about vaccine. No matter people said about fake news about vaccine. I believe that vaccine is the best way to protect our body from virus, especially Corona virus. It will reduce the spread of the the disease.
tri pras says:
We need to analyze first why some people are uncomfortable with the vaccines. If they have a good reason, it will be okay to unvaccinated.
Maria Luki Susanti says:
First, I just follow the government and WHO instruction that people need to be vaccinated. Now, I know the benefits of vaccination. It helps the body’s immunity increase and produces antibodies. It is great, I think.
Anna Maelani says:
We hope we will get the NORMAL CONDITION AS BEFORE
let’s do the HEALTH PROTOCOL
and be HEALTH AND HAPPY
Fajar Fardyansyah says:
vaccine is very important to againts Covid 19 because, when 75% peoples of the world has got the vaccine, it creates global immunity throughout the world so that the covid 19 virus can be overcome and the future of the younger generation of this kind of virus is not dangerous
ika says:
I agree about the vaccination program from the government during this pandemic time. It is one ways that we can do as prevention. By doing this I think we protect our self and others.
NURIL IMAN says:
I agree with the vaccination of covid-19. It is one way to overcome the deases of Covid-19. Hopefully after getting vaccination, the herd immunity will be build and we live in the new normal like before pandemic of covid-19.
larasati says:
In my opinion, vaccination aims to make a person’s immune system able to recognize and quickly fight viruses that cause infection. Although not 100% able to protect people from Corona virus infection, this vaccine can reduce the possibility of severe symptoms and complications due to COVID-19. In addition, the COVID-19 vaccination aims to encourage the formation of herd immunity or herd immunity. This is important because there are some people who cannot be vaccinated for certain reasons.
MULIADI,S.Pd says:
everyone has to get vaccine to get better live for better future. Vaccine doesn’t kill you.
Nunuy wulan says:
Actually we got information from this web, great! But we hope the vaccine will not side effect to people. We hope better for whole the world..thank you
Eduardo says:
The vaccine is important for everyone. A syringe makes me feel very nervous, but thinking the importance of this, I made an exception. We learned that the vaccine contains weak or inactive viruses, and our immune system produce antibodies, so incase we get the COVI, we will be able to fight it off. I hope this terrible pandemic disease goes away soon, so we can go back to our normal lives. Lastly, I would like to know the side-effects of the vaccine, especially for those with asthma issues. Thank you. Great info and lots of vocab to learn from.
Bethlahem says:
This one’s a great explanation so everyone can be persuade to take the vaccine as everyone thought it’s harmful to have the vaccine. Thanks a lot
Johanna rodriguez says:
La primera pregunta no entendi
Carlos Gómez says:
that we should not self-medicate rather we must go to the doctor and so they will be sent the correct medications and if someone has covid it is better to do the vapors and drink those waters that help many because if they go to the hospital they get sick more than usual because There is conditioned air there and that is bad for people who are sick (I mean, they have covid).
ANDREA GONZALEZ BUSTAMANTE says:
Falle 1 una
Temitope says:
Esl is an amazing website. Thank  you
DAVID MARTIN SANCHEZ says:
In my view, nurses don’t inject people unfamiliar substances because they inoculate an inactive or a weak version of the virus.
Information is the key for taking the right decision, but nowadays we have to be careful with fake news, so it’s important to check the information you get: check the source and their interests, why they say that, is it true?, etc.
Fake news harm the whole society, so it’s important to deactivate them and to spread true facts. In news it’s also important to distinguish between facts and opinions.
With the information we know about vaccines and the information we’ve got, as far as I am concern, if you don’t get vaccinated you’re a fool who is risking your health and the others’.
Think of your relatives, friends, acquaintances, etc. and be wise, if you don’t get the vaccination you won’t be able to travel anywhere or you’ll have trouble for doing it.
Shokouh says:
It is so useful to know about  virus
Socorro says:
Thank you for the information, I have many vaccine, bat I din’t know how it’s working.

Hi there! I totally agree with you. I think this short audio-text is a hot subject amid coronavirus pandemic outbreak around the world. It helps people grasp how vaccines work to understand the great importance to invent one vaccine against this disease.
According to CNN updated May 1, 20, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 3,2 million people and killed at least 233 thousand around the world. So the vaccine to fight off this disease is currently indispensable to our world.
Injecting vaccine into the body could be uncomfortable  for some, but disease prevention is more important, I guess.
Thank you.

How Vaccines Work
What is Immunity?
When disease germs enter your body, they start to reproduce. Your immune system recognizes these germs as foreign invaders and responds by making proteins called antibodies. These antibodies' first job is to help destroy the germs that are making you sick. They 
                                        may not act fast enough to prevent you from becoming sick, but by eliminating the attacking germs, antibodies help you to get well.
The antibodies’ second job is to protect you from future infections. They remain in your bloodstream, and if the same germs ever try to infect you again — even after many years — they will come to your defense. Only now that they are experienced at fighting these particular germs, they can destroy them before they have a chance to make you sick. This is immunity. It is why most people get diseases like measles or chickenpox only once, even though they might be exposed many times during their lifetime.
Vaccines to the Rescue
Vaccines offer a solution to this problem. They help you develop immunity without getting sick first.
Vaccines are made from the same germs (or parts of them) that cause disease; for example, polio vaccine is made from polio virus. But the germs in vaccines are either killed or weakened so they won't make you sick.
Vaccines 
                                        containing these weakened or killed 
                                        germs are introduced into your body, 
                                        usually by injection. Your immune system 
                                        reacts to the vaccine in a similar way 
                                        that it would if it were being invaded 
                                        by the disease — by making antibodies. 
                                        The antibodies destroy the vaccine germs 
                                        just as they would the disease germs — 
                                        like a training exercise. Then they stay 
                                        in your body, giving you immunity. If 
                                        you are ever exposed to the real 
                                        disease, the antibodies are there to 
                                        protect you.

How Vaccines Work
How Vaccines Work
A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. To do this, certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response.
These molecules are called antigens, and they are present on all viruses and bacteria. By injecting these antigens into the body, the immune system can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies, and remember them for the future. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will recognize the antigens immediately and attack aggressively well before the pathogen can spread and cause sickness.
The Herd Immunity Imperative
Vaccines don't just work on an individual level, they protect entire populations. Once enough people are immunized, opportunities for an outbreak of disease become so low even people who aren't immunized benefit. Essentially, a bacteria or virus simply won't have enough eligible hosts to establish a foothold and will eventually die out entirely. This phenomenon is called "herd immunity" or "community immunity," and it has allowed once-devastating diseases to be eliminated entirely, without needing to vaccinate every individual.
Featured Online Programs
This is critical because there will always be a percentage of the population that cannot be vaccinated, including infants, young children, the elderly, people with severe allergies, pregnant women, or people with compromised immune systems. Thanks to herd immunity, these people are kept safe because diseases are never given a chance to spread through a population.
Public health officials and scientists continue to study herd immunity and identify key thresholds, but one telling example is the country of Gambia, where a vaccination rate of just 70% of the population was enough to eliminate Hib disease entirely.
However, if too many people forgo vaccinations, herd immunity can break down, opening up the population to the risk of outbreaks. That is why many officials and doctors consider widespread immunization a public health imperative and blame recent disease outbreaks on a lack of vaccination.
For example, in 1997, prominent medical journal The Lancet published research claiming to have found a link between the measles vaccine and autism. As a result, in following years the parents of over a million British children decided not to vaccinate their kids. The research has since been thoroughly debunked, but the number of measles cases has skyrocketed, from just several dozen a year in 1997 to over 2,000 cases in 2011. Similar outbreaks have occurred throughout the United States, involving both measles and whooping cough, with doctors and officials blaming low rates of vaccination.
Types of Vaccines
The key to vaccines is injecting the antigens into the body without causing the person to get sick at the same time. Scientists have developed several ways of doing this, and each approach makes for a different type of vaccine.
Live Attenuated Vaccines: For these types of vaccines, a weaker, asymptomatic form of the virus or bacteria is introduced into the body. Because it is weakened, the pathogen will not spread and cause sickness, but the immune system will still learn to recognize its antigens and know to fight in the future.
Advantages: Because these vaccines introduce actual live pathogens into the body, it is an excellent simulation for the immune system. So live attenuated vaccines can result in lifelong immunity with just one or two doses.
Disadvantages: Because they contain living pathogens, live attenuated vaccines are not given to people with weakened immune systems, such as people undergoing chemotherapy or HIV treatment, as there is a risk the pathogen could get stronger and cause sickness. Additionally, these vaccines must be refrigerated at all times so the weakened pathogen doesn't die.
Specific Vaccines:
Measles
Mumps
Rubella (MMR combined vaccine)
Varicella (chickenpox)
Influenza (nasal spray)
Rotavirus
Inactivated Vaccines: For these vaccines, the specific virus or bacteria is killed with heat or chemicals, and its dead cells are introduced into the body. Even though the pathogen is dead, the immune system can still learn from its antigens how to fight live versions of it in the future.
Advantages: These vaccines can be freeze dried and easily stored because there is no risk of killing the pathogen as there is with live attenuated vaccines. They are also safer, without the risk of the virus or bacteria mutating back into its disease-causing form.
Disadvantages: Because the virus or bacteria is dead, it's not as accurate a simulation of the real thing as a live attenuated virus. Therefore, it often takes several doses and "booster shots" to train the body to defend itself.
Specific Vaccines:
Polio (IPV)
Hepatitis A
Rabies
Subunit/conjugate Vaccines: For some diseases, scientists are able to isolate a specific protein or carbohydrate from the pathogen that, when injected into the body, can train the immune system to react without provoking sickness.
Advantages: With these vaccines, the chance of an adverse reaction in the patient is much lower, because only a part or the original pathogen is injected into the body instead of the whole thing.
Disadvantages: Identifying the best antigens in the pathogen for training the immune system and then separating them is not always possible. Only certain vaccines can be produced in this way.
Specific Vaccines:
Hepatitis B
Influenza
Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib)
Pertussis (part of DTaP combined immunization)
Pneumococcal
Human Papillomavirus (HPV)
Meningococcal
Toxoid Vaccines: Some bacterial diseases damage the body by secreting harmful chemicals or toxins. For these bacteria, scientists are able to "deactivate" some of the toxins using a mixture of formaldehyde and water. These dead toxins are then safely injected into the body. The immune system learns well enough from the dead toxins to fight off living toxins, should they ever make an appearance.
Specific Vaccines:
Diphtheria
Tetanus
Conjugate Vaccines: Some bacteria, like those of Hib disease, possess an outer coating of sugar molecules that camouflage their antigens and fool young immune systems. To get around this problem, scientists can link an antigen from another recognizable pathogen to the sugary coating of the camouflaged bacteria. As a result, the body's immune system learns to recognize the sugary camouflage itself as harmful and immediately attacks it and its carrier if it enters the body.
Specific Vaccines:
Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib)
DNA Vaccines: Still in experimental stages, DNA vaccines would dispense with all unnecessary parts of a bacterium or virus and instead contain just an injection of a few parts of the pathogen's DNA. These DNA strands would instruct the immune system to produce antigens for combating the pathogen all by itself. As a result, these vaccines would be very efficient immune system trainers. They are also cheap and easy to produce.
Specific Vaccines: DNA vaccines for influenza and herpes are currently in human testing phases.
Recombinant Vector Vaccines: These experimental vaccines are similar to DNA vaccines in that they introduce DNA from a harmful pathogen into the body, triggering the immune system to produce antigens and train itself to identify and combat the disease. The difference is that these vaccines use an attenuated, or weakened, virus or bacterium as a ride, or vector, for the DNA. In essence, scientists are able to take a harmless pathogen, dress it in the DNA of a more dangerous disease, and train the body to recognize and fight both effectively.
Specific Vaccines: Recombinant vector vaccines for HIV, rabies, and measles are currently being developed.

1. Introduction
Most of the current vaccines are delivered through intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. What happens between the injection, the early reaction, and the induction of protective mechanisms is explained in this chapter. Vaccine responses depend on their interaction with the immune system and understanding the main features of this interaction may help designing vaccines and defining optimal vaccination strategies. Five steps are involved: (1) initial events at the site of injection and the draining lymph nodes (dLNs); (2) recognition of antigenic specificities at B- and T-cell level; (3) cell proliferation, maturation, and differentiation; (4) effector stage with production of antibodies and effector T cells; and (5) building up of immunological memory that allows later responses at the time of exposure to the specific pathogen. We will briefly review each of these steps and consider the importance of the vaccine types and vaccine formulations in the outcome of induced responses.
More emphasis will be given to vaccine-induced antibody responses. Indeed most of the current vaccines essentially work through effects of antibodies. 1 Antibodies can protect by a number of effector mechanisms. 2 They can bind to the enzymatic active sites of microbial toxins and prevent their action and diffusion. They can neutralize viral replication through preventing virus entry into their target cells. They can activate the complement cascade and promote opsonization and phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages and neutrophils. These effects are essential to rapidly limit the microbial load and to help clearing extracellular pathogens from the body. However, critical factors influence vaccine-induced antibody responses.
2. What follows a vaccine injection? Basis of antibody response to protein vaccines
When one injects a classical subunit vaccine (eg, influenza or tetanus toxoid) intramuscularly, the first reaction is local pain, followed by varying levels of swelling and redness. This reaction reflects an inflammation at the injection site, characterized by increased vascular permeability and local recruitment of inflammatory cells from circulating blood. 3
The Lymph that may contain antigens and antigen-transporting cells arrives from the injection site through lymphatic channels. These channels open on the outer part of the dLN, in the subcapsular (or marginal) sinus. Antigens and antigen-containing cells are distributed through small conduits within the lymph node to the outer cortex and to the inner medulla. The cortex is filled with lymphocytes and the outer cortex contains aggregates of cells called follicles (B-cell zones). T cells are densely located around the cortical follicles and also extend to the medulla (Fig. 2.1 ).

First, vaccine antigens migrate from the injection site to the dLNs through afferent lymphatic channels (Step 1). They are then picked up by subcapsular macrophages in the marginal sinus and delivered to B cells in the B-cell zone (Step 2). These B cells benefit from a helper effect from T cells located at the T–B cell border (Step 3) and are essential elements of the germinal center (GC) that develops within lymphoid follicles (Step 4). The process will eventually lead to the differentiation of plasma cells and memory cells.
3. Vaccine antigen recognition
Antibody responses to protein vaccines depend on their recognition by B-cell receptors and interactions between B- and T cells within lymph nodes. The immune system can recognize 10 7 –10 9 different antigenic moieties: B- and T cells carry a highly diverse set of antigen receptors that are generated in naïve cells through gene rearrangement.4., 5. Soluble antigens, such as those present in a classical influenza vaccine, which are drained from the site of injection to the marginal sinus of the local lymph nodes are translocated by specific subcapsular macrophages into the B-cell zone. If the vaccine forms a depot at the site of injection, for example, tetanus toxoid adsorbed to an aluminum salt, antigens are also captured by attracted monocytes/dendritic cells (DCs) which then migrate to the T–B cell zone border of the dLNs. There, antigen transported by activated DCs recruit and activate antigen-specific CD4 T helper cells that provide appropriate cofactors for the stimulation of antigen-specific B cells. This leads to the first step of the antibody response, called “extrafollicular” (Fig. 2.2 ). It is associated with B-cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells but the resulting antibodies are of low affinity and the response is short-lived. 6 It should be noted that replicating live vaccines which are usually injected subcutaneously, are more widely distributed than subunit vaccines. They can induce responses in multiple lymphoid sites largely dependant on the viral vaccine dynamics and tropism.

4. Germinal center reaction
The second step of the immune response is essential. It is the GC reaction. Activated antigen-specific B cells and CD4 follicular helper T cells (Tfh) are attracted by antigen-bearing follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and form specialized units, GCs, within lymphoid follicles (Fig. 2.2 ). A GC can be considered as a B-cell factory. It is providing an optimal environment where within a few days, B-cell clones actively proliferate. This proliferation is associated with an extensive somatic hypermutation process that affects the variable-region segments of immunoglobulin. In some B cells, this results in higher affinity B-cell receptors. Such B cells compete efficiently for binding to the vaccine antigen that persists at the surface of FDCs. After antigen processing, they benefit from helper signals and further proliferate. 7 B cells also switch from IgM to IgA, IgG, or IgE antibody production. Finally, they mature either into antibody-producing plasma cells or into memory B cells. Plasma cells become detectable in blood after 10–14 days, reaching their peak at 4 weeks after immunization. Most plasma cells die after a few weeks. However, some home to “survival niches” in the bone marrow where they are rescued from apoptosis, become long-lived plasma cells, and are responsible for the prolonged persistence of antibody production. 8
Some essential factors control the initial peak antibody responses: (1) antigen characteristics such as the epitopic structure (2) the administered dose, (3) B-/T-cell repertoires, largely influenced by genetics, and (4) the activation status of antigen-presenting cells and the generation of Tfh (GC control) that are dependent on the triggering of innate immunity by adjuvants and pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Adjuvants can optimize antigen delivery to B cells and activate DCs, follicular helper T cells and B cells.
The duration of the antibody response is largely dependent on the number of long-lived plasma cells that have been induced. For example, the persistence of HBsAg vaccine antibodies may be predicted on the basis of initial antibody titers.9
5. Building B-cell memory
Sustaining protection using a protein vaccine is usually dependent on the administration of a booster dose of the same vaccine several months or years after the priming series. Following a booster dose, antibody levels rise rapidly with a peak around day 7. Antibody titers are higher than after the priming dose and the quality of these antibodies, for example, neutralizing capacity, is also better than in the initial stages. This reflects a higher affinity. This antibody response (so-called secondary response) lasts longer than the primary one. In fact, secondary responses reflect the restimulation of persisting memory B cells that were induced during the primary immunization. 1 All protein vaccines induce memory. As previously described, memory B cells are produced within GCs in parallel with the induction of antibody-producing plasma cells. However, after migrating in the blood, they localize in the B-cell zone of all lymph nodes and remain quiescent until a new antigen encounter. Their reactivation can result from a natural microbial exposure (colonization, infection), exposure to cross-reacting microbial antigens, or booster vaccine doses. This leads to a very rapid cell multiplication and differentiation, explaining the rapid increase of antibody level (IgG) within 4–7 days. The improved quality of these secondary antibodies reflects the affinity maturation that takes place during the first phase of the immune response. During the GC reaction, random somatic mutations occur in B-cell immunoglobulin genes. Some of them confer a better capacity to bind to the vaccine antigen and these cells get a definite competing advantage in the context of limited availability of antigen. Within the GC, only those B cells that strongly bind antigen on FDCs receive the appropriate survival signals. Memory B cells continue their affinity maturation during several months and this leads to the persistence of cells that have at their surface immunoglobulin receptors of higher affinity than the antibodies produced as a result of the primary response. Thus, when reactivated, memory B cells produce antibodies of higher affinity.
In addition to the essential factors that control primary responses, a critical determinant of the quality of secondary responses is the timing of vaccine boosters. The interval between priming and boosting should be sufficient to allow for affinity maturation. A too short interval would result in additional primary dose effect. For example, in adolescents receiving two doses of 10 μg of hepatitis B vaccine, it was found that antibody responses measured 1 month after the second immunization were much higher after a 6-months interval than a 4-months interval. 10 Similarly, it was observed in young adolescents that superior responses were induced after a 0–6-months than a 0–2-months schedule with a bivalent adjuvanted HPV vaccine.11
Therefore, on the basis of immunological data, it appears now logical to consider as an ideal protein vaccine schedule, the following sequence: priming with one or two doses (at 1-month interval), then rest for 4 or 5 months to allow for B-cell response maturation, and then boosting at 6 months. Obviously, adjustments have often to be made in relation to programmatic limitations or epidemiologic considerations.
6. Response to polysaccharide vaccines
Antibody responses to polysaccharides are independent from T-cell help and do not involve a GC reaction. Polysaccharides are presented to the immune system during bacterial infections or after vaccination (eg, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines). This leads to the rapid induction of a wave of short-lived antibody-producing plasma cells. This is the end result of a sequence of events. 6 First, injected polysaccharides diffuse through lymphatic vessels to the local dLN. They enter the dLN through the marginal sinus and are captured by subcapsular sinus macrophages that translocate them to the marginal B-cell zone (Fig. 2.1 ). In the B-cell zone, the PS antigens are exposed to a large number of B cells and bind to the few cells that carry surface immunoglobulins able to recognize this particular PS antigen with a sufficient strength. The cross-linking of B-cell receptors results in the activation and proliferation of these B-cell clones which differentiate into short-lived antibody-producing plasma cells. The absence of GC reaction explains why vaccination with plain polysaccharide vaccines induces antibody responses that are relatively modest and do not last for very long. A characteristic of these responses is the poor induction of memory. 12 Usually a second injection of the same vaccine after a few months induces again a primary response similar to the first injection. However, the second administration may result in a decreased response to the PS vaccine or to a corresponding PS-conjugate. This hyporesponsiveness was first reported for meningococcal C polysaccharide vaccine and subsequently for pneumococcal vaccines and is probably reflecting an exhaustion of the antigen-specific B-cell reservoir. 13
Responses to polysaccharides can be markedly improved through the use of protein-conjugated glycoconjugates.14 When capsular PS are conjugated to a protein carrier, there is an effective GC response due to the differentiation of carrier-specific Tfh cells and PS-specific B cells which differentiate into high-affinity antibody-producing cells, long-lived plasma cells, and memory B cells.
The assessment of antibody responses is initially based on measurement of the amount of antigen-binding immunoglobulin (eg, ELISA assays) or the number of antigen-specific B cells (ELISPOT assays) before or after their in vitro reactivation by antigen. However, functional assays for example, viral or toxin neutralization assays, measurement of serum bactericidal or opsonophagocytic activity, and influenza hemagglutination inhibition may better correlate with vaccine efficacy.
7. Vaccine-induced T-cell responses
All protein vaccines induce T-cell responses. They are essential to support the induction of antibodies (helper effects). They also participate in effector mechanisms that contribute to reducing the microbial load and clearing pathogens in infections by viruses and intracellular pathogens and they play a major role in controlling immune responses and limiting the risk of concomitant autoimmune manifestations.
The production of T-cell precursors takes place in bone marrow where, like B cells, their initial repertoire are being developed through receptor gene rearrangements. This results in a hugely diverse capacity of recognition of antigen moieties. However, two major characteristics dominate the recognition pattern. First, T-cell receptors only see small peptides bound in the groove of HLA surface molecules. Second, T cells have to undergo a severe selection process in the thymus while maturing into potential effector cells (CD4, CD8). Paradoxically, the T-cell repertoire that participates in defense mechanisms against foreign invaders is initially selected on its capacity to bind self-peptide–HLA complexes on thymic cortical epithelial cells. 15 However, a subsequent negative selection takes place in the thymus medulla and only low affinity self-reactors leave the thymus. Medium-affinity cells form a pool of regulatory T cells. Interestingly, the protective function of vaccine-induced T cells is relying on cross-reactivity between self and foreign peptide moieties. 16 After vaccination, initial contacts between specific T cells and vaccine antigens primarily take place in the dLNs (Fig. 2.3 ). T cells recognize peptide–HLA complexes presented on DCs, in the T-cell zone of the dLN. T-cell activation and proliferation require a number of cofactors, including cytokines and other chemokines as well as cell-to-cell contact. As previously indicated, CD4+ helper T cells and particularly Tfh strongly contribute to T-dependent B-cell responses. Some of the CD4 progeny cells primarily release Th1-type cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α/β, IL-2) and others Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-14, IL-6, IL-10), whereas Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-21, IL-22. Conversely to B cells, T cells do not undergo extensive somatic mutations or affinity maturation in peripheral lymphoid organs after immune activation.

8. Innate immunity and T-cell differentiation
How do vaccines induce more or less specific T cells of one or another cell type?
A key step is the activation of innate immunity. At the site of vaccine injection, the formulated antigens induce a local inflammation which favors the recruitment and activation of DCs as professional antigen-presenting cells. These cells capture the antigens as well as the accompanying adjuvant or microbial DC activator which makes them express activation markers while migrating toward the local dLNs. DCs, monocytes, and neutrophils can be activated by “danger signals” of microbial origin. They have receptors—including the so-called Toll-like receptors (TLR) which can recognize evolutionarily conserved pathogen patterns that differ from self-antigens. 17 Their activation results in the increased expression of critical surface molecules and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.18., 19., 20.
In the absence of activation signals, DC may present processed antigenic peptides to specific T cells in a tolerogenic mode. These DC remain immature and, on contact with naïve T cells, trigger their differentiation into regulatory CD4+ T cells that maintain immune tolerance. 21
A moderate level of DC activation, for example, when using aluminum salts as adjuvant, may favor Th2-type responses. Strong inflammatory signals favor the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells toward the Th1 type. With some adjuvants, there is an induction of Th17 cells, which play a major role in tissue inflammation, particularly at mucosal level.
CD4+ T cells may also differentiate into regulatory T cells (Treg), which inhibit T-cell proliferation/activation and help terminate a T-cell response. They also play an essential role in avoiding excessive cross-reactions against autologous tissues during responses to microbial aggression. 22
Live viral vaccines introduce antigens within the cell cytosol, ensuring their access to MHC class I molecules. As a result, they also induce CD8+ T cells which after activation can produce high amounts of IFN-γ and become potent killer cells. CD8+ T cells recognize peptides associated with MHC-type 1 whereas CD4+ T cells recognize peptides associated with MHC-type 2 molecules. 23
9. Vaccine-induced T-cell memory
T-cell memory is a critical component of immune responses to intracellular pathogens. Following the antigen-driven expansion and the death of effector cells after antigen clearance, some of the remaining T cells differentiate into memory T cells of two different types: central memory and effector memory T cells. 24 The first ones are located in lymphoid organs and bone marrow and have a high proliferative potential whereas the second ones stay in peripheral tissues in a preactivated form that enables them with immediate action on pathogen recognition. A third type of memory T cells (resident memory cells) was recently recognized as memory T cells which remain settled within specific organs such as the intestine, the lungs, and the skin. They appear important for the protection against mucosal infections. 25
It is useful to know that the establishment of T-cell memory requires some time after the initial priming. Secondary T-cell responses are lower if vaccine boosters are given too early. Through homeostatic proliferation, memory T cells may persist lifelong, even without antigen exposure. 26
A number of T-cell parameters can be measured during vaccine studies. Some are quantitative for example, measurement of T-cell proliferation following antigen stimulation with a dye and quantification of T-cell frequencies by ELISPOT or flow cytometry. Some assays add a functional component, for example, assessment of the production of cytokines by ELISPOT or flow cytometry, or cytotoxic assays.
10. Conclusions
There is now a better understanding of the different factors that affect vaccine-induced responses. This allows for a more rational development of new vaccines and building more appropriate vaccination strategies. A particular attention is required for the selection of an appropriate formulation. Vaccine characteristics have a significant impact on the initial steps of immune responses, extrafollicular responses, and the generation of GCs. A critical aspect of vaccine efficacy is the duration of protection. In most cases, it depends on the quality of memory induced by priming doses. Both B- and T-cell memory are slowly maturing, which implies the need for a sufficient delay before giving a vaccine booster dose. Responses to live viral vaccines are more disseminated and the exposure to vaccine antigens is often prolonged, resulting into stronger- and longer-lasting responses. The understanding of how adjuvants influence the T- and B-cell machinery should help to define optimal pathways toward protective vaccine responses.

Alright, so I've got this information on how vaccines work. Let me try to make sense of it. So, vaccines are like training for our immune system. They show our body what a germ looks like without actually making us sick. Our immune system then remembers how to fight that germ if we ever encounter it for real. That way, we're protected without having to go through the illness.

From what I read, there are different types of vaccines. Some use a weakened or dead version of the germ, while others might just use a piece of the germ, like a protein or sugar molecule. The idea is to give the immune system just enough to recognize the germ but not enough to cause disease.

I think understanding how vaccines work could help explain why some people might be hesitant to get them. Maybe they don't fully understand the process or have concerns about safety. It's important to address these concerns with accurate information.

So, next, I should look into why people might not want to get vaccinated. Maybe there are common misconceptions or personal beliefs that play a role.

Let me try to list some possible reasons:

1. **Fear of side effects:** Some people might be worried about getting sick from the vaccine itself or experiencing serious side effects.

2. **Distrust in medicine or government:** There might be a general mistrust in the medical establishment or the government agencies that approve vaccines.

3. **Religious or philosophical beliefs:** Some people have religious beliefs that prohibit vaccination, or they might have philosophical objections to altering the body in this way.

4. **Misinformation or myths:** There are a lot of myths and misinformation out there about vaccines, such as the false link between vaccines and autism.

5. **Lack of belief in the need for vaccination:** Some people might not see the value in vaccination if they haven't personally experienced the diseases that vaccines prevent.

6. **Convenience or access:** Not everyone has easy access to vaccines, or they might find it inconvenient to get vaccinated.

I should probably look deeper into each of these reasons to understand them better.

First, let's consider the fear of side effects. I know that vaccines can sometimes cause mild side effects like soreness at the injection site, fever, or fatigue. These are usually short-lived and mild compared to the potential severity of the disease they prevent. But I can see how someone who doesn't understand this might be scared of getting sick from the vaccine.

Maybe I should look up information on vaccine side effects to get a better understanding.

Arnold Schwarzenegger Gets COVID Vaccine And Urges Others To Follow Suit
Many COVID-19 vaccines, especially two-dose regimens, have a variety of side effects. The debate over the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine has many recipients wondering if their symptoms are normal. Here’s a list of the most common symptoms for the main vaccines, all of which can be uncomfortable but are ultimately harmless in the vast majority of cases.
This data comes from clinical trials, conducted by manufacturers and compiled courtesy of The Guardian. The symptoms listed were reported within a week of receiving the vaccine and typically cleared up in less than three days for the Moderna vaccine.
Experiencing symptoms is actually a positive sign for recipients: Vaccines work by provoking an immune response with a defanged version of a disease, ensuring if the real deal comes along the body already remembers the illness and can better defend itself. Vaccine symptoms mean the drug is doing its job.

Whether you've gotten your COVID shot already or you're still waiting for your chance, you've likely heard plenty of commentary from friends, family, and internet strangers about the side effects they experienced post-vaccine. While discussing vaccine side effects can help people know what to expect, it's also important to know that reactions vary widely depending on age, sex, and which vaccine you get.
Recently, Mother Jones made charts using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that break down the most common side effects by age and vaccine. Read on to find out the most common side effects in your age group, and for more on vaccine reactions, discover The Common Vaccine Side Effect That No One Is Talking About, Experts Say.

Although the most common side effects people experience tend to be pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain, there are other side effects that pop up frequently. Muscle pain was most commonly reported by Moderna recipients, with 61 percent of people aged 18 to 64 and 47 percent of people over 64 reporting the side effect. It was also fairly common among the other vaccines, with 37 percent of the younger cohort and 29 percent of the older Pfizer recipients reporting muscle pain. According to the data, 39 percent of the younger Johnson & Johnson recipients reported muscle pain, while 24 percent of the older group said the same.
Nausea and vomiting are fairly common occurrences for people who receive the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but they're rare occurrences for those who get the Pfizer shot, with less than 3 percent of people reporting it. Fever was not commonly reported across the board, with less than 18 percent of recipients of any vaccine reporting it. That side effect was also less common among the older cohorts.

Here are all the side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines
Staff Report October 1, 2021 @ 9:25 AM
The push for the vaccine has come to a head, and many people are losing their jobs over it.
Side effects are a huge worry for many, and many side effects are common and go away after a few days.
The CDC says there have been no reported long term side effects as the monitoring continues.
Here are all the possible side effects for those that are worried about getting the COVID vaccine:
Redness, pain, and swelling are common at the site of injection.
It’s also common to experience headaches, tiredness, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea.
A fever and body aches can show that the body is building immunity against COVID.
Over the counter medicines can help relieve these symptoms.
A cool cloth for pain and discomfort can help as well as drinking fluids for a fever.
Some report stronger side effects after the second dose.
The more serious side effects are rare, and the CDC makes it clear the benefits outweigh the risks.
One rare event reported was Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune neurological disorder causing weakness and paralysis in muscles and limbs.
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has also been reported as a rare symptom, which causes blood clots and low platelet levels.
For Moderna, the shot has been administered to over 12 million individuals with 100 reports of Guillain-Barré and one death. Symptoms start with weakness and tingling before rapidly spreading.
For TTS, there have been 38 cases reported within 15 days of the individuals getting the vaccine. Four of these resulted in death. Symptoms appear between 4 and 30 days after vaccination and manifest as headaches that persist, visual changes, abdominal pain, chest pain, leg pain, coldness in limbs and acute bruising or bleeding.
To compare numbers, for every one million doses of Moderna men between 50 and 64 receive, the 1,800 hospitalizations and 140 deaths from COVID could have been prevented compared to the 14-17 Guilian-Barré cases and 1-2 TTS cases that could be prevented from not being vaccinated.
The Pfizer vaccine has reported cases of myocarditis after the second dose, mostly in men, several days following the vaccination.
Of the 141 million people who have had the vaccine, 497 cases of myocarditis were reported with no deaths.
Side effects include shortness of breath, chest pain, and feelings of a fast or fluttering heart.
The flu vaccine is safe to get with the COVID vaccine.

Vaccine Side Effects and Adverse Events

A vaccine is a medical product. Vaccines, though they are designed to protect from disease, can cause side effects, just as any medication can.
Most side effects from vaccination are mild, such as soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site. Some vaccines are associated with fever, rash, and achiness. Serious side effects are rare, but may include seizure or life-threatening allergic reaction.
A possible side effect resulting from a vaccination is known as an adverse event.
Each year, American babies (1 year old and younger) receive more than 10 million vaccinations. During the first year of life, a significant number of babies suffer serious, life-threatening illnesses and medical events, such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Additionally, it is during the first year that congenital conditions may become evident. Therefore, due to chance alone, many babies will experience a medical event in close proximity to a vaccination. This does not mean, though, that the event is in fact related to the immunization. The challenge is to determine when a medical event is directly related to a vaccination.
The Food and Drug and Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have set up systems to monitor and analyze reported adverse events and to determine whether they are likely related to vaccination.
Types of Side Effects
To understand the range of possible vaccination side effects events, it is useful to compare a vaccine with relatively few associated side effects, such as the vaccine for Haemophilus influenza type B, with a vaccine known to have many potential side effects, such as the infrequently used smallpox vaccine (given to military personnel and others who might be first responders in the event of a bioterror attack).
Haemophilus influenza type B is a bacterium that can cause serious infections, including meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and sepsis. The CDC recommends that children receive a series of Hib vaccinations starting when they are two months old.
Smallpox is a serious infection, fatal In 30% to 40% of cases, and caused by the Variola major or Variola minor virus. No wild smallpox cases have been reported since the 1970s. The World Health Organization has declared it eradicated.
The information below about side effects of Hib and smallpox vaccination is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hib Vaccine Side Effects
Redness, warmth, or swelling where the shot was given (up to 1 out of 4 children)
Fever over 101°F (up to 1 out of 20 children)
No serious side effects have been related to the Hib vaccine.
Smallpox (Vaccinia) Vaccine Side Effects
Mild to Moderate Problems
Mild rash, lasting 2-4 days.
Swelling and tenderness of lymph nodes, lasting 2-4 weeks after the blister has healed.
Fever of over 100°F (about 70% of children, 17% of adults) or over 102°F (about 15%-20% of children, under 2% of adults).
Secondary blister elsewhere on the body (about 1 per 1,900).
Moderate to Severe Problems
Serious eye infection, or loss of vision, due to spread of vaccine virus to the eye.
Rash on entire body (as many as 1 per 4,000).
Severe rash on people with eczema (as many as 1 per 26,000).
Encephalitis (severe brain reaction), which can lead to permanent brain damage (as many as 1 per 83,000).
Severe infection beginning at the vaccination site (as many as 1 per 667,000, mostly in people with weakened immune systems).
Death (1-2 per million, mostly in people with weakened immune systems).
For every million people vaccinated for smallpox, between 14 and 52 could have a life-threatening reaction to smallpox vaccine.
How Do I Find Out the Side Effects for Different Vaccines?
When you or a child gets a vaccine, the health care provider gives you a handout known as the Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). The VIS describes common and rare side effects, if any are known, of the vaccine. Your health care provider will probably discuss possible side effects with you. VIS downloads are also available through the CDC’s website.
Package inserts produced by the vaccine manufacturer also provide information about adverse events. Additionally, these inserts usually show rates of adverse events in experimental and control groups during pre-market testing of the vaccine.
How Are Adverse Events Monitored?
VAERS
The CDC and FDA established The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in 1990. The goal of VAERS, according to the CDC, is “to detect possible signals of adverse events associated with vaccines.” (A signal in this case is evidence of a possible adverse event that emerges in the data collected.) About 30,000 events are reported each year to VAERS. Between 10% and 15% of these reports describe serious medical events that result in hospitalization, life-threatening illness, disability, or death.
VAERS is a voluntary reporting system. Anyone, such as a parent, a health care provider, or friend of the patient, who suspects an association between a vaccination and an adverse event may report that event and information about it to VAERS. The CDC then investigates the event and tries to find out whether the adverse event was in fact caused by the vaccination.
The CDC states that they monitor VAERS data to
Detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events
Monitor increases in known adverse events
Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events
Identify vaccine lots with increased numbers or types of reported adverse events
Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines
Not all adverse events reported to VAERS are in fact caused by a vaccination. The two occurrences may be related in time only. And, it is probable that not all adverse events resulting from vaccination are reported to VAERS. The CDC states that many adverse events such as swelling at the injection site are underreported. Serious adverse events, according to the CDC, “are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes.”
VAERS has successfully identified several rare adverse events related to vaccination. Among them are
An intestinal problem after the first vaccine for rotavirus was introduced (the vaccine was withdrawn in 1999)
Neurologic and gastrointestinal diseases related to yellow fever vaccine
Additionally, according to Plotkin et al., VAERS identified a need for further investigation of MMR association with a blood clotting disorder, encephalopathy after MMR, and syncope after immunization (Plotkin SA et al. Vaccines, 5 th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2008).
Vaccine Safety Datalink
The CDC established this system in 1990. The VSD is a collection of linked databases containing information from large medical groups. The linked databases allow officials to gather data about vaccination among the populations served by the medical groups. Researchers can access the data by proposing studies to the CDC and having them approved.
The VSD has some drawbacks. For example, few completely unvaccinated children are listed in the database. The medical groups providing information to VSD may have patient populations that are not representative of large populations in general. Additionally, the data come not from randomized, controlled, blinded trials but from actual medical practice. Therefore, it may be difficult to control and evaluate the data.
Rapid Cycle Analysis is a program of the VSD, launched in 2005. It monitors real-time data to compare rates of adverse events in recently vaccinated people with rates among unvaccinated people. The system is used mainly to monitor new vaccines. Among the new vaccines being monitored in Rapid Cycle Analysis are the conjugated meningococcal vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, MMRV vaccine, Tdap vaccine, and the HPV vaccine. Possible associations between adverse events and vaccination are then studied further.

Timeline Entry: 4/24/1955
The Cutter Incident
Just a few weeks after the landmark press conference announcing success of the vaccine trials, an Idaho doctor reported a case of paralytic polio in a recently vaccinated girl. Over the next few weeks, similar reports trickled in to local health authorities. All involved a disturbing detail: paralysis began in the vaccinated arm, rather than in the legs as was more common.
It soon emerged that most of the cases of paralytic polio occurred in children inoculated with vaccine produced by Cutter Laboratories in California.

Timeline Entry: 10/15/1999
Rotavirus: First Vaccine Withdrawn
The first vaccine for rotavirus, a common cause of severe childhood diarrheal illness, RotaShield, was licensed and recommended for routine childhood immunization in 1998. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, however, withdrew the vaccine in 1999 due to safety concerns. Scientists associated the vaccine with a rare intestinal problem called intussusception, a potentially fatal telescoping of part of the bowel.

Timeline Entry: 1948
Kyoto Disaster
In Kyoto, Japan, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization as a result of improper manufacture of toxoid.
Toxoid in the preparation reverted to toxin, with disastrous effects. Toxoid manufacturers instituted safeguards after this event to prevent similar incidents. No similar cases have since been reported.

Measles virus vaccine Side Effects
Medically reviewed by Drugs.com. Last updated on Dec 3, 2021.
Applies to measles virus vaccine: subcutaneous powder for injection
Local
Local side effects have included injection site burning/stinging, wheal and flare, erythema, swelling, and vesiculation.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity reactions have included anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, angioneurotic edema (including peripheral or facial edema ), and bronchial spasm.[Ref]
Cardiovascular
Cardiovascular side effects have included vasculitis.[Ref]
Dermatologic
Dermatologic side effects have included Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, urticaria, and rash.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea.[Ref]
Hematologic
Hematologic side effects have included thrombocytopenia, purpura, regional lymphadenopathy, and leukocytosis.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal
Musculoskeletal side effects have included arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), polyneuritis, myalgia, paresthesia, and rarely chronic arthritis; these symptoms may also occur with natural rubella.[Ref]
Nervous system
Nervous system side effects have included measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), encephalopathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), febrile convulsions, afebrile convulsions or seizures, ataxia, and ocular palsies.[Ref]
Significant central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis and encephalopathy have been very rarely temporally associated with measles vaccine (occurring within 30 days after vaccination); however, causality has not been determined in any case.  A certain number of  encephalitis cases unrelated to vaccines is expected to occur in a large childhood population; however, there is the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccine.  The risk of measles vaccine-associated serious neurological disorders is much smaller than the risk for encephalitis and encephalopathy due to natural measles.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) has been very rarely reported in children after measles vaccination.  Some of these cases may have been due to unrecognized measles during the first year of life or possibly due to the measles vaccination.  The results of a retrospective case-controlled study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that measles vaccine has had the overall effect of protecting against SSPE by preventing measles with its greater risk of SSPE.[Ref]
Ocular
Ocular side effects have included retinitis, optic neuritis, papillitis, retrobulbar neuritis, and conjunctivitis.[Ref]
Other
Otic side effects have included nerve deafness and otitis media.[Ref]
Respiratory
Respiratory side effects have included pneumonitis, cough, and rhinitis.[Ref]
Other
A postmarketing surveillance study of measles/mumps/rubella vaccine in Finland during 1982 to 1993 with 1.5 million pediatric and adult vaccinees reported no deaths or permanent sequelae.[Ref]
Other side effects have included panniculitis, atypical measles, fever, syncope, headache, dizziness, malaise, and irritability.  Fatalities have been reported with the polyvalent measles/mumps/rubella vaccine; however, causality has not been determined.
Health care providers should report any allergic or unusual adverse reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at 1-800-822-7967 (USA) and the manufacturer.[Ref]

So, from these articles, it's clear that vaccines can cause side effects, ranging from mild to serious. The most common ones are things like soreness at the injection site, fever, headache, and fatigue. These are usually short-lived and not a big deal. But there are also some rare, more serious side effects like Guillain-Barré syndrome or blood clots. It's important to weigh these risks against the benefits of vaccination, which are significant in preventing serious diseases.

Now, going back to why people might not want to get vaccinated. One reason could be fear of these side effects, especially the serious ones, even if they're rare. People might hear about someone who had a bad reaction and decide that's too big a risk for them.

Another factor is distrust in medicine or government. Some people might not trust that the vaccines are safe or effective, perhaps because of past experiences or because they don't trust the institutions involved in creating and promoting vaccines.

Religious or philosophical beliefs also play a role. Some religions prohibit certain medical interventions, and some people have personal beliefs about natural immunity or the body's ability to heal itself without vaccines.

Misinformation and myths are a big problem too. For example, the now-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism has persisted for years and continues to influence people's decisions.

Additionally, some people might not see the need for vaccination if they've never experienced the diseases vaccines prevent. This is especially true in areas where vaccination has led to the elimination of certain diseases, so people forget how severe they can be.

Lastly, convenience and access can be barriers. Not everyone has easy access to vaccination sites, or they might not have the time off work to get vaccinated.

I think understanding these reasons is crucial for addressing vaccine hesitancy. It's not just about educating people about how vaccines work; it's also about building trust, addressing specific concerns, and making vaccination accessible and convenient.

Maybe I should look into some strategies that have been effective in encouraging vaccination.

Abstract
Purpose of review: To summarize evidence-based strategies for improving pediatric immunization rates including physician behaviors, clinic and public health processes, community-based and parent-focused interventions, and legal and policy approaches RECENT FINDINGS: Studies continue to show the effectiveness of audit and feedback, provider reminders, standing orders, and reminder/recall to increase immunization rates. Provider communication strategies may improve immunization rates including use of a presumptive approach and motivational interviewing. Centralized reminder/recall (using a state Immunization Information System) is more effective and cost-effective compared to a practice-based approach. Recent work shows the success of text messages for reminder/recall for vaccination. Web-based interventions, including informational vaccine websites with interactive social media components, have shown effectiveness at increasing uptake of pediatric and maternal immunizations. Vaccination requirements for school attendance continue to be effective policy interventions for increasing pediatric and adolescent vaccination rates. Allowance for and ease of obtaining exemptions to vaccine requirements are associated with increased exemption rates.
Summary: Strategies to increase vaccination rates include interventions that directly impact physician behavior, clinic and public health processes, patient behaviors, and policy. Combining multiple strategies to work across different settings and addressing different barriers may offer the best approach to optimize immunization coverage.

Key Takeaways
A study suggests five key strategies for a way to move COVID-19 vaccine promotion forward, including making vaccines free and using public endorsements from government leaders.
Despite the national urgency to disseminate the COVID-19 vaccine at lightning speeds, experts say that a vaccine strategy should be rolled out without compromising accuracy and equity.
While efforts to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine at lightning speeds are underway, convincing the majority of the U.S. population to get vaccinated poses a new challenge. A Pew Research Center study finds that 49% of people said they would not be willing or are unlikely to get vaccinated, highlighting the need for a large scale vaccine promotion strategy across the country. 1
“We’ve never had a vaccine roll-out quite like this one," Alison Buttenheim, PhD, MBA, Silverstein chair in global women’s health at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Nursing, tells Verywell. "The vaccine is a vital tool in the route back to “normal.""
CDC Panel Recommends Who Should Get the COVID-19 Vaccine Next
According to Buttenheim, a national vaccine strategy is needed to not only coordinate vaccine distribution logistics, but also look at allocation, promotion, and delivery. A December study, published in JAMA and co-authored by Buttenheim and her colleagues proposes five strategies for a national COVID-19 vaccine promotion program. 2 ﻿﻿
What This Means For You
You can take part in promoting the COVID-19 vaccine. If you get vaccinated, you can share your experience publicly with friends and family or on social media. Being honest about any symptoms and your experience can help increase confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine.
Five Steps To Promoting the Vaccine
In order to increase confidence in the new COVID-19 vaccines, and encourage the public to get vaccinated when their turn comes, the study authors propose a promotion strategy. Their five suggestions range everywhere from instituting popular voting strategies like 'I voted' stickers to making the vaccine free and accessible to all.
Make Vaccines Free and Accessible
Research shows if the process of getting a vaccination is hassle-free, more people will seek out the vaccine. 3 For example, decreasing wait times, making service locations convenient, and making the paperwork easier to fill out can help reduce the friction and difficulty people might encounter when signing up to get vaccinated. In addition, ensuring that the vaccine is accessible at a variety of places including healthcare centers, pharmacies, and doctor’s offices will reduce time and other barriers.
Where Will I Be Able to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine?
“It has to be clear to the public when they are eligible to receive a vaccine, how to make an appointment, and where to go," Buttenheim adds. "It has to be zero cost at the point of care for individuals—no co-pays, administration fees."
Make Entry Contingent on Vaccination
Restaurants and malls have made face coverings mandatory to protect employees and customers. Similarly, making access to these settings could be conditional based on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Although vaccine mandates will be hard to come by, a conditional requirement would serve as a non-monetary incentive.
Will COVID-19 Vaccines Be Required In Schools?
"People want access to certain places like stores, Disney World, or schools and only allowing people in if they have been vaccinated will incentivize people to get vaccinated,” Kevin Volpp, MD, PhD, director of Penn Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics (CHIBE), tells Verywell.
Suggested settings for conditional access includes hospitals, living facilities, and retail spaces. More discussion about whether institutions would allow this will likely unfold in the coming months.
Public Endorsements
From Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s vaccine Instagram Live to President-elect Joe Biden’s vaccine shot on national television, Buttenheim and Volpp want to underscore the importance of governmental leaders endorsing the vaccine.
“We’ve already seen the Instagram posts and tweets from elected officials and front-line healthcare workers getting vaccinated," Buttenheim says. "This can increase buy-in and confidence in the public."
Pfizer Vaccine Trial Participant Shares Experience
There are two potential caveats to this approach that Buttenheim says to be careful of. First, Buttenheim cautions celebrities and governmental leaders from making it seem like they’re receiving special treatment or jumping the line. Second, skeptics are likely to dismiss these public vaccination displays as stunts. Therefore, “leaders and celebrities can boost the effectiveness of these posts by following them up with updates on any reactions they are having to the vaccine and how those wane over time,” Buttenheim says.
Use a Waitlist
According to Volpp, people place value on things they perceive to be scarce. Marketing research supports this point. 4 ﻿﻿ One way to motivate people to get vaccinated is by creating a waiting list. It becomes “a way to have people feel invested in getting vaccinated and then creates an ‘endowment effect’ whereby people won’t want to lose their place in line,” Volpp says.
How Will the COVID-19 Vaccine Be Distributed?
Make It a Public Act
Similar to approaches used for voting promotion such as the “I voted” stickers and social media testimonials, Buttenheim sees value in forms of public engagement. Healthcare workers and members of Congress have taken their “I got the shot” stickers to Instagram and Twitter. “Just think about how much people love to get their “I voted” stickers at the polls—the “I got the shot” stickers should generate the same excitement as people signal their excitement about the vaccine to their social networks,” Buttenheim adds.
Making the Vaccine Strategy Equitable
Experts recognize that the public has raised valid concerns about vaccinations and their ties to medical mistrust in communities of color. While the aforementioned vaccination strategies are well-intentioned, Buttenheim calls for these efforts to begin with humility and to dignify the concerns that are being voiced about the vaccine development process, allocation, and roll-out.
How Public Health Officials Can Increase Confidence in the COVID-19 Vaccine
“The 'nudge' strategies I mentioned above work well to help people already motivated to get the vaccine to follow through on that motivation," Buttenheim says. "That’s a very different task from the much harder work for rebuilding trust and meeting people where they are. The impact of prior medical exploitation and unconsented experimentation cannot be overstated.”

Abstract
In 2021, many countries have begun distribution of COVID-19 vaccines but are hampered by significant levels of vaccine hesitancy or apathy. Experts recommend that standard health communication campaigns be expanded to include a more holistic approach of behaviourally oriented strategies. We constructed a large-scale Delphi panel of marketing and behavioural science university faculty to assess 12 previously reported US vaccination promotion strategies, asking respondents to assess applicability of the strategy in their country, how efficacy might compare to the USA and recommendations for local adaptations necessary to successful implementation. Separately, we sought to determine whether strategies based on cognitive mechanisms (eg, ‘nudges’) are more readily generalisable than strategies based on social identity. Ninety-two marketing and behavioural science faculty from universities worldwide participated. Globally, all 12 behavioural strategies were validated; a majority of respondents reported that they would or could work well in their country. While all strategies were strongly validated at a global level, specific need for regional adaptation was identified. Also, open-ended responses suggested the addition of three emergent strategies to a global effort. Finally, we see that strategies based on some types of cognitive mechanisms are more readily generalisable across regions than mechanisms based on social identity, however, this is not always true of ‘nudge’ strategies. All 12 strategies are robust to global use and consensus exists on adaptation for optimal efficacy in different regions; specific strategy recommendations are posited. Use of these strategies can accelerate individual country efforts to achieve desired vaccination rates to protect global public health.

Summary box
Vaccine hesitancy continues to undermine the necessary vaccine uptake to herd immunity levels worldwide.
Twelve behaviourally oriented strategies, adapted from marketplace theories commonly used to spur innovation adoption, have been recommended to augment standard US vaccination promotion campaigns.
Because these strategies were developed for the USA and because they reflected different types of behavioural approaches (eg, social affiliation tactics, implicit ‘nudges’), it was not recommended that they be used for global vaccination promotion without validation.
We undertook to validate all 12 strategies for use in the 7 major world regions (as categorised by the World Bank) using a large-scale Delphi method with expert marketing and behavioural science faculty from each world region.
Experts independently assessed (1) whether the strategies could be applied in their region, (2) how efficacy would likely compare to the USA and (3) how strategies should be adapted for cultural context. Analysis yielded strong validation and a pattern of necessary adaptations.
Experts agree that use of these practices can confidently accelerate worldwide efforts to achieve desired vaccination rates.
All 12 behavioural strategies are recommended for use, but vary in the need for region-based adaptation to fit local contexts.
The use of behaviourally oriented persuasion techniques, that go beyond standard health communication practices, will also benefit future healthcare initiatives and campaigns.
The rapid development of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been a staggering global achievement. Yet, while the scientific community focused on the clinical research, manufacture and distribution of vaccines, there was not a similar effort developing strategies to globally promote vaccine uptake. Unfortunately, merely sharing scientific data about vaccine efficacy and safety does not comprise a marketing strategy. To address this gap, we developed 12 promotion strategies—based on robust marketing and behavioural science theories—to augment standard US health communication practices. 1 Because any single behavioural change approach is insufficient for reaching diverse communities and contexts, the strategies ranged across a behavioural spectrum, from small ‘nudges’ to large social identity motivations. When adapted and implemented, these strategies can constitute a multifaceted vaccine-promotion campaign. 2 3
This research, and subsequent recommendations, focused on one country, the USA. As global firms know, to move successfully from one country to another, marketing strategies must carefully consider local cultures, contexts and constraints. All strategies may not be equally generalisable to new places. Thus, in this healthcare context, it is critical to validate and potentially adapt strategies for COVID-19 vaccination promotion campaigns from one global region to the next.
Fortunately, a wealth of worldwide expertise exists for consultation on the global validation and adaptation of these strategies—academic faculty who study consumer behaviour in universities around the world. To accelerate the translation of this vaccine promotion framework to seven world regions, we engaged in an unprecedented large-scale global validation effort using a diverse academic Delphi panel of consumer behaviour experts.
Expanding the toolbox for global COVID-19 vaccination campaigns
Given the urgency and size of the national COVID-19 vaccination initiative, 12 novel behavioural strategies were developed for use within, or in addition to, traditional US health communications (for descriptions of the 12 strategies, see table 1; for more detail about strategy methodologies and examples please see the original source. 1 These strategies were developed using consumer behaviour and behavioural economics research, and were based, as identified by the academic literature, on either cognitive mechanisms or social mechanisms. Strategies with cognitive mechanisms rely primarily on underlying mental functions. Strategies with social mechanisms rely primarily on interpersonal effects.

Methodology
For the Delphi panel, we recruited global university faculty, with doctoral degrees in marketing or behavioural science, to participate via emailed surveys (open 16 February 2021–11 March 2021). Delphi methods harness the power of expert groups to assess unknown entities like innovations or trends. 4 5 Descriptions of this Delphi panel, from seven global regions (Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle-East and North Africa, Europe and Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Pacific, and North America), are shown in figure 1. While heterogeneity exists within global regions, and even within countries or communities, this analysis of seven regions provides a practical and foundational effort to outline global strategy validation and adaptation. We used snow-balling recruitment, sending an initial recruitment email to 250 professors who serve on the Editorial Review Board for a premier international consumer research journal. This email asked recipients to respond to an anonymous survey (hosted on the Qualtrics online survey platform) and to forward the request to marketing professors they knew at universities in the seven world regions named. We received 189 responses from the initial email invitation of 250 professors (75.6%). Of the 189 responses, 103 completed the extensive 84-question survey (54.5%). The survey asked respondents to self-identify by academic degree (ie, Ph.D. vs other) and area (marketing/behavioural science or other). Marketing is an interdisciplinary academic field with roots in psychology and sociology and, thus, universities describe the field with different designations; ‘marketing’ is by far the most common term but some use ‘behavioural economics’ or ‘behavioural science.’ We filtered out respondents who were not a professor of marketing or behavioural science or not fully credentialed faculty (eg, doctoral students or marketing practitioners); this resulted in a final panel of 92 faculty. Typical Delphi panels consist of 10–20 experts; the panel here represents an extraordinary global effort. We implemented only one round of assessments from the full panel (given high levels of regional consensus), and sent a second round of inquiry into specific exemplars to a subset of the panel. The questions submitted to the panel can be seen in box 1.

Validation results of behavioural strategies by global region
The results of the Delphi panel are described below; added details can be seen in the accompanying tables as noted. The global validation results (table 1) show that all strategies are validated (in this paper, we consider a strategy to be validated when a majority of experts agreed the strategy would or could be effective in their country), but that the need for regional adaptation varied greatly. Experts also predicted variance in efficacy, due in part to potential cultural differences; for example, increased efficacy of observability and decreased efficacy of uniqueness neglect between regions could be a function of differences in characteristics anthropologists define as individualism/collectivism. 6
To understand why some strategies are more easily applicable to cross-national use, we categorised the original 12 into three categories based on mechanism: cognitive mechanisms to increase perceived net benefits, cognitive mechanisms to leverage implicit ‘nudges,’ and social mechanisms to increased perceived affiliation or affect (see table 2 ). Taken together, the data suggest that mechanism matters. Strategies that use cognitive mechanisms to promote net benefits are highly transferable and need only superficial adaptation. Strategies that use social mechanisms to promote affiliation and emotional appeal are highly transferable, but need careful adaptation to local culture. Finally, and importantly, strategies that use cognitive mechanism to prompt implicit nudges are not as easily transferable and also need significant adaptation regionally; thus, health organisations must be careful with how ‘nudges’ are used across global contexts.

Strategy adaptations by global region
The open-ended responses provided by the Delphi panel described many concrete suggestions and examples for adapted use of the 12 strategies globally (validation percentages are reported by global region and summarised in table 2; examples of how the panellists agree these might be applied for selected countries—especially for high variance strategies—are shown for illustrative purposes (table 3 ). Finally, we outline a phased framework by healthcare role to deploy applicable strategies and combinations of strategies into local environments (figure 2 ).

Coordinating a locally adapted COVID-19 communication strategy across different roles.
Segment by identity barriers (panel validation: 83.3%)
Our identity, especially as a member of a group, often impacts our health behaviours. Thus, this strategy works to target behavioural ‘segments’ (or subpopulations) by personal or group identity—both to address the hurdles faced by that group and to frame vaccine adoption as a congruent component of that identity. Panellists see this as widely applicable, adapting the characteristic by which populations are segmented. While North American panellists see North America as often, and perhaps effectively, segmented by political identity, panellists in other global regions view politics to be a risky characteristic to target. Identity is clearly multifaceted and other facets of identity may be more effective. Panellists recommended that the best facets for each region are: affiliative groups based on sports, entertainment and social activities (Europe and Central Asia; sub-Saharan Africa), urban versus rural residence and age groups (Middle East and North Africa), professions (East Asia and the Pacific), religion and attitudes toward modern medicine (Latin America), and the intersection of affluence and perceived health (South Asia).
Identify a common enemy (panel validation: 82.4%)
This strategy works to unite polarised groups by focusing on a third, more hated common enemy, such as battling the economic impact of the pandemic. 7 Panellists saw this strategy as effective in most regions. However, there were important suggestions for local adaptations. While common enemies can be used to unite a highly polarised area, for more homogeneous or collective communities, it is beneficial to reframe this strategy as a common goal. If a common enemy i s used in collective communities, the enemy should be clearly related to something outside of individual control. The virus can be anthropomorphised to create an embodied (though ultimately defeatable) enemy. Some areas, preferring a common goal approach, can create an anthropomorphised goal-oriented mascot such as Brazil’s readapted Zé Gotinha (Droplet Joe) mascot, originally created to promote polio vaccination campaigns in the 1980s and 1990s as a way to make events more attractive to children. 8
Several panellists identified pandemic fatigue as an evocative common enemy. Panellists (sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia) described the danger of health apathy in general, or for COVID-19 specifically. Recent research demonstrates that communications aimed at vaccine hesitancy will not be effective for vaccine apathy. 9 In such cases, because apathy can breed fatalism about health, (decreasing the likelihood of vaccination), it is important not to identity people as apathetic, but rather set a campaign around a common goal to fight the concept of apathy (‘pandemic fatigue’) and help all citizens take good care of themselves.
Use analogy (panel validation 94.2%)
Analogies harness understanding of a familiar concept to elucidate a complex new concept. 10 The Delphi panel saw this as highly applicable and effective globally; it is one of the most highly rated strategies for worldwide use. Minimal adaptation is necessary; panellists recommend checking that analogies are relevant and sensitive to different cultures. Many regions benefit from the use of emotion-based analogies (eg, the vaccination protects you like a mother’s loving arms), based on local proverbs, or tied to local mythologies (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific). The panel suggest caution, however, in that any populations highly involved in vaccine decisions may experience overly simplistic analogies as authorities unnecessarily ‘dumbing down’ information.
Increase observability (panel validation: 87.2%)
Innovation observability suggests that consumers’ ability to physically see others’ choices can increase an innovation’s rate of adoption. 11 The Delphi panel reported this strategy as effective in most regions, but with an important adaptation to shift the framing from the individual focus to the community. Making vaccinated individuals observable may be non-normative in collective communities, may cause unwarranted attention where vaccination is viewed with suspicion, or where it might trigger perceptions of status/corruption.
Here, the preference would be to make community numbers more visible. For example, a billboard with an electronic counter can both thank community members who have been vaccinated while updating the number of vaccinated daily. This increases communal ‘perceived’ popularity or a sense of momentum. 12 Two simple ways to do this in communications are to highlight turnout for mass vaccination events as successes, and to use plural amplifications (eg, ‘people say…’).
Leverage natural scarcity (panel validation: 83.5%)
In consumer markets, scarcity often signals exclusivity and prompts greater interest or desirability. 13 Again, this strategy was seen by the panel to be effective in most regions. Suggested adaptations are to focus communications about scarcity on the precious nature of the vaccine and the care taken of its handling and distribution. Importantly, scarcity can also trigger negative thoughts, particularly where communities have memory of other times of scarcity. For example, triggers to be avoided are inflation/poverty (Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia), status (Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and Pacific) and inequity (Europe and Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, North America). This strategy can prompt different patterns of vaccine distribution. For example, in Mali, it may be best to offer scarce vaccines first to the highest status members of a community because associating vaccinations with power emphasises their value. In Uganda, it may be best to offer scarce vaccines equitably to citizens and immigrants alike, where associating the shots with strict fairness emphasises their value.
Predict and address negative attributions (panel validation: 92.9%)
‘Attribution theory,’ from social psychology, describes how people confronted with something unexpected or troublesome develop explanations for it. 14 This strategy recommends proactively finding and countering false negative attributions that people make about the vaccine. Panellists see it as highly applicable and effective globally. Negative attributions are so widespread that collective action and local adaptation were suggested by panellists.
The first step in adaptation of this strategy is determining the channel of misinformation most damaging in the community. The Delphi panel consistently named social media as dangerous due to its speed. Thus, at national levels, health leaders must determine how to monitor social media for misinformation and develop means to stop its spread. In some regions, social media regulation is seen as a critical tool (Europe and Central Asia, North America). In other regions, social media counter-campaigning was seen as more practical and effective. Other suggestions include partnering with social media influencers to both report misinformation they receive and to encourage them to post true information. To determine if a rumour is worth countering, Online scraping tools, like Google Trends’ Interest Score, can determine if a rumour is growing or declining in interest.
Panellists noted that the foundational challenge in implementing this strategy is the need to build trust. Widespread lack of trust in institutions and information is sadly ubiquitous, as was experienced in East Africa with Ebola. 15 Trust is a prerequisite for any strategy to be effective, but is clearly critical in addressing misinformation. One common suggestion is to find, educate, empower and incentivise trusted local community-influencers since trust in health agents can differ regionally; this mirrors excellent existing work on building trust through a community-oriented approach (eg, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/08/important-tool-in-healthcare-is-trust-vaccines-africa/ ). Additionally, trust can be established by: (1) noting common ground, (2) providing credentials or authority, (3) affiliative mimicry and (4) consistency. 12
Prompt anticipated regret (panel validation: 84.9%)
Imagining the practical and emotional consequences of a bad thing that may happen (anticipated regret) prompts people to take action to prevent that thing, even if it is very rare. Emotions, such as regret, are such powerful motivators of decisions that they can motivate us even before they are experienced. 16 However, panellists expressed less support for this strategy, recommending it only be used where the vaccine is widely available or when the patient can get vaccinated at that moment so that guilt and fear may be avoided. Also, they note that in more communal regions, focusing on the possible illness of a loved one (not oneself) will be more effective. Finally, some subpopulations may feel that such a question is too emotionally manipulative (Europe and Central Asia) and, in such instances, this strategy is not recommended.
Beware the danger of piecemeal risk information (panel validation: 84.7%)
This strategy notes that the ‘trickling out’ or piecemeal delivery of vaccine-related information may increase the perceived risk of taking the vaccine. This is not something that can be changed, but is a danger that should be understood by everyone involved in vaccine communication efforts. For patients, changing risk information is frequently perceived as increasing the frequency of side effects. 17 The massive regulatory response across Europe to several reports of rare thrombotic side effects with the Astra-Zeneca vaccine is an example of this phenomena. 18
Here, health advocates can emphasise how the new information is a positive sign and indicates that scientists/doctors are not just resting on their laurels after developing the vaccine. The Delphi panel largely acknowledged that the effect of piecemeal risk information can impact most regions, but saw different potential to address this issue, especially when clinical data are coming from outside the region. Overall, this was seen as the least easily applicable strategy of the 12.
Promote compromise options (panel validation: 74.7%)
In the US consumer marketplace, three choices are often offered to consumers (eg, small, medium and large drink sizes, ‘gold, silver or bronze’ level services); when consumers are uncertain, choosing the middle option feels most reasonable or logical. This strategy was largely validated by the panel, but there was additional concern about local adaptation of this strategy. For many regions, the ‘illusion’ of choice does not exist; people may be required to be vaccinated. Similarly, even if they can choose, the idea of having an array of options may feel false or suspicious in communities where this is not often the case. Finally, in some cultures, choosing a middle option may be attractive because it is seen as polite, but in others it can be a very negative signal of ambivalence or weakness. While this strategy is often extremely effective in the behavioural sciences literature, it is more challenging to apply globally and should only to be used in limited situations for COVID-19 communication according to the panel.
Create fear of missing out motivations (panel validation: 85.2%)
Fear of missing out (FOMO) refers to the fear people have of missing out on something others are doing. In this strategy, vaccination is linked to some other positive attribute such as a day-off from work, a direct payment or gift, or some other reward that will be ‘missed’ if the person does not get vaccinated. The panellists also agree the FOMO concept can explain the efficacy of vaccination conferring preferential access, such as vaccine-passports for travel or special benefits for the vaccinated in workplaces or schools. The Delphi panel saw strong applicability of this strategy globally, but did caution that in areas with rampant economic, health or security crises, the ‘fear’ should be taken out of FOMO so that a positive tone is employed. The panel further expressed that it is critical that promises be fulfilled if this strategy is implemented.
Combat uniqueness neglect (panel validation: 73.8%)
Uniqueness neglect is an individual patient’s dislike of being treated as the average case or with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment recommendation. To counter uniqueness neglect, healthcare advocates can provide special accommodations for some vaccines (eg, the vaccine has been blessed or is certified to be halal, or to have had a religiously permissible technology development pathway), 19 or can provide special accommodations to some patients (eg, provide longer postshot observation times for patients with allergies). While the overall strategy was validated by the panel, it felt to be not as locally applicable as the other strategies. Some regions may be more attracted by the sameness of the treatment and be suspicious of inconsistencies (South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa).
Neutralise the case versus base-rate heuristic (panel validation: 96.5%)
Healthcare often emphasises communication using facts and statistics, and yet robust data show that people often underweight base-rate statistics and overweight anecdotal cases—stories—in judging probability, a decision heuristic known as the base-rate fallacy or case versus base-rate effect. 20 To neutralise this perception bias, healthcare advocates should use more stories in both their educational and persuasive communications. This approach can be especially powerful in countering negative stories which are shared on social media.
The Delphi panel strongly validated this strategy and emphasised its efficacy. They reported that across cultures, people communicate using stories which are memorable, emotionally evocative and compelling. Some respondents noted the importance of following up stories with statistics, especially in regions where people may be more numerate. Another overarching recommendation was that healthcare workers should learn to use narrative stories before reporting scientific findings. Finally, in all regions, many positive vaccine stories should be shared in order to overcome the fewer but more attention-grabbing negative vaccine side effect stories.
Additional emergent strategies available for global use
This research also uncovered several strategies suggested by the Delphi panel that had not been previously identified for US use; some may be better suited to different global regions.
Behaviour coupling
One emergent strategy is the need to use ‘coupling’ strategies that encourage people to achieve multiple prohealth behaviours. Because of global attention and financial support for COVID-19 efforts, existing efforts to provide vaccinations for measles, malaria and polio have been overshadowed. Other non-COVID health efforts, which have a disproportionate benefit for children, may be compromised or curtailed. One solution is to couple or link together multiple health behaviours (COVID-19 vaccination plus other treatments/protections, especially those that occur regularly like annual check-ups, influenza vaccines or cancer screenings), thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving both rather than by raising the likelihood of one at the expense of the other. It is important to note that more ‘all-encompassing’ messaging around COVID-19 and other health threats should only be done in areas where it is necessary. Panellists noted it is challenging but important to coordinate across multiple health agencies and/or multiple vertical donors in implementing a strategy where multiple well-being behaviours (both vaccinations and other kinds of unmet needs) are addressed in one effort. 15
Focus on recent ‘wins’
Another emergent strategy is to focus on past wins, even small ones. Around the world, individual countries or regions emerged in 2020 as leaders in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. For example, Uruguay was noted for their rapid, scientifically grounded response to COVID-19. 21 Similarly, Chile has experienced great momentum around vaccination from successful political negotiations to buy large supplies of vaccine from Sinovac, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. 22 Even when ‘success’ is relative to other more catastrophically hit areas, a basis of pride can prompt new efforts in an effort to avoid losing that pride. This strategy is powerful because it is positive and encouraging, but also subtly prompts loss aversion. Loss aversion describes the asymmetric attention to and motivation for avoiding losses compared with achieving gains; where countries already have a point of pride in their COVID-19 response, it will be especially motivating to make sure that this pride is not lost.
Vaccine as ritual artifact
Ritual artifacts are products that are symbolic or important to cultural rituals, such as traditional wedding garments. When ritual traditions are important to group identity, vaccination offers a unique opportunity to build from what is most cherished in that tradition. Thus, vaccination can be a chance to reflect those values at a highly symbolic moment in time. This can be done by timing (eg, the Navaho Nation decided to first vaccinate their members who can fluently speak Navaho—the famed ‘Code Talkers’ —irrespective of age), or by ceremony (eg, first vaccinating leaders in ceremonial dress at a community event). 23 As is true with many ritualised behaviours, the meaning stems from or is greatly enhanced by the symbolic narratives promoted by community leaders such as religious elders or matriarchs/patriarchs; the ritual meaning of vaccines must evolve naturally but can be shared to inspire other communities.
Putting it into practice
The global healthcare community is facing the challenge of developing diverse communication strategies for COVID-19 vaccination efforts across many populations and cultures. 24–26 By providing a validated global framework for communication efforts, we can better develop promotional campaigns that ‘travel’ across regions, and know which efforts require local adaptations before being implemented. Importantly, strategies which are based on explicit cognitive mechanisms (those that aid learning or the perception of net benefits) are judged inherently more generalisable, while strategies which rely on cognitive ‘nudges’ or underlying social mechanisms require more careful adaptation.
The tables contain additional material that can be disseminated to communication stakeholders; table 1 defines the strategies and their characteristics; table 2 describes the necessary adaptations by global region; Table highlights strategies with high levels of variance and offers examples of how this changes the strategy execution. Finally, in figure 2, we organise the strategies best suited to different stakeholder roles and necessary to construct a multifaceted vaccination promotion campaign.
It is important to note that while these COVID-19 strategies originate from a set of behavioural theories originally developed for US use, the marketing literature they are based on is international, though skewed towards North American and European sources. In light of a growing desire to remove the consequences of colonialisation from public health research, we note it would have been equally appropriate to first develop theories from the extant marketing literature for any region and to subsequently adapt them for US use. Additionally, while our Delphi panel included experts from all the regions we studied, we were able to recruit fewer experts from some regions. Finally, even at a regional level, it is important to note that some recommendations may still be overgeneralised for particularly heterogeneous populations. Unfortunately, the examples described here cannot speak to every country or community in detail and require local expertise to aid in adaptation.
Finally, it is critical to note that successful campaigns will use a combination of many strategies in the effort to reach the heterogeneity of vaccine attitudes even within the same community, such as those who are vaccine hesitant versus those that are vaccine apathetic. Ultimately, whether carefully coordinated or more organically evolved, the 12 globally validated strategies here can accelerate local country efforts to confidently develop vaccine promotion at a time when both speed and care are critical.

12 COVID-19 Vaccination Strategies for Your Community
A Guide to Support the Work of Health Departments and Community Organizations Across the United States
Many see COVID-19 vaccination as the key to a post-pandemic life, yet millions in the United States have not been vaccinated despite eligibility and plentiful supply.
On this page, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights 12 strategies derived from evidence-based practices that are being applied in communities across the country to promote vaccine confidence and uptake.
Vaccine confidence is the belief that vaccines work, are safe, and are part of a trustworthy medical system. Without some level of confidence, people will not move toward receiving a vaccine for themselves or their children.
Vaccine uptake refers to the proportion of the population that has received a vaccine.

Field Guide users can submit feedback and strategy examples to confidenceconsults@cdc.gov.
The COVID-19 Vaccination Field Guide outlines selected strategies to help increase vaccine confidence and uptake. These strategies were drawn from historical (non-COVID-19) vaccination efforts and supported by positive outcomes from evaluation research.
The Field Guide also includes examples from communities currently using these strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake. Each strategy addresses common barriers to getting a COVID-19 vaccine, which are structural, behavioral, or informational. Refer to the complete Field Guide [48 pages] for a list of barriers and their meanings.
When implementing any of these strategies in your community, consider real-world factors by assessing the cost (dollars, time, effort, staffing), involving community leaders in planning and execution, and piloting the effort to measure success before wider execution.
12 Strategies to Help Increase COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence and Demand
State and local health departments, community- and faith-based organizations, and local non-profits are encouraged to try a combination of the following:
1. Vaccine Ambassadors
2. Medical Provider Vaccine Standardization
3. Medical Reminders
4. Motivational Interviewing
5. Financial Incentives
6. School-Located Vaccination Programs
7. Home-Delivered Vaccination
8. Workplace Vaccination
9. Vaccination Requirements

The PANDEMIC Framework for Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccinations
The PANDEMIC Framework for Encouraging COVID-19 Vaccinations

The American Journal of Managed Care,May 2021, Volume 27, Issue 5
This commentary offers 8 promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC to address COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy.
ABSTRACT
After sufficient doses are manufactured and logistical barriers are reduced, convincing an overwhelming majority of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccination may be the next major challenge during this pandemic. A group of experts recently proposed strategies that have compelling rationales and are well grounded in behavioral science. However, their approaches may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy. The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians’ own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each of the strategies is discussed in turn. Many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains. However, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets.

Takeaway Points
This commentary offers 8 promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC to address COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy.
Approaches for encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations that have recently been proposed by some experts may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful. Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy.
The present commentary offers the following 8 strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians’ own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk.
These strategies should be carefully evaluated, particularly among individuals who are unsure about receiving vaccinations.
_____
After sufficient doses are manufactured and logistical barriers are reduced, convincing an overwhelming majority of people to receive a COVID-19 vaccination may be the next major challenge during this pandemic. According to a December 2020 national survey, just 56% of Americans were likely to get a COVID-19 vaccination once available to the general public. 1 Black individuals and people with lower educational backgrounds had even lower intentions to become vaccinated. 1
Volpp, Loewenstein, and Buttenheim recently proposed 5 strategies for a national COVID-19 vaccine promotion program. 2 Their strategies have compelling rationales and are well grounded in behavioral science. However, their approaches may sometimes be unacceptable, impractical, and/or unsuccessful (see the Table 2-4 ).
Therefore, other strategies will be greatly needed to address vaccine hesitancy. The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians’ own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each strategy is discussed in turn.
Presumptive Language
This style of communication has been successfully used by primary care clinicians regarding past vaccinations. Training practitioners to use presumptive announcements (eg, “There are some shots we need to do today”), as opposed to more neutral messages (eg, “What do you want to do about shots today?”), increased human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates for younger adolescents. 5 Of course, parents encountering the former communication style could still decline the HPV vaccination for their children. Nevertheless, a similar statement implying that a COVID-19 vaccination is standard clinical practice may enhance the credibility of these shots.
Asking for Advice
Liu and Gal found that a business might increase future transactions after informing potential customers, “We are interested in what advice you might have for our organization.” 6 In contrast, these researchers concluded that asking solely for opinions or expectations did not produce the same effect. Although the mechanism for this finding is not fully understood, the research team speculated that asking for advice engenders feelings of greater perceived closeness.
This strategy could be adapted for COVID-19 vaccinations by having organizations (eg, local agencies, places of worship) ask for advice regarding ways to encourage future vaccination uptake among its local reluctant members. This approach would be consistent with community coalition–driven interventions, which have some evidence for reducing disparities in other health domains. 7 This approach would also be compatible with motivational interviewing, a nonconfrontational communication style in which patients are asked about their own ideas regarding how healthy changes can be facilitated. Some experts have suggested that motivational interviewing is particularly beneficial for minority populations. 8
Norms on an Anonymous Level
Volpp et al proposed that individuals publicize their COVID-19 vaccinations.2 Highlighting the worthwhile activities (eg, better food choices, energy conservation) of peers has increased desired behavior by target individuals. 9-11 The greater the similarity between the peers and the target person, the more likely that the social norms led to the desired outcomes in those studies. Social influences can demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of the desired action to ambivalent individuals.
However, in those aforementioned empirical studies, social norms were presented in a deidentified fashion. There would be multiple ways to convey comparable information regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. Describing the sociodemographic heterogeneity of the phase 3 vaccination trial participants (eg, “Thousands of Caucasians and thousands of individuals from racial/ethnic minority groups volunteered for those studies”) may encourage diverse populations to receive vaccinations. Similarly, as members of the general public receive vaccinations under emergency use authorizations, summary statistics about local recipients could further the same objective.
Description of Favorable Attributes
Kreps and colleagues found that people reported being more willing to receive COVID-19 vaccinations if (1) efficacy rates were 90% (as opposed to 50%) and (2) the products were developed by US companies. 12 Therefore, a statement like “These vaccinations, which were developed by Pfizer (from New York) and Moderna (from Massachusetts), reduced cases by 95%” may be persuasive to target individuals.
Emphasizing Clinicians’ Own Experiences
Patients often view their own health care providers as more trustworthy relative to other informational sources (eg, government officials). 13 Clinicians could mention their own healthy choices, including personal receipt of COVID-19 vaccinations, to help convince reluctant patients. 14
Mandated Choice (“active choice”)
Many opportunities reflect “opt-in,” which necessitates neither engagement in a target behavior nor explicit notification of one’s decisions. Similarly, mandated choice—which is more commonly known as active choice—preserves freedom by allowing people to decide if they wish to follow a recommended course of action. However, unlike opt-in, active choice requires people to indicate explicitly an affirmative decision or a negative decision. Active choice may help overcome procrastination and signal the importance of the present opportunity. Relative to opt-in, active choice has been shown to increase intentions for influenza vaccinations. 15
Under an opt-in approach to COVID-19 vaccinations, employers would inform employees about the availability of shots and invite them to a scheduling website. Under an active choice approach, employers would require employees to visit a website within a brief time frame to formally indicate their decision—yes vs no—regarding receiving a vaccination. Organizations could justify active choice for not only maximizing vaccinations but also obtaining prompt, accurate estimates of the demand for these shots.
Active choice could be even more impactful by highlighting the benefits of the target behavior and the drawbacks of the opposite behavior. 15 Enhanced active choice for COVID-19 vaccinations would go beyond presenting people with an “agree” option and a “decline” option. Enhanced active choice could feature 2 more strongly worded options from which each person must select, such as “YES! I agree to receive the COVID-19 vaccination to reduce my chances of getting this disease” and “I do not agree to receive the vaccination. I realize that my decision may increase my chances of getting COVID-19.”
Images
Verbal messages may lack the vividness to capture someone’s attention. Salient images have resulted in positive outcomes ranging from increasing intentions to quit cigarette smoking to discouraging littering. 16,17 Distinctive visual images that are not typically encountered in everyday life may be more effective in facilitating desired behavior vs text-only approaches. 18 Media coverage of long lines of cars containing people seeking COVID-19 vaccinations is one potential image that would convey these shots’ popularity. Subsequently, other strategies (eg, widespread dissemination at local pharmacies and scheduled appointments) could be implemented to convince people about the relative ease of obtaining the high-demand vaccinations.
Communication of Risk
Informing potential recipients of the adverse effect profiles of the vaccinations may engender feelings of trustworthiness. Mentioning small weaknesses may enhance the credibility of the message/messenger and increase uptake of the vaccination. Nevertheless, an undue emphasis on adverse effects may dissuade individuals from vaccination although benefits greatly outweigh harms. Presentation of risk information may influence acceptability of vaccinations. Previous research suggests that presenting the likelihood of adverse effects as percentages (eg, “1% of people experienced a high fever”) rather than frequencies (eg, “1 in 100 people experienced a high fever”) may promote more favorable views of the vaccinations.19 The latter presentation may lead people with less numeracy to more easily envision other patients with adverse effects. In addition, positive framing (eg, “99% of individuals did not experience a high fever” vs negative framing (eg, “1% of individuals had high fever”) might enhance willingness to receive vaccinations. 19
Final Thoughts
Although many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets. The large number of people who are not highly interested in vaccinations, combined with calls to ease informed consent requirements for minimal risk research, 20 would facilitate the empirical evaluation of these approaches.
The strategies proposed in this commentary may not be appropriate for all individuals. At one extreme, these strategies may be unnecessary for people who are extremely motivated to receive vaccinations. At the other extreme, these strategies would likely fail to convince those individuals who are adamantly opposed to these shots. Therefore, these strategies may have the greatest impact for those who are unsure about receiving vaccinations. The phrasing of these strategies should be pilot tested, refined, and tested with these ambivalent individuals. For those skeptics questioning if a single strategy would have a demonstrable impact on vaccination rates, multiple strategies could be combined into an overall communication plan.
In conclusion, persuasive messages that increase COVID-19 vaccination rates by even a few percentage points could help the country move closer toward herd immunity. Considerable resources have been devoted to develop, test, and manufacture biological interventions for this pandemic. Assuming that data continue to indicate that COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and efficacious, optimal behavioral strategies to encourage these shots deserve substantial attention, as well.
