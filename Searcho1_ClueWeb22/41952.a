So I have this question: "How did society shape science and how did science shape society?" It seems like a pretty big topic, right? I mean, society and science have been influencing each other for centuries, so there's probably a lot to cover here. I need to break this down into smaller parts to understand it better.

First, I need to think about what society is. Society refers to the people in a particular area who share government, religion, way of life, and culture. So, it's basically the collective group of people and their ways of living together. Science, on the other hand, is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

Now, the question is asking about the mutual influence between these two. So, I need to look at how society has shaped science and vice versa.

Let me start with how society shapes science.

I think one way society shapes science is through funding. Governments and private organizations decide which areas of research to fund based on societal needs and priorities. For example, during times of war, there might be more funding for military technology and weapons research. In contrast, during peacetime, there might be more investment in healthcare, environmental science, or space exploration.

Another way society influences science is through ethical considerations. As science advances, it often raises ethical questions that society grapples with. For instance, the development of genetic engineering technologies has led to debates about the ethics of genetically modifying humans or animals. Society's values and morals can shape the direction and limits of scientific research in such areas.

Additionally, cultural beliefs and worldviews can impact the acceptance and development of scientific ideas. For example, the theory of evolution was met with resistance in some cultures due to conflicting religious beliefs. This resistance can slow down the advancement of certain scientific fields or lead to alternative theories being pursued.

On the other side, how does science shape society?

Well, scientific discoveries and technological advancements have profoundly impacted various aspects of society. For example, the industrial revolution, driven by scientific innovations, transformed economies and societies from agrarian to industrial. This led to urbanization, changes in social structures, and new economic systems.

Moreover, medical sciences have improved public health and increased life expectancy. Vaccines, antibiotics, and other medical treatments have eradicated or controlled many diseases that once devastated populations.

Science has also influenced education systems. The importance placed on scientific literacy has led to the inclusion of science in school curricula worldwide. This, in turn, has educated generations of citizens and future scientists.

Furthermore, science plays a crucial role in shaping public policy and decision-making. Scientific data and research inform policies on climate change, environmental protection, public health, and more. Scientists often advise governments and institutions on evidence-based approaches to address societal challenges.

I should also consider the impact of science on culture and daily life. Technologies like the internet, smartphones, and social media have revolutionized communication and information access. These advancements have changed how people interact, work, and consume information.

However, it's important to note that the relationship between science and society is complex and multifaceted. There are instances where science has been misused or where societal factors have hindered scientific progress. For example, during the eugenics movement, scientific ideas were misapplied to promote discriminatory policies.

Moreover, there can be a gap between scientific consensus and public perception. Issues like climate change or vaccine hesitancy illustrate situations where scientific evidence is not universally accepted by society, leading to challenges in implementing effective policies.

In conclusion, society shapes science through funding decisions, ethical considerations, and cultural attitudes, while science shapes society by driving technological advancements, improving health, informing public policy, and transforming economies and cultures.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Society shapes science through funding, ethics, and cultural beliefs, while science shapes society via technological advancements, health improvements, and informed policies.}} \]
