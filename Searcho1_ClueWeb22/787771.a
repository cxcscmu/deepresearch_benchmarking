Alright, so I need to figure out what attracts software engineers. This seems like a pretty broad question, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I should probably understand who software engineers are and what they generally look for in their careers or in their work environment.

I know that software engineers are professionals who design, build, and maintain software systems. They can work in various industries, from tech companies to finance, healthcare, and more. So, their attractions might vary based on personal interests, career goals, and lifestyle preferences.

Maybe I should start by considering what motivates people in general in their careers and see how that applies to software engineers. Common factors include salary, career growth opportunities, work-life balance, company culture, and the impact of their work.

Let me think about salary first. Software engineering is known for offering competitive salaries, especially compared to many other professions. High compensation might be a significant attractor for many software engineers, as it can provide financial stability and support their desired lifestyle.

But I've also heard that money isn't everything. Career growth and advancement opportunities might be just as important. Software engineers might be attracted to companies that offer chances to learn new skills, take on challenging projects, and advance their careers through promotions or leadership roles.

Work-life balance is another crucial factor. The tech industry has sometimes been criticized for encouraging long working hours and high stress. However, many software engineers nowadays prioritize maintaining a healthy balance between their work and personal lives. Therefore, companies that promote flexible working hours, remote work options, and emphasize employee well-being might be more attractive to them.

Company culture also plays a significant role. Software engineers likely want to work in an environment where they feel valued, supported, and aligned with the company's values and mission. A positive company culture can enhance job satisfaction and retention.

Additionally, the nature of the work itself is important. Software engineers might be attracted to companies that are working on innovative projects, solving meaningful problems, or contributing to fields they're passionate about, such as technology, healthcare, education, etc.

I should also consider the development resources and tools provided by the company. Software engineers often prefer to work with the latest technologies and tools to stay updated in their field. Companies that invest in modern tech stacks and provide opportunities for continuous learning and skill development might be more appealing.

Moreover, the team and colleagues matter a lot. Working with talented and collaborative teams can be very motivating for software engineers. A supportive and inclusive team environment can enhance collaboration and overall job satisfaction.

Lastly, benefits and perks can also be attractive. While not the primary driver, benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, stock options, and perks like free meals, gym memberships, or wellness programs can make a company more appealing to potential hires.

I think I've covered several key aspects, but maybe I should verify this with some data or insights from reliable sources. Perhaps looking up surveys or reports on what attracts software engineers to a company would be helpful.

Let me consider performing a web search to gather more concrete information.

How To Hire Software Engineers: 12 Characteristics To Look For | Built In
What to Look for When Hiring Software Engineers
Adam Calica
September 19, 2019
Updated: June 3, 2021
There are two key components of any great team: individuals who work well together to achieve a common goal and a leader who works diligently to ensure they’re well equipped to do so. With skills and toolsets as diverse as those found in engineering, leaders need a keen eye to spot new team members and processes that will add value to their squad, which is no small feat.
We spoke to engineering team leads at twelve companies to learn about how they hire software engineers and what they do to support employees once they’ve been welcomed.
How To Hire Software Engineers Successfully
Look for candidates that display humility, ambition, curiosity and enthusiasm.
Ask about their strengths and talents, how will they compliment the team?
Find a candidate that is team-oriented and seeks collaboration — perfect skills aren't helpful unless they're attached to a team player.
A good fit goes both ways. An engineer must be good for the team and the team must be good for an engineer.
Peapod Digital Labs
You can’t tell a compelling story using characters that are identical. And similarly, Development Manager Dan Miller at Peapod Digital Labs believes his team can’t reach its full potential when its members have identical strengths. So, he seeks out diversity in skillsets when hiring and works to cultivate those individual talents once new team members are on board.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
When I go into an interview, I like to focus on the talent of the individual and how they will complement the rest of the team. I pay attention to how they respond to the questions and feedback; for example, how do they react when they don’t know an answer? Do they demonstrate structured, organized thinking and problem-solving?
Beyond that, I think it’s important to consider the broader team they’ll be working in. Many leaders will say they wish they could clone their top performer, but having people who look, think and contribute identically is not a team. I like to think about the skillsets and talents that aren’t represented in our team and identify the complementary experiences that will push us to be better overall.
I believe a significant part of my role as a leader is to listen and understand what someone is working towards.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
I believe a significant part of my role as a leader is to listen and understand what someone is working towards and to give them opportunities to develop the skills they need for their long-term objectives. I don’t think a one-size-fits-all strategy works because everyone approaches their work and their goals differently. I also believe I’m here to remove barriers and create an environment that doesn’t slow things down, and I really appreciate that our agile approach supports that. As an organization, we’re constantly evaluating what is working and what’s hindering success. I hope that my team members are never fearful to share a mistake or a problem but instead feel encouraged to be open about what they could do differently to get an improved result.
Travelers Haven
Warren Wright, vice president of engineering at the tech-enabled housing firm Travelers Haven, strives to build tech teams that are like families. He wants team members to share, look out for one another and call out areas of improvement for others — all without the sibling rivalries or bickering.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
We value the spirit of Agile here and hire accordingly. To that end, I look for engineers who, aside from technical qualifications, show a level of humility and relational smarts. I want a team of folks who collaborate well, are in love with the idea of shared code-ownership, are open to the ideas and critiques of others, and treat each other well. I strongly believe that an engineer who is productive and functions well as part of a team is a happy engineer.
Each team has a dedicated product owner, and that P.O. puts in work to make sure devs are tackling meaningful problems.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
We run a fairly typical scrum framework for our engineering teams. That said, I am not married to scrum, so much as to principle of Agile development. Over time, our flavor of Agile can and should evolve, tailoring to each team. Retrospectives and open conversations are key.
Further, I work with my product folks to not just funnel requests, but to develop them into roadmap items and strategically prioritize them before we expend dev cycles. Each team has a dedicated product owner, who puts in work to make sure devs are tackling meaningful problems.
Tinder
You can use your engineering skills to help with workflow optimization, data-driven insights and video gaming prowess, but have you ever considered deploying your coding talent in the service of love? Tinder is unique in that the work of a relatively small engineering team can have huge impacts on its millions of users worldwide.
VP of Engineering Tom Jacques highlighted some examples of his engineers’ career growth at the West Hollywood company.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
One of the most unique things about Tinder is the outsized opportunity to make a tangible impact for a community of tens of millions of users. Our team is still considered “small” relative to our global footprint, so every engineer has a real hand in shaping the user experience.
For example, Tinder Lite — which just launched on Android in Vietnam — came out of a hackathon project pitched and built by one engineer. Our leadership team was impressed with their dedication — and the effort so perfectly laddered up to our company’s goal of creating better global experiences — that we had a team come together to finalize the version that’s in the hands of users today. A small team of five engineers was responsible for building our sexual orientation update that helps our LGBTQ+ community find more relevant matches, too.
When you take a step back to think about that, it’s incredible. It’s important that this facet of the job — and the opportunity that comes with it — allows candidates to pursue their passions because ultimately it’s a two-way street: our organization needs to be a fit for the candidate as much as the candidate needs to be for us.
...our organization needs to be a fit for the candidate as much as the candidate needs to be for us...”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
Communication is critical. Engineering is a more technical field, but people tend to forget that communication and soft skills still matter, regardless of how much you can code on your own. Establishing communication systems that optimize for engineering success has been a priority since I joined the team. We’ve redesigned our pod structure to ensure that they are more cross-functional than ever before. We’re experiencing better communication, faster decision-making and more end-to-end ownership of initiatives. Tinder is an app that brings people together, and I want to be sure that our team has access to the information and tools that can guarantee success — and that their role and contributions aren’t isolated.
We also have a company-wide learning and development program that entitles every employee to a stipend in order to further pursue career-focused passions and skill development. This could be anything from a business class to a public speaking course.
Tovala
Tovala ’s Co-Founder and CTO Bryan Wilcox looks for a number of traits in candidates, but one of the most significant is also the simplest — is this candidate a nice person? He invests time in truly getting to know interviewees so he can maintain the cooperative and transparency-based culture of his engineering team, and the company overall.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
We look for people who are ambitious but humble, and team-oriented. We have a very kind workplace, so we’re always filtering for that. Amazing talent is not enough to make up for a poor attitude or mistreatment of your colleagues. We look for people who are curious, have a growth mindset and act with integrity. These are not the easiest things to screen for, so we rely heavily on our network for references, and we do our best to spend as much time as possible with candidates so we can get the truest sense of their character.
Amazing talent is not enough to make up for a poor attitude or mistreatment of your colleagues.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
We have a very transparent and process-oriented culture, particularly with our engineering teams. We hold weekly stand-ups, rely heavily on a variety of tools to ensure clear communication, accountability and prioritization, and go to great lengths to build camaraderie among our engineers. We also have several company-wide processes in place to make sure that our engineers, and everyone else, have visibility into everything important that is happening at Tovala.
Flowhub
As the chief technology officer at Flowhub, Mark Donnelly takes seriously his job of aligning employee goals with that of the business. Donnelly said new engineers are asked to think about what they want their future at the company to look like almost immediately, and efforts are taken to ensure their goals can be met within the enterprise.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
We look for engineers who can work with a level of maturity regardless of title. No one has time to micromanage, so being comfortable with autonomy is very much a trait you need to have to thrive here.
The culture at Flowhub is something everyone is very proud of. We have an interview process where the candidate will get to meet a lot of the engineering team. During this process, our people naturally illuminate aspects of the culture they like. At the end of the interview, we make sure the message has resonated with the candidate.
We look for commonality between our employee’s needs and wants, and the company’s — making sure that people get to work on the problems that interest them.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
Career development has always been in sharp focus for me. It is satisfying to see people grow within the organization. When a candidate starts at Flowhub, an engineering manager will meet with them in their first week to discover what they want their career trajectory to look like and what interests them — be it technologies, processes or experiences. We look for commonality between our employees’ and company’s needs and wants, making sure that people get to work on the problems that interest them.
Cloudvirga
While owning a home is undoubtedly exciting, the process of applying for a mortgage is certainly not. Cloudvirga’s point-of-sale software helps simplify the process for loan officers and homebuyers alike, processing more than $200 billion each year for the largest mortgage lenders in the United States
CTO Daniel Akiva said he always aims to set his engineers up for long-term career growth.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
Enthusiasm and curiosity! When we evaluate a candidate’s fit, we start by identifying those who are truly excited about technology and solving problems. Coming to work every day and being amped to create, ideate and build is deep-rooted in the DNA of all CV engineers. As for curiosity, our engineers are driven by a need to make things work. As someone who built and disassembled computers from a young age, I understand that driver. The combination of enthusiasm and curiosity leads to success in so many ways: elegant code, efficient workflow, exciting user experiences, work satisfaction and more.
...we created teams that are comprised of diverse levels of engineering talent in order to drive continuous learning and mentoring. ”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
When I joined CV, one of my first initiatives was to create and publish a career ladder that provided overall visibility and optionality into career progression. In addition, we created teams that are comprised of diverse levels of engineering talent in order to drive continuous learning and mentoring. We work hard to align our technology passion with projects and teams to promote career growth. And, of course, being surrounded by the best, the brightest and the most enthusiastic teammates has contributed to our engineers’ job satisfaction and success.
ChromaDex
ChromaDex partners with universities and research institutions to explore the potential of nicotinamide riboside, a molecule the company says has outsized effects on our experience of aging. ChromaDex seeks to replenish the body’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide — dubbed NAD — and improve the way customers age through its direct-to-consumer supplement.
CTO Ben Shichman hires engineers he can trust and prefers to act as a consultant for his teams, rather than a micromanager.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
I love to work with smart, curious people. They should be natural problem solvers, like to experiment with new technologies and explore new ways of working. Like any startup, we need entrepreneurially-minded, creative people who are also fun to work with. For culture fit, we look for communicative, collaborative people who like to ask questions. Interviewees meet with other cross-functional teams so they can meet the people they’d interact with outside of the engineering team. We believe that every interview is a candidate evaluating us as much as it is us interviewing them.
Simply put, my job is to create an environment for success for my teams — and then get out of their way. ”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
Simply put, my job is to create an environment for success for my teams — and then get out of their way. The key is trust. I don’t practice micromanagement and leave it to the team to make the decisions they need to and consult with me where appropriate. I do my best to help us move forward in a strategic fashion and eliminate the out-of-bounds work requests that so often derail a good team’s productivity. I never set expectations with external stakeholders without consulting my team, and I look to them to provide honest assessments and feedback.
Forager
Matt Weber, CTO at Forager Logistics, is not clairvoyant, but he wants to help candidates see their professional futures — then get them there after they sign on. Weber said the company values professional development and offers opportunities for team members to diversify their skillsets.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
As a recent startup, we work in a fast-paced and high-expectations environment, and our team is excited and proud of the impact we’re making in the transportation industry. So, when it comes to hiring a new team member, making sure they match our culture and enthusiasm is a top priority. We’re always looking for out-of-the-box thinkers who really like to dig in and make a difference — not just punch a timecard. We like to keep our interview process short and conversation-based. This helps us get to know candidates and their backgrounds and quickly determine if they are a good fit for what we’re doing.
We’re committed to the long-term growth of our team and work to provide plenty of development opportunities.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
We’re committed to the long-term growth of our team and work to provide plenty of development opportunities. In fact, a question you’ll often hear in our interviews is, “Where do you want to take your career, and how can we help you get there?” And the cool thing about Forager is the opportunity to work on both the front end and back end. Couple this with our “Open Communication, Always” policy, and it’s easy to see why this is a great place for someone to build a career.
Wowza Media Systems
Sometimes, you need more than pure skill to succeed. Director of Engineering Scott Nicholls at Wowza Media Systems doesn’t hire new team members based solely on their technical prowess — he assesses how well they would fit into the team dynamic overall and how their uniqueness can add value across the board.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
Of course, we look for strong technical skills and experience that will help us succeed in building great software. But, candidates should also bring their unique perspectives, talents, passions and preferred ways of working. I consider how each candidate would complement and affect the team dynamic and make us even stronger. It’s also important to engage the rest of the team in the interview process for them to get a personal sense of how a candidate will mesh.
I consider how each candidate would complement and affect the team dynamic and make us even stronger.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
As a leader, I consider serving the team my top priority. I strive to work with the product team and other leadership to capture the company vision so the teams understand the “why” behind the work we’re doing and the impact we’re making. I also have regular one-on-one meetings to listen to concerns and challenges, to coach and to ensure we’re working together to help the team succeed while also enabling individual career growth.
GutCheck
Software Engineering Director Nathan Lamb pushes his team to succeed by letting them fail. The leader at the online market research firm GutCheck encourages his team members to take chances on things that may not be guaranteed to work but are guaranteed to be learning experiences.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
We’re always looking for the next hire that makes our amazing team even more amazing. We search for those excited to share their own knowledge and expertise, helping push the current team to even greater heights. Our culture is one that values candor, intellectual honesty and humility. We are a team that collaborates with a positive attitude to find the most constructive ways to accomplish goals in the time we have allotted. Our team strives to find people who are egoless, driven and who want to push themselves past their limits. We search for these candidates and invite them to our team’s welcoming and friendly environment.
Each team member is free to take calculated risks; failure is encouraged provided we learn something along the way.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
GutCheck’s core values help set its leaders on a great path. I empower my team by trusting and respecting their decisions. Each team member is free to take calculated risks; failure is encouraged provided we learn something along the way. Further, I assume and generally believe that everyone on the team is doing the best they can do. As a group, we are challenged to solve difficult problems, and we trust ourselves to build the best possible solutions.
Brandfolder
Brandfolder ’s Director of Engineering Brett Nekolny works to keep his team engaged, and he has a number of ways of doing so. Nekolny’s team at the cloud-based asset management solution provider has many efficiency-based processes and tactics in place, designed to keep engineers working at their full potential.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
We’re always looking for someone who is going to add to our team dynamic and push us all to be a better team. But we also make sure the candidate’s values align with our core team values: it’s all about the team; bring passion, work together; ship fast, sustainably; and fix problems, even when they’re not yours.
Assessing if someone is a great culture fit for us is much simpler if we understand how they’ll complement the various opinions and personalities across our team and fit within the values. Our team strives to strike a balance between well-designed code and delivering the next great customer experience. Does the candidate seek team buy-in, or do they steamroll others with their ideas? Is there a drive to deliver? Finally, when we have an incredible product that’s been built, will this person embrace the existing successes of the team’s hard work and build upon those wins?
In my experience, I’ve seen that having an engaged team segues into a team that is executing at a high level.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
The first thing to establish is what success looks like. For me, success looks like an engaged team that’s continuously learning and delivering on objectives. In my experience, I’ve seen that having an engaged team segues into a team that is executing at a high level.
We have numerous mechanisms and touch points that facilitate both growth and delivery. Some of these day-to-day practices include seeking feedback early with code reviews; static code analysis and automated testing; pushing dark code that leverages our iterative process across more than 15 deploys a day; and feature ownership and documentation that includes product requirement docs, an internal Wiki and code-level comments.
On the “softer” side of things, we have planning, daily standups, check-ins and one-on-ones to support the progress and growth of our individual team members and the overarching goals of our team. If we leverage these practices appropriately, there should be sufficient feedback to show us that our team is set up for success and supported in reaching their goals.
Boingo Wireless
It didn’t take long for Wi-Fi to become an essential utility, up there with power and water. Boingo plays a pivotal role in the delivery of information to the masses through its design, building and operation of Wi-Fi and cellular networks at airports, convention centers, stadiums and other commercial hubs.
VP of Engineering Ben Shamsian said his team is already deep into working with 5G technology.
When it comes to hiring, what characteristics do you look for in candidates and how do you ensure they’re a great culture fit?
Boingo is the place to be. We’re front and center to the 5G era and are always looking for superstars who are eager to help us build the wireless future. We take pride in our work, thrive solving complex issues and have an engineering culture where coding, stacks, the cloud and Star Wars fan clubs are the norm. Our ideal candidates embody the “SPIRIT of Boingo”: supportive, people, impassioned, responsive, innovative and transparent.
We work hard to ensure everyone has goals that align with the department and company.”
How do you set your engineering team up for success and support them in reaching their goals?
Transparency is key. No matter your role on the team, it’s important we provide you with a clear idea of Boingo’s strategic roadmap and what we’re trying to accomplish. We work hard to ensure everyone has goals that align with the department and company. Once goals are set, action plans are put in place and we ensure employees have the tools they need to achieve success. Open communication allows us to help troubleshoot, give strategic guidance and confirm the team is on track to meet goals.
Great Companies Need Great People. That's Where We Come In.

The 10 Qualities to Look for When Hiring Software Engineers
Recruiting tips
The 10 Qualities to Look for When Hiring Software Engineers
Paul Petrone
Editor, LinkedIn Sales Blog
June 17, 2015
Based on a Quora thread: What distinguishes a great software engineer from a good one?
Perhaps the most in-demand talent today is software engineers, as the average Silicon Valley developer receives dozens of unsolicited recruiter messages every week. That said, all software engineers are not created equal, and some are going to push your company far ahead others.
The problem for recruiters is most of them aren’t overly technical, so they don’t always know what the perfect software engineer looks like. To help, there was a Quora thread on this exact issue, and some highly successful engineering managers described the qualities of perfect software engineer.
Here is what they said:
1. They are able to balance pragmatism and perfectionism.
Shared by Russel Simmons, Former CTO and Co-Founder of Yelp
Great programmers have the ability to make both masterful/quick/dirty hacks and elegant/refined/robust solutions, and the wisdom to choose which is appropriate for a given problem.  Some lesser programmers seem to lack the extreme attention to detail necessary for some problems.  Others are stuck in perfectionist mode.
2. They aren’t averse to debugging and bugfixing.
Shared by Simmons
Mediocre programmers often fear and loathe debugging, even of their own code.  Great programmers seem to dive right and drill down with Churchill-esque tenacity.  They might not be happy if it turns out that the bug is outside their code, but they will find it.
3. They have a healthy amount of skepticism.
Shared by Simmons
A good programmer will get a solution that appears to work and call it a day.  A great programmer will tend to not trust their own code until they've tested it extensively.
4. They understand what the business is trying to accomplish.
Shared by Slava Akhmechet, Founder at Rethink DM
You can also call it product-awareness. Most engineers (especially the really talented ones) tend to waste a huge percentage of their time making improvements to things that won't make the slightest bit of difference in the grand scheme of things. Great engineers are aware of the fact the company exists for a purpose - they have a feel for what matters and what doesn't to the customers.
5. They know when not to write code.
Shared by Jeff Dean, Director at Galvanize Stack
This goes along with the point before. Yes, coders have to follow the plan. But sometimes the plan doesn’t make sense, and a great engineer will recognize that and make themselves heard.
After all, it’s great to write great code. But if what your coding isn’t going to push the company forward in a meaningful way, it’s an exercise in futility.
6. They have no attachment.
Shared by Dean
The best programmers are ones that can work tirelessly on a project for months, and when faced with evidence that there are better approaches, they'll be the first to `rm -rf` their code and ask "OK, what's next?"
7. They can clearly communication complex ideas.
Shared by Jason Schwartz, product owner at Spotify
Can the engineer explain themselves to non-technical stakeholders, as well as other engineers?  Many technically proficient engineers are not considered great because they can't communicate their ideas.
8. They desire to simplify instead of making things more complex.
Shared by Schwartz
Hard, complex challenges are often fun for developers.  Great engineers want to simplify the problem instead of building something complicated.
9. They know the industry really well.
Shared by Kartik Ayyar, Google engineer
Great engineers are extremely well informed of software efforts outside their own domain and are thus great at not reinventing the wheel. It makes them more efficient and ultimately more strategic with their time.
10. Most of all, they love to code.
Shared by Schwartz
Being an engineer is a great high paying job, which is why many good developers do it. Great engineers would code even if that weren’t the case.  They keep their skills current, and they have the stamina to power through long hours because they are doing what they love.

Developers are people.  They have the same hierarchy of needs as everyone else.  I'm assuming that their basic needs are met.  If you don't pay a living wage or they don't feel safe at work, none of the rest matters.
1. A path for growth.  The really good developers grow or stagnate, and they don't want to stagnate.  That means new(to them) and interesting projects, projects using new(to them) frameworks or technologies, a path for promotion/responsibility growth, etc.
2. Respect.  That includes giving them the resources they need to do their jobs, an outlet for expressing ideas, authority comme

There may be a lot of them but as far as I realised the top incentives that would make a Software Developer satisfied are:
1. A week off and paid holiday package on the desired location.
2. Gadgets he loves to use on work or at home.
3. Unlimited Meals and Drinks of one's choice at office place.
Money is not the only incentive that can make one happy there are other things too that really matter. :)

What used to get me going (I’m retired now, so a good night’s sleep is rare - and welcome) was just the ability to go into the office and finally solve that problem that had been nagging me. For an hour, for a week (once for about 6 months), but I’ve loved solving problems since I was a little kid, so getting a job for which I got paid to solve problems was all I needed. (The feeling of, “Ah! That works.” can’t be put into words. Especially if you’ve been pounding at it for days.)

How do you attract software developers?
Money and good working conditions.
And have an interesting problem to work on.
You probably need a good senior engineer to manage the project in order to achieve the other three conditions. A solid engineer to start with can reduce the amount of repetitive code your developers need to write, and will make it easier to add features, allowing your engineers to focus on the interesting challenges and less on the minutiae.
But here's the catch: Distinguishing between good senior engineers and crappy senior engineers that talk a good talk is really hard. It's a Catch-22: You need to be good to be able

Where do weak software developers work?
Here's another perspective.
I am a weak software developer, because I never did a computer science degree, and I couldn't pass one of those whiteboard algorithms interviews if I tried.
I failed a coding pre screen once.
I just failed a phone pre screen interview for a fintech company.
I've worked as a team lead at Siemens, changed working practices at a document management company, been in a startup and branched into martech development, written parts of Nokia Bounce on a hundred million handsets and had games sold in shrink wrap in the 80s.

What type of software developer writes the most code?
In general, no developer should “write a lot of code”, as you need to write smart, not a lot. This generally means that you’ll be using various frameworks and code generators to help you with the code. It is not unusual for the average developer to write an average of 100 new lines per day, which sounds absurdly low but isn’t. Various frameworks and code generators are actually helping here.
So the developers who have to write the most code tend to be developers who can’t use frameworks or code generators for their chosen platforms, and any developer who doesn’t know how to use frameworks and c

What is the best bonus plan for software developers?
I would recommend avoiding bonuses as a regular part of compensation.
My personal experience is that the incentive part of bonuses (good job!) motivates the wrong kind of performance, and the disincentive part of bonuses (you need to do better) feels like misguided, unfair punishment.
A lot of this rides on communications and expectations.  The simple rule is that if the bonus is seen as a means of changing behavior, you won't get much effect.  If bonuses are seen as an unexpected reward after the fact, they are more effective.  Even then, you have to be careful, as a regular unexpected bonus qu

For Google, completely false.
Your manager and HR actively work to keep your work-life balance, even if you have trouble with that. I’ve seen coworkers told to go home and get some rest… before lunch.
It is true that many Googlers are still in the office at dinner time… but those folks usually showed up just before lunch, and have team situations that make those working hours convenient. So, it’s not so much poor balance as a different solution to getting the balance right.

I don't know what you mean by "or SAAS providers", but I'll answer with respect to contracted developers.
Contracted developers are in essence mercenaries.  They're going to serve their own interests before yours.  Your best strategy is to make sure that you're giving them what they want, which is typically working on the latest and greatest technology at ridiculously high bill rates.  If you fail to do this for them and some one else is willing to, chances are they'll go work for them instead.

The keyword here is “Dream Job” and not “best paying”. Hence, answer varies from person to person. Some might say they want to go work at Facebook, Google or some other giant company while others stick to the ones that interest them the most.
Personally, I’d like to be working at SpaceX or Tesla or anywhere near Elon Musk. It has nothing to do with how much I get paid but has everything to do how much I get to learn.

What do software developers make?
As the name, they develop software. That’s what they make.
(Yes, I know, you were asking for the pay, which varies depending on the location, education, company, etc. Maybe US $20 000 per year in a low-pay country to well over $200 000 for someone senior in a high pay country - part of that is also depends on what you mean by “software developer”, there are many possible job titles that are covered by that - is Mark Zuckerberg a software developer - he is the CEO of a software developing company, so if we include that, you end up with “many millions”)

What are the common work hours for an SDE at Amazon?
Depends on the team and the situation.
There is no fixed hours of work, if you complete the work you can leave for the day.
Usually 8 effective hours is more than sufficient per day.
Just before the year end due to holiday seasons it will be usually more.

What factors can increase your salary as a full stack developer?
Here was my first professional coding situation. Imagine the owner of a company that has 5–8 developers. He knows he needs the developers, he knows they are writing code and tells them things he wants done to their codebase/website. I had 2 CTOs while I was there (one after the other, not at the same time). The first highly technical and not great with communication, the second was almost the opposite.
His main feedback came for most of the developers came from the CTO. Making sure the CTO was aware of my contributions and competency was probably the biggest factor to the raises I got. The seco

Are software developers overpaid?
My personal view on this and I think about this more than I should really is that, TL;DR - no on the whole they are definitely not overpaid.
If you’re being underpaid in the tech industry(at least as a developer with good skills) then you’re not being underpaid but allowing yourself to be subjected to that situation(or maybe you can’t move for personal reasons).
The great thing about developers and the industry is that either you can deliver or you can’t. More importantly, if you don’t stay relevant you won’t last long. The pay comes from what companies and users value . The more we look at diff

15 Characteristics of a Good Software Engineer
Everything nowadays is managed by computers and because of this one of the most emerging professions in the world is software engineering. Every aspect of life now relies on some kind of software. Even machines which were totally mechanical are now mostly software controlled. The software industry is one of the very few fields that didn’t slow down even during the recent global economic recession and software related jobs remained gettable throughout the period. From freelancing projects to software houses and multinational giants, there is always a demand for a capable software engineers. Let us see what traits put you ahead of so many others in this field and what are the real characteristics of a good software engineer after all:
1. Passionate
The most important thing for a good software engineer is his passion for the field. This holds true for any field in life. The most vital ingredient for the success of any profession is the passion for it as underdogs have always been traced back to passionate individuals.
People have set up empires because of their passion, soldiers have won wars and teams have won matches just because of their passion and it’s no different in the software industry.
Usually an early years interest in computer science is a good indicator about the commitment level of a software engineer in the long term.
2. Determined
Developing and keeping check of softwares and programs is not an easy task. Developing a database or even an algorithm can take quite a lot of time and more often than not, detecting complex bugs is nerve wrecking. A competent software programmer therefore needs sound determination to cope up with routine tasks efficiently.
3. Team Player
There are seldom one man shows in software industry and most professional software engineers have got to work in a team. You may have to join one at your workplace or you may work with several distributed teams situated throughout the globe. No matter what the case, you should know how to blend in with the rest of the team.
A good software engineer is not only well aware about general office etiquettes but also keeps team work in mind while coding (writes useful comments in the code, writes proper documentation, religiously follows coding conventions etc).
4. Confident
“How is your morale?” “High, sir” “Up to?” “Sky, sir”. Keep up this sort of confidence in yourself. It is obvious that the nature of work in the world of software is arduous, mind boggling, tiring, and may at times dishearten you a lot but good software professionals keep motivating themselves from time to time by asking themselves questions like; how many people in the world could do it?, how would society get benefited once the problem is solved?, Wouldn’t I be a smarter version of myself once done with this?, Isn’t there a smarter way around this problem?, Isn’t there an algorithm for this? Who would be smarter enough other than me to solve this? etc.
5. Up-to-date
The world of software is continuously progressing at a rapid pace. There are new softwares, tools, languages, frameworks, modules and programs being released every day. When you’re working for international clients and conglomerates, you have to be to up-to-date with the latest trending technologies that are being worked upon.
This may sound like a piece of cake thing but in reality it’s not an easy thing to do because of the complexity of the latest technology and time required to master it. Good software engineers however are known to spend their holidays with headphones plugged in, multiple screens attached to laptops, and exploring latest available trends. So, keep your skill set be up-to-date if you want to be among the best.
6. Efficient Time Management
We live in a fast paced world. Everyone is working on the watch. Software engineers are no exceptions. They are given big projects and are kept on a tight time leash.
So a very important attribute of good software engineers is that they should know that they’re on a clock and therefore need to manage their time wisely. You don’t need to bother about trivial details when you’re on a deadline to say set up a whole database. As the cliché goes “time is of the essence”.
7. Coolheaded and Open Minded
Software engineers ought to have a cool head with an open mind. In a software related problem mostly there are multiple solutions available. In the heat of the battle, a short tempered software engineer might make a blunder due to poor emotional judgement which can cost the entire team dearly in the long run.
A software engineer therefore should have a calm personality which can help it in juggling optimal solutions. Further, one shouldn’t hesitate from adapting an approach that may not be what was originally thought. Such mentality and open mindedness puts you over the top of other developers.
8. Competitive
With the number of software engineers passing out each year, it’s a tough race and a very crowded one. According to recent reports, the number of software professionals in the world would top a whopping number of 26.4 million. With such huge numbers, comes great competition. Will everyone of those 26.4 million professional get a job? Unfortunately, the true but harsh answer is, a big NO.
However, healthy competition within itself isn’t a bad thing as it ensures quality of work and promotes learning.
9. Creative
Mostly overlooked, but creativity is a vital skill that a soft engineer should posses. Why? … Ever heard about the ‘programming is an art vs programming is a science debate’?
Creativity allows programmers to think out of the box. It allows them to work in smarter ways and explore areas which aren’t usually explored by people who like to follow hard and fast rules. It is past that time when people stuck with traditional methods for ages and most employers now seek creativity.
Creativity is also something that sets apart a software engineer from other off the mill engineers. It is a hard earned skill that allows to stand out of the crowd quite easily.
10. Strategist
This traits is an important attribute of any sound engineer. When you’re working on a product you need to have a clear vision about it and you need to set goals till the very final stages of the product.
Planning and vision is what drives an entire software development cycle. Remember, great software engineers always plan while an average Joe just codes!
11. Original
Good software engineers are always original and don’t come by the dozens. There are millions of skilled programmers out there but 99% are working on a set format (which is usually dictated by institutions they graduate from). What is bound to impress an employer or a client is the originality of your skill set.
Originality is what defines good software engineers. Your ability to stand apart from the rest of the graduates is all that matters in these vying times.
12. Industrious
Software industry is a game of capturing the market share. Any good software engineer has to be industrious. He ought to know what sells and a business oriented mindset.
At the end of the day, it the final product that defines you, your aptitude and your organization. No matter how architecturally perfect a software may be, unless it attracts users with its features and price, it is just another rubbish piece of program that’s destined to join the failure club where hundreds and thousands of similar softwares lay in dust.
13. Realist
It is very important in any field to be realistic. Software engineers may get carried away in the course of their work or with a brilliant idea but it is their ability to conduct an accurate feasibility check that allows them to determine the learning curve, real cost, return of value and future of their products.
Above all they need to be practical. There is no use in working on something that cannot be realistically achieved within a reasonable time frame. Time to market is the mother of all aspects when it comes to software development as it alone can determine the fate of a product.
14. Independent
A good software engineer needs to be an independent person. There may be times when your team may not be able to keep pace with you or you may be working on something that they may not be familiar with.
Any average software engineer would lag behind schedule. But the independence of a good software engineer enables him to work personally and achieve it himself. This is what makes them successful.
15. Nerves of Steel
One of the most praised and probably the most difficult of virtues, a good software engineer is always patient. Software development requires patience, a lot of patience, really a huge lot of patience. Things get really bumpy when there are dozens of new features to add, unexpected bugs to fix, compatibility issues to resolve, deadlines to meet, team members to mentor, seniors to be reported, clients to be briefed, quality assurance guidelines to be followed, market standards to be set and cost to be minimized.
This is what software professionals do throughout their careers, this is what defines software engineers, this is why software development is not a pie for everyone, this is why software engineers have above average IQ, this is why software professionals get paid high and this is why software engineers are so cool.
There is a price to pay for everything, patience is what you have to give in return for getting the life of a software engineer.
This concludes our list for some of the common attributes and characteristics of a good software engineer. Feel free to share your opinion in the comments section below!

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about what attracts software engineers.

First, from the Built In article, it seems like they focus more on what characteristics companies look for in software engineers rather than what attracts engineers to companies. But it does mention things like competitive salaries, career growth opportunities, work-life balance, company culture, and the impact of their work, which are probably attractive to software engineers.

The Business Insider article lists the top 25 best-paying companies for software engineers, with Juniper Networks paying the highest average base salary. So, obviously, salary is a big吸引factor for many software engineers.

The LinkedIn article talks about qualities that make a great software engineer, such as balancing pragmatism and perfectionism, not being averse to debugging, having a healthy amount of skepticism, understanding the business goals, knowing when not to write code, having no attachment to their own code, being able to communicate complex ideas clearly, desiring to simplify rather than complicate, being well-informed about the industry, and, most importantly, loving to code.

The Quora threads discuss incentives that are most compelling to software developers. One answer suggests that developers are people with the same hierarchy of needs, assuming their basic needs like living wage and safety at work are met. Then, they look for a path for growth, respect, resources, and opportunities for continuous learning.

Another Quora answer mentions specific incentives like a week off and a paid holiday package, gadgets they love to use, unlimited meals and drinks at the office, massages, racquetball courts, cheerleaders (mentioned humorously), cards against humanity for code reviews, and a relaxed work environment.

The last article from Arkhitech lists 15 characteristics of a good software engineer, including being passionate, determined, a team player, confident, up-to-date with the latest technologies, efficient in time management, cool-headed and open-minded, competitive, creative, a strategist, original, industrious, realistic, independent, and having nerves of steel.

So, summarizing all this information, it seems that software engineers are attracted to companies that offer:

1. **Competitive Salaries:** As seen in the Business Insider article, high-paying companies are attractive.

2. **Career Growth Opportunities:** The Built In article mentions career growth as important, and the Quora answers suggest that a path for growth is crucial.

3. **Work-Life Balance:** Features like flexible working hours, remote work options, and a healthy work environment are valued.

4. **Positive Company Culture:** A supportive and inclusive team environment is important.

5. **Impactful Work:** Working on innovative projects and solving meaningful problems is motivating.

6. **Professional Development:** Opportunities for learning, skill development, and staying updated with the latest technologies.

7. **Recognition and Respect:** Being valued and respected by the team and management.

8. **Challenging Projects:** The opportunity to work on complex problems and contribute meaningfully.

9. **Well-Defined Goals:** Clear objectives and a strategic direction for the team and the company.

10. **Perks and Benefits:** While not the primary driver, benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, stock options, and additional perks can make a company more appealing.

It's clear that while salary is important, software engineers are motivated by a variety of factors that contribute to their overall job satisfaction and career growth.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Competitive salaries, career growth opportunities, work-life balance, positive company culture, impactful work, professional development, recognition, challenging projects, well-defined goals, and benefits/perks.}} \]
