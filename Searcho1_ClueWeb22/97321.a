So I've got this question about redlining and how it affects people today. I'm not super familiar with the term, but I know it has something to do with housing and discrimination. I need to understand what redlining is and then see how its effects are still felt nowadays.

First things first, I should probably define what redlining is. From what I recall, it's a practice where certain areas are deemed undesirable for lending or investment, often based on the racial composition of the neighborhood. So, banks and other financial institutions would literally draw red lines around these areas on maps and avoid investing in them. That sounds pretty discriminatory.

But I need to make sure that's accurate. Maybe I should look it up to get a precise definition. Also, I should find out when this practice started and if it's still happening today.

Let me think about how to approach this. I could start by searching for "what is redlining" to get a basic understanding. Then, I can look into its history and how it was officially practiced. After that, I need to explore its long-term effects on communities and how those effects persist today.

I should also consider other aspects, like whether redlining is still legal, or if there are laws in place to prevent it. And if it's been outlawed, why do its effects still linger.

Another thing to consider is how redlining relates to other forms of discrimination in housing, like racial covenants or predatory lending practices. Maybe they're all interconnected.

I should probably collect some data or statistics to support my points. For example, looking at housing patterns, wealth disparities between different racial groups, or access to services in previously redlined areas.

It might also be useful to look at specific case studies or examples of cities where redlining had a significant impact and see how those areas have fared over time.

Furthermore, I should think about policy solutions or efforts that have been made to mitigate the effects of redlining. Have any programs been implemented to revitalize redlined neighborhoods or to provide equal opportunities for residents?

I need to organize my thoughts carefully so that my answer is coherent and well-supported. Let me try to outline the steps I'll take:

1. Define redlining and its historical context.

2. Explain how redlining affected communities at the time it was practiced.

3. Discuss the long-term consequences of redlining that are still evident today.

4. Provide examples or data to illustrate these points.

5. Mention any current efforts to address the legacy of redlining.

Alright, starting with step one: defining redlining.

Redlining is a term that refers to the practice of denying services, such as loans or insurance, to residents of certain areas based on their racial or ethnic composition. The term originates from the practice of marking maps with red lines to indicate areas where investment was to be avoided. This practice was prevalent in the United States in the first half of the 20th century and had a profound impact on housing segregation and economic inequality.

I should verify this definition. Maybe I can look it up online to ensure accuracy.

What Is Redlining?
Redlining is a discriminatory practice that puts services (financial and otherwise) out of reach for residents of certain areas based on race or ethnicity. It can be seen in the systematic denial of mortgages, insurance, loans, and other financial services based on location (and that area’s default history) rather than on an individual’s qualifications and creditworthiness. Notably, the policy of redlining is felt the most by residents of minority neighborhoods.
Key Takeaways
Redlining is the discriminatory practice of denying services (typically financial) to residents of certain areas based on their race or ethnicity.
Under fair lending laws, these factors cannot be used for making lending or underwriting decisions. 1
Redlining is most often associated with mortgage lending practices, but can also be seen in student loans, business loans, car loans, and personal loans.
Understanding Redlining
The term “redlining” was coined by sociologist John McKnight in the 1960s and derives from how the federal government and lenders would literally draw a red line on a map around the neighborhoods they would not invest in based on demographics alone. Black inner-city neighborhoods were most likely to be redlined. Investigations found that lenders would make loans to lower-income Whites but not to middle- or upper-income African Americans. 2 Unable to get regular mortgages, Black residents who wanted to own a house often were forced to resort to exploitatively priced housing contracts that massively increased the cost of housing and gave them no equity until their last payment was delivered. Chicago's Contract Buyers League was formed in the 1960s by a group of inner city residents to fight these practices.
Indeed, in the 1930s the federal government began redlining real estate, marking “risky” neighborhoods for federal mortgage loans on the basis of race. The result of this redlining in real estate could still be felt decades later. In 1996, homes in redlined neighborhoods were worth less than half that of the homes in what the government had deemed as “best” for mortgage lending, and that disparity has only grown greater in the last two decades.
Examples of redlining can be found in a variety of financial services, including not only mortgages but also student loans, credit cards, and insurance. Although the Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977 to help prevent redlining, critics say discrimination continues to occur. 3 For example, redlining has been used to describe discriminatory practices by retailers, both brick-and-mortar and online. Reverse redlining is the practice of targeting neighborhoods (mostly non-white) for higher prices or lending on unfair terms such as predatory lending of subprime mortgages.
There's also evidence of what Midwest BankCentre CEO Orv Kimbrough calls "corporate redlining." As reported by The Business Journals, since peaking prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the annual number of loans to Black-owned businesses through the U.S. Small Business Administration's 7(a) program decreased by 84%, compared to a 53% decline in 7(a) loans awarded overall. 4 The report also found an overall trend of significantly less lending to businesses in Black-majority neighborhoods, compared to White-majority ones.
Courts have determined that redlining is illegal when lending institutions use race as a basis for excluding neighborhoods from access to loans. In addition, the Fair Housing Act, which is part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, prohibits discrimination in lending to individuals in neighborhoods based on their racial composition. 5 However, the law does not prohibit excluding neighborhoods or regions on the basis of geological factors, such as fault lines or flood zones.
The destructive legacy of redlining has been more than economic. A new 2020 study by researchers at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, the University of Wisconsin/Milwaukee, and the University of Richmond finds that "the history of redlining, segregation, and disinvestment not only reduced minority wealth, it impacted health and longevity, resulting in a legacy of chronic disease and premature death in many high minority neighborhoods...On average, life expectancy is lower by 3.6 years in redlined communities, when compared to the communities that existed at the same time, but were high-graded by the HOLC." 6
Lenders are not forbidden from redlining areas with regard to geological factors, such as fault lines or flood zones. 1
Special Considerations
While redlining neighborhoods or regions based on race is illegal, lending institutions may take economic factors into account when making loans. Lending institutions are not required to approve all loan applications on the same terms and may impose higher rates or stricter repayment terms on some borrowers. However, these considerations must be based on economic factors and cannot, under U.S. law, be based on race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status. 1
Banks may legally take the following factors into consideration when deciding whether to make loans to applicants and on which terms:
Credit history: Lenders may legally evaluate an applicant’s creditworthiness as determined by FICO scores and reports from credit bureaus.
Income: Lenders may consider an applicant’s regular source of funds, which can include income from employment, business ownership, investments, or annuities.
Property condition: A lending institution may evaluate the property on which it is making the loan as well as the condition of nearby properties. These evaluations must be based strictly on economic considerations.
Neighborhood amenities and city services: Lenders may take into account amenities that enhance or detract from the value of a property.
The lending institution’s portfolio: Lending institutions may take into account their requirements to have a portfolio that is diversified by region, structure type, and loan amount. 1
Housing discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. 7 One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or with HUD.
Lenders must evaluate each of the above factors without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status of the applicant. 1
Mortgage applicants and homebuyers who believe that they might have been discriminated against can take their concerns to a fair housing center, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or in the case of mortgages and other home loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 8 9
Where Does the Term "Redlining" Come From?
The term “redlining” was coined by sociologist John McKnight in the 1960s and derives from how the federal government and lenders would literally draw a red line on a map around the neighborhoods they would not invest in based on demographics alone. In the 1930s the federal government began redlining real estate, marking “risky” neighborhoods for federal mortgage loans on the basis of race.
Why Is Redlining Discriminatory?
Redlining is discriminatory practice as it puts services (financial and otherwise) out of reach for residents of certain areas based on race or ethnicity. It can be seen in the systematic denial of mortgages, insurance, loans, and other financial services based on location (and that area’s default demographic) rather than on the individual’s qualifications and creditworthiness. Black inner-city neighborhoods were most likely to be redlined. Investigations found that lenders would make loans to lower-income Whites but not to middle- or upper-income African Americans. The result of this redlining in real estate could still be felt decades later.
What Factors Can Banks Use When Making Loans?
Banks, and other lending institutions, are allowed to take economic factors into account when making loans. If these decisions are based solely on economic factors, then lending institutions are not required to approve all loan applications on the same terms and may impose higher rates or stricter repayment terms on some borrowers. However, according to U.S. law, they cannot base their approval decisions on race, religion, national origin, sex, or marital status. 10

What is Redlining?
In the United States and Canada, redlining is the discriminatory and unethical practice of systematic denial of providing services, particularly financial services, to residents of certain neighborhoods or communities associated with a certain racial or ethnic group. The denial of services can be accomplished directly (e.g., prohibiting the granting of loans to a certain racial group) or indirectly (e.g., imposing higher interest rates for the borrowers from a certain racial group).
Figure 1. Redlining neighborhoods in Philadelphia, 1937 (Source: Wikimedia Commons)
Redlining is typically associated with the denial to provide various financial services such as banking or insurance. However, there are other examples of such unethical practices associated with other services, including healthcare and retail.
History of Redlining
The term “redlining” was introduced by American sociologist J. McKnight in the 1960s. Using the term, McKnight described the discriminatory practice employed by banks when investments in certain neighborhoods were banned based solely on the demographics of the area.
In his study, McKnight identified that certain banks denied various financial services (mortgages, student loans, credit cards) to people living in areas predominantly populated by African Americans.
Redlining and the Law
The discriminatory nature of redlining makes the practice illegal. Businesses are prohibited by law from denying services to customers based on the latter’s race or ethnicity. For example, the Fair Housing Act in the United States protects housing buyers and renters from discriminatory practices that could be employed by sellers or landlords. Additionally, the Community Reinvestment Act bans all redlining practices in lending.
Effects
Redlining adversely affects both the economic and social conditions in an urbanized area. The practice hinders the economic development in neighborhoods populated by ethnic minorities since it paralyzes the housing market in the affected areas and limits the inflow of investments. As a result, the redlined areas become underdeveloped while their residents become poorer.
In addition, redlining fosters the so-called hood culture in the affected areas. The urban population becomes more segregated because residents of redlined neighborhoods tend to bond together and oppose other communities in order to overcome the harmful impact of the practice.  Eventually, the practice results in the destabilization of the urban community.

In the United States, redlining is a discriminatory practice in which services (financial and otherwise) are withheld from potential customers who reside in neighborhoods classified as 'hazardous' to investment; these neighborhoods have significant numbers of racial and ethnic minorities, and low-income residents. [2] While the most well-known examples involve denial of credit and insurance, denial of healthcare and the development of food deserts in minority neighborhoods have also been attributed to redlining in many instances. [3] [4] In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, the purposeful construction of stores impractically far away from targeted residents results in a redlining effect. [4]
Reverse redlining occurred when a lender or insurer targeted majority-minority neighborhood residents with inflated interest rates by taking advantage of the lack of lending competition relative to non-redlined neighborhoods. [5] [6] The effect also emerged when service providers artificially restricted the supply of real estate available for loanable funds to nonwhites, thus providing alternative pretext for higher rates. Neighborhoods which were targeted for blockbusting were also subject to reverse redlining. [7]
In the 1960s, sociologist John McKnight originally coined the term to describe the discriminatory banking practice of classifying certain neighborhoods as "hazardous," or not worthy of investment due to the racial makeup of their residents. [8] During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were Black inner city neighborhoods. For example, in the 1980s a Pulitzer Prize -winning series of articles [9] by investigative reporter Bill Dedman demonstrated how Atlanta banks would often lend in lower-income white neighborhoods but not in middle-income or even upper-income Black neighborhoods. [10] [11] Blacklisting was a related mechanism employed by redlining institutions to keep track of areas, groups, and people that the discriminating party intended to exclude. In academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of credit rationing.[12] The documented history of redlining in the United States is a manifestation of the historical systemic racism that has had wide-ranging impacts on American society, two examples being educational and housing inequality across racial groups.

The specific process termed "redlining" in the United States occurred on the background of racial segregation and discrimination against minority populations. It had its origins in sales practices of the National Association of Real Estate Boards and theories about race and property values codified by economists surrounding Richard T. Ely and his Institute for Research in Land Economics and Public Utilities, founded at the University of Wisconsin in 1920. [15] With the National Housing Act of 1934 the federal government began to be involved in the practice and the concurrent establishment of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). [16] The FHA's formalized redlining process was developed by their Chief Land Economist, Homer Hoyt, as part of an initiative to develop the first underwriting criteria for mortgages.[17] [18] The implementation of this federal policy accelerated the decay and isolation of minority inner-city neighborhoods through withholding of mortgage capital, making it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes. [19][page needed] The discriminatory assumptions in redlining exacerbated residential racial segregation and urban decay in the United States.
In 1935, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) asked the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to look at 239 cities and create "residential security maps" to indicate the level of security for real-estate investments in each surveyed city.  On the maps, the newest areas—those considered desirable for lending purposes—were outlined in green and known as "Type A". These were typically affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cities. "Type B" neighborhoods, outlined in blue, were considered "Still Desirable", whereas older "Type C" were labeled "Declining" and outlined in yellow. "Type D" neighborhoods were outlined in red and were considered the most risky for mortgage support. While about 85% of the residents of such neighborhoods were white, they included most of the African-American urban households. [20] These neighborhoods tended to be the older districts in the center of cities; often they were also African-American neighborhoods.[21][page needed] Urban planning historians theorize that the maps were used by private and public entities for years afterward to deny loans to people in black communities. [21][page needed] But, recent research has indicated that the HOLC did not redline in its own lending activities and that the racist language reflected the bias of the private sector and experts hired to conduct the appraisals. [22] [23] [24]
Redlining maps even became prominent under private organizations, such as appraiser J. M. Brewer's 1934 map of Philadelphia. [25] Private organizations created maps designed to meet the requirements of the Federal Housing Administration 's underwriting manual. The lenders had to consider FHA standards if they wanted to receive FHA insurance for their loans. FHA appraisal manuals instructed banks to steer clear of areas with "inharmonious racial groups", and recommended that municipalities enact racially restrictive zoning ordinances. [26] [27] Between 1945 and 1959, African Americans received less than 2 percent of all federally insured home loans. [28] [29] [30]
Banks and mortgage lenders were not the only private entities to develop redlining practices. Property insurance companies also  instituted rigid redlining policies in the post-World War II period. According to urban historian Bench Ansfield, the postwar advent of comprehensive homeowners' insurance was limited to the suburbs and withheld from neighborhoods of color in U.S. cities. One Aetna bulletin from 1964 advised underwriters to "use a red line around questionable areas on territorial maps." The New York Urban Coalition warned in 1978, “A neighborhood without insurance is a neighborhood doomed to death.” [31]
Following a National Housing Conference in 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formed National People's Action (NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country. This organization, led by Chicago housewife Gale Cincotta and Shel Trapp, a professional community organizer, targeted The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the governing authority over federally chartered Savings and loan associations (S&L) that held at that time the bulk of the country's home mortgages. NPA embarked on an effort to build a national coalition of urban community organizations to pass a national disclosure regulation or law to require banks to reveal their lending patterns. [32]
For many years, urban community organizations had battled neighborhood decay by attacking blockbusting (deceptive encouragement of white flight from neighborhoods in order to buy up real estate at a huge discount and then rent to low-income, usually black tenants), forcing landlords to maintain properties, and requiring cities to board up and tear down abandoned properties. These actions addressed the short-term issues of neighborhood decline. Neighborhood leaders began to learn that these issues and conditions were symptoms of disinvestment that was the true, though hidden, underlying cause of these problems. They changed their strategy as more data was gathered. [33]
With the help of NPA, a coalition of loosely affiliated community organizations began to form. At the Third Annual Housing Conference held in Chicago in 1974, eight hundred delegates representing 25 states and 35 cities attended. The strategy focused on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB), which oversaw S&Ls in cities all over the country.
In 1974, Chicago's Metropolitan Area Housing Association (MAHA), made up of representatives of local organizations, succeeded in having the Illinois State Legislature pass laws mandating disclosure and outlawing redlining. In Massachusetts, organizers allied with NPA confronted a unique situation. Over 90% of home mortgages were held by state-chartered savings banks. A Jamaica Plain neighborhood organization pushed the disinvestment issue into the statewide gubernatorial race. The Jamaica Plain Banking & Mortgage Committee and its citywide affiliate, The Boston Anti-redlining Coalition (BARC), won a commitment from Democratic candidate Michael S. Dukakis to order statewide disclosure through the Massachusetts State Banking Commission. After Dukakis was elected, his new Banking Commissioner ordered banks to disclose mortgage-lending patterns by ZIP code. The suspected redlining was revealed. [34] Richard W. "Rick" Wise, a former community organizer who led the Boston organizing, has published a novel, Redlined, which gives a somewhat fictionalized account of the anti-redlining campaign. [35]
NPA and its affiliates achieved disclosure of lending practices with the passage of The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. The required transparency and review of loan practices began to change lending practices. NPA began to work on reinvestment in areas that had been neglected. Their support helped gain passage in 1977 of the Community Reinvestment Act .

Court system[edit]
In May 2015, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that Associated Bank had agreed to a $200 million settlement over redlining in Chicago and Milwaukee. The three-year HUD observation led to the complaint that the bank purposely rejected mortgage applications from black and Latino applicants. [36] The final settlement required AB to open branches in non-white neighborhoods. [37]
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a settlement with Evans Bank for $825,000 on September 10, 2015. An investigation had uncovered the erasure of black neighborhoods from mortgage lending maps. [38] According to Schneiderman, of the over 1,100 mortgage applications the bank received between 2009 and 2012, only four were from African Americans. [39] Following this investigation, The Buffalo News reported that more banks could be investigated for the same reasons in the near future. The most notable examples of such DOJ and HUD settlements have focused heavily on community banks in large metropolitan areas, but banks in other regions have been the subject of such orders as well, including First United Security Bank in Thomasville, Alabama, and Community State Bank in Saginaw, Michigan. [40]
The United States Department of Justice announced a $33 million settlement with Hudson City Savings Bank, which services New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, on September 24, 2015. [41] The six-year DOJ investigation had proven that the company was intentionally avoiding granting mortgages to Latinos and African Americans and purposely avoided expanding into minority-majority communities. The Justice Department called it the "largest residential mortgage redlining settlement in its history." [42] As a part of the settlement agreement, HCSB was forced to open branches in non-white communities. As U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman explained to Emily Badger for The Washington Post, "[i]f you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go." The enforcement agencies cited additional evidence of discrimination in Hudson City's broker selection practices, noting that the bank received 80 percent of its mortgage applications from mortgage brokers but that the brokers with whom the bank worked were not located in majority African-American and Hispanic areas. [43]

In the United States, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 was passed to fight the practice of redlining. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, "The Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale of a dwelling because of race or national origin. The Act also makes it unlawful for any person or other entity whose business includes residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race or national origin." [44] The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was tasked with administering and enforcing this law.
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) is a United States law (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.), enacted 28 October 1974,[1] that makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract);[2] to the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from a public assistance program; or to the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The law applies to any person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly participates in a credit decision,[3] including banks, retailers, bankcard companies, finance companies, and credit unions.
The part of the law that defines its authority and scope is known as Regulation B,[4] from the (b) that appears in Title 12 part 1002's official identifier: 12 C.F.R. § 1002.1(b) (2017).[5] Failure to comply with Regulation B can subject a financial institution to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions. Liability for punitive damages can be as much as $10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the creditor's net worth in class actions.[6]
The Community Reinvestment Act, passed by Congress in 1977 required banks to apply the same lending criteria in all communities. [45]
Community organizations[edit]
ShoreBank, a community-development bank in Chicago 's South Shore neighborhood, was a part of the private-sector fight against redlining. [46] Founded in 1973, ShoreBank sought to combat racist lending practices in Chicago's African-American communities by providing financial services, especially mortgage loans, to local residents. [47] In a 1992 speech, then-Presidential candidate Bill Clinton called ShoreBank "the most important bank in America". [46] On August 20, 2010, the bank was declared insolvent, closed by regulators and most of its assets were acquired by Urban Partnership Bank .
In the mid-1970s, community organizations, under the banner of the NPA, worked to fight against redlining in South Austin, Illinois. One of these organizations was SACCC (South Austin Coalition Community Council ), formed to restore South Austin's neighborhood and to fight against financial institutions accused of propagating redlining. This got the attention of insurance regulators in the Illinois Department of Insurance, as well as federal officers enforcing anti-racial discrimination laws. [48]
Current issues[edit]
Racial segregation in American cities[edit]
Main article: African-American neighborhood
The United States Federal Government has enacted legislation since the 1970s to reduce the segregation of American cities. While many cities have reduced the amount of segregated neighborhoods, some still have clearly defined racial boundaries. Since 1990, the City of Chicago has been one of the most persistently racially segregated cities, despite efforts to improve mobility and reduce barriers. Other cities like Detroit, Houston, and Atlanta likewise have very pronounced black and white neighborhoods, the same neighborhoods that were originally redlined by financial institutions decades ago. [49] While other cities have made progress, this continued racial segregation has contributed to reduced economic mobility for millions of people.

The practice of redlining actively helped to create what is now known as the Racial Wealth Gap seen in the United States. [50]
Black families in America earned just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04. [51] In 2016, the median wealth for black and Hispanic families was $17,600 and $20,700, respectively, compared with white families' median wealth of $171,000. [50] The black-white wealth gap has not recovered from the Great Recession. In 2007, immediately before the Great Recession, the median wealth of blacks was nearly 14 percent that of whites. Although black wealth increased at a faster rate than white wealth in 2016, blacks still owned less than 10 percent of whites' wealth at the median. [50]
A multigenerational study of people from five race groups analyzed upward mobility trends in American cities. [52] The study concluded that black men who grew up in racially segregated neighborhoods were substantially less likely to gain upward economic mobility, finding "black children born to parents in the bottom household income quintile have a 2.5% chance of rising to the top quintile of household income, compared with 10.6% for whites." Because of this intergenerational poverty, black households are "stuck in place" and are less able to grow wealth.
A 2017 study by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago economists found that redlining—the practice whereby banks discriminated against the inhabitants of certain neighborhoods—had a persistent adverse impact on the neighborhoods, with redlining affecting homeownership rates, home values and credit scores in 2010. [53] [54] Since many African-Americans could not access conventional home loans, they had to turn to predatory lenders (who charged high interest rates). [54] Due to lower home ownership rates, slumlords were able to rent out apartments that would otherwise be owned. [54]
Retail[edit]
Brick and mortar[edit]
Retail redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among retailers. Taxicab services and delivery food may not serve certain areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition and assumptions about business (and perceived crime), rather than data and economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. Consequently, consumers in these areas are vulnerable to prices set by fewer retailers. They may be exploited by retailers who charge higher prices and/or offer them inferior goods. [55]
Online[edit]
A 2012 study by The Wall Street Journal found that Staples, The Home Depot, Rosetta Stone and some other online retailers displayed different prices to customers in different locations (distinct from shipping prices).  Staples based discounts on proximity to competitors like OfficeMax and Office Depot.  This generally resulted in higher prices for customers in more rural areas, who were on average less wealthy than customers seeing lower prices. [56] [57] [58]
Liquorlining[edit]
Further information: Whiteclay, Nebraska
Some service providers target low-income neighborhoods for nuisance sales. When those services are believed to have adverse effects on a community, they may considered to be a form of "reverse redlining".  The term "liquorlining" is sometimes used to describe high densities of liquor stores in low income and/or minority communities relative to surrounding areas. High densities of liquor stores are associated with crime and public health issues, which may in turn drive away supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail outlets, contributing to low levels of economic development. [59] Controlled for income, nonwhites face higher concentrations of liquor stores than do whites. One study done on "liquorlining" found that, in urban neighborhoods, there is weak correlation between demand for alcohol and supply of liquor stores. [60]
Financial services[edit]

Student loans[edit]
In December 2007, a class action lawsuit was brought against student loan lending giant Sallie Mae in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The class alleged that Sallie Mae discriminated against African American and Hispanic private student loan applicants. [61]
The case alleged that the factors Sallie Mae used to underwrite private student loans caused a disparate impact on students attending schools with higher minority populations. The suit also alleged that Sallie Mae failed to properly disclose loan terms to private student loan borrowers.
The lawsuit was settled in 2011. The terms of the settlement included Sallie Mae agreeing to make a $500,000 donation to the United Negro College Fund and the attorneys for the plaintiffs receiving $1.8 million in attorneys' fees. [62] [63]
Credit cards[edit]
Credit card redlining is a spatially discriminatory practice among credit card issuers, of providing different amounts of credit to different areas, based on their ethnic-minority composition, rather than on economic criteria, such as the potential profitability of operating in those areas. [64] Scholars assess certain policies, such as credit card issuers reducing credit lines of individuals with a record of purchases at retailers frequented by so-called "high-risk" customers, to be akin to redlining. [64]
Banks[edit]
Much of the economic impacts we find as a result of redlining and the banking system directly impact the African American community. Beginning in the 1960s, there was a large influx of black veterans and their families moving into suburban white communities. As blacks moved in, whites moved out and the market value of these homes dropped dramatically.  In observation of said market values, bank lenders were able to keep close track by literally drawing red lines around the neighborhoods on a map. These lines signified areas that they would not invest in. By way of racial redlining, not only banks but savings and loans companies, insurance companies, grocery chains, and even pizza delivery companies thwarted economic vitality in black communities. [65] The severe lacking in civil rights laws in combination with the economic impact led to the passing of the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977.
Racial and economic redlining set the people who live in these communities up for failure from the start, so much so that banks would often deny people who came from these areas bank loans or offered them at stricter repayment rates. As a result, there was a very low rate at which people (in particular African Americans) were able to own their homes; opening the door for slum landlords (who could get approved for low interest loans in those communities) to take over and do as they saw fit. [66]
Insurance[edit]
Gregory D. Squires wrote in 2003 that data showed that race continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. [67] Racial profiling or redlining has a long history in the property-insurance industry in the United States. [31] From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry. [67] Home-insurance agents may try to assess the ethnicity of a potential customer just by telephone, affecting what services they offer to inquiries about purchasing a home insurance policy. This type of discrimination is called linguistic profiling.[68] There have also been concerns raised about redlining in the automotive insurance industry. [69] Reviews of insurance scores based on credit are shown to have unequal results by ethnic group. The Ohio Department of Insurance in the early 21st century allows insurance providers to use maps and collection of demographic data by ZIP code in determining insurance rates. The FHEO Director of Investigations at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Sara Pratt, wrote: [70]
Like other forms of discrimination, the history of insurance redlining began in conscious, overt racial discrimination practiced openly and with significant community support in communities throughout the country. There was documented overt discrimination in practices relating to residential housing—from the appraisal manuals which established an articulated "policy" of preferences based on race, religion and national origin. to lending practices which only made loans available in certain parts of town or to certain borrowers, to the decision-making process in loans and insurance which allowed the insertion of discriminatory assessments into final decisions about either.
Mortgages[edit]
In reverse redlining, lenders and insurers target minority consumers by charging them more than a similarly situated white consumer would be charged, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products. In the 2000s, some financial institutions considered black communities as suitable for subprime mortgages. Wells Fargo partnered with churches in black communities, where pastors would deliver "wealth building" sermons encouraging new mortgage applications. The bank would then make a donation to the church in return for every new application. Many working-class blacks wanted to be included in the nation's home-owning trend. Instead of empowering them to contribute to homeownership and community progress, predatory lending practices through reverse redlining stripped the equity homeowners sought and drained the wealth of those communities for the enrichment of financial firms. The growth of subprime lending, higher cost loans to borrowers with flaws on their credit records, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, coupled with growing law enforcement activity in those areas, clearly showed a surge in manipulative practices. Not all subprime loans were predatory, but virtually all predatory loans were subprime. Predatory loans are dangerous because they charge unreasonably higher rates and fees compared to the risk, trapping homeowners in unaffordable debt and often costing them their homes and life savings. [71] [72]
A survey of two districts of similar incomes, one being largely white and the other largely black, found that bank branches in the black community offered exclusively subprime loans. Studies found out that high-income blacks were almost twice as likely to end up with subprime home-purchase mortgages compared to low-income whites. Fueled by deep racism, some loan officers referred to blacks as "mud people" and to subprime lending as "ghetto loans". [71] [72] [73] Lower savings rate and distrust of banks, stemming from this legacy of redlining, may explain why there are fewer financial institutions in minority neighborhoods. In the early 21st century, brokers and telemarketers actively encouraged subprime mortgages to be offered to minority residents. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions, allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt. [74]
Redlining has helped preserve residential segregation between blacks and whites in the United States. Lending institutions such as Wells Fargo have shown that they treat black mortgage applicants differently when they are buying homes in white neighborhoods than when buying homes in black neighborhoods by offering them subprime and predatory loans when black residents try and integrate neighborhoods. [71] [72] [75]
The inequality in loaning extends past residential to commercial loans as well; Dan Immergluck writes that in 2002, small businesses in black neighborhoods received fewer loans, even after accounting for business density, business size, industrial mix, neighborhood income, and the credit quality of local businesses. [76]
Several State Attorneys General have begun investigating these de facto practices, which may violate fair lending laws. The NAACP filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks.
Environmental racism[edit]
Main article: Environmental racism
See also: Race and health
Policies related to redlining and urban decay can also act as a form of environmental racism, which in turn affect public health. Urban minority communities may face environmental racism in the form of parks that are smaller, less accessible and of poorer quality than those in more affluent or white areas in some cities, which may have an indirect effect on health, since young people have fewer places to play, and adults have fewer opportunities for exercise.. [77] A 2022 study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters found redlined areas in 202 US cities had higher levels of air pollution (nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter) in 2010, so 80 years later. [78]
In 1990, Robert Wallace wrote that the pattern of the AIDS outbreak during the 80s was affected by the outcomes of a program of "planned shrinkage" directed at African-American and Hispanic communities. It was implemented through systematic denial of municipal services, particularly fire protection resources, essential to maintain urban levels of population density and ensure community stability. [79] Institutionalized racism affects general health care as well as the quality of AIDS health intervention and services in minority communities. The over-representation of minorities in various disease categories, including AIDS, is partially related to environmental racism. The national response to the AIDS epidemic in minority communities was slow during the 80s and 90s, showing an insensitivity to ethnic diversity in prevention efforts and AIDS health services. [80]
Environmental justice scholars such as Laura Pulido, Department Head of Ethnic Studies and Professor at the University of Oregon, and David Pellow, Dehlsen and Department Chair of Environmental Studies and Director of the Global Environmental Justice Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, argue that recognizing environmental racism as an element stemming from the entrenched legacies of racial capitalism is crucial to the movement, with white supremacy continuing to shape human relationships with nature and labor. [81] [82] [83]
Workforce[edit]
Workers living in American inner cities have more difficulty finding jobs than suburban workers do. [84]
Digital redlining[edit]
Main article: Digital redlining
Digital redlining is a term used to refer to the practice of creating and perpetuating inequities between racial, cultural, and class groups specifically through the use of digital technologies, digital content, and the internet. [85] [86] Digital redlining is an extension of the historical housing discrimination practice of redlining to include an ability to discriminate against vulnerable classes of society using algorithms, connected digital technologies, and big data. [87] [88] This extension of the term tends to include both geographically based and non-geographically based discrimination.  For example, in March 2019 the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) charged Facebook with housing discrimination over the company's targeted advertising practices. [89] While these charges included geographically based targeting in the form of a tool that allowed advertisers to draw a red line on a map; they also included non-geographically based methods that did not use maps but rather utilized algorithmic targeting using Facebook's user profile information to directly exclude specific groups of people. A press release from HUD on March 28, 2019, stated that HUD was charging that "Facebook enabled advertisers to exclude people whom Facebook classified as parents; non-American-born; non-Christian; interested in accessibility; interested in Hispanic culture; or a wide variety of other interests that closely align with the Fair Housing Act 's protected classes." [89]
Political redlining[edit]
Political redlining is the process of restricting the supply of political information with assumptions about demographics and present or past opinions. [90] It occurs when political campaign managers delimit which population is less likely to vote and design information campaigns only with likely voters in mind. It can also occur when politicians, lobbyists, or political campaign managers identify which communities to actively discourage from voting through voter suppression campaigns. [91] [92]
Redlining and Health Inequality[edit]
Health inequality in the United States persists today as a direct result of the effects of redlining. This is because health in America is synonymous with wealth, both of which minority groups have been denied as a result of discriminatory practices. Wealth affords the privilege of living in a neighborhood or community with clean air, pure water, outdoor spaces and places for recreation and exercise, safe streets during the day and night, infrastructure that supports the growth of intergenerational wealth through access to good schools, healthy food, public transportation, and opportunities to connect, belong, and contribute to the surrounding community. Wealth also provides stability of home as those with capital are not confined to the deteriorating housing stock that minority groups who were redlined were forced to try and rehabilitate without access to loans. [93] [94] [95] [96] [97]
Redlining intentionally excluded black Americans from accumulating intergenerational wealth. The effects of this exclusion on black Americans' health continues to play out daily, generations later, in the same communities. This is evident currently in the disproportionate effects that COVID-19 has had on the same communities which the HOLC redlined in the 1930s. Research published in September 2020 overlaid maps of the highly affected COVID-19 areas with the HOLC maps, showing that those areas marked “risky” to lenders because they contained minority residents were the same neighborhoods most ravaged by COVID-19. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) looks at inequities in the social determinants of health like concentrated poverty and healthcare access that are interrelated and influence health outcomes with regard to COVID-19 as well as quality-of-life in general for minority groups. The CDC points to discrimination within health care, education, criminal justice, housing, and finance, direct results of systematically subversive tactics like redlining which led to chronic and toxic stress that shaped social and economic factors for minority groups, increasing their risk for COVID-19. Healthcare access is similarly limited by factors like a lack of public transportation, child care, and communication and language barriers which result from the spatial and economic isolation of minority communities from redlining. Educational, income, and wealth gaps that result from this isolation mean that minority groups' limited access to the job market may force them to remain in fields that have higher risk of exposure to the virus, without options to take time off. Finally, a direct result of redlining is the overcrowding of minority groups into neighborhoods that do not boast adequate housing to sustain burgeoning populations, leading to crowded conditions that make prevention strategies of COVID-19 nearly impossible to implement. [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104]
After years of de facto discrimination achieved through redlining, a system of structural racism blocking the achievement of health equity for all Americans has developed. As a result, a de facto health narrative that does not inspire belonging, compel political participation, nor dictate strategic change towards the social justice model for health equity has matured. In order to eliminate health inequality in America, a new de facto health narrative needs to dictate strategy. The process for achieving health equity relies on healthcare leaders articulating, acting on, and building the vision into all decisions and structures that support equity. Sufficient resources must be allocated to establishing a governance structure that can oversee health equity work. This includes taking specific action to address the social determinants of building intergenerational wealth as well as confronting institutional racism within health systems themselves. Next, health systems need to address the socioeconomic determinants of health which disadvantage minority groups. Through training, education, support groups, housing support, improved transportation, resource assistance, and community health programs, health equity organizations can begin to break down the long-lasting barriers that tactics like redlining have imposed on achieving health equity. In addition to ensuring the equal health outcomes of patients, healthcare organizations can also utilize their position as employers to develop a more diverse workforce through improved hiring practices and ensuring living wages to minority employees. [105] [106]
Strategies to reverse effects of redlining[edit]
Redlining has contributed to the long-term decline of low-income, inner city neighborhoods and the continuation of ethnic minority enclaves. Compared to prospering ethnic minority areas, historically redlined or other struggling black communities need targeted investments in infrastructure and services in order to prosper. [107]
Some of these strategies include:
Targeting planning resources to improve employment, incomes, wealth, the built environment, and social services in struggling communities.
Recognize the importance of public transportation as a means for low-income communities to access jobs and services.
Provide jobs near the labor supply through targeted economic development.
Invest in the housing stock through neighborhood revitalization programs.
Utilize inclusionary zoning (IZ) ordinances to improve amounts of high quality housing.
Equitably distribute hazardous waste sites so they are not concentrated in low-income and minority areas.

Redlining Definition
Redlining refers to the unethical, discriminatory practice of denying inhabitants of a particular neighborhood or community access to services, such as banking, insurance, healthcare, retail, etc., because of their race or ethnicity. It resulted from the age-old discrimination observed between the whites and the blacks in the United States, allowing the former to have their way.
The concept got its name from drawing red lines on a map to indicate areas where people of color would not avail of financial services. The federal government and banks propose systemic denial of loans services by either rejecting them or raising interest rates. It is common in student, consumer, business, home, automobile, and personal loans.

The term originated from the practice of putting red lines on a map to highlight regions where people of color would not be able to access financial services, irrespective of their income or creditworthiness.
The federal government and banks prohibit granting student, consumer, commercial, home, automotive, and personal loans by refusing them or increasing interest rates.
The Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 put a stop to discriminatory lending practices against the colored population of the U.S.
Understanding Redlining
Redlining restricts providing financial and other services to people of color or other minorities residing in a particular area. In the United States, it has prohibited generations of African Americans from obtaining home or home improvement loans. Besides, they were denied insurances and other financial services irrespective of their eligibility, such as income or creditworthiness.
The federal government, banks, and other lenders marked such neighborhoods and communities on the map via red lines to restrict lending services. Furthermore, unethical and discriminatory lending laws in these places were based on race rather than credit history. The red lines played a remarkable role in the history of discrimination in North America. The U.S. government implemented redlining on African Americans, either by disapproving loans or imposing higher interest rates.

Areas with a history of red line discrimination remain segregated and disadvantaged, with mostly non-white residents. Though redlining no longer exists, it created unequal wealth distribution between black and white people. Critics argue that the red lines in the heart and the social structure still exist, resulting in socioeconomic inequities.
In the 1960s, American sociologist John McKnight coined the term “redlining” to characterize the zoning of areas heavily populated by African Americans. These people were denied the benefits of financial schemes like mortgages and loans offered by the federal government or banks.
In his series of articles on redlining in real estate in the 1980s, American investigative reporter Bill Dedman highlighted how banks offered home loans to lower-income white individuals while refusing to lend to middle-income or upper-income colored individuals.
History
The origin of redlining dates back to 1862 when the U.S. government enacted the Homestead Act. The law excluded non-whites from government housing plans. Also, it kept them under the threat of violation if they were residing in the non-red-lined areas. It, thus, segregated blacks from the community and gave only a few parts far off from the white neighborhoods.
During the Great Depression in 1932, U.S. President Herbert Hoover introduced the Federal Home Loan Bank Act. It allowed lending institutions to apply codes to determine which locations were eligible for the federal government and bank mortgage loans and which were not. They used the color red to segregate regions for non-whites from whites. Anyone from those redlined areas was considered a risky investment by banks despite their creditworthiness.
In 1933, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt formed the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, replacing the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Its goal was to make mortgages affordable to promote homeownership. However, it did not provide any relief to neighborhoods predominantly inhabited by African Americans. The program marked areas on redlining maps as A (green), B (blue), C (yellow), and D (red). The new plan too avoided the D, i.e., redlined regions.
In 1968, the U.S. government introduced the Fair Housing Act as part of the Civil Rights Act, followed by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. Finally, the Act prohibited discriminatory lending practices based on race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and religion.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act implemented in 1975 helped combat redlining and unfair lending practices. It required lenders to make loan data public. In 1977, the passage of the Community Reinvestment Act outlawed redlining. It encouraged banks and lenders to lend to the communities they serve.
Legal Implication
The redlining laws widened the racial divide by limiting access to various services, especially financial services, to whites only. As a result, redlining became an illegal and discriminatory practice. Furthermore, it prohibited banks from investing in the redlined areas. And the most critical aspect of the loan approval process was assessing the eligibility of the borrowers based on race and color rather than their creditworthiness or income.
Even though the Community Reinvestment Act put an end to redlining, the divide in the social structure still exists in the U.S., with the prevalence of racial discrimination.
Effects
The best approach to build equity in the U.S. is to own residential property. However, redlining limited the privilege of earning wealth to whites only. It resulted in an unequal distribution of resources across the country. The underdevelopment of redlined areas made its residents poorer.

The white and black residential premises in the U.S. are built based on the region’s exposure to pollution and its proximity with highways, banks, supermarkets, etc., with the former receiving priority in all respects. Investment restrictions in areas populated by racial or ethnic minorities harmed the housing market and economic growth.
The redlining practice impacted the overall social and economic structure. It also caused discrimination between the developed whites and the developing colored population. Even though housing policies underwent dramatic changes over the last eight decades, the inequality they caused persists.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What does redlining mean?
Redlining is a practice of restricting financial and other essential services to residents of a particular area based on their race or ethnicity. The federal government and banks prohibit granting student, consumer, business, housing, vehicle, and personal loans to minorities by refusing them or raising interest rates. The name comes from drawing red lines on maps to indicate areas where people of color would not access financial services.
When did redlining end?
The Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ended unethical lending practices against colored individuals in the U.S. These laws required banks to make loan data public. Also, they encouraged lenders to lend to the communities they serve.
What are the effects of redlining?
The practice of redlining impacted the broader social and economic structure, resulting in discrimination between high-income whites and low-income blacks. Restricted investments in racial or ethnic minority communities negatively influenced the housing market and economic growth. Thus, the residents of redlined regions became poorer as a result of the underdevelopment.

Alright, so I've got this information on redlining. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First off, redlining is a form of discrimination where certain areas are marked for lack of investment or service provision based on the racial or ethnic makeup of the neighborhood. It seems like this practice was really prevalent in the United States, especially in the 20th century.

From what I can gather, the term "redlining" comes from the actual practice of drawing red lines on maps to indicate areas where banks and other financial institutions wouldn't invest or lend money. These areas were often neighborhoods with high concentrations of racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans.

I see that this practice wasn't just limited to banking; it extended to insurance, healthcare, retail, and even online services. So, it's a broad issue that affects multiple aspects of people's lives.

Looking back at history, it seems like redlining has deep roots in the United States. Starting from the Homestead Act of 1862, which excluded non-whites from government housing programs, through the Great Depression when the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) graded neighborhoods and used color-coded maps to indicate lending risks, with red areas being the highest risk and least desirable for investment.

These HOLC maps are mentioned in several sources, and they seem to be a key piece of evidence showing how systematic this discrimination was. The grading was ostensibly based on economic factors, but in practice, it correlated strongly with the racial composition of the neighborhoods.

Over time, there have been legislative efforts to combat redlining. The Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 are all法律法规旨在打击歧视性贷款做法，特别是针对有色人种。这些法律要求贷款机构公开贷款数据，并鼓励他们在服务的社区内放贷。

尽管有这些法律，但红lining的影响仍然存在。研究表明，历史上被红线划定的地区至今仍然面临着持续的不平等，包括较低的房屋价值、较少的投资和较差的社会经济结果。这导致了财富差距的扩大，尤其是黑人和白人之间的财富差距。

此外，红lining还与健康不平等等问题有关。由于缺乏投资，这些社区可能没有足够的绿地、健康的食品选择或优质的医疗服务，从而影响居民的整体福祉。

在现代，虽然明确的红lining做法已经被法律禁止，但一些批评者认为，类似的歧视形式仍然存在，比如通过算法和数据分析进行的隐形歧视，或者在贷款定价和条款上的差异对待。

总的来说，红lining是一个复杂的历史和当代问题，它揭示了系统性的种族不平等如何在美国社会中根深蒂固，并且持续影响着人们的生活机会和经济前景。

So, to sum it up, redlining is a discriminatory practice that has had lasting effects on communities, particularly affecting people of color in terms of housing, wealth accumulation, and overall quality of life. Even though laws have been passed to prevent it, its legacy continues to be felt today.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Redlining is a discriminatory practice that has had lasting effects on communities, particularly affecting people of color in terms of housing, wealth accumulation, and overall quality of life.}} \]
