Alright, so I need to figure out the importance and significance of art during the prehistoric period. I don't know much about this topic, so I'll need to do some research. First, I should understand what the prehistoric period is. I think it refers to the time before written records, right? So, that's when humans were still developing their cultures and societies without writing systems. Art from that time must be really old and probably very different from what we have today.

I need to find out why art was important back then. Maybe it was used for communication since they didn't have writing. Or perhaps it had religious or ceremonial purposes. Also, art can reflect the life and environment of those times, so it might provide insights into how people lived, what they ate, their beliefs, and their interactions with nature.

Let me think about the different types of prehistoric art. I remember something about cave paintings, like the ones in Lascaux and Altamira. Those feature animals and hunting scenes, so maybe art was a way to document their daily activities or to pay homage to animals that were important for survival.

There are also sculptures, like the Venus figurines. These small statues of women, often emphasizing fertility, suggest that there might have been a focus on reproduction and the female form in their culture. Maybe these were religious icons or symbols of prosperity.

Then there are megalithic structures, like Stonehenge. Those are massive stone structures that must have required a lot of planning and cooperation to build. They might have had astronomical alignments, indicating that prehistoric people observed and tried to understand the movements of celestial bodies.

I should look up more information to confirm these ideas. Let me try searching for "importance of art in prehistory."

Art: a tradition that connects and encourages us to look beyond reality. Prehistoric art, in particular, is very important because it gives us insight into the development of the human mind and ways. Evidence of artistic thinking in hominids dates back 290,000 years ago; the Palaeolithic age. From holes in the wall to elaborate frescos, art shows us that there was more to our prehistoric ancestors than neanderthalic behaviour.
There was an abundance of art created during prehistoric times, the majority holding important information that we can use to unlock mysteries about the early humans. The first signs of artistic thinking and capability were shown in Bhimbetka, India, 290,000 BCE. Nothing more than 10 cup shaped holes were found in the …show more content…
Research suggests that early art was made for rituals and sacred ceremonies. One example of this is the murals that were often used to depict and map out what early humans believed to be their spiritual journey which they created while intoxicated. This suggests that art held specific meaning for people which may also indicate that painting was a possible first sign of independent thought and opinion. Prehistoric paintings also often included some form of wildlife. Some may think this is a depiction of the muralists daily life, but the animals on the walls of most caves actually represent animal guardians. The prehistoric people painted them to protect both themselves and the spirit of the animal. The predominance of paintings that this applies to were created in the upper Palaeolithic age. In addition to the paintings that show us how our prehistoric ancestors visualised the non-physical world, objects have also been found that many think were used to make sounds to drive away evil …show more content…
The motion of sculpting and painting was at first done ambidextrously, but over time, it has been shown that ancient artists started to favour one hand over the other. Following this, people realised that one hand was stronger and more precise, so tools were also often used with that hand. This led to hand dominance. Judging from ancient art, the majority of prehistoric artists were right handed, and that predominance is still seen to this day. In addition to the use of brushes and tools, brain development and growth also contributed to handedness. As this happened, one side of the brain grew to be more dominant, thereby resulting in the corresponding hand becoming dominant. For instance, if you are left handed, the right side of your brain is dominant. At first, though, prehistoric artists didn’t notice this because they used both hands proportionally. The reason not everyone is right-handed, though, is because having the right hemisphere of your brain be dominant could have been useful during prehistoric times. It was proven that left-handed people had exceptional memory of landmarks, good direction, and were particularly skilled at navigation in unfamiliar terrain.
Art contributed to society in many consequential ways. Artistic thinking dates back many years and has continued to this day to make us ponder as it evolves at its own pace for each individual. Art holds the key to our understanding

497 Words  | 2 Pages
At first, our ancestors simply drew what they saw and what they observed. However, as time went on, our later ancestors became more creative and abstract, combining animals, creating religious figures, using pigments for color, and utilizing the bumps in the cave to help display the image.

The Odyssey: The Joys Of Equality In The Odyssey

Equality
	 Within the comforts of the modernized human civilization that we all experience on a daily basis, a person can easily forget how privileged they are to be existing in such a time of human equality. However, times were not always as pleasant as they currently are, as different diversities of people were not only shamed for their race, gender or ethnicity, but they were abused for it. That being said, if abusive behaviors like human trafficking and racial discrimination can still be found in today’s modern world, then discriminatory practices or rules back several centuries ago must have been a common part of daily life for ancient societies. In the Odyssey, the poem’s epic hero, Odysseus, finds himself and his crew in many horrible situations while he persistently sails across the seas in quest to find his long lost home in Ithaca, Greece.

Tension And Competition In Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man

Humanity’s crux and advantage is the need to be seen by others. The human race is constantly improving and trying one-upping each other causing us to evolve-discover new things-at a fast pace; but this need also causes tension and competition to be the ‘most seen’ which leads to wars and mistrust. The Invisible Man’s narrator is only human and so he feels this same desire to be seen but to a somewhat more visceral degree, as he has been told from a young age that life would be easier if he simply ignores that base instinct- and despite getting multiple examples of why his grandfather’s words are true the narrator continues on his plight to be noticed by society.

Sacred Boundaries In Etruscan Societies

In class we talked about many issues surrounding the Etruscans and our understanding of Etruscan societies based off of the ruins and artifacts that they left behind. At one point during class we discussed how temples were often built to accent a natural feature such as a stream, river, or a hill. We also discussed the differences between scared and non-sacred boundaries in Etruscan societies. I would like to look back on these discussions for a moment and contribute some new thoughts that I hadn’t necessarily worked out earlier

1. What was the importance and significance of art during the prehistoric period? The importance of that little art that has been discovered has given us insights and understanding into lives that came before written language for me it has a thousand meaning, I think by doing that art, they want to say that “I was here” because no one knows why pre- historic humans created images and objects which are currently described as art.
The impact of art during the prehistoric period has allowed us to gain knowledge and understanding of how humans lived at the time.
Because there were no other human recordings or writings at the time, the art allows us to understand human activities. The art provides us with information about the events that occurred during that time period. Craving painting, for example, would display events from various eras and pass a massage.
2. During the early Egyptian civilization, in what ways were art and religion interconnected?
Their art was related to messages/drawings to help the deceased to live forever by giving them instructions when they meet the gods on their way to eternal life. Egyptian religion was System of beliefs/rituals, with non-human like gods. Religion centered on the pharaoh of Egypt. Pharaoh was believed to be descended from gods. Also preservation of knowledge of the past.
Art and Religion is a multidisciplinary topic of study that focuses on the creative interplay between image and meaning creation as religious activities. In its broadest sense, the term refers to studies of the role, place, or experience of art in religion(s).
Art is a primal feature of human existence and a constitutive factor in the evolution of religion as a form of creative expression, communication, and self-definition. Art lends meaning and worth to anthropic goals, encounters, and narratives through visual expression and shape, while also orienting the human within the horizon of a society, globe, and cosmos. As a result, art uses visual representations to make the human situation—origin, existence, death, and afterlife—comprehensible. Religion is the spiritual impulse that connects humans to divine through spiritual experience, ceremonial, and mythology as a stimulant for creativity and culture. Art may mysteriously perceive and project the substance and meaning of a spiritual experience through form, resulting in a tangible record that guides the initiation or repetition of the original spiritual moment. Similarly, art uses visual archetypes and idealizations on the route to truth and beauty, providing sacred visions and models to follow on the road to salvation. Art, as a visible religion, uses iconography and images of the human body to transmit religious ideas, rituals, and values. The reciprocity between image production and meaning creating as creative correlatives is the underlying concept underpinning the links between art and religion.

What was the importance of art during the prehistoric period?
Asked by: Ondrej Tikhodeev
asked in category: General Last Updated: 28th February, 2020
What was the importance of art during the prehistoric period?
Cave art is significant because it was what people in prehistoric times did in order to record history and culture. But, prehistoric cave art was also significant because it also served as a warning to people who were to come later. For example, they could show the way to kill a beast or warn them of a beast.

Thereof,  what is the purpose of prehistoric art?
Some believed the art to be religious in nature. Cave paintings in particular were the products of worship, though portable figurines were also interpreted as being deities.
One may also ask,  what is prehistoric era art? Prehistoric art refers artifacts made before there was a written record. The earliest art comes from the Paleolithic era (the Old Stone Age ), but it was in the Neolithic era that we see the most important developments in human history.
In this manner,  what subjects were common in prehistoric art?
The subjects that were common in prehistoric art were animal figures and human figures. Pre-historic art is the earliest period where first humans painted animal and human figures in caves. The paintings supposedly are descriptions on moments of hunting.
What is the purpose of cave paintings?
Hunting was critical to early humans' survival, and animal art in caves has often been interpreted as an attempt to influence the success of the hunt, exert power over animals that were simultaneously dangerous to early humans and vital to their existence, or to increase the fertility of herds in the wild.

Alright, so I've got these search results about the importance and significance of art during the prehistoric period. Let's see what they say.

First, there's a document from the Internet Public Library that talks about how prehistoric art gives us insight into the development of the human mind and ways. It mentions that evidence of artistic thinking dates back to around 290,000 years ago in the Paleolithic age. That's really old! The article suggests that early art was used for rituals and sacred ceremonies. It also points out that prehistoric people painted animals to protect themselves and the spirits of those animals. Interesting.

Another source from r4dn.com reiterates that prehistoric art is important because it offers a glimpse into the development of human thought and practices. It emphasizes that art from this period helps us understand the beliefs and lifestyles of our ancestors.

Then, there's an essay that discusses the importance of prehistoric art in general, mentioning that it's a crucial record of early human culture since it predates written history. The essay categorizes prehistoric art into four basic types recognized by archaeologists.

A user on CourseHero asks about the importance of prehistoric art, and the answer provided discusses how it allows us to understand the intelligence and culture of early humans. It also mentions that cave paintings provide information about the activities and perceptions of prehistoric people.

Another CourseHero document provides a concise answer, stating that prehistoric art is significant because it's one of the primary ways we can learn about the past, especially since there are no written records from that time.

From these sources, it seems clear that prehistoric art is invaluable for understanding the thoughts, beliefs, and daily lives of our ancestors. It serves as a historical record that transcends language and time, offering insights into human evolution and cultural development.

But I want to dig deeper. I'm curious about specific examples of prehistoric art and how they illustrate these points. For instance, the cave paintings in Lascaux and Altamira are famous for their detailed depictions of animals. What do these paintings tell us about prehistoric people?

Maybe I should look up more specific information about these sites.

The Iconography & Symbolism of the Lascaux Cave Paintings
The Iconography & Symbolism of the Lascaux Cave Paintings
Education
|
College & Higher Education
By Ralph Heibutzki
The Lascaux cave paintings of southwestern France have been objects of intense curiosity since their accidental discovery by four teenagers and a dog in September 1940. Like similar artwork found in other western European nations -- notably Spain -- the Lascaux paintings represent an early sign of man's desire to make sense of his surroundings through artistic expression. Although many theories have been proposed, archaeologists have yet to definitively establish what purpose the images actually served.
Contents and Style
Dated between 28,000 and 10,000 B.C., the Lascaux images focus on the animals that dominated the artists' lives -- including bison, bulls, cows, deer and horses, an analysis from Glendale Community College suggests. No environmental details are shown. To create their images, the artists either blew paint onto the walls by mouth or through hollowed-out bones, according to Laura Anne Tedesco, an associate educator for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The pigments came from locally available minerals. No brushes have surfaced, suggesting that the artists used mats of moss, hair or colors for outline work.
Interpretations of Images
Numerous theories have been advanced to explain the paintings' symbolism. One interpretation is that the caves mostly served a ceremonial purpose, because the paintings aren't near the main entrance, Glendale's analysis suggests. The artists may also have painted the images to celebrate successful hunts or ensure a good outcome on future ones. Other authorities such as German researcher, Dr. Michael Rappengluck, suggest that the paintings represent an early star map. For evidence, Rappengluck points to a drawing of a bull, a birdman and a bird -- which he says are symbolic of the stars Vega, Deneb and Altair.
Meaning and Significance
The arrival of cave art like the Lascaux images coincides with anatomically modern humans' replacement of their Neanderthal predecessors as the predominant presence throughout continental Europe. These developments, in turn, followed the creation of art during the upper Paleolithic period, around 40,000 B.C. -- which marked man's gradual mastery of the environment along with a desire to interpret and explain it through engraving, painting and sculpture, Tedesco says. In her view, the discovery of numerous images superimposed over others suggests that the Lascaux paintings likely served more of a functional purpose than an artistic one.
Status Since Rediscovery
After World War II ended in 1945, the caves opened for daily tours that drew as many 1,000 visitors per day -- whose combined breathing raised carbon dioxide levels to environmentally catastrophic heights, according to the International Committee for Preservation of Lascaux's website. The resulting combination of high humidity and carbon dioxide levels built up moisture and condensation that endangered the paintings, according to the committee. High calcite levels also began to form on the artwork. The French government responded by closing the caves to the public in 1963. Since then, access has remained restricted to researchers and caretakers.

Home / Uncategorized / The Significance of Lascaux Cave Paintings Back in Those Days
Lascaux is located in south-west France. The site has earned international fame as a tourist hot-spot for its prehistoric cave paintings. Situated near the village of Montignac, the Paleolithic art is estimated to be a good 15,000 years old.
Lascaux cave paintings have made Vezere valley in France a UNESCO World Heritage Site, since 1979. It is famous for the surrealistic images of animals that research reveals lived 15,000 years ago. They were part of the discovery made on 12 September, 1940. The caves were chanced upon by four teenagers, and their dog. After World War II, the site was opened to the general public. However, the increasing number of visitors resulted in an unprecedented release of carbon dioxide and visible damage to the paintings.
In 1963, the caves were officially closed to the public, with the intent of restoration and preservation of the art. Today, the Lascaux paintings are monitored regularly and the sites have been segregated on the basis of exhibit into:
Great Hall of the Bulls
Lateral Passage
Shaft of the Dead Man
Chamber of Engravings
Painted Gallery
Chamber of Felines
Lascaux II exhibits replication of the artwork depicted in Great Hall of the Bulls and the Painted Gallery. Lascaux artwork can also be seen at Le Thot, Center of Prehistoric Art, France. Preservationists from the Archaeological Survey Department have been battling fungus and black mold since 2000. The climatic conditions within the caves are now monitored to preserve the exhibits.
Significance
Lascaux paintings are about 2,000 in all and while 600 of the animal figures can be identified, the rest are a trip back into prehistoric times. Geometric figures of equines, cattle, felines, birds, bears, rhinoceros, humans, and stags are dominant. The effect of the ‘bulls in motion’ give us an insight into the precision and dedication of the artists. The Paleolithic cave painters displayed unique perspective in the non-figurative images. The night sky depictions actually correlate with constellations. These ‘visions’ within paintings of humans and the sky also highlight the fact that the artists indulged in the ritual of trance-dancing.
These paintings are deduced as beyond ‘decorations’, since research reveals that they did not show any signs of prolonged habitation. This is indicative of the fact that the caves were used for preserving and transmitting information. Archaeological experts spotted realistic images superimposed for the ‘stampede’ effect. While the images appear linear, the sudden burst of colored and stylized detail speaks volumes for the versatility of brush and dynamic hand movement.
The primitive inhabitants immortalized their lifestyle, artwork, and crude tools via exquisite and exclusive renderings. Their hand at foreshortening, contrasting color schemes, and three-dimensional illusions brings many a modern painter to Lascaux each year. The paintings tell visitors a lot about the inhabitants of the era and the level of intellect through the fact that they used the cave walls to pass on vital information about animal and human life then.
Their sense of aesthetics and prevalent culture crosses all linguistic and social barriers, appealing to even the indifferent-to-art visitor to the caves. The ancient caves give us an idea of the painter’s sanctuary for rites and ceremonies and some serious revelations about their hunting and group strategies. A visit to the site is an intense learning process full of opportunity for the painter to observe and replicate genius in transforming real time agility of the animal world on canvas.
These paintings offer the visitor an understanding of the development of intercultural communication between group hunters centuries ago. The walls display the versatility of the painter through preserved sophistication of hue and choice of location.

Lascaux Cave: Paintings and Cave Drawings
Lesson Summary
Lascaux Cave
Lascaux Cave is located in southwestern France. It is a Paleolithic cave, meaning that it is home to some of the earliest known prehistoric drawings by humans. It is famous for the distinct paintings found on the walls of the cave. The Lascaux Cave contains a few different areas of importance, including the Hall of the Bulls, the Passage Gallery/Passageway, and the Nave.
There are nearly 600 paintings that can be found within Lascaux Cave. For their age, they have been appraised as being in exceptional quality and condition. The Lascaux Cave drawings will be discussed in this lesson, as well as the location, discovery, and significance of the cave.
Lascaux Cave: Location
Where is the Lascaux Cave located? This historic site can be found in the Dordogne region of France near the village of Montignac. The area is characterized by lush countryside filled with valleys, forested hills, rivers, and caves that date back many centuries. Lascaux Cave is just one of many prehistoric caves in the region, but it holds the most detailed and famous drawings.
Lascaux Cave is located in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. The region is home to many caves that are nestled into lush countryside.
In 1979, the cave was deemed to be a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. It became included in the number of existing Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves division of the Vezere Valley. Over the years, the cave has been replicated directly next to the original cave by the French government. Lascaux cave still exists, but it is no longer accessible by the public.
Lascaux Cave: Discovery and Preservation
The Lascaux France cave paintings were first discovered on September 12, 1940, by four teenage boys. Historians recount that the boys' dog had fallen down a foxhole located on Lascaux hill and they had made an effort to rescue the dog. Marcel Ravidat is credited with being the first person to discover Lascaux Cave because he was the first person to reach the bottom of the foxhole. Once in the cave, the four teenagers found many paintings of animals on the walls and continued their exploration the following day. After reporting their findings to their teacher, excavation work began on uncovering the history of this famous landmark.
In 1948, Lascaux cave became open for public viewing. Visitors could freely walk through the cave and explore the wonderous Lascaux Cave drawings. However, this experience was only possible for fifteen years. In 1963, the original cave was closed to prevent further deterioration of the paintings found within. Carbon dioxide and perspiration by human visitors had weathered and aged the paintings rapidly.
Following the closure of the cave and initial irreparable damages, other threats and impacts to the cave have come to light. These include:
The growth of algae and fungus throughout the cave. This was caused by the presence of more carbon dioxide in the air.
The growth of black mold. In 2006, this problem was identified and has only become more serious.
The fading of paintings from added carbon dioxide.
Though the paintings of Lascaux cave survived nearly 20,000 years undisturbed, the presence of humans within the cave has made the paintings fade significantly.
Preservation efforts for Lascaux cave are ongoing. French authorities and historians alike have both been making efforts to preserve the cave in the years that followed the closure of the original cave. Some preservation methods that have been explored are:
Lascaux II is a replica cave that was opened in 1983. It cost $64 million to construct and is located next to the original cave.
Lascaux III and Lascaux IV are other replica caves constructed nearby for display, education, and research.
Meetings and summits have been held to discuss preservation efforts, though few tactics have been implemented.
One person is allowed into the cave for twenty minutes each week to record the climate statistics of the original cave.

Lascaux Cave: Paintings and Cave Drawings
Many of the Lascaux Cave drawings are of animals, namely bulls, aurochs, horses, stags, and feline species. Horses are the most dominant image in Lascaux Cave. Human figures also appear alongside the animals. Interestingly, no plant life or vegetation is depicted amongst the other drawings.
The paintings were created by using pigments and minerals, a practice that has been used since before the time of the artwork. Minerals and ores such as hematite, iron, manganese, as well as clay and charcoal, were used to make the colors. Red, yellow, and black are the most commonly seen colors throughout the Lascaux Cave drawings. The paintings appear to have been done by hand.
Horses are the most painted animal in Lascaux Cave. The reason for this is unknown, though scientists believe that the cave may have been used to record hunting successes or perform ceremonies.
When Lascaux Cave was discovered, the deepest chambers of the cave contained many tools used to carve and etch the walls. This included tools made of bone, shells, flint, and other stones. Brushes made of moss may have also been used to paint the caves. The chambers of the cave were lit by torches fueled by animal fat, which assisted in the creation of the cave paintings.
Lascaux Cave: Age of Paintings and Drawings
The artwork found within Lascaux Cave consisted of both paintings and cave drawings, many of which were etched into the stone. The art is estimated to be from the Upper Paleolithic period, which took place around 17,000 B.C.E. to 15,000 B.C.E. Therefore, the Lascaux cave drawings are nearly 20,000 years old!

Cave Paintings and Artifacts
Paintings of animals crowd calcite walls at Lascaux.

Many of the remnants of Paleolithic societies have been found in caves. That doesn't mean that people spent a lot of time living in caves -- the environment of a cave simply preserves these remnants from erosion, corrosion and decay, allowing them to last for tens of thousands of years. But not all caves are so helpful. Caves that have water sources inside them, known as active caves, make it difficult to determine what life was like in the past. Floods and changes in the water's course spread detritus like bones, stone fragments and tools throughout the cave, often hundreds of meters from where they were first dropped.
Even cave art isn't really restricted to caves. Again, caves preserve the art better, but Stone Age paintings of animals have been found on rocks and cliffs throughout Africa [source: Constable ]. The most famous cave in the world is Lascaux, near Montignac, France. It was discovered in 1940, and the entrance was later modified to create an entryway and masonry floors for visitors. However, the cave was eventually sealed off and climate-controlled to prevent damage to the paintings, which are very sensitive to the flashes from cameras and the carbon dioxide given off by visitors.

We can only speculate about the purposes of the cave paintings found at Lascaux and other sites. They may have been part of religious rituals, simple representations of life as the cave dwellers experienced it, or superstitious homages created in hopes of a successful hunt. One thing is clear: The main subject on the minds of the cave dwellers was the animal life around them. The overwhelming majority of the images painted onto the cave walls depict animals, mainly herd animals such as bison, horses and boars [source: Aujoulat ]. Some images seem abstract, depicting grid and dot patterns. These may have been a primitive form of calendar or sign, or they may have represented images seen while in a trance [source: Price ]. It's just as interesting to consider what wasn't depicted by cave art: very few trees or other vegetation, and few images of humans. We have no idea why they neglected these subjects.
The cave paintings, particularly at Lascaux, are remarkably detailed. Some of them depict large animals at near life size. The primary pigments used were iron oxides for red and manganese for black. Ochre created a variety of yellow or orange shades. Cave dwellers applied the paint by blowing through a tube or directly from the mouth. They also used brushes made from animal hair or plant material, along with their fingers, rocks and other tools [source: Aujoulat ]. Sometimes the images were engraved in addition to being painted. Many of the paintings were made deep within the cave with the aid of torches and lamps. The lamps were pieces of stone with a handle on one end and a hollow carved at the other. A piece of animal fat was placed in the hollow and lit with an ember [source: Aujoulat ].
Along with paintings, we've found other things inside caves that give us hints about the lives of the cave dwellers. They made jewelry and engraved small items out of bone or ivory (and probably wood, though none of those survived). Some cave dweller cultures buried their dead with such items, suggesting some kind of religious belief or belief in an afterlife.
Some people still live in caves today. We'll find out why and where in the next section.­
What's a Troglodyte?
Troglodyte is a word sometimes used in a general way as a synonym for "caveman." It's a Greek word that, literally translated, means "someone who lives in a hole." There are historical and Biblical references to a tribe of people on the western coast of Africa who lived in caves, called Troglodyti or Troglodytae.

So, from these search results, I've gathered that the Lascaux cave paintings are a prime example of prehistoric art and hold significant importance for understanding the lives and cultures of early humans. These paintings, estimated to be around 15,000 to 20,000 years old, depict mainly animals and were found in a cave in southwestern France. The art is remarkable for its detail and the techniques used, suggesting a level of skill and possibly symbolic or ritualistic significance.

The discovery of these paintings in 1940 by four teenagers has provided invaluable insights into prehistoric human life. The images primarily feature animals, which might indicate their importance in the daily lives of these early humans, perhaps relating to hunting practices or spiritual beliefs.

However, the exposure to large numbers of tourists starting in 1948 led to deterioration of the paintings due to increased carbon dioxide and humidity. Consequently, the original cave was closed to the public in 1963 to preserve the artwork. Replicas of the cave and its paintings have been created to allow visitors to experience this historical site without risking further damage.

Studying prehistoric art like that found in Lascaux not only helps us appreciate the artistic capabilities of early humans but also provides clues about their social structures, beliefs, and interactions with their environment. It's a window into a time before written records, relying solely on the expressions left behind in these ancient artworks.

I think this gives me a solid foundation to answer the original question about the importance and significance of art during the prehistoric period. Prehistoric art, exemplified by the Lascaux cave paintings, is crucial because it offers a direct link to the thoughts, beliefs, and daily lives of our ancestors. It allows us to glimpse into a time before written language and to understand the development of human cognition and culture.
