Alright, so I've been given this question about how ableism affects men in dating. I have to think through this carefully because ableism is a complex issue that intersects with many other aspects of identity, including gender. I need to understand what ableism is, how it plays out in dating scenarios, and specifically how it impacts men.

First things first, I should define ableism. Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. It can manifest in various ways, from physical barriers that prevent access to services to attitudes that stereotype or devalue people based on their disabilities. In the context of dating, ableism could influence who is considered desirable, who has opportunities to meet potential partners, and how interactions play out between individuals.

Now, considering that the question specifies "men in dating," I need to think about how ableism might affect men differently than women or non-binary individuals. Gender roles and expectations probably play a significant part here. Society often has different standards and stereotypes for men and women, and these can intersect with ableism in complicated ways.

Maybe I should look into some statistics or studies that explore disability and dating. I suspect that there's research out there on the experiences of disabled people in romantic relationships, but I need to find sources that specifically address men.

Let me consider conducting a web search to gather more information. I can look for academic articles, personal essays, or advocacy group reports that discuss ableism in dating, particularly as it relates to men.

People Reveal What Dating With a Disability Is Like - ATTN:

People Share What Dating With a Disability Is Actually Like
April 27th 2016
By:
Carrie Poppy
In a world built for the able-bodied, disabled people face countless barriers in their everyday lives. Dating can be even more challenging, then, for the woman who has to spend every first date explaining how she “ended up” in a wheelchair or the man who receives pitying glances as he gives his date a rose. But many able-bodied daters may not know how to approach someone with a disability or what to avoid when asking a disabled person out.

According to the last U.S. Census statistics in 2012, one in five people Americans has a disability and more than half consider their disability severe, but physical and cognitive limitations don't stop those with disabilities from enjoying dating and having meaningful, lasting relationships.
We talked to five people with disabilities and asked them about dating ups and downs, tips for other daters with disabilities, and what able-bodied people can do differently in relationships.
Here’s what they said:
1. “Don't assume you're superior to us, because frankly, you're not... at all.”
Rivka Francher photography Rivka Francher photography
Name: Ariella Barker, 35
City: Charlotte, North Carolina
Disability: Spinal Muscular Atrophy
Job: Attorney, former law professor, Ms. Wheelchair NC 2014, and disability advocate.
How she approaches disability and dating:
In my opinion, we all have a disability in some way. Maybe it's not a disability that falls under the legal definition and maybe it's not visible. But I have dated men who were weaker in character than I am physically. Men who can't part from their mothers, men who cried like children at the drop of a hat, men who were one-minute men or selfish in bed, men who couldn't get a job, and grown men who still lived at home with their parents. They were more disabled than I ever was.
On dating able-bodied men:
The struggle is the sense of feeling inferior, particularly with regard to his family or friends. Hearing others praise your boyfriend for being such a saint to date the crippled girl and constantly trying never to burden my boyfriend with anything, for fear he would think that I'm a burden. [There were] men who saw me as someone they could use for a green card or my money. I even married a man I desperately loved, [who] immediately pressured me to apply for his green card and when he became impatient [waiting for it], emptied my bank account, maxed out my credit cards to the tune of $30,000, bought a one-way ticket back to his home country with my credit card, and ransacked my apartment while I was in a deposition one day.
On dating other people with disabilities:
Dating men with mobility impairments makes having physical contact a challenge. With a wheelchair or two coming in between our physical bodies and separating us in physical distance, cuddling and holding hands while watching a movie or riding on the bus are impossible. When I date someone, touch and affection are very important to me and these barriers make that nearly impossible. I have, however, dated men with other disabilities, like mental illness, and chromosomal defects.
Her message to able-bodied daters:
If you reject someone because of their disability, you could be rejecting the next Beethoven, who was deaf and made such beautiful music that we still play it today. Or Prince, who had epilepsy and was the sexiest man ever to live. Or the next Stephen Hawking, who has taught us more about the universe than any other human. Or the next Oscar Pistorius (sans the killing part) or the next Peter Dinklage, the hottest and most brilliant actor on "Game of Thrones." Don't assume you're superior to us, because frankly, you're not...at all.
2. “At least 90 percent of my relationship problems have had nothing to do with disability.”
Katinka Neuhof Katinka Neuhof
Name: Cara Liebowitz, 23
City: Long Island, New York
Disabilities: Cerebral palsy, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and asthma
Job: Freelance writer and blogger
Her biggest dating challenges:
Honestly? It’s the fact that I don’t drive. It’s really hard to maintain a romantic relationship (never mind sexual), when you hardly ever see the person. So whenever I make plans, I have to plan it with military precision: Where are we going? Which subway station is near there? Is it accessible? Will I have enough battery power in my scooter to get there and back? Even the closest relationships, geographically, can feel like long-distance relationships to me because it takes so much planning and so much energy.
Relationship experiences have been positive:
I have so many good memories from all of my relationships. I think my favorite memories are those memories where my disabilities and access needs were really accepted and accommodated. The first time I fell in front of one of my boyfriends, I was super nervous about how he’d react. People tend to panic when I hit the floor. But he said “I’m sorry I didn’t catch you,” and my heart just melted.
Her message to able-bodied people:
We are not your charity case. We are not your feel-good story. So many memes and news stories go around about non-disabled teens taking a disabled teen to prom. It makes me want to vomit — that’s not newsworthy! Kids go to prom! People date! But it’s presented as 'This non-disabled person could have gotten anyone, and they chose a disabled person.' It’s objectifying as all hell. We don’t need non-disabled people to do “special” things for us, so if you’re genuinely interested in us, great! But don’t act like you’re a saint for asking a disabled person out. Unless you want to get dumped — that’s a great way to get dumped.
The mantra wants disabled daters to know:
I’m invoking Elsa here, but “Let it go.” I’ve met so many disabled people who think there’s no way a non-disabled person will ever be interested in them or that a non-disabled person will never truly accept them, period. I used to feel like that, too. Just be yourself, disability and all. If you relax and stop worrying so much, you’ll find people who accept you for who you are. You’ll also find people who don’t but those people aren’t worth your time.
3. “ Disabled people should be acknowledged as viable partners and people capable of relationships.”
Name: Kate M., 26
City: Washington, D.C.
Disability: Spastic Cerebral Palsy
Job: Marketing/digital media professional, Twitter muse
Her biggest dating challenge:
I've been dating since I was about 22. I've been in one serious relationship (it lasted about a year) since I began dating. I am now single and got back into it after recovering from the breakup. A topic that comes up frequently is having to answer really strange questions about having a disability, like 'Can you have sex?' or 'Can you give oral sex?' There's still such negative stereotypes about people with disabilities having relationship or being sexual in any way.
The biggest surprise of dating others with disabilities:
I dated a guy with cerebral palsy for about a year. For some strange reason, I shied away from dating another person with a disability, as I thought it would be the only thing we would talk about. I was very wrong and it was one of the most fun and supportive relationships I'd ever been in.
On using dating apps:
It's always something different in terms of reaction. I'm currently on Tinder. I've met some great and not so great people on there. I used to not disclose my disability on dating profiles because I wanted to see the most honest reactions to my disability. Now, I fully disclose and it's taken a lot of the awkwardness out of the experience for me. It's been pretty good for the most part.
If you’re dating someone with a disability:
Be open. Ask questions. TALK. Learn their bodies. Communication starts on day one with a person with disability. It shouldn't be a job interview. Just be aware that there may be things that are done in a different way, and that's totally cool. Disabled people should be acknowledged as viable partners and people capable of relationships, if they want them. And take every stereotype you've ever heard about a woman with a disability and throw it away. At the end of the day, we're all just looking for a connection in some way, and that's just human.
4. “Be open to learning what you don't know.”
Fixed, the movie - fixedthemovie.com Fixed, the movie - fixedthemovie.com
Name: Lawrence Carter-Long, 48
City: Washington, D.C.
Disability: Cerebral Palsy
Job: Disabled rights activist, writer, and film historian.
His worst dating memory:
Wait staff asking my non-disabled date what I wanted for dinner — that killed the mood for sure. I also had one guy assume that my girlfriend was my daughter, I suspect in part because I was using my cane that day. That was awkward. For all of us.
When dating someone else with a disability:
The most annoying part was the condescending attitudes of other people who felt it was their business to react, publicly, by saying things like, 'Isn't it great you found each other?'
His thoughts for non-disabled daters:
Listen. Be open to learning what you don't know. Make sure the place you want to go to is accessible before asking somebody out. Relationships are complicated enough, and there is no need to make matters worse by showing up to a place with five flights of stairs or flashing lights for someone who has revealed to you that they have seizures.
Come into all relationships with an open mind:
Don't automatically refuse to date another disabled person, just because that's what people expect you to do. By the same token, don't assume that simply because someone else is disabled that you'll be a good match either. What else do you have in common? Movies? Music? Food? Talking about lack of access can get boring very quickly.
Bottom line? Relationships are work:
In my adult life, most of the issues that have emerged in my relationships have been more about who is doing the dishes than they've been about any kind of issue related to me having cerebral palsy. That is, I suspect, as it should be.
5. “My wheelchair is literally no different from a pair of eyeglasses.”
Adam Bouska - bouska.net Adam Bouska - bouska.net
Name: D’Arcee Charington Neal, 30
City: Washington, D.C.
Disability: Cerebral Palsy
Job: Correspondence Specialist
How he sees the dating scene:
Dating is by far the most stressful thing for most people, unless you’re Nick Jonas, and I’ll bet he still has problems. Being a triple minority is HARD. But I have to believe someone will see in me something that sometimes I have a really hard time seeing in myself. In the meantime, you just gotta pull yourself up and keep going.
His experiences have been varied:
I’ve met guys who are completely and totally open, guys who were apprehensive and curious, guys who were shamed into it, and people who were completely disgusted by it. I’m usually happy when I meet people that are generally OK with the idea, but most of time, people end up treating me like glass, afraid of what to do or say the entire time.
How his first relationship changed his perspective:
My whole life, I felt like I was never going to be desired. No one ever sees a person in a wheelchair and lusts after them. But my first boyfriend, Frank, loved everything about me, even the disability, which he thought made me unique. The first time we kissed was like something out of a Disney movie. It was very natural, and for the first time, I thought, “Oh. That’s what this feels like.”
Words that sting forever:
Several years ago, I was chatting with a group of friends, and the concept of dating disabled people came up. And one guy made a comment which has been burned into my memory: He said that no one was ever going to date me openly. He said being seen with me would be desperate and horrible, and that if someone were with me, it was only out of pity. When I told him that he should pray that he never ended up in a wheelchair, he told me that he would’ve killed himself, because he could never live with my disability and still be gay... being lonely forever.
And the worse part about this whole ordeal? None of the 10 people we were talking with said a word. No one defended me. No one refuted him. So I know a part of what he says, a lot of people believe, and that’s what hurts me the most.
Advice for non-disabled daters:
Give us a chance. My wheelchair is literally no different from a pair of eyeglasses. It’s a device that helps me with a natural function. Talk to people. Ask them (respectfully) and don’t make assumptions, because you’re often wrong.

The Challenges of Dating a Man in a Wheelchair
The Challenges of Dating a Man in a Wheelchair
Written by Chris Blank
16 November, 2018
In the 1978 movie "Coming Home," Sally Hyde, an able-bodied married woman, falls in love with Luke Martin, a wounded Vietnam veteran who uses a wheelchair. Their developing romance illustrates some of the challenges that occur with dating a man in a wheelchair. These challenges go beyond the logistical issues of access, and often touch nearly every aspect of the dating relationship.
Is This an Emergency?
If you are experiencing serious medical symptoms, seek emergency treatment immediately.
Diminished Financial Resources
Disabled men traditionally have a higher unemployment rate than able-bodied men, and those men who are employed often work in less prestigious positions with lower pay, according the Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation. During the economic crisis that began in 2007, able-bodied workers began competing for jobs formerly reserved for disabled workers, according to CNN. As the economy began moving out of recession in 2010, the rate of unemployment among disabled workers remained steady, according to Disability Scoop. In fact, some employment outlets geared toward disabled workers have taken an especially hard hit during the recession, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In the dating market, a man's desirability often hinges to some extent on his financial resources. During the financial crisis that began in 2007, many men began to scale back their dating expenses or stop dating altogether because of wage cuts or job loss. In some cases, men found that their appeal to women had diminished.

Physical Prowess
The documentary film "Murderball" shows disabled men playing a particularly rough variety of wheelchair rugby at paralympic competitions in Sweden and Athens. Disabled men are encouraged to develop their physical prowess as a means of preserving their sense of masculinity. Some disabled men develop what Women With Disabilities Australia called "supercrip" tendencies, placing extreme emphasis on developing physical strength in their arms and other areas of their bodies. Others redefine their masculinity around their earning power.
Nonetheless, many people view men who use wheelchairs as weak or a possible burden to potential dating partners. Aaron Broverman explains in the website Eyeweekly, "Isn't he supposed to be taking care of you, not the other way around? ... What will your friends think? How can you be expected to be constantly worried about someone else’s well-being so early in a relationship, when you’re barely sure about your own?"

Sexuality
A pivotal scene in the movie "Coming Home" shows Luke and Sally in a passionate sexual encounter. The scene illustrates that disabled people can and often do have active sex lives. However, there are often physical and mental adjustments, not least of which involve the attitudes of many able-bodied people that disabled men and women are or should be asexual. "I was not allowed to be a lover, not even with girls who got close to me. I was the friend they could trust because my sexuality was denied me by both sexes," Alan Holdsworth writes in New Internationalist 3.

The art of dating is already tough to master, but factor in the stress of how, when, and where to share your disability? Now it’s even more complicated.
It isn’t easy to figure out whether or not to disclose your disability in your profile, but the truth is, you shouldn’t have to be concerned over that. You should be able to enjoy the process of getting to know new people, having some back-and-forth banter, and assessing whether or not there’s potential for sparks to fly. Your disability does not define who you are, nor does it have to have any negative bearing on your love life.
RELATED: Dating as a Gay Man Is Tough, Having Cerebral Palsy Makes It Tougher
Whether you’re an amputee, physically disabled from an accident, or dealing with a life-long mental health condition, it’s understandable to want a partner who can empathize with you. That’s why it’s important to take note of this: Anyone can find and is deserving of love, regardless of their disability. You just need to start looking in the right places.
If you’re tired of the superficial swipe culture and you’re looking for a real connection with someone who can understand your life for all that it is, we’ve rounded up 8 apps and sites for disabled people that are a great place to start.
8 Dating Apps to Help People With Disabilities Find Their Perfect Match
Glimmer
The tagline of this dating site is “be proud of who you are.” Their mission? To create a more transparent and inclusive community for singles. While disclosure of your disability is not mandatory and can be modified at any time, Glimmer does offer the option to add it to your profile.
Geoffrey Anderson was inspired to launch Glimmer after noticing that his brother, someone with cognitive disabilities, wasn’t having much success on some of the more mainstream dating apps. Anderson told Buzzfeed that he didn't like the fact that people felt the need to omit their disabilities simply because having one is often stigmatized. Not everyone on Glimmer has a disability, but you can rest assured that those who have joined are clearly there because they’re accepting and open-minded to finding love in any form.
Once you’ve joined Glimmer, you can search members by what you’re looking for (friends, partners, other parents of people with disabilities), or by shared interests (music, travel, sports, gaming, etc.). You can also filter out members by their specific disability — post-traumatic stress disorder, quadriplegic, ADD, OCD, autism, or visual impairment.
Check out Glimmer
Disability Matching
Whether you’re looking for new friends or to spark up a romantic connection, this dating app is a viable option.
While Disability Matching is free to download, you’ll only get a limited number of messages per day. However, you can upgrade to a premium membership for a one-time fee of $12.99 to get unlimited messages and advanced search filters, keep a list of your favorite users, see who has viewed your profile, and add more exciting details to your profile. Upgrading also lets you set your profile match criteria so you can personalize your experience while setting your GPS location to search specifically for users who are nearby. You can even promote your own profile to the top of the results so you get seen by more members.
App Store reviews say it’s super simple and straightforward to use, from the time you sign up to the time you start messaging other users.
Check out Disability Matching
Prescription4Love
The founder of this site was inspired to launch it by his late brother, a man with Crohn’s disease who struggled with dating as a result.
“I thought if he met someone at a website where everyone had the same condition, there would be nothing to disclose,” he explains on the website. Prescription4Love went live in 2006 with 11 conditions, but it has grown significantly since to include 36 conditions, including deafness, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, diabetes, epilepsy, and even STDs.
Prescription4Love is totally free to use, and without even making a profile, you can do a quick search to see who’s online by entering criteria for what gender and age range you’re interested in, as well as your zip code. You can also select a specific disorder if you’d like to filter out members that way. The best way, of course, to spark something up is to create an account with a profile picture and some information about you.
Once you’ve found someone you’re interested in, you can add them to your favorites list or email them directly from the search results.
Check out Prescription4Love
Dating4Disabled
It only takes a minute or two to register for this dating site, aimed at helping people with any kind of disability meet like-minded people for relationships and friendships alike.
Dating4Disabled is free to use, and as a non-paying member, you get one free point per month that you can use to read an email from another user. By upgrading to a paid membership, though, you can send and read an unlimited number of messages per month. Upgrading costs $23.90 for one month, or you can pay three months upfront for $49.90, six months upfront for $69.90, or one year upfront for $120.
Dating4Disabled is one of the more expensive dating apps on this list, but that said, there does seem to be some benefits. For one, the site takes safety very seriously, using an advanced filtering system that blocks about 90% of illegitimate membership requests and automatically denies membership to suspicious applicants. All member profiles are scanned for fraudulent information, and public correspondence is monitored. The site also has an abuse report system and allows all users to “blacklist” certain members from contacting them if necessary.
Not to mention, the testimonials page is packed with heartwarming stories of people who found their perfect person on this particular site.
Check out Dating4Disabled
S’More
While this app isn’t exactly designed for the disabled, its whole philosophy ensures a less superficial experience. How so?
Well, rather than swiping through pictures, you’ll be presented with other information about your potential matches (like their interests, personality traits, education, etc.), to support decisions based on who they are rather than just what they look like. If you dig anything about a person’s profile, you can give them a “wink,” and after you’ve given them a certain amount, their profile photo will gradually come into focus. That way, you have enough time to form a connection before making any superficial judgments about whether or not they’re a good fit for you.
Completing your profile provides you with picks of the day on the home screen. As a free member, you can chat with up to eight people, and upgrading to a premium membership allows you to chat with up to 12. You’ll unlock the option to start a video chat once you’ve started conversing with someone, but for the first two minutes, the image is blurred. Video calls are limited to five minutes for unpaid members, but can be continued for a longer time for premium members.
Perhaps one of the coolest distinguishing features of S’More is that users who receive more positive scores for their behavior can increase their visibility and position on the app, providing incentive for just being an overall decent person here.
Right now, S’More is only active in New York City, Boston, Washington DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas, but there are plans for expansion soon.
Check out S’More
Ellie
If you prefer a Tinder-like swiping interface, look no further than Ellie.
“We've designed Ellie to be a uniquely safe space where everyone can feel accepted, and be themselves without being judged,” the company says on the App Store. But FYI, this one is only available for the iPhone, and is geared specifically toward people who are looking for a serious relationship.
Creating an account takes just a couple of minutes, and from there, you can refine your search further to make sure your matches meet what you’re looking for. In late 2020, Ellie updated the app with some new features, including the ability to see when your match is online, when they are typing, and whether messages have been read.
Check out Ellie
Dating Handicapped
There are two types of members on this site: those with disabilities, and those who don’t have a disability but are open to meeting anyone with one. Either way, once you’ve completed your profile and uploaded a picture, you can browse other members based on your location or other criteria (such as who’s currently active online). You can also filter users by age, location, interests, level of education, occupation, marital status, and specific disability.
You’ll need to upgrade to a premium account if you want to send or receive messages, add people to your list of favorites, or use the chat room. However, free users can create a profile, search for singles, and even send and receive “flirts” (a digital wink, so to speak) as part of a trial run of sorts.
“Honestly, I feel more comfortable and able to just be myself,” said one user in a review.
Check out Dating Handicapped
Whispers4U
A part of Dating Factory — one of the largest online dating networks in the world — this site claims to have thousands of members across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and all over Europe.
Part of what sets Whispers4U apart is that it offers live audio and video webcam chatting, as well as instant messenger features. On top of that, the company regularly checks for scammers and removes fraudulent profiles.
You can join the site for free, but upgrading does come with a number of perks. Free trial members can create and update their profile, browse the user base, send and respond to chat requests, send and receive winks, and add members to their “friends” list. Gold members, meanwhile, get the added benefit of sending and replying to an unlimited number of emails, viewing other members’ galleries, and using chat without any restrictions. As a VIP member, you also get highlighted in search results and galleries, get featured on members’ homepages and in their mailboxes, and get overall priority listing on the site.
Whispers4U claims that its matching software actively promotes members based on the quality of your profile, which means it’s definitely worth taking the extra time to flesh out your bio and add more than one photo.
Still not sure if the site is right for you? The success stories from members speak for themselves.

Dating With Asperger’s
January 22, 2015 by Matthew Rozsa 3 Comments
Dating with high-functioning autism isn’t easy, but it can be done.
___
There are two things you should know about me:
1. I have autism.
2. I am fascinated by dating culture.
If life in a society is a game (and make no mistake about it, it is), having Asperger’s forces you to play while learning two-thirds of the rules as you go along, even as everyone else knows them instinctively … and assumes you do too.
There is more of a connection between these two things than you might think. After all, there are few places in society where social rules are as crucially important and deeply entrenched as in the sphere of courtship, and being mildly autistic—or having Asperger’s Syndrome (AS), if you use the label as it was before the APA revised its diagnostic criteria last year—impairs your ability to comprehend nonverbal communication. Since people communicate through both verbal and nonverbal methods, those of us with AS are frequently at a disadvantage when attempting to socialize in our personal and professional lives. As I explained in an earlier article on my personal experiences with AS:

If life in a society is a game (and make no mistake about it, it is), having Asperger’s forces you to play while learning two-thirds of the rules as you go along, even as everyone else knows them instinctively … and assumes you do too.
Of course, one of the twists of having AS is that you tend to develop an outsider’s perspective on social rules in general, and the world of dating is no exception. I remember feeling disgust and then curiosity the first time someone explained the concept of “dating leagues” to me, or being stunned to learn that a girl who invites you to a hotel room to “just chill for a night” might actually mean the opposite of that, or that one who keeps postponing seeing you again is blowing you off. Others with AS have told me about similar stories, all linked by a common theme: We experience dating, as we do all other social rituals, as non-native bumblers, struggling to comprehend a culture of Byzantine complexity (in our eyes) and lacking the unassailable logic of being entirely direct, straightforward, verbalized, and emotionless (which is clearly reasonable … again, in our eyes). We also notice that …
♦◊♦
1. A lot of the “obvious” rules about dating are actually pretty arbitrary, so we aren’t instinctively aware of them.
I recently had a conversation with a friend who commented that people with AS should “just use common sense” when navigating the dating scene. Few pieces of advice are more frustrating to a mild autistic, since “common sense” in dating involves intuitively knowing the assumptions that others will make about you based on the cues you give off through what you say and do—which, of course, is precisely what AS causes you to miss. Regardless of whether two people are meeting on a prearranged date or striking up conversation in a casual setting, each one’s emotional response is determined by the assumptions they make based on a multitude of factors, from body language, facial expression, and eye contact to manner of dress, choice of conversation topics, and tone of voice (the same principle applies to online dating, although the cues are different).
While the merely awkward are at least subconsciously aware of these variables when they’re engaged in an interaction, someone with AS is wired to assume that (a) if someone finds us attractive, they will directly and immediately state it from the get-go and (b) they would want us to do likewise.
For better or worse, there is a music to dating, and while people with AS can understand the verses (and often have a distinctly straightforward way of expressing ourselves that can be refreshing), we struggle with the pitch, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, and texture. The end result is emotional tone deafness.
The idea that people communicate interest other than through what they actually say, or that even what someone says is fraught with layers and nuances—none of this occurs to us, since our instinct (which we assume the rest of the world shares) is to just say what we think and feel at length without any filters. If we learn it at all, it’s because we’ve had others bluntly explain to us the “rules” regarding these and other related matters. Similarly, many of the practices that are generally regarded as “obvious” parts of dating feel like intimidatingly strange concepts to us, such as “flirting” and “bantering,” creating an intangible “chemistry,” or spacing out how often you call, text, e-mail, and/or suggest hanging out with a dating prospect. For better or worse, there is a music to dating, and while people with AS can understand the verses (and often have a distinctly straightforward way of expressing ourselves that can be refreshing), we struggle with the pitch, rhythm, dynamics, timbre, and texture. The end result is emotional tone deafness.

2. It’s also difficult for us to come to grips with the emotion colloquially known as “love.”
There is a great quote by Bertrand Russell that helps illustrate what I mean:
Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.
This could be compared to speaking a different language, although that analogy would imply that individuals with AS could at least “speak” to others with the condition, when in fact AS manifests itself so differently from person to person that we are generally as unable to relate to each other as we are with the non-AS population.
Thankfully having AS certainly doesn’t inhibit one’s ability to desire or enjoy sexual intercourse, but the same cannot be said of cultivating the kinds of connections necessary to escape from the “existential loneliness” described by Russell. While this is partially due to the insecurity caused by disproportionately experiencing various forms of social rejection for years and years, even people with AS who received predominantly positive reinforcement in their early lives can still feel detached and isolated due to their inability to fully communicate with others. This could be compared to speaking a different language, although that analogy would imply that individuals with AS could at least “speak” to others with the condition, when in fact AS manifests itself so differently from person to person that we are generally as unable to relate to each other as we are with the non-AS population.

While the resulting sense of loneliness is not unique to the mildly autistic, as Russell’s quote itself makes clear, having AS significantly hinders one’s ability to cure it. Love requires not only the ability to have “loving” feelings for someone else, but also the ability to have those feelings reciprocated, create “chemistry” in a relationship and, ultimately, create a deep and mutual romantic bond. As explained by Canadian writer A. J. Mahari, people with AS may be able to ”feel a tremendous amount of empathy, compassion, sadness, happiness, and so forth,” but “it is not natural for us to communicate and to express our emotions in a social/relational context the way that it is second nature to NT’s [Neurotypicals, or people without AS]. It feels foreign. It is work and requires effort and energy.” Not only does this cause people with AS to often come off as emotionless and lacking in empathy, but it makes the process of falling in love almost alien to us—you can’t develop or identify chemistry without knowing how to give off and read cues, or feel truly connected to someone with whom you can only communicate by feigning mastery of a social language in which you’ll never be fluent.
This isn’t to say that there is no hope if you have AS. If nothing else, many of us (myself included) have learned through careful study, trial and error, and self-discipline how to socially “function” at the level of people who don’t have AS. It’s still possible to have sexual and/or committed relationships, and while the ordeal may be painful at times, it is undeniably worth it.
To quote Russell again: ”To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead.”

The Challenges of Dating a Man in a Wheelchair
Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images
Dating a man in a wheelchair might not present any additional -- or any fewer -- challenges than dating a man not in a wheelchair. A woman can have quite enjoyable times with a man who is in a wheelchair. The concerns that she may have will depend upon his level of autonomy, the extra planning that each date will involve and how prepared she is to handle the emotional and social issues that come along with being disabled. In addition to the added responsibilities, a woman will have some of the same concerns as she does when she is on a date with any other man -- the desire to be liked for who she is. Time and making sure he is comfortable is necessary to make sure the date goes smoothly.
Extra Responsibilities
Getting ready for a date with a man in a wheelchair will involve extra steps. Either the woman or her date will have to find out if the location is wheelchair-friendly. Although many men in wheelchairs might be quite autonomous, it may still be necessary for you to offer a helping hand. This may involve doing the driving, assisting him in getting in and out of the car, moving extra chairs, helping with his coat and holding the door open for him.
Efforts at Comfort
A woman might be worried about offending her date by offering too much assistance when he does not need it. From his point of view, he may feel belittled. She needs to be mindful of what an appropriate touch is and when to use it. Touching the man’s wheelchair or patting his head before he has become comfortable may be construed as condescending, says the United Spinal Association in its report, “Disability Etiquette.” Broaching the issue of his disability too soon or referring to it too frequently may be a turn off and might result in making him feel uncomfortable. For some wheelchair users, the reason for the disability and the daily experiences of using a wheelchair can be quite emotional to handle.
Prepare for Unwelcome Reactions
Going out with a man in a wheelchair may invite unwelcome attention and reactions. People tend to be uncomfortable with whatever is different, writes Tiffiny Carlson in the Huffington Post article, "10 Things to Never Say to a Person in a Wheelchair." Uncertainty as to how to act around a person in a wheelchair may cause some people to refuse to make eye contact, attempt to avoid the man or the couple or to speak over the man's head as if he is not there, says Rick Chillot in his article, "Do I Make You Uncomfortable?" on Psychology Today. The woman should prepare for the stares and remarks that people who are not sensitized to being with people who have disabilities might make. Although the man may be accustomed to these types of behavior from others, they may still hurt him and affect how much he enjoys his time on the date.
Venues May Be Limited
The types of dates a woman goes on with her partner will face some limitations simply because he is in a wheelchair. This may rule out some activities she'd usually enjoy on a date, like dancing and sporting activities. He will also be limited to places that are wheelchair accessible and have elevator lifts. Although she may prefer it, her date may not be able to walk her to her door at the end of the date or to stop by her place for a nightcap, if her house is not wheelchair accessible.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First up, there's an article from ATTN called "People Reveal What Dating With a Disability Is Like." It seems like they interviewed several people with disabilities about their experiences in dating. One of them is Ariella Barker, who has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. She talks about dating both able-bodied men and other people with disabilities. She mentions feeling inferior and dealing with people's perceptions, but also highlights that many able-bodied people reject disabled people without realizing the potential they have.

Another person interviewed is Cara Liebowitz, who has cerebral palsy, OCD, and asthma. She discusses the challenges of not being able to drive and the planning that goes into dates because of accessibility issues. But she also shares positive memories and encourages able-bodied people not to treat disabled people as charity cases.

Then there's Kate M., who dated another person with cerebral palsy and found it to be a supportive relationship. She emphasizes the importance of communication and not making assumptions based on disability.

Lawrence Carter-Long, a disability rights activist, shares his experiences, including instances where waitstaff assumed his non-disabled date would speak for him. He stresses the importance of treating disabled people as viable partners and not focusing solely on their disability.

Lastly, D’Arcee Charington Neal talks about being a triple minority—black, gay, and disabled—and the challenges that come with that, including people assuming he wouldn't be desired or that any relationship with him would be out of pity.

So, from these stories, it seems like dating with a disability involves dealing with societal attitudes, accessibility issues, and the need for open communication. But it's not all negative; there are also positive experiences and connections to be made.

Moving on to the next article from Healthfully, titled "The Challenges of Dating a Man in a Wheelchair." This seems more focused on the perspective of someone dating a man in a wheelchair, perhaps from an able-bodied standpoint.

The article mentions three main challenges: diminished financial resources, physical prowess, and sexuality.

First, it talks about how disabled men may have higher unemployment rates and lower-paying jobs, which can affect their desirability in the dating market. During economic downturns, this can be even more pronounced.

Second, there's the issue of physical prowess. Society often equates masculinity with physical strength, and a man in a wheelchair may not fit that stereotype. Some disabled men may overcompensate by focusing on developing upper body strength, while others redefine masculinity in terms of earning power.

Third, there's the topic of sexuality. There's a perception that disabled people are asexual, which isn't true. The article acknowledges that disabled people can have active sex lives, but there may be adjustments needed in attitudes and physical approaches.

This article seems to be addressing the misconceptions and challenges from the able-bodied partner's perspective.

Next, there's an article from AskMen about the best dating apps for people with disabilities. It lists several apps that cater to or are inclusive of people with disabilities, such as Glimmer, Disability Matching, Prescription4Love, Dating4Disabled, S'More, Ellie, Dating Handicapped, and Whispers4U. Each app has its own features and approaches to connecting people with disabilities.

This suggests that there's a recognized need for dating platforms that are accessible and inclusive, and that there are options available for people with disabilities to find partners who may understand their experiences.

Another article is from the Good Men Project, titled "Dating With Asperger's." This focuses specifically on dating experiences of men with Asperger's Syndrome, which is now considered part of the autism spectrum.

The author discusses how having Asperger's affects his ability to navigate social rules and nonverbal communication, which are crucial in dating. He notes that people with Asperger's may not intuitively understand the "music" of dating—the nuances of body language, flirting, and building chemistry.

He also talks about the difficulty in understanding and expressing emotions, which can impact forming deep connections. Despite these challenges, he emphasizes that it's possible to have fulfilling relationships with effort and self-awareness.

This article provides insight into how a specific type of disability, affecting social interaction and communication, can influence dating experiences.

Finally, there's an article from Our Everyday Life called "The Challenges of Dating a Man in a Wheelchair." It outlines extra responsibilities that a woman might have when dating a man in a wheelchair, such as ensuring accessibility and possibly assisting with mobility.

The article also mentions the need to be sensitive to the man's comfort and avoiding actions that could be seen as patronizing. It advises preparing for potential negative reactions from others who may be uncomfortable around disabilities.

Additionally, it notes that certain activities may be off-limits or require adaptation, and that the choice of dating venues may be more limited due to accessibility constraints.

Overall, these sources paint a picture of dating with a disability as involving both unique challenges and opportunities for connection. There are societal attitudes to navigate, practical considerations to manage, and sometimes a need to educate others about what it means to date a disabled person.

From these searches, I can see that ableism affects men in dating in several ways. First, there are stereotypes and prejudices that can lead to discrimination, where able-bodied individuals may avoid dating disabled men due to misconceptions about their capabilities or desirability.

Second, there are practical barriers, such as accessibility issues, which can make dating more logistically challenging for disabled men and their partners.

Third, there's the emotional toll of dealing with societal attitudes and potential rejection based on disability status.

However, despite these challenges, many disabled men find fulfilling relationships and advocate for greater acceptance and understanding in the dating world.

I think the key takeaway is that ableism in dating affects disabled men in multifaceted ways, but with awareness, inclusivity, and a willingness to challenge stereotypes, these barriers can be overcome.

\boxed{\text{Ableism in dating affects men with disabilities through stereotypes, accessibility issues, and emotional challenges, but awareness and inclusivity can help overcome these barriers.}}
