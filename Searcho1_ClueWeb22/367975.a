I'm trying to understand why animal testing is considered ineffective. I know that animal testing has been used for a long time in medical research and product safety testing, but there must be reasons why some people think it's not effective. Maybe it's because animals aren't exactly like humans, so the results might not always apply to us. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand what animal testing is. It's when scientists use animals to test new drugs, chemicals, or procedures before they try them on humans. The idea is to see if these things are safe and effective without risking human lives. Animals like mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys are commonly used because their biological systems are similar to ours.

But, similar doesn't mean the same. Different species can react differently to the same substance. For example, something that's safe for mice might be harmful to humans. There have been cases where drugs passed animal tests but still caused problems in human trials. So, maybe that's one reason why animal testing is seen as ineffective—it doesn't always predict human responses accurately.

Another thing I've heard is that animals in labs are often kept in unnatural environments, which might affect their health and how they respond to tests. For instance, if a mouse is stressed in its cage, that stress could influence the test results. So, perhaps the conditions in which the animals are tested aren't ideal, leading to less reliable data.

Also, there might be more ethical considerations here. Some people argue that animal testing is cruel and unnecessary, but since the question is about effectiveness, I should focus on that aspect. Still, if animals are suffering or not being treated well, it could impact the quality of the research.

I should probably look up some statistics or studies that compare animal test results with human outcomes. Maybe see how often animal tests correctly predict human reactions. That would give me a better idea of their effectiveness.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

47 Must-Read Animal Testing Statistics (2022 UPDATE)
47 Must-Read Animal Testing Statistics (2022 UPDATE)
by Boriana Slabakova
Last updated:
February 18, 2022
Animal testing statistics confirm that many of the products we use were tested on animals. However, the general public isn’t aware of what precisely happens to animals in laboratories. Nor do they know how many animals are used.
Keep reading to discover more about what you can do to make a change!
Top 10 Most Important Animal Testing Statistics You Must Know
90% of new drugs don’t even make it to patients.
560,000 experiments have invoked moderate to severe suffering in animals.
It takes nearly a decade to undergo all the tests to register a single pesticide.
47% of people accept animals in research for medical purposes.
The Animal Welfare Act doesn’t protect 95% of the animals being tested on.
The cost of registering one pesticide is $3 million.
Yearly, over $12 billion in taxpayer money is wasted on research on animals.
By 2025 there will be a 30% reduction in studies using animal testing.
56% of animal experimentation is for basic research.
75,000 animals are killed yearly by just one animal testing company.
Below, you’ll find the most critical but frightening statistics to better understand how extensive the use of animals for research and testing has become.
General Facts About Animal Testing
It’s easy to overlook what happens behind the closed doors of laboratories and enjoy the products, medication, and cosmetics from this research.
Unfortunately, we don’t know plenty due to the lack of transparency and the inaccurate counts of the animals used in laboratories.
Even the small proportion of animals being tested on is more than enough to make us stop in our tracks and think about the products we use daily.
1. 90% of new drugs don’t even make it to patients.
(NIH)
Animal testing facts reveal the unfortunate truth. Regardless of the numerous tests done on animals for new drugs and medicines, less than 10% are actually considered effective and safe. This is because animal trials fail to deliver quality results in people.
The reason for these failed trials is that 55% aren’t effective in treating the condition. In comparison, 30% have shown signs that they’re toxic to humans, which couldn’t be confirmed in animal tests.
2. Almost 560,000 experiments are verified to have invoked moderate to severe suffering in the animals being tested on.
(HSI)
Animal experimentation stats show that over half a million experiments cause pain in animals.
In the UK, the Home Office describes mild suffering as experiencing short-term distress or moderate pain. Severe suffering is defined as experiencing long-lasting distress or pain.
In many cases, these animals experience this type of pain or distress throughout the trial, lasting anywhere from several days to several months or until the animal dies.
3. In the case of cosmetic animal testing, statistics suggest that 115 million animals worldwide are used for testing every year.
(Cruelty Free International)
Different countries have different laws regarding the animals that are counted for animal research. For example, in many countries, rodents and rabbits aren’t counted toward the final numbers.
Thus, recent research by Cruelty Free International and the Dr. Hadwen Trust can only estimate the number of animals used for experimentation each year.
4. More than $420 million has been invested in developing non-animal testing methods as per the stats for animal testing.
(ChemicalWatch)
Over 40 years, Procter & Gamble has made significant investments in finding alternatives to animal testing. Their main competitor, Unilever, has also started pushing for a global ban on animal testing.
P&G is the first in the beauty sector’s top 10 to actively support legislative reform that prohibits animal testing for cosmetics.
The European Parliament voted to adopt a resolution that will call for the global ban of animal testing by 2023, with the practice already banned in the EU since 2013.
5. It takes nearly a decade to undergo all the tests necessary to register a single pesticide.
(HSI)
Facts on animal testing show that the required animal studies for registration with the US Environmental Protection Agency result in animals’ torture for a prolonged period.
It also entails the testing on and subsequent deaths of approximately 10,000 animals. Among them are mice, rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, and even thousands of dogs.
Unfortunately, even after such extensive testing, much of the research doesn’t reach approval. The deaths of these animals reap no results.
6. One critical change to cosmetic animal testing, the facts show, was the Australian Industrial Chemicals Act, which passed the Senate in 2017.
(SMH)
Although this doesn’t prohibit all animal testing for cosmetics, it bans any results from data gathered via animal testing after July 1, 2018.
This may not mean that testing on animals for cosmetics will ultimately end. However, the act will limit and reduce it dramatically.
7. Animal testing facts and statistics reveal that 41% of people in the UK think organizations that engage in animal testing are secretive.
(Ipsos)
Currently, only 32% of people feel they work in organizations that engage in animal testing is necessary for human health. In general, there’s minimal transparency about what happens behind the closed doors of animal testing facilities.
This leads to people feeling uneasy about what they don’t see. Without knowing what these companies are doing and what these tests uncover, it’s easy to understand why more people prefer alternative options to animal testing.
Animal Testing Pros and Cons: Facts and Stats
As much as we would like to say that animal testing is all bad, there are some benefits of animal testing, and these facts clearly show it.
There are many animal testing cons. But, in the past, it’s proven to be very beneficial for humans, the environment, and animals as well.
Animal testing articles show that scientists have found cures and treatments for major diseases and illnesses that otherwise would not have been possible through animal testing.
This, however, was at a time when no possible alternatives were available. Today many experiments do not necessarily require animals. Many other tests on animals have proven to be useless due to their inaccuracy.
8. 47% of people accept animals in research for medical purposes.
(Speaking of Research)
Animal testing statistics for 2021 show the number is the same as when individuals have asked the same question a couple of years ago. However, more people nowadays oppose animal testing compared to a couple of years ago.
For the most part, people aren’t aware of precisely what happens behind the closed doors in the labs, and most likely, they prefer it that way.
9. Interesting facts about animal testing reveal that mice’s lifespan is 2–3 years.
(The Jackson Laboratory)
This makes them necessary for life cycle studies that are otherwise impossible in human testing.
The average lifespan of a human can be anywhere between 70 and 80 years of age. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for researchers to study and experiment with how a drug or chemical will affect a human’s life cycle.
This is why the use of mice is very effective—their shorter lives provide the opportunity to do long-term research across an entire life cycle.
10. One of the significant animal testing facts reminds us that scientists have found treatments for numerous diseases by testing on animals.
(Penny Saviour)
As painful as the numbers are to read about animals’ treatment and death during animal testing, some unarguable results couldn’t be achieved without it.
Many scientists confirm that there wouldn’t be vaccines without animal testing medications for heart disease, cancer treatment, and even life-saving transplants.
Approximately 70% of the Nobel Prize winners for medicine and physiology made their discoveries through animal research.
11. Stats on animal testing show how the polio vaccine, which was initially tested on animals, vastly reduced the disease’s occurrence rate.
(WHO)
Through animal testing, scientists were able to develop this life-saving vaccine. There were approximately 350,000 occurrences of polio in 1988. With the vaccine’s help, this number was reduced to just 33 cases of polio in 2018.
The cases continue to go down with every passing year.
12. The Covid-19 pandemic showed that scientists can skip animal testing.
(Procon)
Animal experimentation statistics show that thousands of animals endure incredible pain during testing. Researchers were able to test and develop efficient vaccines with the help of human volunteers.
13. Stats about animal testing reveal that the Animal Welfare Act doesn’t protect 95% of the animals being tested on.
(Procon)
The majority of the animals used for research are birds, fish, mice, and rats, none of which are protected by the AWA.
Statistics reveal that just over 820,000 animals used for research are covered by the AWA. According to this percentage, approximately 25 million animals are left unprotected, leading to potential abuse and mistreatment.
There is also very little transparency about the treatment of these animals.
Statistics on Animal Testing Costs
The amount of money that goes toward animal testing and experiments is jaw-dropping, to say the least. Unfortunately, most of the money invested doesn’t lead to many new results. Most of the time, the final product doesn’t get approved.
Most people don’t know that most animal testing done for educational purposes is paid for by taxpayers.
14. The cost of registering one pesticide is $3 million.
(HSI)
Animal testing stats show that it takes nearly a decade, thousands of animals’ deaths, and money to register a pesticide.  The cost of registering a single pesticide with the US Environmental Protection Agency costs millions of dollars.
In many cases, the money and animals’ lives lost while attempting to register a single pesticide are fruitless—a minimal number pass the necessary requirements and get registered.
15. Every year, more than $12 billion in taxpayer money is wasted on research that involves animals.
(PETA)
Statistics of animal testing show the University of Utah gets, on average, $500,000 to induce heart attacks in dogs. Northeastern University receives some $300,000 to inject hamsters with steroids and make them fight.
And that’s not all. Oregon Health and Science University gets a staggering $1.6 million to turn monkeys and mice into alcoholics. In comparison, the NIH receives $1.7 million to induce depression in baby monkeys.
Furthermore, PETA revealed that the government could provide $210 a month to food-insecure seniors with this money. They could also hire additional 300,000 teachers or provide $715 a month to 1.4 million homeless veterans.
Animal Testing Statistics in the US
The US continues to use animals for experimentation, even though they’re also the leaders in finding the best alternatives to such cruel testing.
There is an exciting contrast between the companies that test on animals regardless of the available alternatives and the companies conscious of animal cruelty that have already taken steps to eliminate it altogether.
16. Statistics about animal testing show that as many as 100 million animals die from this annually in the US alone.
(PETA)
The animals suffer through many experiments before dying in cruel food, drug, cosmetics, and chemical tests. These numbers include the animals that die in dissection and classroom biology experiments.
In many cases where animals have been used, there are already advanced non-animal experimentation options available.
They’re proven to save time and money and offer more educational value while reducing animal suffering and death.
17. Recent animal testing statistics show that 52% of Americans feel testing on animals for medical purposes isn’t acceptable.
(PETA)
A survey has revealed that regardless of the numerous alternatives available, close to half of Americans still feel that testing on animals is morally acceptable. Conversely, 52% feel that testing on animals is ethically wrong.
18. 171.406 guinea pigs were used for animal research in the US, as animal testing facts show.
(Speaking of Research)
These numbers can’t be 100% accurate due to the lack of transparency in many testing facilities. The statistics further reveal that the second most common animal used for testing in the US in 2018 was the rabbit, with 133,634 animals.
All other AWA-covered species totaled 182,580. Sheep had the lowest numbers, at 13,000. Sadly, cats were also the victims of testing at 18,619.
19. In 2020, California used more cats for research than any other state.
(Procon)
Statistics for animal testing show the state abused 1,682 cats for testing in 2020. Moreover, Ohio used the most guinea pigs — 35,206. Finally, Massachusetts used the most dogs and primates — 6,771 and 11,795, respectively.
Many people think animal testing is only on rabbits and rats in cages. Still, cats, dogs, and primates are regularly used to test medications, cosmetics, chemicals, and more.
20. In the case of cosmetic testing on animals, statistics reveal that if the animal isn’t killed during testing, it’s killed when the experiment ends.
(Humane Society)
When it comes to cosmetic testing on animals, articles show a grim picture.
Not only do animals suffer through these experiments, but if they do survive, they’re then killed through decapitation, neck-breaking, or asphyxiation. No pain relief is provided throughout the experiments, nor when they’re killed.
There’s no protection for most animals. Many don’t even count toward the high numbers of animals used for experimentation since they aren’t covered by the Animal Welfare Act.
21. When engaging in animal testing, statistics from 2019 reveal that these tests’ failure rate is greater than 90%.
(Green Garage Blog)
This failure rate is across all industries, which includes cosmetics. In the pharmaceutical industry, the failure rate is at least 96%.
This reveals that there are little to no results coming out of thousands of animals’ continuous torture and death yearly, with only a tiny percentage of the products reaching the market.
Regardless of these staggering statistics, the United States, and many other countries, still feel the need to use all types of animal testing, ignoring many other non-animal alternatives.
22. The US is among the leading users of animals for testing.
(Cruelty Free International)
Animal testing statistics from 2020 reveal China is a worldwide leader, with over 20 million animals known for research and testing. Japan and the US are close behind, with 15 million animals used for experiments.
In the European Union, the UK, Germany, and France are leaders in animal testing.
23. The EPA notes that by 2025 there will be a 30% reduction in the number of studies using animal testing.
(NY Times)
Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. Administrator, believes animal testing should be banned. His goal is to eliminate animal testing using mammals by 2035, with some case-based approvals.
The agency has also promised to invest at least $4.25 million into developing alternatives to using animals to test chemicals.
Animal Testing Statistics Worldwide
On a global scale, animal testing is challenging to control and track. Many countries have different requirements for the allowed number of animals in labs, animal protection laws, and principles.
One thing’s for sure, the numbers aren’t going down. In fact, they’re increasing, even with the many available alternatives that can make testing on animals obsolete.
With a worldwide ban on animal testing for cosmetics in the works by the EU and more companies becoming concerned with animal rights, there’s hope yet.
24. Statistic of animal testing reveals no evident decline in the number of animal experiments.
(Cruelty Free International)
Although many alternatives have been found, and many tests are proven useless, animal testing has not declined. In China, the use of animals for experimentation has increased.
And in Europe, the numbers are nearly the same as they were during the 1980s and 1990s.
25. 2,785 dogs and 1,306 monkeys were used for dose toxicity tests in Europe in one year alone.
(Cruelty Free International)
The animals are given doses of drugs that cause many ongoing side effects from two weeks to nine months.
Nevertheless, scientists against animal testing have revealed facts that prove these tests are ineffective in showing drug toxicity levels in humans.
26. In 2018, 123 skin irritation tests were done on rabbits in the UK.
(Cruelty Free International)
There are many experiments for toxicological testing that have approved non-animal alternatives.
However, these animal-based tests were still being conducted in the UK in 2018, with 40 eye irritation tests, 10,275 acute lethal toxicity tests, and 638 pyrogenicity experiments on live rabbits.
This proves that governments and companies overlook the available alternatives and still opt for harmful and inhumane testing on animals.
27. 56% of animal experimentation is for basic research.
(Cruelty Free International)
Each year, about 1.8 million experiments in the UK use animals. Animal experiments facts show that approximately one million are for basic research. University researchers and their curiosity drive the majority of these.
As more than 50% of all the tests are done in universities, most of the funding comes from taxpayers. As per these statistics, only 13% of the experiments done on animals are actually required by regulators.
28. 85% of the monkeys used for experiments in the EU were imported from outside the region.
(Cruelty Free International)
Specifically, most primates used for experimentation in 2018 were imported from Africa and Southeast Asia.
29. 75,000 animals are killed yearly by just one animal testing company.
(About Animal Testing)
The leading animal testing company, Huntingdon Life Sciences, kills the most animals annually. Statistics for animal testing show that ff the animals killed, approximately 87% are rodents.
30. 80% of the primates used for experiments in the US are brought in from China.
(CNBC)
The new 15% levy that the Trump administration imposed on all Chinese imports will significantly affect current animal experimentation on primates.
While many US researchers claim their research is impossible without primates, there are significant non-animal testing advancements that they’ll be forced to use.
31. Statistics on animal testing reveal that Germany typically uses 2.8 million animals for research.
(Doctors Against Animal Experiments)
Year after year, these numbers are similar and put Germany in a close second to the UK. Regardless, the numbers are slightly lower than they were in 2014 when Germany used 3.3 million animals.
As with most other countries, Germany primarily uses rodents for testing, but there are also cats and dogs. The government has also increased the number of experiments using monkeys from 2,462 to 3,472.
32. Animal experiments facts show that 12.1 million tests on animals are performed yearly in Europe.
(About Animal Testing)
It’s challenging to determine the exact numbers due to a lack of transparency and not all animals being accounted for. So, Britain is considered the leader with nearly 3 million animal experiments yearly.
In close second comes France with the cosmetics company L’Oréal still testing its cosmetics on animals. France also presents the most significant opposition to the expected ban on cosmetics testing.
33. In 2018, 202,000 animals were used in medical tests just in Britain.
(Cruelty Free International)
Many countries still have laws and regulations requiring animal testing before clinical trials can begin on humans for medication.
Animal experimentation stats reveal the number of animals used in Britain is just the tip of the iceberg. It doesn’t include the millions of more animals used to conduct medical research that’s more basic in nature.
Approximately 81% of experiments on monkeys and 60% of trials on dogs in 2018 were to test human medication.
34. PETA reveals that more than 100 million lab animals are used for research in the United States.
(PETA)
These numbers may seem extreme, but animal testing cosmetics facts reveal that even they’re not showing the real picture.
Animal abuse facts show they’re only a small fraction of the actual number of animals used because approximately 95% of the exact total isn’t covered by the AWA.
There will never be a way to really see the depth of animal abuse or the number of animal deaths due to the lack of transparency and counting restrictions.
35. 3.52 million procedures were done on animals in the United Kingdom in 2018 alone.
(Pharma Times)
Stats on animal testing reveal this was the first extreme decrease since 2007. 2018’s numbers included 1.1 million tests on mice, 170,665 tests on rats, 146,680 tests on birds, 11,159 tests on rabbits, 297,881 tests on fish, and 6,445 tests on guinea pigs.

FAQ
36. What is animal testing?
Testing on an animal usually consists of an experiment where an animal undergoes injections, forced feeding, inhalation, or consumption of toxic chemicals.
And many other procedures are likely to cause them distress, pain, suffering, long-lasting harm, and ultimately, death.
All this is done to research medicines, cosmetics, and other products to determine their toxicity, effectiveness, and potential danger to humans.
37. What percentage of animals survive animal testing?
Recent statistics from Israel reveal that only 3% of the animals used for testing survive the lab experiments. Unfortunately, animals that survive are either used for new trials or are killed when the research is over.
Once scientists get what they need, they have no use for the animals. Percentages are similar in other countries as well.
38. What percentage of animal tests fail?
The National Institutes of Health recognize that approximately 95% of all drug safety experiments on animals fail in human trials. Furthermore, 90% of all necessary research, including animal testing, doesn’t lead to any effective therapies for humans.
39. How many animals die from animal testing each year?
It’s near impossible to give an exact number of how many animals die yearly around the globe due to animal testing and experimentation. It’s estimated that more than 100 million die annually in the United States alone.
40. Why should we not use animals for testing?
Although there’ve been many advances in medicine with animal testing in the past, today, there are many non-animal experimentation alternatives for most of the current research done today.
These alternatives are practical, proven, and less expensive, and they don’t harm animals.
41. How do animals benefit from animal testing?
With the help of animal experimentation, there have been many advances in veterinary medicine as well. There’s been a significant advancement in various life-extending treatments for pets, wildlife, and many endangered species.
42. Why is animal testing important?
As unfortunate as the outcomes are for the animals themselves, there are essential benefits in using them for research.
Where alternatives aren’t available, animals are used as models for studying diseases, the development of drugs and treatments for many conditions, and protecting people, other animals, and the environment.
43. When did animal testing start?
Animal testing started as early as the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE by the Greeks. The first scientists are known to perform experiments on animals being Erasistratus and Aristotle.
44. Is animal testing still happening?
Currently, 40 countries worldwide have banned cosmetics testing on animals. The EU Parliament is urging for a complete worldwide ban on cosmetics testing.
Although the US passed a ban on cosmetics testing in 2015, it still hasn’t been implemented.
Japan and China still allow animal testing for cosmetics. At the same time, France is the most prominent opponent to the expected world ban.
45. Do animals feel pain during animal testing?
Sadly — yes. More than half a million experiments in a year cause animals pain. Over half a million experiments cause pain in animals.
What’s worse is that these animals experience high levels of pain or distress throughout the experiment. These painful experiments last for days, months, or until the animal dies.
46. Why are animals killed after testing?
Not all animals are killed after testing. Some are used again for other experiments, while others get adopted. However, many of them are euthanized.
Just like they need experiment information while the animals are alive, scientists also need information from their organs.
47. Why is animal testing cruel?
There are tons of reasons why animal testing is bad. Animals are confined to small cages and deliberately made sick with toxic chemicals, and infected with diseases.
These animals typically endure lots of pain and stress, and we don’t even have to explain why this is cruel.
Conclusion
It’s a fact there’ve been many positive things that came out of animal testing. But, today, more and more people, companies, and governments are seeing that most testing may be obsolete.
Many available alternatives can quickly reduce animal testing statistics to a minimum and stop animal cruelty in labs.
Regardless of how one looks at animal testing, it’s easy to see that there’s room for improvement. As a whole, we need to find more alternative options to drastically reduce these animals’ suffering.

11 Animal Testing Statistics The Will Blow Your Mind | PETA
11 Shocking Animal Testing Statistics That Are Hard to Swallow
What have humans gained from animal testing? Are we getting closer to finding a cure for HIV, cancer, and other diseases through animal experiments? These 11 animal testing statistics will help you understand how animal experiments (don’t) work and what we’re (not) getting out of them.
1. Each year, more than 110 million animals—including mice, frogs, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, fish, and birds—are killed in U.S. laboratories.
Experimenters force animals to inhale toxic fumes, immobilize them in restraint devices, drill holes into their skulls, mutilate their brains, and burn their skin and eyes—and if the animals don’t die in the process, they’re killed afterward. Whether it’s for biology lessons, medical training, curiosity-driven experiments, or chemical, drug, food, or cosmetics testing , these animals are confined to barren cages, socially isolated, and psychologically traumatized.
Covance Cruelty
2. Ninety-five percent of all drugs that are shown to be safe and effective in animal tests fail in human trials.
This stat comes straight from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the government agency that funnels billions of our taxpayer dollars into these reckless experiments. NIH has noted that the drugs fail in humans because they either don’t work or are dangerous. Because animal trials are so unreliable, they make human ones more risky.
Try our augmented reality experience to discover the hidden cost of animal experiments.
Start the Experience
3. Ninety-nine percent of the animals used in laboratories aren’t covered by federal animal protection laws.
It’s as if the government were saying, “I’m sorry, but you’re just not animal enough” to the tens of millions of rats, mice, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians who constitute 99% of the animals used in laboratories yet are excluded by the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) and therefore denied even the most basic consideration. However, even animals who are supposedly “protected” under the AWA are still allowed to be burned, shocked, poisoned, isolated, starved, restrained, made addicted to drugs, and brain-damaged. No test—no matter how painful or trivial—is illegal. And pain relief isn’t required.
© Doctors Against Animal Experiments
4. Between 2015 and 2019, more than 300,000 animals covered under the AWA were subjected to painful experiments without pain relief.
Rabbits haven’t received any pain relief in the Draize eye and skin irritation and corrosion tests since they started in the 1940s. In these tests, a substance is dripped into rabbits’ eyes or smeared onto their shaved skin, leaving them to suffer from inflammation, ulcers, bleeding, irritated and cloudy eyes, blindness, redness, swelling, discharge, and hemorrhaging.
5. A 2009 survey found that mice and rats used in invasive, painful surgeries were only provided with post-operative pain relief about 20% of the time.
The survey found that mice and rats who were subjected to skull surgeries, burn experiments, spinal surgeries, and other horrors rarely received post-procedural pain relief. Imagine someone drilling open your skull to expose your brain but not giving you so much as an Advil.
6. More than 93% of experimental cancer drugs failed in the first phase of human clinical trials after testing “successfully” on animals.
The survey was based on nearly 4,500 cancer drugs developed between 2003 and 2011. Artificially inducing a condition in a healthy individual of a different species who is confined and isolated in stressful, unnatural conditions and then applying the results to naturally occurring diseases in humans is not only unethical but also ridiculous. Even animal experimenters acknowledge that the extreme distress that these animals endure jeopardizes the results.
We’ve been handicapped by the fact that we have been studying diseases in animals that don’t really exist in animals. Mice … don’t get schizophrenia. They don’t get Alzheimer’s disease.
—Dr. Christer Nordstedt, Eli Lilly’s vice president of neuroscience research
7. The chemicals that cause cancer in rats only cause it in mice 46% of the time.
If extrapolating from rats to mice is so unreliable, imagine the inefficiency of applying results from mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys to humans. Richard Klausner, former head of the National Cancer Institute, said, “The history of cancer research has been a history of curing cancer in the mouse. We have cured mice of cancer for decades and it simply didn’t work in humans .”
8. One hundred HIV vaccines have been successful in animal experiments—100% of them failed to protect humans sufficiently.
In one case, an HIV vaccine that was shown to be effective in monkeys failed in human clinical trials because it didn’t prevent people from developing AIDS, and some believe that it made them more susceptible to it. According to a report in The Independent, one conclusion was that “testing HIV vaccines on monkeys before they are used on humans, does not in fact work.”
Monkeys used for experiments are often housed inside tiny and virtually barren cages for their entire lives, deprived of everything that’s natural and important to them.
9. Every year in the U.S., NIH blows about 47% of research funding on animal experimentation.
Approximately 47% of NIH-funded research involves animals, and in 2020, the agency budgeted nearly $42 billion for research and development—that’s $19.6 billion spent on animal experiments. But for what? Do you know of any cures for multiple sclerosis, West Nile virus, or muscular dystrophy? Well, there aren’t any. A 2014 review paper co-authored by a Yale School of Medicine professor in The BMJ documented the overwhelming failure of experiments on animals to improve human health, concluding that “the public’s continuing endorsement and funding of preclinical animal research seems misplaced.”
10. Currently, 52% of U.S. adults oppose the use of animals in scientific research.
A Pew Research Center poll found that the majority of American adults oppose the use of animals in scientific research, and other surveys suggest that the misguided folks who do support it only feel that way because they wrongly believe that it’s necessary. In an article published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that medical treatments developed for animals rarely translated to humans and warned that “patients and physicians should remain cautious about extrapolating the finding of prominent animal research to the care of human disease … poor replication of even high-quality animal studies should be expected.”
11. Since 2017, PETA has had nearly 150 victories for animals used in experiments.
Our victories include helping engineers develop a new ventilator for COVID-19 patients without animal testing, working with the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration to eliminate animal tests for health marketing claims for foods, persuading Suave to go cruelty-free, and getting pharma giant Bristol Myers Squibb and others to ban near-drowning tests. PETA’s work to end animal experiments—backed by the support of our more than 6.5 million members and supporters worldwide—is saving countless animals.

*****
In NIH’s most recent five-year plan, the agency stated that “animal models often fail to provide good ways to mimic disease or predict how drugs will work in humans, resulting in much wasted time and money while patients wait for therapies.” Animal experiments are not a good indicator of drug responses in humans or any species other than the one being exploited. Penicillin is the backbone of human antibiotics, yet it kills guinea pigs! Aspirin kills cats and causes birth defects in rats, mice, guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys, and morphine, a depressant in humans, stimulates goats, cats, and horses.
All these animal testing statistics can be boiled down to just one: Animal experiments are speciesist—making them unacceptable 100% of the time. They don’t work, and even if they did, they’d still be unacceptable. Torturing sensitive beings isn’t OK, even if someone’s pretending it’s for science or medicine —it’s as simple as that.

47+ Horrifying Animal Testing Statistics
By
Emma
-
April 14, 2022
Animal testing statistics are horrifying. They can shock you even if you don’t care much about this issue. It’s so sad that it can make you want to look away and forget about it, but that won’t stop animal testing.
Knowing more about this issue helps you make better-informed decisions about the products you buy and use daily.
Little Known Animal Testing Facts
Official US statistics don’t count 99% of the tested animals.
Over 100 million animals are tested in the US yearly.
Laws protecting animals from testing don’t include smaller rodents, birds, and amphibians.
One test can use as many as 120,000 animals.
Official US animal testing polls don’t count 92% of the animals used for medical testing.
Around 10 million animals are killed in US classrooms every year.
US government bodies don’t regulate labels stating a product has not been tested on animals.
Every year, 115 million animals are used in experiments worldwide.
Chinese law requires cosmetic companies to conduct animal testing.
Stats on Animal Testing
Animal testing facts and statistics can be terrible to read, but it’s necessary to inform yourself.  Animals don’t have a voice, so the only way to make a real change is to vote with your feet.
1. Animal Testing Is Used Unnecessarily for Products Like Fabric Softener
(Source: Humane Society International)
Some medicine and pesticides tests require thousands of trials. Many of them use the same animals as much as three times.
Most tests employ methods such as force-feeding, skin application, and injection, with no pain reliever. Factory farming also treats animals in similar inhumane ways.
The US government doesn’t legally require testing on animals for new products. Unfortunately, animal testing statistics show that even with animal testing, there’s a 95% chance the drug won’t make it past the human trial phase.
Agencies state that animal testing is beneficial for human health. But animal experimentation statistics show it isn’t true, and animals aren’t necessary for this process. 100 or 50 years ago we had limited knowledge of medicine, but it’s unethical in today’s modern world.
2. Official Animal Testing Statistics Don’t Include 99% of the Animals Used.
(Source: Peta)
Animal testing cruelty statistics fail to include millions of mice, rats, birds, and amphibians. This fabrication of the truth makes the public believe that testing is rarely occurring.
Painful tests like dropping toxic chemicals into bunnies’ eyes are sometimes approved for human trials even if an animal shows adverse effects.
Don’t trust the label since the US government bodies don’t regulate them.
The accuracy of animal testing statistics is so low because no one reports them. Leaving out chunks of details to fit a certain narrative has adverse effects on humans, too. If the information is incorrect, you could agree to things that don’t align with your morals.
Animal Testing Industries That Will Surprise You
Many industries use animal testing to distribute their products legally. Here are the ones you may not know about that show us why animal testing is bad.
3. Eyes and Skin Irritation Tests Are Common in the Cosmetic Industry
(Source: United States Humane Society)
The makeup industry is notorious for unnecessary tests on animals. These tests don’t even prove anything. Mice and bunnies have different skin than humans, making the results invalid.
Cosmetic animal testing statistics show that many tested animals receive no pain relief. Also, they live in horrible conditions with no outside air or sunlight.
The FDA (Federal Drug Administration) doesn’t require animal testing on cosmetics. Companies are making this choice themselves.
Always read the labels to ensure you’re purchasing cruelty-free makeup products.
4. Biology Classroom Experiments Kill Approximately 10 Million Animals Each Year
(Source: Peta)
There’s a massive backlash against schools across the US. Many of them perform unnecessary dissections of frogs and mice in biology classes.
Every year, more than 20 million animals in the US are abused during teaching exercises, and half of them are killed
Studies about animal testing show that computer technology is far more educational and cruelly-free.
Common “fun” science tricks include: driving pins into frogs’ brains while they’re still alive, smashing turtles’ heads with hammers, and putting mice in horrific environments.
These tests affect humans, too. Many studies suggest that students forced to dissect animals do so out of fear of failing their course.
Such acts are entirely inhumane and must end. Animals testing facts report they have little to no educational value, so there’s no need for these experiments.
5. The Medical Industry Has Been Testing on Animals Since The 17th Century
(Source: Understanding Animal Research
Labs test mainly monkeys when it comes to medications and medical procedures intended for humans. But that has the same insufficient statistical evidence as testing other species.
There are far more humane ways to test medicine. For instance, scientists can now replicate human DNA to provide accurate reactions and effects for studying.
Medical animal testing statistics show that researchers in the UK use over 3,000 monkeys annually for lab tests. A shocking number considering the UK has the fourth highest population of vegans.
Animal testing in medicine was once the most valid scientific procedure. But with modern technology, its benefits are now invalid. Drug testing on animals facts shows us how ruthless this industry can be.
Who Benefits From Animal Testing?
Animal testing costs statistics will shock most people. There’s little information on the topic, so it’s understandable why you don’t know enough. But while the pet industry is booming, breeders supply animals for testing illegally.
6. Animal Breeders Profit the Most
(Source: NAVS)
Many news articles display the horrific atrocities of animal testing, so how does this industry continue to grow? Research suggests animal breeders profit millions every year due to the high demand.
Companies use illegal animal breeders to obtain protected animal species for testing.
National health initiatives and pharmaceutical companies spend millions on animal testing every year. What’s more, researchers, universities, and academics all profit from it, too.
Animal testing statistics show that much of what occurs between companies and animal breeders is under the table. In most cases, it’s unregulated and illegal. That’s why you should know what to look for in a breeder before purchasing an animal.
7. Carers Are Paid to Turn Their Backs
(Source: First Post)
Animal testing continues because companies and laboratories state good care for the animals. Reports suggest it’s untrue. Besides, vets and carers receive obscene amounts of money to ignore the test subjects’ suffering.
Carers fabricate reports to meet regulatory requirements.
We’ve only scratched the surface and may never know the real story of what happens in these labs. Researchers suspect that the truth is far worse. Some animal testing money statistics bring to light shocking information about who gains the most from the business.
Countries and Animal Testing
There’s a mass movement from large countries banning these experiments. But huge markets still thrive on animals tested for cosmetics. For example, Chinese law requires large makeup brands to conduct animal testing. Read on for more shocking animal testing make up facts.
8. The US Cosmetics Industry Is the Largest in the World
(Source: Statista)
The US beauty industry is worth close to $90 billion.
Eye cosmetics is the most popular segment and also among the most highly animal-tested ones.
Do your research. You may not know that a big brand makes a product you use. Multinational companies often buy small cosmetics brands.
Bigger companies often test on animals as they have a significant market share in countries such as China.
Animal testing statistics in the United States are very high for a country that doesn’t legally require it. Over 100 million tests are conducted annually, which just scratches the surface of the actual numbers.
9. China Has the Second Largest Cosmetics Industry
(Source: Statista)
China imports over a third of cosmetic products from other countries.
The consumption value of beauty products is worth more than $58 Billion. Many companies don’t pull their products from Chinese shelves because of the growing makeup industry.
Animal testing in China is mandatory for cosmetics. The rules and regulations are extensive and difficult to avoid.
In 2021, China agreed on importing some general cosmetic products that are cruelty-free. This is considered a positive sign for foreign cruelty-free brands that want to expand in the Chinese cosmetic market.
With the growing number of animals tested for cosmetics, it’s vital to stop these experiments in China. That’s why brands need to start pulling their products. It’s all based on supply and demand. So, if larger companies stop importing products, the Chinese government could change regulations.
Animal Testing Alternatives
The technology to find alternatives is here. It’s time to abandon the cruel processes of the medical, cosmetic, and cleaning industries.
10. Alternatives Offer Better Results
(Source: Peta)
Alternatives to animal testing statistics show that not only do they provide better results, but they’re also far more reliable.
Scientists start to admit that many conducted tests aren’t necessary. Tests often use the same compound, which is a waste of valuable time and money.
Some scientists don’t want alternatives as they’re used to animal testing.
Alternatives can harness results much faster and are cheaper than animal testing .
From this standpoint, it’s clear to see why there’s such a growing movement to stop the use of animal testing in all industries. But if there are better and cheaper alternatives, why are animal testing statistics on the rise in the US?
11. Alternatives Are on the Rise
(Source: Peta)
The most rapidly rising substitute is cell cultures. Modern science allows us to grow human and animal cells in labs. They’re far more effective in seeing the actual product effects as the DNA is replicated and not merely assumed to be similar.
Harvard’s Wyss Institute develops o rgans grown on microfluidic devices, similar to microchips. It’s the future of testing, and a recognized alternative that will reduce animal testing percentages.
Live human trials allow people to contribute more. Many are selflessly offering to be test subjects for more reliable results.
Computer modeling is growing. It helps us mimic disease progression, as well as provide reliable live medical procedure simulations.
Every medical school across Canada, the US, and India has replaced animal laboratory testing with virtual simulators.
Animal testing alternatives are fast the future of the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Statistics showing how many animals are killed each year for animal testing are a massive driving force behind these new and innovative alternatives.
12. What Does the Future Hold?
By 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) promised to reduce studies on mammals by 30%.
In 2018, EU Parliament encouraged every country to a global ban on testing cosmetics on animals by 2023.
Starting from 2021, the UK`s maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty raised from six months to five years.
We still don`t know if these promises will come true, but we know that the UK is on the right path to stopping animal abuse. In fact, in 2019 the UK joined 26 other countries in banning animal use in circuses.
What You Can Do to Help
There are ways that you can decrease how many animals die a year from animal testing.
Join One of the Countless Initiatives Against Animal Testing
(Source: Ethical Elephant)
Cruelty-Free International has many programs to stop animal testing worldwide. Besides, it provides accurate animal testing statistics. Help by donating to their worthy cause.
Many companies that want a change in the makeup industry back up the Humane Society International. Sign their pledge to stop cosmetic animal testing .
National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) leads the science world with new testing methods that don’t include animals. They expose the industry and show why animal testing should be banned. Donate or sign their petition to support the cause.
All of these initiatives shed light on animal testing cruelty. The main objective is to ban animal testing across the globe and prevent unnecessary punishment for innocent animals.  And what is left for us, is to spread the word and buy vegan and cruelty-free products whenever there’s an option.
Small Changes Make a Huge Difference
(Source: Peta2)
Research is key. Do your homework by checking drug testing on animals facts to see if the products you use are ethically sound.
Raise your voice instead of turning the other way. Prepare animal abuse statistics and reach out to companies to let them know you disagree with their practices and stand for animal rights.
Look for beauty products that don’t test on animals.
Most importantly, vote with your feet. If you disagree, the biggest statement you can make is to stop buying these products and helping their financial gain. It’s often the only way for conglomerates to notice and try to change.
There are ways you can personally make a difference in how many animals die from animal testing. Gaining the knowledge to make informed decisions is a big step in the right direction.
To Sum Up
Animal testing facts display the harsh reality of innocent animals across the globe. Atrocities are still taking place, regardless of scientific evidence that animal testing is wrong. The industries that benefit are vast, and the money poured into them shows no signs of slowing down.
Unless more people read statistics about animal testing, there’d be little change. We can make significant progress if more people know their place in the industry and what they’re contributing. Animals don’t deserve to suffer for the selfish nature of man.
FAQ
What is animal testing for cosmetics?
Cosmetic testing on animals is when the chemical compounds for beauty products are placed on or in animals to observe any adverse reaction. This can mean the products go in the eye or on the skin.
Why is animal testing cruel?
Animal testing is cruel because the animals have no rights or say about what happens to their bodies. They are forced into terrible situations where they are hurt and tortured.
Why testing on animals should be banned?
We understand that back in the day scientists had to test on animals because there were no other options. However, today there are alternatives to animal testing that yield even more accurate results.
How many animals are killed due to animal testing in the US?
Animal testing statistics show that every year more than 110 animals in the US are killed due to experimental testing. Among the most abused animals are frogs, mice, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and fish.

Animal Testing Statistics
Report highlights. Animal testing is often called “pre-clinical testing” or “pre-clinical trials.” The National Research Council recommends an end to animal research, and critics cite the inefficacy of animal testing in addition to the pain and suffering research animals undergo.
22 million research animals are estimated to populate U.S. laboratories at any given time; fewer than 1 million are protected under animal welfare laws.
Animal testing costs taxpayers $14 billion annually.
Over 30% of animal experiments involve moderate-to-severe suffering.
Over 98% of drugs tested on animals are never sold in stores.
Worldwide, there are over 192 million research animals.

Animals Testing Statistics
Over a thousand facilities nationwide test on animals from dogs and cats to nonhuman primates. Laboratories are required to report federally-protected animals to the U.S. government; this accounts for a relatively small percentage of the total estimated population.
There are 1,055 active animal testing facilities in the United States.
These facilities keep a total of 936,675 legally protected animals on site at any given time.
The average facility houses 888 legally protected animals.
An average facility may have as many as 20,850 animals on site, including those that are not legally protected (such as certain types of rodents and fish).
An estimated 7.3% of these animals are housed in federal facilities.
At least 2.3% are in facilities that perform cosmetic testing.
5%-15% of research animals are protected by law.
As many as 100 million animals may pass through laboratories each year.

Animal Testing in Pharmaceuticals
Pharmaceutical companies invest years of research to put out a viable product. Experimentation reveals how a product may work in multiple scenarios, at multiple concentrations or doses, with a range of test subjects. Toxicity levels differ across species, however, making test results unreliable.
The pharmaceutical industry is a $1.3 trillion business responsible for 4% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product.
10-15 years is the average time it takes for a drug to complete the development process and be made available to consumers.
On average, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves 37.75 new drugs per year out of hundreds of applications.
The number of drugs released to the market increases each year by an average of 14%.
92% of drugs tested on animals are deemed ineffective for humans.
0.02% of animal-tested drugs are ever made available to the public.
Animals used in pharmaceutical testing are typically euthanized once the experiment is complete.
Animal Testing in the Federal Government
A number of departments and institutions regulated by the United States Federal Government make use of animal testing in their facilities. U.S. Agencies use animals in testing for many of the same reasons public organizations and private companies do.
1.6 million animals, protected and unprotected, are estimated to populate federal laboratories.
The Department of Agriculture (DOA) researches the health and quality of livestock.
The Department of Defense (DOD) conducts experiments using technologies and/or chemicals for use in the armed forces.
The Department of Energy (DOE) tests the effect of new technologies on the health of living creatures.
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) oversees multiple agencies where testing is done, including the FDA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
The Department of the Interior (DOI) uses animal experiments to improve fish and wildlife resource management.
The Department of Transportation (DOT) conducts research on safe transport of potentially hazardous material and its effect on living creatures.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) uses animals to test the safety of consumer products.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tests the effects of toxic substances on living creatures.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) experiments on animals to study the effects of flight and space travel on living creatures.
The Veterans Administration (VA) uses research animals to study treatments for veteran health as well as for education programs.
Animal testing is a federal requirement for certain research: the FDA, EPA, CPSC, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) all have processes that explicitly call for animal testing.
Academic Animal Testing
Biomedical research in universities and academic institutions account for a large percentage of experiments using animal test subjects. In academia, ethics of animal research and viability of testing are constantly under question.
4% of U.S. medical schools use animal testing.
Many top universties do not allow animal testing, including Yale, Duke, Harvard, and Tufts.
Other universities, such as Stanford, have pledged to minimize their use of animal testing.
Academic animal research may include surgery practices, system examinations, pharmacological testing, psychological tests, and studies of growth.
95% of animals used for academic biomedical research are rodents.
Animal Testing in Cosmetics
Experimenting on animals for the purposes of developing cosmetics is the most likely form of animal research to face a ban. Some animal experiments with cosmetics are fatal.
More than 500,000 animals are used in cosmetic research.
250 U.S. companies have petitioned the federal government to put an end to unnecessary cosmetics animal testing.
39 countries have banned the use of cosmetics animal testing altogether.
Animal testing is not a legal requirement for cosmetics approval.
Common experiments include skin and eye irritation tests, force-feeding, and determination of a product’s “lethal dose.”
Animal Testing Statistics by State
States are required to report the number of federally protected animals they hold in their facilities. Some states may have additional laws regulating animal testing and research, but legislation is minimal.
Massachusetts reported the highest number of research animals with 91,394, up 1.7% year-over-year (YoY).
Delaware reported the fewest with 129 federally-protected research animals.
Delaware also reported the fewest animals per facility, with 65 animals per research center.
Mississippi has the most crowded laboratories by far, with 10,060 animals per site.
California has the largest number of research facilities with 121 labs statewide.

Use of Different Species
Pre-clinical trials involved animal experimentation require the use of multiple species in order to be considered viable. Research scientists select species based on what they know of the animal’s physiology, how the animal’s physiology may compare to a human’s, what effect they believe the experiment may have on the animal, etc. The animal’s size, metabolism, and medical history are all potential factors when selecting an animal for experimentation.
For pre-clinical trials to be viable, a minimum of 2 species must be used in experimentation.
Among reported animals, guinea pigs are the most widely used, with 171,406 undergoing experimentation every year.
Rabbits are the second-most used in experiments, followed by Non-human primates.
The United States uses more primates in experiments than any other country.
Non-human primates are the most likely species to be held in a research facility without participation in any experiment.
When used in experiments, non-human primates are most likely to be used to test gastrointestinal disorders.
Rats are most likely to be used in general and preliminary testing.
Use of Animals in Experiments
The earliest examples of animal experimentation date to the 4th century BC, when animals were dissected to study their anatomy and practice surgeries.
Test subjects are purposefully exposed to infectious diseases in order to study progression and treatment.
Other tests include forced ingestion, such as forced feeding or forced inhalation of a toxic substance.
Animals may be deprived of food and water as part of an experiment.
Wounds, burns, or other physical damage may be inflicted to study healing.
Animals are used to study the physiological effects of pain.
Behavioral studies may induce stress, fear, and panic.
Genetic manipulation/engineering leaves some animals born with genetic deficiencies, deformities, and potentially fatal disorders.
Multiple industries use animals in experimentation for varying reasons.
Animals are used to test cosmetics.
Biomedical research on animals is common in the pharmaceutical and academic industries.
Departments and agencies under the federal government use animal testing to predict how new chemicals and technologies might affect humans and/or the environment.
Pain & Treatment in Animal Testing
Animal experimentation is for illnesses or conditions that are painful; these experiments require the animal to experience pain while still others require the animal’s death. If animals are legally protected, research facilities are required to report how many of those protected animals experienced pain, on a scale of mild-to-severe, as part of the experimental process.
471,037 animals reportedly experienced no pain in the course of experimentation.
253,002 animals experienced pain and were given pain-killing drugs.
56,031 animals experienced pain but were not given any pain-relieving treatment.
Massachusetts reported the highest rate of pain-free experimentation with 65.3%.
California reported the highest number of animals given an anesthetic for pain.
Michigan reported the highest rate of pain and distress among animals during experimentation.
21.9% of painful and/or distressing animal experimentation reportedly occurs in Michigan facilities.
Animal Welfare and Research Laws
Federal and state governments specify regulations for use of animals in science and research laboratories. At the federal level, conduct in research and science laboratories is regulated by multiple departments. Animal rights groups, public health officials, universities and private companies also publish reports and guidelines for scientists and researchers in the course of dealing with animals.
Animal Welfare Act
The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is enforced by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Under the AWA, pets have the most rights, whereas some animals have none at all. In research labs, enforcing the AWA is especially difficult.
The AWA applies to hospitals, colleges and universities, diagnostic laboratories, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and private research facilities.
Research facilities are required to form their own Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee to oversee research animal welfare.
The AWA prohibits researchers from duplicating experiments unnecessarily.
Critics of the AWA cite its vague language.
Facilities are required to provide “basic standards of veterinary care and animal husbandry” with little mention of specifics.
Cages and enclosures must be cleaned every two weeks.
Potable water must be available twice daily for one hour.
A caretaker must observe the animals daily.
Dogs are singled out to be given “the opportunity for exercise.”
Laboratories are required to “promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.”
Researchers are obligated to minimize animal suffering “unless withholding such methods is scientifically justified.”
Still more critics argue the AWA is insufficient for preventing animal suffering.
APHIS is prohibited from interrupting the conduct of actual research or experimentation.
Laboratories are not required to report unprotected animals.
Some animals have no federal protection only if they were bred specifically for research:
Birds
Rats of the genus Rattus
Mice of the genus Mus
Some animals have no protection under the AWA in any case:
Coldblooded species
Fish
Invertebrates
Health Research Extension Act
The Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Animals (PHCUA) is a result of the Health Research Extension Act of 1985. This law established guidelines for proper care of animals used in biomedical and behavioral research funded by PHS. The policy itself makes reference to the AWA, noting that PHS regulations are to be considered in conjunction with the rules of the AWA.
State Legislation
Some states have created laws to fill in gaps left by federal policy. States have recently placed limits on or banned animal testing. Most state anti-cruelty laws exempt research animals, though some supplement these exemptions with additional regulations just for animals involved in laboratory tests.
349 state laws regulate use and treatment of animals in research facilities.
Each state has an average of 7 regulations affecting research animals.
Michigan offers the most legal protection to research animals with 23 regulations.
2 states have zero additional legal protections: Wyoming and Pennsylvania.
4 states have banned animal testing for cosmetics: California, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia.
Alternatives to Animal Research
An increasing number of specialists and institutions call animal testing ineffective and unnecessary. The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineers, and Medicine (NASEM) published their official position that animal testing should be discontinued.
Scientists already use simulated human organs and tissues as substitutes for human experimentation; these are considered more reliable than testing animals with completely different physiologies.
Tissue-on-Chips or Organs-on-Chips are human cells that have been manipulated to function as organs and organ systems.
Computer modeling can simulate chemical effects on a human body based on known parameters, such as toxicity of like-substances.
Human volunteers are typically given extremely small doses of experimental drugs.
State-of-the-art scanning and technology can view the inside of the human body with no dissection necessary.
International Law and Trends
Worldwide, more countries are placing restrictions on or outright banning animal testing. Industries still make the argument for animal testing in certain cases, however, and some governmental bodies actually require animal testing prior to approval for market release.
China is estimated to use the highest number of research animals, with 20.5 million test subjects.
Japan is the only other country besides China and the United States to test animals in the tens of millions.
Brussels has banned experiments on cats, dogs, and primates.
The European Union estimates that only 20% of animal experiments are regulatory requirements.
50% of all animal testing in the United Kingdom (UK) is conducted in universities.
49% of all animal tests in the UK involved the creation or breeding of genetically altered animals.
The Chinese government requires animal testing on all cosmetics.
Public Opinion
The general public is divided when it comes to animal experimentation and research. Political preferences don’t seem to affect opinion, but the level of education a person received does.
52% of Americans oppose the use of animals in research laboratories.
21% of Americans oppose genetic engineering of animals due to the potential for suffering.
Men are 46.8% more likely to support animal research than women.
People with advanced degrees are 38.4% more accepting of animal research than those with a high school degree as their highest level of educational attainment.

Animal statistics Mythbusting
Facts without context
Those opposed to animal research often point out that most drugs that pass the legally required toxicology tests in animals go on to fail in human clinical trials. They then go on to suggest that this shows that animal research does not work, or that it is proof that animals are not accurate models for humans.
However, this is misleading without an understanding of the relevant context and the reasons for the animal safety tests. Ironically, the figures cited by many animal rights activists are actually drawn from industry and are intended to explain the expense of developing safe and useful medicines.
The most frequently used statistics are
“90% drugs tested on animals fail” – British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection
“92% of drugs fail in clinical trials, having successfully passed through animal studies” – Safer Medicines Trust
“In fact according to the FDA’s research, nine out of ten drugs deemed successful in animal tests fail in human clinical trials” – Humane Society International
The main sources of this information come from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2006, health and Human Services Secretary, Mike Leavitt said:
“Currently, nine out of ten experimental drugs fail in clinical studies because we cannot accurately predict how they will behave in people based on laboratory and animal studies,”
The 92% statistic comes from an earlier report which showed only 8% of those drugs passing animal testing stages would go on successfully to be FDA approved.
“For example, a new medicinal compound entering Phase 1 testing, often representing the culmination of upwards of a decade of preclinical screening and evaluation, is estimated to have only an 8 percent chance of reaching the market.” – Challenges and Opportunities Report, FDA, 2004
Are the figures right?
To help break down these statistics, it is useful to look at the success rates at each stage. In the diagram below the red percentages show the proportion of drugs that move from one stage to another – so 64% of New Molecular Entities (NMEs – essentially new drugs) will pass the animal tests (preclinical studies) and be moved into Phase 1 clinical trials in humans.
Looked at this another way, animal experiments remove 36% of the potential drugs from moving onto the next stage. This is almost certainly a good thing as it avoids humans being given drugs which are likely to be toxic to them. The percentages at the bottom look at the percentage chance that a drug that has made it to that stage will make it all the way – so of all the drugs that make it to Phase 2 clinical trials, 12% will be approved by the FDA (and 88% will fail).
The first thing to note is of those drugs which pass animal tests, 94% will fail during human clinical trials stages (Phases 1 – 3)*.
* number of drugs which have passed Phase 3 clinical trials ÷ number of drugs which have passed just animal tests = 1.2 ÷ 19.4 = 6.2% of drugs which reach Phase 1 trials are eliminated by Phase 1-3 clinical trials. 100 – 6.2 = 93.8% fail.
So the failure rate is actually higher than even the animal rights organisations suggest (since they are using data from before 2006). Is this damning for animal research?
Consider that of all the drugs which pass Phase 1 clinical trials in humans, 86% will fail in later stage human trials**. Yet, we do not hear activists suggesting that humans are an entirely inappropriate model for drug development (though we should note that one human is not a perfect model for another).
** number of drugs which have passed Phase 3 clinical trials ÷ number of drugs which have passed Phase 1 trials = 1.2 ÷ / 8.6 = 14% of drugs which pass Phase 1 trials are eliminated by Phase 2-3 clinical trials. 100 – 14 = 86% fail.
Facts with context
Here is where it is important to understand a little about the drug development process.Before the preclinical animal tests there are a large number of pre-preclinical non-animal tests done on all manner of research tools including computer models, automatic screening, cell cultures, microbial studies and more. These methods are used to (relatively) cheaply remove many potentially toxic, or obviously non-starting drugs from reaching the more expensive animal testing stage – greatly reducing the amount of animal research required for a drug to reach market.
So contrary to animal rights claims of alternative methods being better, the truth is that 94% of drugs that pass animal AND non-animal preclinical tests will fail in human tests.So rather than damn just the animal tests, have animal rights activists managed to damn all of preclinical research? In short, no.
The role of preclinical animal tests is to check if the drug offers any potential therapeutic value and, importantly, if it is safe enough to move to Phase 1 trials in humans. This does not even mean free of all side effects, but to learn whether a drug can safely be given to humans and at what approximate dosage.
If you want to know how truly successful animal tests are, consider that in over 30 years there has not been a single death in a Phase 1 clinical trial in the UK. The last major incident was in 2006 in the Northwick Park trials where 6 people suffered extreme side effects in a Phase 1 clinical trial – though it should be noted that TGN1412 was a very novel type of molecule which was poorly understood. Considering that there are normally over 200 Phase I clinical trials each year in the UK (each involving multiple people), animal testing has been exceptionally effective at keeping dangerous drugs away from people.
Even Phase 1 clinical trials in humans are not intended to check for efficacy, but rather to assess whether a drug is safe enough to be tried in a larger number of patients (who are suffering from an illness the drug is intended to treat).
Furthermore, when a drug is licensed for use, it is on the basis of the clinical trials in humans, not the preclinical animal tests which exist to ensure that a drug is safe enough to move into Phase 1 trials. So when animal rights activists claim that adverse drug reactions can be blamed on animal tests approving the drug, remember that it is the clinical trials in thousands of people which provide the evidence of its safety.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources about why animal testing is considered ineffective. Let me try to organize this.

First, I need to understand what animal testing is. It's when scientists use animals to test new drugs, chemicals, or procedures before trying them on humans. The idea is to see if these things are safe and effective without risking human lives. Animals like mice, rats, rabbits, and monkeys are commonly used because their biological systems are similar to ours.

But, similar doesn't mean the same. Different species can react differently to the same substance. For example, something that's safe for mice might be harmful to humans. There have been cases where drugs passed animal tests but still caused problems in human trials. So, maybe that's one reason why animal testing is seen as not effective—it doesn't always predict human responses accurately.

Another thing I've heard is that animals in labs are often kept in unnatural environments, which might affect their health and how they respond to tests. For instance, if a mouse is stressed in its cage, that stress could influence the test results. So, perhaps the conditions in which the animals are tested aren't ideal, leading to less reliable data.

Also, there might be more ethical considerations here. Some people argue that animal testing is cruel and unnecessary, but since the question is about effectiveness, I should focus on that aspect. Still, if animals are suffering or not being treated well, it could impact the quality of the research.

I should probably look up some statistics or studies that compare animal test results with human outcomes. Maybe see how often animal tests correctly predict human reactions. That would give me a better idea of their effectiveness.

Looking at the first source, it's about animal testing statistics. It mentions that 90% of new drugs don't make it to patients, even after passing animal tests. That suggests that animal tests aren't very predictive of human responses. Also, it says that 560,000 experiments cause moderate to severe suffering in animals, which is concerning from an ethical standpoint, but again, I should focus on effectiveness.

Another point is that it takes nearly a decade and costs $3 million to register a single pesticide, and even then, many don't get approved. That implies that animal testing is not only ineffective but also time-consuming and expensive.

In terms of cosmetics, it's mentioned that 115 million animals are used for testing every year worldwide. That's a huge number, and if the tests aren't effective, it's a massive waste of resources and animal lives.

The second source is from PETA, which argues that animal testing is unreliable and that alternatives are available. They mention that 95% of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human trials, which aligns with the first source. PETA also points out that animals not covered by the Animal Welfare Act are subjected to cruelty without any oversight, which again raises ethical concerns but also might indicate that the data from these tests aren't reliable if the animals aren't being treated properly.

Moreover, PETA notes that more than 93% of experimental cancer drugs fail in human clinical trials after testing successfully on animals. This suggests that animal models aren't good predictors of human responses, especially for complex diseases like cancer.

The third source is from Pawsome Advice, which provides more animal testing statistics. It reiterates that over 100 million animals are used in the US each year, and that animal testing is unnecessary for products like fabric softeners. It also mentions that biology classroom experiments kill approximately 10 million animals each year, which seems excessive and possibly not justifiable.

The fourth source is from Spots.com, which provides detailed statistics on animal testing by state in the US. It shows that Massachusetts has the highest number of research animals, while Delaware has the fewest. This might not directly relate to the effectiveness of animal testing, but it gives an idea of where most animal testing is happening in the US.

The fifth source is from Understanding Animal Research, which seems to defend animal research. It addresses the statistic that 90% of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human trials, arguing that this is because animal tests are designed to ensure that a drug is safe enough to proceed to human trials, not to guarantee its success.

The source explains that animal testing is just one part of a larger process that includes many non-animal methods to screen potential drugs before they reach animals. So, the 90% failure rate isn't necessarily a reflection of the ineffectiveness of animal testing alone but rather the overall difficulty in developing safe and effective drugs.

Moreover, the source points out that animal testing has an excellent safety record, with no deaths in Phase 1 clinical trials in the UK for over 30 years. This suggests that animal testing is effective in identifying major safety issues before drugs are tested in humans.

So, there seems to be a discrepancy between the sources. Activist groups like PETA and animal rights organizations present animal testing as ineffective and cruel, while scientific organizations argue that it's a necessary and effective part of drug development and safety testing.

I need to consider both perspectives carefully. On one hand, the high failure rate of drugs in human trials after passing animal tests suggests that animal models aren't perfectly predictive of human responses. On the other hand, the fact that no one has died in Phase 1 clinical trials in the UK for over 30 years indicates that animal testing is effective in catching serious safety issues.

Maybe the key is understanding what animal testing is intended to achieve. If its primary purpose is to identify major safety hazards before drugs are tested in humans, then it seems to be effective in that regard. However, if the expectation is that animal testing should accurately predict all side effects and efficacy in humans, then it falls short.

Additionally, the complexity of biological systems and the differences between species mean that no animal model can perfectly replicate human biology. Therefore, while animal testing can provide valuable information, it should be complemented with other testing methods, such as in vitro tests, computer modeling, and human clinical trials.

It's also important to consider the alternatives to animal testing. Many sources mention that there are now advanced non-animal testing methods, such as organ-on-a-chip technology and computer simulations, which can provide more human-relevant data. As these alternatives become more sophisticated and widely accepted, they may reduce the reliance on animal testing.

In conclusion, animal testing is not ineffective; rather, its effectiveness depends on the context and the specific goals of the testing. While it may not perfectly predict human responses, it plays a crucial role in ensuring that drugs and other products are safe before they reach humans. However, as science progresses, integrating multiple testing methods, including non-animal ones, will likely lead to more accurate and humane testing protocols.

\boxed{\text{Animal testing is not ineffective; it plays a crucial role in ensuring drug safety, but its predictive power for human efficacy is limited, and it should be complemented with other testing methods.}}
