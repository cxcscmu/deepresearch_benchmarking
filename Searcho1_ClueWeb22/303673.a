So I've been hearing about this chicken wing shortage lately, and I'm really curious about why it's happening. I love buffalo wings on game day, and the thought of them being in short supply stresses me out a bit. So, I need to figure out what's going on here.

First off, I should probably start by understanding what a chicken wing actually is. I know that it’s a part of the chicken, but to be precise, it’s one of the parts that people eat as appetizers or snacks. I think it’s the joint between the drumette and the wingette, or something like that. But maybe I should look that up to make sure.

How Much Does a Chicken Wing Weigh?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 26, 2020
Cappi Thompson/Moment Open/Getty Images
A raw chicken wing weighs approximated 3 ounces, or 89 grams. The amount of lean meat in a chicken wing is about 1 ounce, or 30 grams. The skin on the wing is slightly less than an ounce, or 26 grams.
One raw wing accounts for 12 percent of an entire chicken’s meat production. Wings consist of white meat and have three distinct sections: the tip, mid-section and drumette. The drumette is the section between the shoulder and elbow.
When eaten, one large boneless chicken wing is approximately 124 calories, 75 of which come from fat. The total fat in the wing averages 8.3 grams, or 0.3 ounce.

LORD of the WINGS                 (or how I learned to stop worrying and love the suicide): WK Guide to Classifying Chicken Wings
Wednesday, 15 October 2008
WK Guide to Classifying Chicken Wings
Here it is, the diffinitive guide to classifying chicken wings. Surprisingly, most people do not understand the difference between chicken wings, their cooking methods, styles or the variations that have come about from the popularity of this cooked chicken extremity. After seeing, hearing and watching people confuse and misrepresent what a Buffalo Chicken Wing was, I had to come up with a way to educate and inform about the greatest food out there.
While chicken wings have been apart of the food world as long as we as humans have been eating chicken, it is important to understand that the phenomenon of WINGS comes from the Anchor Bar in Buffalo New York in the 1960's. From that fatefull day, chicken wings have become an important member in the lexicon of popular cuisine. Buffalo Wings were born, then Hot Wings were developed, and then an explosion of the styles and methods of cooking have graced the world. We need to understand the differences so that we can be clear what kind of food we are talking about.
I am breaking this classification down into 4 sections: Wing Parts, Cooking Methods, Wing Styles & Wing Variations.
WING PARTS
Let's start by looking at the physical wing itself. Some restaurants/chefs may split it into three parts, two, or as one jumbo unit.
THE WINGETTE- aka FLAT, MID-WING JOINT
-Part of the wing with 2 bones, and delicious stretched skin.
THE DRUMMETTE - aka DRUMMY, MINI DRUMSTICK
-Part of the wing that resembles a chicken leg: bulbous meaty end
THE TIP - aka NUB,
-Part of the wing that is just a tip. Usually discarded (or put into soup etc), but may remain attached. People unfamiliar with the tip may fear it is a mutant part of the chicken, or that it is simply a waste, but can be a small source of crispy joy.
Wing sizes vary from restaurant to restaurant and grocery store to butcher shop. Most of the time, bigger is better - but always try to avoid frozen.
COOKING METHODS
There are many ways in which to cook a wing. These are the most mainstream ways to make wings, but there are always people inventing new ways to prepare them.
DEEP FRIED
-In a deep fryer or pot filled with oil (different oils will produce different flavours) cooked at extremely high temperatures.
-'Traditional method for "Buffalo Wings"
-Produces the most crispy wings (WK prefered method of wing cookery)
a) BAKED - aka ROASTED
-Placed on a rack or a pan and roasted/baked, usually at high temperatures.
b) BAKED with SAUCE IN
-Sauced wings that are baked, creating a more flavoured skin.
GRILLED
-Wings cooked over or on a direct source of heat such as a BBQ (charcoal or gas) or a grate (also known as a grill) over a fire.
STIR FRIED
-Frying wings quickly at high temperatures in a frying pan or wok in a thin layer of oil.
-More common in Asian style of wings.
SLOW COOKED
-Chicken is cooked in a crock-pot/slow cooker or pot in sauce on low heat for many hours, producing a 'fall-off-the-bone' soft skinned wing.
BROASTED
-A pateneted technique that involves a marinated and breaded piece of chicken, then deep fried and pressure cooked
-Not a common technique but tasty results
SMOKED
-Like grilling, chicken is cooked over an open heat source, but it is the smoke produced (from various types of wood chips/logs) that actually flavours and cooks the wings by drying them out.
CHICKEN WING STYLES
There are hundreds of ways to serve wings once they have been cooked, or even before. Here are the 8 main catagories in which to serve wings.
BUFFALO STYLE
-Wing is deep fried, then tossed in a butter/margerine and pepper sauce (Frank's or Crystal). That is all. If you bake, dust, batter or sauce any other way, it is NOT a Buffalo Wing, it becomes a 'HOT WING'.
-Traditionally served with blue cheese dip with celery and/or carrot sticks to dip.
-Made famous by the Anchor Bar in Buffalo New York, hence the term 'Buffalo' wing
-Residents of Buffalo when refering to 'wings' often mean 'Buffalo wings', but this is misleading as there are hundreds of variation of 'wings'. Hence this classification guide.
SAUCED
-Any wing prepared, then covered in sauce.
-Hundreds of sauce possibilities. Most common include: mild/medium/hot/suicide, BBQ sauce, honey mustard, curry, garlic-parmesean, sweet Thai, maple. Please note that no matter how many people order Honey Garlic, the LOTW blog does not consider Honey Garlic a chicken wing ~ it is an abomination.
BREADED TYPE
-Preperation of wing involves a coating added on before cooking. There are several variations:
>DUSTED, aka DREDGED: Raw wing is lightly tossed in flour (maybe other spices as well) before cooking.
>BREADED: Wing is dipped in liquid (beat egg, butter milk, hot sauce etc.), then tossed in a dry ingredient (flour, cornmeal etc.) before cooking to create a crispy outside.
>BATTERED: Wing is dipped into batter (dry ingredient & liquid combination) before
frying. Different batters include Beer Batter or Tempura. Least common breading technique.
ASIAN
-A huge generalization, mostly known from North American Chinese establishments.
-Wings are generally stir-fried in a wok (or deep fried first) with various ingredients (often garlic, shallots, peppers etc) as well as a spicy/sweet/sour/salty sauce (ie soy sauce, teriyaki, honey etc) combination.
-Korean Fried Chicken is a glowingly popular dish that is close to both Breaded type and Sauced. I have yet to try but yearn to so much.
-Indonesian ? Maylasian? Japanese? Sure - but I can't report on them yet.
KFC
-Wing that is seasoned with secret herbs and spices, breaded, then pressure fried. Some place may simply deep fry.
DRY SPICED
-Wing (which may be naked, dusted or breaded), fried, than tossed with dry seasonings. Sometimes wings are spiced before cooking.
-Common seasoning include: Cajun, dry salt, lemon pepper, Mexican, and various potato chip flavours.
GOURMET
-Wings that are served in posh environments with flavours rarely catering to the masses
-Wing is often made into a lollipop configuration (meat and skin is all pulled to one end of the bone).
NAKED
-Chicken wing that has no sauces, seasonings or breading before or after the cooking process.
-Most often ordered from a restaurant so that a consumer may sauce or season themselves.
CHICKEN WING VARIATIONS
It took over 20 years for modern 'wings' to become part of the popular cuisine in North America, but once it did, it didn't stop at the wing.
BONELESS WINGS
-Chicken that is cooked and sauced like a chicken wing (often Buffalo style sauce) but has no bones. It never refers to a wing that has actually been de -boned.
-Chicken types may include: Chicken Finger/Fillet, Chicken Nugget/Fling and Pop Corn Chicken
-May be served on top of a salad
BUFFALO CHICKEN SANDWICH
-Chicken burger/finger that is tossed in a Buffalo wing sauce, often topped with blue cheese dressing
-May be served as a wrap in a tortilla.
-The term Buffalo refers to sauce, not the cooking method.
BUFFALO CHICKEN LEG
-A chicken leg or thigh that is deep fried, then tossed in Buffalo wing sauce, just like a Buffalo Wing.
BUFFALO WING DIP
-Appetizer dip generally consisting of cream cheese, blue cheese, shredded cheese, shredded chicken breast, and hot sauce (usually Frank's) that is baked and served warm.
-No actual wings are involved in the dip.
BUFFALO WING SOUP
-Creamy, chicken soup (may have wings in it, but more likely pieces of chicken meat) that has Buffalo wing sauce.
SNACKS
-Wide range of snacking foods that have a Buffalo wing flavour.
-May include, but not limited to: Potato Chips, Pretzel Bits, Pop Corn, Crackers, Nuts etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So as you can see, Chicken Wings are not just some simple bar food. Complex, diversified, tasty, they truly are a marvel of modern cuisine.

Baked Chicken Wings - Kent Rollins
Baked Chicken Wings
Being a cowboy from Oklahoma, a lot of people have asked me when am I going to do a baked chicken wing video? Well, hold on to your hat because today is your lucky day.
Baked chicken wings are much crispier and have a depth of flavor that you just don’t get in the fryer. I’ve got three different spice recipes to choose from, so let’s get the fire hot and get to cooking up some chicken wings.
Prepare the Wings
If the wings come from the grocery store and the tough edge of the wing is still attached, just slice it at the joint like in the picture here.
Chicken Wing Surgery
Tip: Save and freeze the rough part of the wing to boil for broth or fry up for something to chew on later.
Next, feel around in that chicken wing for what feels like an elbow joint. Slice in half and you should have a “wing-ette” and a “drum-ette.” Dry them for a while so they will be crispy when cooked.
Tip: The “wing-ettes” will cook faster than the “drum-ettes.” Bake separately or remove the “wing-ettes” early.
Sauce it Up
Start by mixing up about a half cup of hot sauce – I’m using Crystal’s Hot Sauce – and add just a little teeny drop of Liquid Smoke in there. Be careful with this stuff because it is potent. Then, generously add W sauce to the mix. Give it a good stir and get ready to give those wings a bath.
Dress the Wings
Once the wings are good and dry, we are going to make three levels of heat: Extra spicy, Spicy and Garlic Parmesan.
Extra Spicy:
Soak them in the hot sauce for a minute. If you like your wings extra extra spicy, let them soak a little longer. Shake the excess off.
Put our rib rub spice mixture (detailed below in the recipe) in a paper sack and add the sauced wings, one a time. Shake until covered with spices. Lay out on a wire rack while you repeat, one at a time, until all of the wings are ready to go.
Spicy:
These won’t go into the hot sauce. Shake into the dry rib rub mixture, coat them well, and set up one at a time on the wire rack.
Garlic Parmesan Spicy:
Start with a flour base. I mixed up some flour, some ground mustard, some mesquite seasoning, and some smoked paprika. Dip in the hot sauce and shake up with the flour base. Set up one at a time on the wire rack.
Time to Bake
The key to a good baked chicken wing is full air circulation around the meat, you want to be sure they are on a wire rack. Stick in the oven at 400 degrees F.
Now, in my case, my wire rack does not fit in my Dutch oven. What am I going to do here? I found a metal grate that fits, and I’m stacking it on some smoked metal horse shoes. If you don’t want any other flavors coming off the horse shoes, you have to smoke them first.
I suggest a metal trivet or smaller wire rack to bake these wings on so you can achieve an elevation of a couple of inches or so to ensure that air circulates all around the meat while cooking.
Spray the metal grate or wire rack with cooking spray to keep the wings from sticking. Place the wings on the rack, and set on a trivet over hot coals. The coals will be around the outside edge of the trivet and on the lid. Cook about 25-30 minutes.
Tip: Be sure to baste the Parmesan wings with minced garlic from the jar as they cook.
During cooking, rotate the Dutch oven one way and the lid the other way. This will help avoid cold spots or hot spots and cook the wings evenly. Get your favorite dipping sauce, like my Red River Mud or some ranch dressing and dig in. These baked chicken wings are finger-lickin’ good.
Take to your favorite tailgate and enjoy the party.

Chicken Wingettes Vs. Chicken Wings: What Cut Should You Purchase?
chicken wingette vs wing
Crispy fried chicken wings have been a favorite bar food of anyone, but do you know that we can work with chicken wingettes too to make things easier? There are some key differences between chicken wingettes and chicken wings, which will explain why one might be preferred over the other.
Let’s accompany us and find out the answer in this article.
What are chicken wings?
View Detail
Chicken wings are simply the wings of the chicken.
Every chicken has two wings that consist of three parts attached to each other via a small joint.
The upper section of the wing that joins the bird’s body is called drumettes because it resembles chicken drumsticks, the middle part is chicken wingette or flat, and the small bottom portion is the wing tip which is mainly made of skin and bone.
Chicken wings are a type of finger-licking food that is typically served as an appetizer at restaurants, bars, and parties because they are easy to prepare in large batches.
Chicken wings are always sold with skin on and bone in because it is hard to remove skin or bone from the wings, otherwise, you will mess things up.
The most common ways to cook chicken wings are to batter and deep-fry or bake them.
After that, you can toss them in any kind of your favorite sauce, such as melted butter mixed with seasonings like salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, or cayenne pepper for a spicy kick.
What are chicken wingettes?
View Detail
Chicken wingettes are the middle part of the chicken wings.

They are also called chicken flats because of their flat shape.
If chicken drumettes have the most meat and are considered white meat, chicken wing tips don’t have any meat but skin and bone, then chicken wingettes have a medium, dark meat content with two small bones running along the wingettes.
Chicken wingettes are juicy, easy to handle, and quick to cook.
They are perfect to be baked, grilled, or deep-fried in hot oil to achieve beautifully brown and crispy skin with tender and moist meat inside.
What are the differences between chicken wings vs chicken wingettes?
Chicken wingettes are actually cut from chicken wings.
However, this produces some key differences between whole chicken wings and chicken wingettes, as mentioned in the comparison table below:
Chicken wings
Chicken wingettes
Parts
Consist of three parts: chicken drumettes (the upper section that attaches to the bird’s body), chicken wingettes (or flats), and chicken wingtips
The middle part of the chicken wing
Size
Bigger
Smaller
Type of meat
Include both white meat and dark meat
Dark meat
Ease of preparation and cooking
Harder to cook and take a longer time because the whole wing has an uneven texture
Much easier and quicker to cook thanks to their flat and even shape
Price
Higher because the whole chicken wing is bigger than chicken wingettes but cheaper per pound
Lower but more expensive per pound
What are the similarities between chicken wings vs chicken wingettes?
Chicken wings and chicken wingettes are not completely different from each other.
They also have several things in common, here are some:
1. Chicken wings and chicken wingettes come from the wings of the chicken
So we already know that chicken wingettes are cut from the middle section of the whole chicken wings.
That means when you buy chicken wings from a grocery store, you can divide them into three separate parts that include chicken wingettes.
Every bird will have two wings, as well as two wingettes.
2. Chicken wings and chicken wingettes have the same taste and nutrient content
Another similarity between chicken wings and chicken wingettes is that they share the taste and nutrient values.
They are more flavorful than chicken breast, but less than chicken legs.
Chicken wings and wingettes are also rich sources of protein, B-vitamins, phosphorus, selenium, niacin, iron, and copper, but also high in fat because they are mainly made from the skin.
3. Chicken wings and chicken wingettes are cooked the same ways
The last thing in common between these cuts is how they are cooked.
Chicken wings and chicken wingettes are typically deep-fried, baked, or grilled.
You can optionally choose to bread them beforehand or toss them in a kind of sauce after cooking.

Alright, so from these search results, I've learned that a chicken wing is indeed a part of the chicken, specifically one of the two wings each chicken has. It's composed of three parts: the drumette, the wingette (or flat), and the wing tip. The drumette is the part that resembles a small drumstick, the wingette is the middle section with two bones, and the tip is just that—the end of the wing.

It seems that when people talk about chicken wings, especially in the context of eating them, they're usually referring to the drumette and wingette portions, as the tip is often discarded or used elsewhere. Wings are popular as appetizers or snacks, especially in places like sports bars, and they're often served with various sauces and dips.

Now, back to the original question: why is there a chicken wing shortage? I need to find out what's causing this shortage. Maybe there's an issue with chicken farming, or perhaps there's higher demand than usual. Let me think about possible reasons.

First, global events like pandemics can affect supply chains. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there might have been disruptions in chicken farming or processing plants due to worker shortages or safety measures. That could lead to a decrease in overall chicken production, including wings.

Second, changes in consumer behavior could be a factor. If more people are ordering takeout or eating at home, there might be higher demand for chicken wings, leading to a shortage if production can't keep up.

Third, perhaps there are issues specific to wing production. For example, if farmers are raising breeds of chickens that have smaller wings or if there are changes in how chickens are processed, that could affect wing availability.

I should look for news articles or reports that discuss the chicken wing shortage to get more concrete information. Maybe there are specific reasons cited by industry experts or officials.

Why There Is a Chicken Wing Shortage in the U.S.

U.S. Chicken Food Restaurants Shortage
Chicken wings are the latest food item facing a shortage in the U.S. Restaurants first began to see a lack of chicken wings in February, in the run-up to the Super Bowl, but operators are still struggling to get their hands on the popular appetizer.
Restaurant Business Online reported on the chicken wing shortage in February and said at the time that "operators should expect to see continued impacts of what is becoming a major chicken wing shortfall."
Isaac Olvera, a commodities and data analyst with supply chain firm ArrowStream, cited United States Department of Agriculture figures when telling Restaurant Business Online that the U.S. is facing "the lowest wing stocks we've seen since 2011."
He added that in February, the average price for a pound of chicken wings was $2.65, up by 10 cents from the week before. The year began with wings at $2.27 per pound. In February 2020, wings were available for an average price of $1.81 a pound.

But why is there a chicken wing shortage? The National Chicken Council reported that the demand for chicken wings increased in 2020, due to the pandemic.

National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said: "If you think about it, restaurants like wing joints and pizza places were built around takeout and delivery, so they didn't have to change their business model that much during the pandemic. Wings travel well and hold up during delivery conditions.
"Plus, they align with consumer desire for comfort food during the pandemic. Chicken production remained steady in 2020, and as long as people are sitting around watching TV and maybe drinking a beer, wings will remain in the game. Don't forget the air fryer revolution, either."
Newsweek subscription offers >
According to the National Chicken council, servings of chicken wings in restaurants were up by 7 percent in 2020 versus 2019, despite an 11-percent decline in visits to commercial restaurants. Moreover, total U.S. wing retail sales during the pandemic were up 10.3 percent compared to the previous year and sales of in-store frozen wings shot up by 37.2 percent.
The nationwide shortage is impacting a restaurant chain in Texas. Wing Barn, which has eight restaurants in the southern Rio Grande Valley area, has asked for the community's "support and understanding" during the shortage.
Vendors have not been able to supply Wing Barn with the volume of chicken wings they need, according to a press release issued on April 12, which said: "There are many reasons for this crisis, including the ongoing pandemic and the recent freeze. Together, these events have caused chicken populations to decline, supply chains to dwindle and prices to surge."
Bobby Saenz, Wing Barn CEO, said in the release: "We are faced with tough decisions. Do we buy from other vendors and sacrifice the quality of chicken wings our customers are used to? Or do we keep our quality, but face 'running out' of traditional chicken wings? Both of these choices disappoint some of our customers. There is no 'good' choice."
Wing Barn has also asked its customers to try different menu items in the meantime, such as burgers or boneless wings.
The restaurant chain cannot predict how long the shortage will last, as Daniel Pompa, Wing Barn head chef and co-founder, said in a statement: "There is no time frame when traditional chicken wings will be back to normal."
ABC6 reported that restaurants in Ohio are also feeling the effects of the shortage. Rich Greenberg of Chef Rich's Kitchen, in the Columbus suburb of Westerville, told ABC6: "My hands are tied. I try to get the best quality I can. At this point, you get what you can.
"My food rep has been driving around every day within a 30-mile radius of Columbus looking for wings. This has really cut into the margins of restaurants."
Modern Restaurant Management has suggested ways for restaurants to manage during the chicken wing shortage that include replacing wings with cut-up chicken thighs and chicken breasts, using cauliflower as an alternative to chicken, offering chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches, or meatless chicken products from, for example, Gardein, PAOW!, or Beyond Meat.

The chicken shortage can be attributed to a few different factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The National Chicken Council dubbed chicken “The Nation’s #1 Quarantine Protein.”
The nation’s chicken wars and cravings for comfort food during the pandemic have made poultry so scarce and expensive that some restaurants are limiting or running out of chicken sandwiches, wings and tenders.
Wings have been particularly popular, according to Tom Super, senior vice president of the National Chicken Council.

“Restaurants like wing joints and pizza places were built around takeout and delivery, so they didn’t have to change their business model that much during the pandemic,” Super said in a statement to WebMD. “Each chicken only has two wings and producers don’t raise chickens just for the wings, they have to sell all of the other parts, as well.”
The chicken industry also took two major hits in February. In Texas, a rare severe winter storm resulted in the death of millions of chickens. Even worse, this event took place around the same time as the wing industry’s biggest event of the year: Super Bowl Sunday. This year, Americans ate an estimated 1.42 billion wings, according to the National Chicken Council.
Changing the Look of Wings
There’s so much of a shortage that wing restaurants are changing their format.
Chicken wing powerhouse, Wingstop is expanding its body of chicken offerings with Thighstop, an online-only, temporary restaurant that will deliver chicken thighs via DoorDash amid a chicken shortage.

The “new thigh concept” will be available at more than 1,400 locations nationwide and is addressing the “consumer’s fear of a chicken wing shortage head-on,” the company said in a release provided by Thighstop spokesperson Megan Sprague.
“We think they’ll appeal to guests because they’re a different part of the chicken and therefore a new way to experience Wingstop flavor,” Charlie Morrison, CEO and chairman of Wingstop restaurants, told USA TODAY.
“They eat like a wing, but with more meat,” Morrison continued.
Rising Wing Prices
The shortage of chicken wings is also raising menu prices across the board. The price per pound for a whole chicken averaged

Chicken Wing Shortage: COVID-19 and Rising Demand Impact Supplies
By Mohit Oberoi, CFA
Feb. 10 2021, Updated 7:47 a.m. ET
The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to several shortages, from semiconductors to blue paint. There's also a shortage of some food products including chicken wings. Some places are facing limited supplies and consumers are frustrated with higher chicken wing prices. Why is there a chicken wing shortage and when is it expected to end?

Poultry producers are struggling to meet the demand for chicken wings. The demand has risen significantly since the economy reopened. Also, a number of fast-food restaurants have introduced chicken sandwiches to their menus. The U.S. has decreased its exports of chicken wings to Mexico to meet its own domestic demand.
Why is there a chicken wing shortage?
Restaurants that offer wings and pizza are famous for takeout and delivery options, and food delivery skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand considerably outstripped supply due to many people buying wings amid the lockdown restrictions.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic wasn’t the only thing that threw the supply-demand equation off. The Texas power crisis in 2021 left around 200 of the state's 1,900 broiler houses without power. As a result, a significant number of chickens died, which squeezed the supply chain more. Record-breaking winter storms in the southcentral U.S. also impacted the chicken population.

Larger restaurant and retail chains rely on national meat-cutting companies, like Perdue, Tyson, and other large industrial meat-processing facilities. Their processing plants have been coping with labor shortages, which have resulted in lower production. Some factories were forced to shut down for weeks at a time amid lockdowns, and suppliers struggled to find employees to process chicken.
The omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus in the U.S. further compounded the labor shortage situation and many workers got infected. This put pressure on the already strained U.S. labor market.

How does U.S. chicken demand-supply stack up?
The USDA estimates that the U.S. broiler production only increased 0.3 percent YoY in 2021. If the estimate is correct, it would be the slowest increase in production since 2012 when production fell 0.4 percent compared to the previous year.
The USDA also estimates that the country's chicken exports rose in 2021 and 17.1 percent of the total production was exported in the year, which was the highest percentage since 2014. U.S. per capita chicken consumption is estimated to have fallen in 2021. Instead of a demand-side issue, the fall can be attributed to the shortage of popular chicken products.

To meet demand, some restaurants have been forced to remove wings and certain specials from their menus or increase the prices. Restaurants have also been experimenting with other chicken recipes including those that use thighs.

Chicken wing prices have been rising.
There isn't a nationwide shortage of chickens, but wings are the most popular part. During the COVID-19 pandemic, meat prices have increased and chicken hasn't been an exception. In April 2020, the price per pound for a whole chicken was $2.80 on average, which was the cheapest since 2016. Prices started to rise again in 2021 after hovering around $3.30 for the rest of 2020.
Talking specifically of chicken wings, prices increased by $1 per pound over the last year. Restaurant owners complain that their purchase price for chicken wings has almost tripled since the end of 2020.

Higher costs for chicken wing suppliers and restaurant owners are an issue because there are several restaurants that offer wings and they must compete with each other. Since consumers are sensitive to price rises, restaurants must either bear the brunt of increased costs or increase prices.
The chicken wing shortage has gotten worsened ahead of the Super Bowl.
Chicken wings are a favorite snack for Americans during the Super Bowl. The National Chicken Council estimates that 1.42 billion chicken wings will be consumed during the event. Not only will consumers pay a lot more for wings in 2022 compared to previous years, but some of them might have to settle for something else amid the shortage situation.
When will the chicken wing shortage end?
The chicken wing shortage should subside by the end of 2022 as supplies increase. Some restaurants are recommending that consumers consider alternative options, like thigh meat. Thighstop, a virtual brand launched by Wingstop, allows consumers to buy a thigh meal online for pickup at more than 1,400 stores or for delivery through DoorDash.

Chicken shortage causing price hike at Pluckers

TEMPLE, Texas — Your next visit to Pluckers might leave you paying a bit extra. The national chicken shortage is causing Pluckers to temporarily raise their prices, according a statement on the Pluckers official website.
The statement says the price increase will raise the cost of bone-in chicken wings $2 per five pieces.
Why is there a shortage in chicken?
Labor shortage, increased demand
According to the Washington Post, poultry companies say their biggest problem is finding labor. Some chicken processors were hit hard when coronavirus spread through their plants. The pandemic has also increased the demand for fried chicken as people turned to comfort food that was easy to deliver.
Winter storm hits poultry farms
There's also the winter storm in Texas back in February, but it didn't just hit the Lone Star State. Arkansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Mississippi were all affected. These are some of the nation's biggest states for poultry farms.
Those farmers dealt not only with extreme cold but also power outages, resulting in some big losses.
All this adds up to a chicken shortage for all of us.

Meat prices have been particularly vulnerable to supply-chain disruptions; barbecue sellers, have reported dramatic spikes in the price of premium beef and pork over the past year.
For chicken wings, this spring could be a perfect storm, analysts say, high demand and supply that's flat at best. Wings are an easy and popular takeout option, which has made them one of the very few categories of food whose sales increased during the pandemic. Wing sales were up 7% last year, according to NPD Group/CREST marketing reports

In February, wing prices hit an all-time record at $2.71 a pound. But prices didn't go down after the annual wing bonanza during the Super Bowl. They kept going up.
"Americans really, really like our wings," said Paul Aho, an international chicken consultant who owns a firm called Poultry Perspective. "Wings tend to be more inelastic than other chicken products. If breast meat gets too high, people stop buying it or they buy less of it. But wings — now wings are things that are important. There's nothing like them. Gotta have them."

Do not worry, chicken is on the way
While yes, chicken production has been down to start 2021, chicken producers point to increased production over the last several weeks as evidence that calling it a “shortage” is an exaggeration and that supply can eventually catch up to demand.
In the meantime, there could be more price hikes, temporary switch to boneless wings made from breast meet or frozen wings.
A pizza spot in Norfolk, VA,  Chicho's Backstage, has responded to the constant fluctuations by pricing its wings the same way a seafood restaurant might list swordfish: Market Price. Right now this means $15.50 for 10 wings, up from $12.50 the week before, causing a staffer to joke they should put wings on their menu "next to the quail or the duck." A block away, at Korean fried chicken spot Bonchon, the price for 10 wings has risen to $14.35 — up about $3 from last summer.

Chicken wing prices have been surging in the U.S. A favorite for many Americans, wing prices are higher than ever, creating a price crunch for the entire industry. While the pandemic is a big factor, it’s not the only reason for the higher prices.

These higher prices are felt more by suppliers and restaurants than by consumers. Thus, the industry is pushing cheaper alternatives that are not quite so in-demand. But will consumers respond positively to anything other than their favorite? That is yet to be seen.

Prices Rising Rapidly
The price of chicken rose rapidly in 2020, which is not something we typically see in this industry. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that the price per pound for whole chicken rose from $1.59 in June 2019 to $1.75 in June 2020. That represents a 16-cent increase, or 10% year-over-year. For comparison, the price in June 2018 was $1.51, meaning the price increased by just 8 cents over that time period.

However, it isn’t all bad news. In fact, the price per pound for whole chicken actually decreased sharply in August 2020 and continued to slowly drop. The price in June 2021 was just $1.47, lower than the cost even before the pandemic began.
Hopefully, prices remain stable relative to inflation. Higher cost for suppliers and restaurants is a problem because there are so many restaurants that offer them. This makes consumers sensitive to price increases, causing restaurants to bear the brunt of higher prices. However, in some cases, restaurants are indeed raising prices. The Associated Press reported some restaurants that increased prices for consumers by $3 since the year before.

Why Are Wings So Expensive Right Now?
There are a few key factors that have contributed to higher prices. As you might expect, the pandemic played a big role. Restaurants that offer items like pizza and wings are popular takeout and delivery options, and delivery has soared in popularity during the pandemic. With so many people ordering wings during the pandemic, demand has far outstripped supply. Shortages then follow, which results in higher prices. The AP also reported a 7% increase in wing sales year-over-year.
But the pandemic was not the only factor in throwing the supply/demand equation off balance. For example, the Texas power outage in 2021 left nearly 200 of the 1,900 chicken houses in Texas without power. Unfortunately, this resulted in the death of a large number of chickens, further squeezing the supply chain.

What Are the Alternatives?
There are a few alternatives to chicken wings. One that restaurants and suppliers have been pushing is other parts of the chicken, such as thigh meat. For example, restaurant chain Wingstop launched Thighstop, which sells thighs as an alternative. Thighs are considered dark meat, and not all Americans have a taste for it. However, white meat, such as chicken breast and wings, was popularized because it was easier for restaurants to work with — not necessarily because it is superior. Thus, some believe the same can be done with dark meat.
Other alternatives exist, too. Several stores, for example, sell plant-based chicken alternatives. If that makes you cringe, I can tell you that these products have come a long way. I have tried them myself, and I don’t have nearly the craving for chicken that I used to.

<|end_search_result|>

Okay, so from these articles, it seems that there is indeed a chicken wing shortage in the U.S., and it's affecting restaurants and consumers. Let me summarize what I've gathered.

First, the demand for chicken wings has increased significantly, especially during the pandemic. With more people ordering takeout and eating at home, the popularity of chicken wings as a snack or appetizer has grown. The National Chicken Council reported a 7% increase in wing servings in restaurants in 2020 compared to 2019, even as overall restaurant visits declined.

Second, there have been supply issues due to the pandemic. Processing plants faced labor shortages because of COVID-19 outbreaks among workers, which reduced production capacity. Additionally, the severe winter storm in Texas in February 2021 led to the death of millions of chickens, further straining the supply.

Third, the export of chicken wings to Mexico was reduced to prioritize domestic demand, which might have also contributed to the shortage.

Fourth, the price of chicken wings has risen substantially. In February 2021, the average price per pound was $2.65, up from $1.81 in February 2020. This increase is putting pressure on restaurants, which may have to raise prices or find alternatives to wings.

Now, regarding the current situation, it seems that the shortage is ongoing, although some projections suggest that it might ease by the end of 2022 as supplies increase. Restaurants are exploring alternatives like chicken thighs or plant-based options to meet customer demand.

I should also consider the broader context of the poultry industry. Chickens are raised primarily for their meat, and different parts of the chicken have different uses and values. Wings represent a specific portion of the chicken, and if there's a higher demand for wings, but the supply of whole chickens remains relatively stable, there could be a shortage of wings even if there isn't a general chicken shortage.

Moreover, the way chickens are raised and processed can affect the availability of certain parts. For instance, if farmers are raising breeds of chickens that have smaller wings or if there are changes in how chickens are processed, that could impact wing availability.

Another factor could be the increasing popularity of chicken wings in other dishes and preparations. For example, if more restaurants are offering buffalo wings, chicken tenders, or other wing-based dishes, the demand could outstrip supply.

I should also consider the role of imports and exports. If the U.S. is relying on imported chicken wings to meet domestic demand, any disruption in international trade could lead to shortages.

Furthermore, the rise in plant-based meat alternatives might be affecting the market, although it's unclear whether this is a significant factor in the wing shortage.

In terms of solutions, restaurants are adapting by offering alternatives like chicken thighs or plant-based options. Some are even creating virtual brands, like Wingstop's Thighstop, to promote thigh meat as a substitute for wings.

Looking ahead, it's possible that the chicken wing shortage is temporary and will resolve as the industry recovers from the pandemic and supply chains normalize. However, if demand continues to outpace supply, higher prices and limited availability could persist.

In conclusion, the chicken wing shortage appears to be a combination of increased demand due to pandemic-related behaviors and supply disruptions caused by labor shortages and extreme weather events. The situation is expected to improve as supplies increase, but in the meantime, consumers and restaurants are adjusting to higher prices and exploring alternatives.
