So I have this question: "How does poverty affect healthcare?" Hmm, I've heard that poverty can have a big impact on people's health, but I'm not exactly sure how. Maybe I should look into this more.

First off, what is poverty? Poverty is when people don't have enough money to meet their basic needs, like food, shelter, and clothing. So, if someone is poor, they might not have access to things that richer people take for granted.

Now, healthcare is about keeping people healthy and treating them when they're sick. So, if poverty affects healthcare, it probably means that poor people have different experiences with health and medical care compared to wealthier people.

Let me think about this. Maybe poor people can't afford to see doctors regularly. They might only go to the doctor when they're really sick, instead of for check-ups. That could mean that diseases aren't caught early, and treatments might be more complicated and expensive.

Also, poor people might live in areas where there aren't many good hospitals or clinics. Maybe the healthcare facilities in poor neighborhoods are overburdened and don't have enough resources to provide quality care.

Furthermore, poverty can lead to stress, and chronic stress isn't good for your health. It can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to diseases.

I also recall that access to healthy food is important for good health. If someone is poor, they might not be able to buy nutritious food and instead have to rely on cheaper, less healthy options. That could lead to malnutrition or obesity, both of which can cause health problems.

Maybe education plays a role too. If someone doesn't have a good education, they might not know as much about how to stay healthy or understand the importance of preventive care.

Additionally, poor people might have jobs that don't offer health insurance, or they might not be able to afford insurance on their own. That would make it harder for them to get the medical care they need.

I should probably look up some statistics or studies on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe there are specific ways in which poverty affects healthcare that I haven't thought of yet.

Let me try to organize my thoughts. It seems like poverty can affect healthcare in several ways:

1. **Access to healthcare services:** Poor people might have limited access to healthcare facilities and services.

2. **Affordability:** They might not be able to afford medical treatments or medications.

3. **Living conditions:** Poor living conditions can lead to health issues.

4. **Nutrition:** Inadequate nutrition due to inability to afford healthy food.

5. **Stress:** Chronic stress related to financial difficulties.

6. **Education:** Lower health literacy and understanding of preventive care.

I think these are some key points, but I'd like to explore each of them in more detail.

First, access to healthcare services. In many countries, including the US, healthcare facilities are not evenly distributed. Wealthier areas often have better hospitals and more specialists, while poorer areas might have fewer options. This could mean that poor people have to travel longer distances to get medical care, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

Second, affordability. Medical treatments can be very costly, and without insurance, poor people might have to choose between paying for healthcare and paying for other necessities like food and housing. This can lead to delayed or foregone treatment, which can worsen health conditions.

Third, living conditions. Poor people might live in overcrowded homes or in areas with higher pollution levels, which can increase the risk of infectious diseases and respiratory problems.

Fourth, nutrition. As I mentioned earlier, poor people might not be able to afford nutritious food, leading to malnutrition or obesity, both of which can have serious health consequences.

Fifth, stress. The constant worry about making ends meet can cause chronic stress, which has been linked to various health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and mental health problems.

Sixth, education. Without proper education, people might not understand the importance of preventive care, such as vaccinations and regular check-ups, or they might not know how to manage chronic conditions effectively.

I should also consider the concept of "food deserts," which are areas where it's difficult to buy affordable, healthy food. These are often found in poorer neighborhoods, and they can contribute to poor nutrition and related health problems.

Moreover, poor people might be more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking or excessive drinking, as a way to cope with stress or due to lack of information about the risks.

I should also think about the impact of poverty on children's health. Children growing up in poverty might not get the nutrition they need for proper development, which can lead to lifelong health issues.

Additionally, poor people might have less access to recreational facilities or safe places to exercise, which can affect their physical fitness and overall health.

I'm starting to see that poverty and healthcare are deeply interconnected, and that poverty can create a cycle where poor health leads to more poverty, which in turn leads to worse health.

Maybe I should look at some specific examples or case studies to illustrate these points.

For instance, in the US, there are significant health disparities between different socioeconomic groups. Life expectancy is lower for people with lower incomes, and they experience higher rates of chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes.

Similarly, in developing countries, poverty is a major factor contributing to high rates of childhood mortality and infectious diseases.

I should also consider the role of government policies in addressing these issues. For example, some countries have universal healthcare systems that aim to provide equal access to medical care regardless of income.

In the US, programs like Medicaid are supposed to help low-income individuals access healthcare, but coverage can be limited, and not all states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

Perhaps I should look up some statistics on how poverty affects healthcare outcomes.

Let me try to find some data.

Insights into Editorial: Poverty and Health
Introduction:
Poverty and poor health worldwide are inextricably linked. The causes of poor health for millions globally are rooted in political, social and economic injustices. That’s why it is so crucial to tackle the root causes of poor health as well as the symptoms.
Poverty increases your chance of getting ill because of:
Poor nutrition
Overcrowding
Lack of clean water
Harsh realities that may make putting your health at risk the only way to survive or keep your family safe.
Poor health increases poverty by:
Reducing a family’s work productivity
Leading families to sell assets to cover the costs of treatment. This increases poverty and their vulnerability to shocks in the future.
Healthcare system for the poor and under-privileged:
The state of India’s healthcare system is somewhat dichotomous — the country is a global supplier of life-saving, affordable and good quality generic medicines, yet lakhs of families are driven into poverty because they are forced to spend much of their earnings and savings on medications to treat chronic and life-threatening diseases.
The poor, particularly, spend disproportionately large amount of their income as out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare, mostly to buy medicines and this has been known to India’s policy-makers for decades. Spending patterns of households on various items, including medicines and doctors, are routinely collected during the course of the Consumption Expenditure Surveys by the National Sample Survey Organisation.
The Health and Morbidity Surveys of the same organisation too have been a rich source of information on expenses incurred by the population on treating various ailments and diseases that include cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
Now, a research paper published in the medical weekly BMJ has once again highlighted the sad condition of healthcare in India. It has estimated that about 5.5 crore people were pushed below the poverty line between 1993-94 and 2011-12 by out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare.
Of further concern is that medicine purchase was the single largest component of OOP at 63 per cent and the rise in the proportion of population reporting any OOP payments to 80 per cent in 2011-12 from 60 per cent in 1993-94.
This has also meant that the share of healthcare expenditure in the Indian households’ consumption expenditure has risen from 4.8 per cent in 1993-94 to seven per cent in 2011-12.
The Centre’s intervention to control prices through Drug Price Control Orders has provided some relief in the past but with treatment protocols and drugs changing, that has not proved enough.
Quick stats:
India’s rank on Universal health care among 100 countries – 56
People pushed to extreme poverty every year in India due to healthcare expense- 49 million
Physicians per 1000 persons in India – 7
Psychiatrists per 1,00,000 persons in India – 3
Surgeons per 1,00,000 persons in India – 6
Hospital beds per 10,000 persons in India – 6
Percentage of people who spend at least 10 percent of their household budgets to pay for healthcare – 33
India’s expenditure on health care – 15 per cent of GDP
Although India has a public healthcare network ranging from primary health-care centres all the way to super-speciality hospitals, the basic network is poorly equipped, under-staffed and overcrowded, forcing people to look to private providers.
Also, the infrastructure is grossly inadequate — India has less than one bed per 1,000 population and less than one doctor per 1,000 persons.
Ayushmaan Bharat – An attempt to transform India’s Healthcare Map:
Innovative and path-breaking scheme in the history of public health in India. It may have a transformative impact if implemented in an effective and coordinated manner.
Aim: To make path-breaking interventions to address health holistically, in primary, secondary and tertiary care systems
Objective: Prevention + Promotion (Health & Wellness)
Full proof mechanism while allowing States to accommodate the existing schemes, keeping the flavour of Digital India intact.
AB-NHPM will target about 10.74 crore poor, deprived rural families and identified occupational category of urban workers’ families as per the latest Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) data covering both rural and urban. The scheme is designed to be dynamic and aspirational and it would take into account any future changes in the exclusion/ inclusion/ deprivation/ occupational criteria in the SECC data.
Two major initiatives:
Health and Wellness Centre: Foundation of India’s health system
1.5 lakh centres will provide – comprehensive health care, including for non-communicable diseases and maternal and child health services, provide free essential drugs and diagnostic services
The budget has allocated Rs.1200 crore for this flagship programme
Contribution of the private sector through CSR and philanthropic institutions in adopting these centres is also envisaged.
National Health Protection Scheme:
Will cover over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries)
Coverage of up to ₹5 lakh a family a year will be provided for secondary- and tertiary-care hospitalization (50 crore beneficiaries)
Conclusion:
It is hoped that the Ayushman Bharat Health Protection Mission, announced in the current year’s Budget and scheduled for rollout on August 15, will reverse the trend of rising OOP and increase access to quality healthcare and medication for the poor.
Only a universal health insurance programme, or provision of healthcare at subsidised rates, can ensure that large numbers of people are not driven to poverty by catastrophic medical expenses. For this to happen, besides the cost of medicines, both the Centre and States have to address the yawning gaps in India’s healthcare infrastructure.
The state and central agency will keep an eye that system is not distorted. For a system of this magnitude in any country, strong monitoring and governance system is required. Help of IT and artificial intelligence will also be taken.
Moreover, there should be a link between institutions or hospitals, with health centres and the community as community engagement helps in planning and implementation of programme. The success of this mission depends on its design and execution, as well as top-down leadership to ensure that the stated goals are met.
This will lead to increased access to quality health and medication. In addition, the unmet needs of the population which remained hidden due to lack of financial resources will be catered to. This will lead to timely treatments, improvements in health outcomes, patient satisfaction, improvement in productivity and efficiency, job creation thus leading to improvement in quality of life.

Poverty, Poor Health and Access to Healthcare - The Borgen Project
Poverty, Poor Health and Access to Healthcare
It is an obvious fact that living in poverty makes one more vulnerable, less secure and more likely to need assistance. When combating poverty issues of health and accessibility to health care providers in a crucial factor in creating the stability that helps people leave poverty and with appropriate polices to prevent future poverty crisis.
In the United States, it is clear that many have fallen into poverty. The U.S. Census Bureau’s annual report on poverty provides clear evidence that more Americans are struggling financially. Nearly 46 million people, which would be 14.6 percent of the population, are living in poverty. Of that, hundreds of thousands of these people were once counted among the middle class. Something beyond employment and GDP has effected security in the U.S. and made it difficult to not be impoverished.
When comparing the U.S. with other wealthy countries, the U.S. has one of the highest reported numbers of people living in poverty. Additionally, Americans also face a high risk of becoming poor. The disparity begs for answers.
When countries do not protect rights and basic securities it often leads to a poorly functioning economy and a poor standard of living.  States that do not have affordable health care have high rates of poverty. High rates of economic growth or their level of wealth cannot circumvent the absence of human rights protections and the statistics reflect that.
With such high costs of coverage and access, it is not surprising that the new census report also shows that 16.7 percent of Americans are without health insurance. The passage of the Affordable Care Act has brought this discussion of the value of human health to the forefront, and is the first major piece of anti-poverty legislation in decades.
The ACA mandates that quality healthcare must be provided to all Americans no matter what their income level is. In addition to accessible healthcare for those in need, the bill also reaffirms the belief that health care is a human right.
The health insecurity of the poor puts everyone at risk and the lack of care is trapping people in systemic poverty and risking lives that could otherwise be saved. When people live in extreme poverty they a more frequently and severely ill and face greater complications with more demands on an already over-burdened healthcare system.
Unless we can contain this spiral out of the cycle of poverty it will only continue. Job creation offers security through employment; however it cannot make a sick individual a healthy worker, and cannot always cover the high costs of health treatments and coverage.
The causes of poverty are varied and not always identified. Unless poverty is fought simultaneously from multiple points of vulnerability, it is not a winnable fight. With affordable accessible healthcare is provided along with increased social services, benefits and job creation, there are enough steps for individuals to finally leave poverty and find the security to participate economically and thrive.

How is poverty related to access to care and preventive healthcare? - Center for Poverty and Inequality Research
How is poverty related to access to care and preventive healthcare?
Data from the Centers for Disease Control
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produce data on
  health and healthcare in the United States.  Health, United
  States includes a variety of tables with breakdowns by poverty
  status.
In 2012-2013 their data for children under 18 with “no usual
  source of healthcare” show
4% of all children had no usual source of healthcare
for poor children the rate was 6%
Children under 6 were less likely than those 6 to 17 to have no
  usual source of healthcare (3% vs. 5%).  Uninsured children
  were ten times more likely than insured children to have no usual
  source of healthcare (28% vs. 2%).  For uninsured children
  under 6 the rate was 20% and for those age 6 to 17 the rate was
  29%.
For adults ages 18-64 data on “no usual source of healthcare”
  show
20% of all adults ages 18 to 64 had no usual source of
  healthcare
the rate for poor adults in that age group was 33%
adults ages 18 to 44 were less likely than those ages 45 to
  64 to have no usual source of healthcare (25% vs. 12%)
The rate was highest for uninsured adults at 54%
The rate was lowest for insured adults at 11%
In 2013, data on preventive care show that
Sixty-seven percent of all women ages 40 and over had a
  mammogram.  The rates vary by income level:
50% of women at or below the poverty level
57% of women between 100-200% of the poverty level
77% of women at 400% or more of the poverty level
Fifty-five percent of adults 50 to 75 had colorectal tests
  or procedures.  The rates vary by income level:
41% of adults at or below the poverty level
45% of those between 100-200% of the poverty level
63% of those at 400% or more of the poverty level

In the United States it has been shown that areas of lower economic status don’t have the best physical and mental health care. On top of already struggling to make ends meet, people are being forced to ignore illnesses, they are unable to take prescribed medications, and are not even seeing the doctor all because of the cost. Poverty prevents Americans from buying healthy food, they have a higher tendency to smoke, and generally live in areas of poor air quality which can cause health impairments such as asthma, and COPD. Some argue that poverty affects you even before you are born. It has been stated that when someone is born into poverty, that while they were in the womb it is very likely they were exposed to secondhand smoke, were malnourished, and premature. 4% of all children have no usual healthcare, but that percentage jumps to 6% in areas of lower economic health. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, ACA, or Obamacare, is a law that passed in 2010 that established better health coverage for those that are of low economic status.Poverty and Quality of Healthcare
In the United States it has been shown that areas of lower economic status don’t have the best physical and mental health care. On top of already struggling to make ends meet, people are being forced to ignore illnesses, they are unable to take prescribed medications, and are not even seeing the doctor all because of the cost. Poverty prevents Americans from buying healthy food, they have a higher tendency to smoke, and generally live in areas of poor air quality which can cause health impairments such as asthma, and COPD. Some argue that poverty affects you even before you are born. It has been stated that when someone is born into poverty, that while they were in the womb it is very likely they were exposed to secondhand smoke, were malnourished, and premature. 4% of all children have no usual healthcare, but that percentage jumps to 6% in areas of lower economic health. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, ACA, or Obamacare, is a law that passed in 2010 that established better health coverage for those that are of low economic status. There was a lot of debate in regards to the ACA. Ultimately it passed and it cut the amount of uninsured people almost in half.
People of impoverished areas tend to have poor health quality, but more so than that, they
tend to have a lower quality of healthcare. Poverty can be seen everywhere. Healthcare for the impoverished can vary, depending on the type of poverty a person is forced to live with. There is “absolute” poverty and “relative” poverty. The idea of Absolute Poverty came to life over one hundred years ago and is defined as an “absolute minimum standard of living.” It is based on the idea that everyone is born with what they need to be healthy. The Believers of the relative poverty theory argue that a definition must relate to the standards of a particular society at a certain time. It is believed that people of relative poverty do not have the basic needs to live and continue to have a healthy life. “Insurance is not just supposed to get you access to care, it’s supposed to keep you from getting evicted from your apartment because you paid your hospital bill instead of your rent.” (“The Costs of Inequality”) All of this will affect the quality of healthcare a person receives.
The ability to have access to healthcare is something nobody should have to worry about, but is a reality for a lot of Americans. There is a large amount of Americans who do not have health insurance. This lack of coverage can make it hard for people to access the care they need. If they choose to go to the doctor, they can be burdened by medical bills that frankly, they cannot afford. Someone without health insurance is “more likely to have poor health, and less likely to receive medical care.”(“Access to Health Services”)
Impoverished areas have more cases of mental health than wealthy areas. Stress caused by a lack of economic wealth can cause depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. The cost of psychiatric medications can also cause someone to be impoverished, so there is the problem that these people simply cannot afford to seek help for their mental health. Typically when dealing with these issues, one must seek professional help through a psychiatrist and a psychologist. However, due to the expenses related to both of these physicians it may be difficult or impossible for one to access these services so that they can live a normal life.
Some argue that poverty affects you even before you are born due to poor air quality of the mothers environment, drug tendencies, and generally bad healthcare due to the lack of care available to those in impoverished areas. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, ACA, or Obamacare, is a law that passed in 2010 that established better health coverage for those that are of low economic status. This act has helped millions of people and is arguably one of the biggest leaps we have made in regards to healthcare.
Throughout their lifetime, people of low economic status tend to have worse overall health. As a country, we need to bind together and help one another, even if it comes out of our own pocket. “United We Stand, Divided We Fall.”
Poor lifestyle choices such as smoking, overuse of alcohol, poor diet, lack of physical activity and inadequate relief of chronic stress are key culprits in the development of preventable diseases. Some of these diseases include: obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even several types of cancer. However, even knowing these things, people of poor economic status tend to indulge in drugs and alcohol more often than those of middle or upper class. On top of that, they do not have the funds or resources for a rehabilitation center or even a simple doctor appointment to address the issue.
Almost half of the young children in the United States live in or near poverty. Poverty and other related social determinants of health can lead to adverse health outcomes in childhood and negatively affect their physical, emotional, and educational development throughout their life, starting in the womb. Poverty affects many aspects of a child’s life such as: low birth weight, infant mortality, language development, chronic illness, environmental exposure, nutrition, and injury. (“Pediatrics, Council On Community. “Poverty and Child Health in the United States.”)
Child poverty also exposes the brain to a condition called “toxic stress.” This illness causes “excessive or prolonged activation of the physiologic stress response systems in the absence of protection by stable, responsive relationships.” Children from impoverished families tend to be at risk for inattention, impulsivity, defiance, and poor peer relationships.(“Pediatrics, Council On Community. “Poverty and Child Health in the United States.”) Unfortunately, due to the fact that they were born into this lifestyle, it is almost impossible for these things to be avoided because healthcare is not easily accessible for people of low economic status. This is where the Affordable Care Act came into play.
The high cost of health coverage has traditionally kept as many as 48 million Americans without health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare is a federal law that was intended to make health insurance that was more affordable and accessible to more people. It also wanted to expand the Medicaid program to cover adults with an income below 138% of the federal poverty level. ACA was enacted in two parts: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and was amended on March 30, 2010.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act) This law has extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but the effects of coverage on access to care remain unclear.
Generally, low economic standards lead to poor health. This has been shown time and time again throughout vigorous research. Whether that means poor physical or mental health depends on the person at hand, but the point remains the same. If someone cannot afford food, clothing, or shelter, they cannot afford healthcare. I strongly believe healthcare should be set at a standard that makes it possible for everyone to receive it. Although it is arguable, I believe that the ACA is a great start to making everyone equal in terms of healthcare. There was a lot of debate in regards to the ACA. Ultimately it passed and it cut the amount of uninsured people almost in half.
People of impoverished areas tend to have poor health quality, but more so than that, they
tend to have a lower quality of healthcare. Poverty can be seen everywhere. Healthcare for the impoverished can vary, depending on the type of poverty a person is forced to live with. There is “absolute” poverty and “relative” poverty. The idea of Absolute Poverty came to life over one hundred years ago and is defined as an “absolute minimum standard of living.” It is based on the idea that everyone is born with what they need to be healthy. The Believers of the relative poverty theory argue that a definition must relate to the standards of a particular society at a certain time. It is believed that people of relative poverty do not have the basic needs to live and continue to have a healthy life. “Insurance is not just supposed to get you access to care, it’s supposed to keep you from getting evicted from your apartment because you paid your hospital bill instead of your rent.” (“The Costs of Inequality”) All of this will affect the quality of healthcare a person receives.
The ability to have access to healthcare is something nobody should have to worry about, but is a reality for a lot of Americans. There is a large amount of Americans who do not have health insurance. This lack of coverage can make it hard for people to access the care they need. If they choose to go to the doctor, they can be burdened by medical bills that frankly, they cannot afford. Someone without health insurance is “more likely to have poor health, and less likely to receive medical care.”(“Access to Health Services”)
Impoverished areas have more cases of mental health than wealthy areas. Stress caused by a lack of economic wealth can cause depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders. The cost of psychiatric medications can also cause someone to be impoverished, so there is the problem that these people simply cannot afford to seek help for their mental health. Typically when dealing with these issues, one must seek professional help through a psychiatrist and a psychologist. However, due to the expenses related to both of these physicians it may be difficult or impossible for one to access these services so that they can live a normal life.
Some argue that poverty affects you even before you are born due to poor air quality of the mothers environment, drug tendencies, and generally bad healthcare due to the lack of care available to those in impoverished areas. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as the Affordable Care Act, ACA, or Obamacare, is a law that passed in 2010 that established better health coverage for people of low economic status. This act has helped millions of people and is arguably one of the biggest leaps we have made in regards to healthcare.
Throughout their lifetime, people of low economic status tend to have worse overall health. As a country, we need to bind together and help one another, even if it comes out of our own pocket. “United We Stand, Divided We Fall.”
Poor lifestyle choices such as smoking, overuse of alcohol, poor diet, lack of physical activity and inadequate relief of chronic stress are key culprits in the development of preventable diseases. Some of these diseases include: obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even several types of cancer. However, even knowing these things, people of poor economic status tend to indulge in drugs and alcohol more often than those of middle or upper class. On top of that, they do not have the funds or resources for a rehabilitation center or even a simple doctor appointment to address the issue.
Almost half of the young children in the United States live in or near poverty. Poverty and other related social determinants of health can lead to adverse health outcomes in childhood and negatively affect their physical, emotional, and educational development throughout their life, starting in the womb. Poverty affects many aspects of a child’s life such as: low birth weight, infant mortality, language development, chronic illness, environmental exposure, nutrition, and injury. (“Pediatrics, Council On Community. “Poverty and Child Health in the United States.”)
Child poverty also exposes the brain to a condition called “toxic stress.” This illness causes “excessive or prolonged activation of the physiologic stress response systems in the absence of protection by stable, responsive relationships.” Children from impoverished families tend to be at risk for inattention, impulsivity, defiance, and poor peer relationships.(“Pediatrics, Council On Community. “Poverty and Child Health in the United States.”) Unfortunately, due to the fact that they were born into this lifestyle, it is almost impossible for these things to be avoided because healthcare is not easily accessible for people of low economic status. This is where the Affordable Care Act came into play.
The high cost of health coverage has traditionally kept as many as 48 million Americans without health insurance. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare is a federal law that was intended to make health insurance that was more affordable and accessible to more people. It also wanted to expand the Medicaid program to cover adults with an income below 138% of the federal poverty level. ACA was enacted in two parts: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and was amended on March 30, 2010.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patient_protection_and_affordable_care_act) This law has extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but the effects of coverage on access to care remain unclear.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, there's a clear link between poverty and poor health. People living in poverty often don't have access to basic necessities like nutritious food, clean water, and safe housing. These factors can lead to a variety of health problems.

For example, malnutrition can weaken the immune system, making people more susceptible to diseases. Living in areas with poor sanitation can expose people to waterborne illnesses and other infections. Additionally, stress related to financial struggles can have negative impacts on mental and physical health.

Moreover, poverty affects access to healthcare. Many poor people can't afford health insurance, which means they might delay or forego necessary medical treatments. Even when healthcare is available, the quality may be lower in impoverished areas due to understaffed clinics and lack of resources.

The sources also mention that poverty can affect health even before birth. If a mother is living in poverty, she may not have access to proper prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and birth. Exposure to toxins and stressors in the womb can have long-term health consequences for the child.

One interesting point is the cycle between poverty and health. Poor health can lead to poverty because sick individuals may be unable to work or may accrue medical debts. Conversely, poverty can lead to poor health due to the reasons I've already mentioned. This creates a vicious cycle that's hard to break.

Now, regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, it seems to have made a significant impact in increasing health coverage for low-income individuals. By expanding Medicaid and providing subsidies for health insurance, it has helped reduce the number of uninsured people in the U.S.

However, there are still challenges. Not all states have expanded Medicaid, which means that some low-income individuals may still fall into a coverage gap. Also, even with insurance, out-of-pocket costs can be prohibitive for some people.

Another aspect is mental health. The sources note that mental health issues are more prevalent in impoverished areas. Access to mental health services is often limited, and the stigma around mental illness can prevent people from seeking help.

Furthermore, children in poverty face unique health challenges. They may experience developmental delays due to malnutrition or lack of stimulation. They're also more likely to suffer from chronic conditions like asthma, which can be exacerbated by environmental factors common in low-income areas, such as pollution and mold.

I think it's important to consider both the direct and indirect effects of poverty on health. Direct effects include things like malnutrition and lack of healthcare, while indirect effects might involve stress-related illnesses or the inability to afford medications.

Also, there's a social determinants of health perspective here. Factors like education level, employment opportunities, and neighborhood safety all play a role in determining a person's health outcomes. Poverty intersects with all these factors, creating a complex web of influences.

I should also consider global perspectives on poverty and health. While my initial focus was on the U.S., it's clear that poverty affects health worldwide. In developing countries, the problems can be even more severe due to lacking infrastructure and resources.

Overall, it seems that addressing poverty is crucial for improving health outcomes. Policies that aim to reduce poverty, such as increasing access to education, creating jobs, and providing social safety nets, could have significant positive impacts on public health.

Perhaps I should look into specific interventions or programs that have been successful in breaking the link between poverty and poor health.

Global Poverty and Nursing Intervention
Topics: Nursing, Poverty Words: 2607 Pages: 10 May 11th, 2020
Introduction
Poverty is inextricably connected with global healthcare inequalities. According to the World Bank (2008) report, about 1.5 billion people live below the poverty line. For poor people, poverty deprives them of their human dignity and denies them access to quality healthcare opportunities. The poor are often prone to ill health, HIV/AIDS, and undernourishment due to lack of income and expensive care costs. Moreover, most of the world’s poor endures intense physical labor, unhealthy diet, and environmental risks that pose a threat to their health.

Health promotion among the world’s poor requires concerted efforts from multiple political, humanitarian, and healthcare organizations to address the health challenges at the population level. Community health nursing practice is well placed to improve the health of marginalized groups or communities, as it involves diverse community-level care approaches that reflect the social and political realities of the populations. This paper examines the impact of poverty on health, the community nursing interventions, and organizations that provide care for the world’s poor.
Statistics
Women and children constitute the largest proportion of the world’s poor. It is estimated that about 70 percent of the world’s poor are women (World Health Organization [WHO], 2000). This demographic group is vulnerable to poverty due to high levels of illiteracy, challenges associated with childcare, and gender inequality that denies women access to land. Poverty is also prevalent among female-headed households in low-income nations (WHO, 2000). Poverty lowers the health outcomes of women as well as those of their children. Children from poor families experience malnourishment that affects their physical health and growth. In addition to women and children, the native communities, the elderly, and war refugees, who are often denied equal economic opportunities, are other populations affected by poverty.
Ill health is prevalent among the poor. The World Bank (2008) reports that “20 percent of the world’s poor individuals die from close to two thirds of preventable communicable diseases, maternal and infant mortality, and nutritional deficiencies” (Para. 8). The poor health outcomes among the world’s poor have been attributed to poverty.
Many social, political, environmental, and dietary factors cause poverty and disease among vulnerable populations. Most of the world’s poor lack access to healthy food, comfortable shelter, and clothing. They also live in unhealthy conditions characterized by the lack clean water, quality health care, and sanitation, which make them vulnerable to diseases, such as diarrhea and URT infections. It is estimated that about one billion people, who are citizens of developing nations, lack proper shelter while another 1.5 billion do not have safe drinking water (World Bank, 2008). The lack of proper sanitation is also common among the world’s poor, affecting close to three billion people, which is about 46 percent of the population (World Bank, 2008). Nutrition is also a problem in these countries where a third of children aged below five years are malnourished.
The overcrowding observed in urban areas has led to the rise of poor neighborhoods characterized by overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, which allow insect vectors to thrive. Furthermore, due to high levels of literacy, most of the urban poor, lack knowledge about disease vectors and ways of preventing them. Studies establish that interventions that promote health, facilitate social policy change, and create awareness among people living in poverty-stricken areas can reduce child mortality and improve the people’s health (Farmer, 2003). In this regard, preventive care interventions that reflect the socioeconomic realities of the communities can help improve the health of the poor.
Causes
Inadequate food is the main cause of ill health among the world’s poor. Malnutrition and starvation have been attributed to many infections, as they weaken the people’s immune defenses, making them vulnerable to diseases (Wagstaff, 2002). The poor people, in both rural and urban areas, often have one meal in a day, which is not adequate for their daily nutritional requirements. Lack of food also affects breastfeeding infants, as mothers cannot produce sufficient breast milk for the children (Wagstaff, 2002). Besides weakening one’s physical health, hunger also causes anxiety and psychological stress among the poor.

The lack of clean drinking water is also linked to ill health among the poor. Shortages are prevalent in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where people have to travel long distances to find water (Farmer, 2003). Water quality, quantity, and availability are the main factors that affect human health in dry regions. Flooding and water pollution also contaminate piped water channeled to homes. Contaminated water is a great health risk to people, especially those living in poor urban neighborhoods. Frequent droughts, especially in rural areas, affect crop production and food security of the rural poor. It also forces people to trek long distances in search of water. This may be injurious to the health of women, children, and the elderly.
Urban residents, especially in poor neighborhoods, lack proper sanitation services. Rapid urbanization in countries, such as Bangladesh, has constrained sanitation facilities (latrines) making them unable to serve all the residents in poor neighborhoods (Farmer, 2003). Open sewer lines pose great health risks to residents, especially schoolchildren. In Latin American countries, some urban areas are littered with waste from cane factories that harbors disease vectors that may cause illnesses (Farmer, 2003). In low-lying plains, floods contaminate drinking water with heavy chemicals and silt from the highlands. The chemicals are health hazards, as they cause various diseases, including skin infections to the residents.
The poor often live in shanty dwellings or mud huts that have poor ventilation. Moreover, the shelters are often built with unsafe roofing materials, such as reeds in countries like Ecuador and bamboo in Vietnamese huts (Farmer, 2003). Rusted zinc used to roof houses also pose a risk to public safety and health. Moreover, in poor neighborhoods, the types of housing that people live in cannot keep out disease vectors and vermin. The roofing materials used in roofing slum shelters are combustible and thus, unsafe. Shanty houses are usually located in unhealthy environments like near chemical plants that release toxic gas emissions that can cause respiratory infections and cancer.
Disability is another cause of social determinant of health among the poor. Physical disability deprives people the capacity to work and support themselves economically. Disability may be caused by the lack of child immunization due to illiteracy among poor mothers. It may also result to work-related injuries for individuals involved dangerous occupations without protective gear. Disability leads to ill health when the affected individuals lack support services or endure discrimination. In countries like Bulgaria, the disabled are thought to be unproductive economically (Farmer, 2003). Furthermore, in most countries, specialist care and disability allowance, which could help improve the health of the disabled, are nonexistent.
Significance of Poverty for Nursing Practice
Poverty alleviation has implications for nursing practice. Nursing interventions can help fight poverty in order to improve the health of the world’s marginalized groups. Nurses, as the primary care professionals, understand poverty as a social determinant of health. From a nursing perspective, improved access to proper nutrition, income, and healthcare services is essential for the poor. The promotion of healthcare among the marginalized communities, such as the indigenous sub-populations, the minorities, and the poor is a fundamental public health policy (Wagstaff, 2002). Community health nurses, as the primary caregivers, are more acquainted with the health inequalities in poor neighborhoods. Thus, they are better equipped to address health issues like HIV/AIDS, prostitution, and infant mortality at community level.
In poverty-stricken areas, the nursing role extends beyond care provision to include advocacy. According to Zanchetta, Leite, Perreault, and Lefebre (2005), “knowing how to care” not only encompasses aspects like “treatment, health promotion, and prevention”, but it also involves an evaluation of the social and political contexts of the people (p. 657). Community health nursing practice employs a number of approaches to address health challenges at the community level. This means that the nursing role includes socio-political actions aimed at improving the general health of the population.
Preventive services in poor community settings resonate with the principles of medical practice. Farmer (2003) writes that preventive care at the community level should include “caring and supporting people with HIV/AIDS in poor countries” to live normal lives. Moreover, for preventive services to be effective, they should be grounded on the local realities and culture. They should reflect the various aspects of local practices and demographic variables. In such settings, the nursing actions should involve evidence-based practice, even when the relevant variables are lacking.

Strategies for Reducing Ill Health among the Poor
Policymakers can employ diverse strategies to improve the health of the poor. One such strategy is the use of a participatory approach that involves the people in identifying their health care needs (International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2000). The poor have a deep understanding of their health problems and thus, they should be consulted in the formulation and implementation of policy interventions that touch on their health. Interventions that do not involve the poor make them feel helpless and unable to participate in alleviating the causes of their ill health (ICN, 2000). Participation processes that involve people of all demographic characteristics ensure that the health interventions formulated meet the needs of the poorest and the marginalized. Policymakers should seek for ways of enhancing participation through community networks and groups in poverty-stricken areas.
Ill health among the poor can also be reduced through the prioritization of public health. It is evident that poor health and poverty are closely related. Ill health not only aggravates poverty among marginalized groups, but it also hampers poverty alleviation efforts. It affects individual productivity and family income. On the other hand, a healthy population is more productive and less vulnerable to poverty. Therefore, poverty reduction interventions should focus on improving the health of the population and thus, create a healthy workforce. More importantly, social inequalities in a country should be addressed, as a way of fighting poverty and poor health among the poor. A more equitable resource allocation can help alleviate poverty and improve the health of the disadvantaged groups.
In low-income countries, programs that address public health issues in underserved regions are very crucial. As noted before, the major causes of ill health among the world’s poor are lack of sanitation, proper shelter, safe drinking water, and food. Improved access to nutrition, water, housing, and education can reduce ill health among disadvantaged groups. Proper coordination of public health programs serving different areas should be the central goal of health ministries. Based on a nation’s health care needs and priorities, much focus should be directed towards the poor people’s health in order to address inequalities.
The health systems of a country should provide essential services to the poor. Poor people cannot afford expensive specialist services that the rich can access. Thus, a health system that does not enhance the accessibility of essential medical services to poor communities affects their health outcomes. Outreach services and increased allocation of health resources to underserved areas can help improve preventive care (ICN, 2000). Moreover, health care costs for primary care should be reduced, as expensive plans prevent the poor from seeking medical help. Affordable health coverage plans, such as the Self-Employed Women’s Association scheme in certain states of India, can enhance healthcare accessibility ((ICN, 2000).
Health Organizations’ Actions
International and non-governmental organizations have played a crucial role in reducing ill health among the poor people. In the 1970s, the WHO initiated the “Health for All” global initiative to improve healthcare accessibility to all people by 2000. Its goals include the reduction of healthcare inequalities among nations and the universal access to basic care. This calls for equity in health care resource allocation to benefit disadvantaged groups. In this regard, health organizations offer outreach programs that target poor communities in order to enhance healthcare accessibility. The outreach programs encompass extended nursing care to communities.
Health organizations in low-income countries help set the public health agenda. In particular, community-based and faith-based organizations help governments in identifying healthcare needs of the communities to inform resource allocation. They also design health promotion interventions for the poor. The International Council of Nurses (ICN) is another healthcare organization that advocates for the improvement of nursing care for the disadvantaged. ICN provides the code of ethics for nurses working in community settings globally. This enhances healthcare equity and quality. Health organizations also implement a number of initiatives targeting the poor. These organizations, in partnership with the government and private players, run HIV/AIDS prevention and health promotion initiatives in underserved areas. NGOs also increase public awareness about preventable diseases, initiate small projects for women, extend credit to the poor, and educate them in a bid to reduce poverty and improve the health of vulnerable groups.
Effects on Community Health
Poor people are more prone to ill physical and mental health than the rich are. One of the effects of poverty is mortality due to lack of nutrition or preventable infections. Maternal and infant mortality is high in poverty-stricken areas, where people lack access to essential care services. Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of poor health in the population (Wagstaff, 2002). It creates a vicious cycle that aggravates the health of the poor. Poverty also causes diseases, such as diarrhea and skin infections, which affect the health outcomes of the population. Ill health weakens people and reduces their productivity. Moreover, poor people cannot afford proper housing and sanitation and thus, are prone to communicable diseases.
Conclusion
It is evident that poor health and poverty are closely linked. Community nurses who are conversant with the dynamics of the health of the poor can run successful health promotion initiatives. Nursing interventions that center on poverty eradication, improvement of economic opportunities for the poor and public education can enhance healthcare accessibility and prevent ill health among marginalized groups.

Poverty and health : WHO proposes a strategy for the African region
On the basis of the clear linkage between poverty and health, the WHO Regional Office for Africa has developed a strategy which explores the potential contribution of health to poverty reduction, economic growth and human development.
The overall objective of the strategy is to have the health sector, given its comparative advantage, contribute to poverty reduction by improving health. The strategy is to be discussed by the 52nd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa scheduled for 8-12 October in Brazzaville, Congo.
It aims to :
develop and maintain a strong advocacy platform targeting stakeholders and partners operating outside the health sector in order to sensitize them on the contribution of health to poverty reduction, and to provide orientations on how other sectors should factor heath into policies and practices to improve health outcomes ;
address reforms in the health sector with a view to shifting the focus of health systems away from an overly curative approach to a more preventive and promotional pattern of health intervention, and
strengthen and promote the capacity of the most vulnerable groups with direct and specific interventions.
The strategy document also enumerates five principles which should guide the implementation of the strategy. These are : equity and fairness of services ; quality, (financial and geographical) accessibility as well as sustainability of services ; community participation and gender sensitivity ; intersectorality and partnership, and a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanism.
Seven priority interventions are proposed in the strategy document. These are:
generating evidence on the linkages between health and other socioeconomic sectors (education, transport, agriculture, energy, chemicals, tourism) for advocacy outside the health sector;
setting up a transparent resource allocation mechanism with a view to recording the responsiveness of interventions to poverty reduction objectives;
extending health coverage (infrastructure, mobile units and health services, including antenatal care and birth attendance) to underserved areas for the benefit of vulnerable populations;
reinforcing immunization programmes against childhood illnesses through regular monitoring and mobilization of adequate funding;
strengthening environmental health services, including safe water, nutrition, safe food and hygiene education;
strengthening health promotion initiatives to improve health and prevent diseases, particularly those afflicting the poor;
scaling up interventions against malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and childhood illnesses.
Specific roles are assigned to various stakeholders in the health as well as in non-health sectors to facilitate the achievement of overall poverty-reduction objectives.
WHO estimates that more than 45 % of the population of the African Region fall under the poverty-line definition which characterizes as "poor" anyone who cannot afford a daily consumption rate of US$1. The heavy burden of diseases in the Region causes significant loss in output which in turn accentuates the gap between the actual and potential growth in the Region.
Poverty is on the rise in Africa, causing deterioration in social and economic indicators - particularly life expectancy, child and infant mortality, and morbidity due to malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS.

Introduction
A detailed and accountable strategy with clear legislative targets and timeliness is essential for the development and implementation of a poverty reduction plan. These blueprints should purpose to address lack of education, Unemployment issues, overpopulation, epidemic diseases, and environmental problems which inherently cause poverty in many countries (Cosgrove & Curtis, 2017). While this condition affects the poorest society members, the overall effect deprives the entire economy of growth; thus its eradication should include a concerted effort involving every member regardless of their socioeconomic or political status.
The high unemployment rate is an indicator of rising poverty levels since it is a disincentive to access of disposable income among households. The incapacitation to spend as a result of unsustainable income shifts expenditures towards the most basic needs at the expense of other priority services like quality health care, and quality education (Barros, Corseuil, Mendonça & Reis, 2015). Moreover, the lack of income in totality may contribute to homelessness and malnutrition. The long term effects result in crowding of public facilities like hospitals and schools adding to reduced services. The state authorities through their legislative organs should formulate monetary and fiscal policies that open opportunities for employment and support youth entrepreneurship programmes. The developed countries may consequently increase income assistance for the disabled in proportion to the inflation index. There is a need to reduce bottlenecks that impede access to these funds. The adjustments of the economy in curbing rising unemployment rates thus improve the economic welfare of the Country.
Further, the poor health services due to the crowding of public hospitals require an elaborate and affordable universal health care coverage plan. The strategy should focus on the capacity building of the entire health care system such as infrastructural expansion and human resource capacitation. Moreover, the health care plan should advocate on the strategies of reduces overpopulation which is another attribute to poor living conditions, especially among the Sub-Saharan regions. Such interventions should involve the community health workers and volunteers who hail from the localities and are more acceptable in teaching family reproductive health. Further, the government should implement the Nation Health Insurance fund framework to facilitate affordable healthcare access.
The government is the custodian of all demographics and should analyze economic indicators relating to housing. The outcomes are essential in formulating affordable housing policies such as informal settlement upgrading. However, in implementing such plans, the government should conduct public participation approaches in soliciting for views that can make the process successful. Moreover, such poverty eradication programmes should involve the private sector and other Non-Governmental organizations who can attract additional funding to the projects. A successful poverty eradication plan should, therefore, rely on critical, informative agenda which include affordable housing, Universal health coverage, quality education, and sectoral transformation of the economy to open employment opportunities through active participation by all stakeholder with specificity to society members who receive the impacts.
‘Housing First’ Approach as an Alternative to Social Welfare Policy
The use of ‘housing first’ approach is a quick problem solver to homelessness in most societies. The strategy focusses on the rapid reallocation of people who are undergoing through homelessness into independent and permanent houses which aids them with the opportunity to pursue personal goals and improve quality of life (Aubry, Nelson & Tsemberis, 2015). The mechanism centers on principles that people are better off in making advances in life when they have proper housing as the priority. These standards make the approach more outstanding as compared to other housing welfare mechanisms. The method involves the assessment of vulnerability and the intensity of their needs after which funds are mobilizable from the government and other well-wishers (Kennedy, 2015). The intervention of the initiative reduces the risk of exposure by the homeless. Further, the strategy has become popular in countries like Canada where the awareness creation has not only shifted discussions towards housing but has also been a success factor in mobilizing funds for the vulnerable, thus making a capable system.
Despite its successes, the homelessness is a complex phenomenon. The condition may arise from poverty, shortages of affordable housing, low wages, and marginalization. The reliance on this initial approach is not enough since Housing First and other interventions may solve homelessness but cannot eliminate the causal links, thus making the problem perpetual. The attributes of these causal factors heighten the rental market thereby making the operation of the approach ineffective. Even though such challenges exist, their prevalence does not necessarily negate the positive outcomes. Thus Housing First intervention remains an effective problem solver to homelessness.
Literature Review
Evans, P. M. (2009). Lone mothers, workfare and precarious employment: time for a Canadian basic income?. International Social Security Review, 62(1), 45-63.
The article suggests that unwarranted unemployment rates reveal a significant threat to the current social assistance income policies. Despite the challenges created by lack of job opportunities, research exploration on the topic remains scanty. The aim is to examine the specific consequences of the adverse outcomes for the case of lone mothers living in Ontario, Canada who are unemployed. The study establishes that factors such as gender disparity in welfare systems which provide money to the unemployed isolates the women without husbands and thus significantly contributing to their financial vulnerability. Further, the Basic income (BI) of the mothers alone is inadequate to eradicate the precarious unemployment and can only determine their ability to enter or leave the job market. The basic income approach purports to guarantees citizens, especially the lone of a basic income to cater for their primary needs. Even though the intention of the initiative is acceptable, the problem lies with an infiltrated government system that demeans lone mothers. Because of the ineffectiveness of the BI, the unions of workers and organizations should enhance policies and modernize income security, improve salaries, and the conditions of working. Therefore, due to the challenges the women face because of gender discrimination, social assistance should reinforce the abolishment of such workfare systems and redesign other policies that would bring financial stability to lone mothers.

Social Policy and Children’s Social Welfare
The rate of child poverty is relatively higher in Canada than most of the industrialized countries. Even though the degree is much lower than the developing states; it depicts a troubling state of affairs for countries of such status. The efforts to eliminate the situation receive little success since measures such as (LIM) used to anticipate the conditions obscures the reality and is inefficient in the people in need and the best strategies of offering assistance (McKeen, 2006). Moreover, despite many debates associating poverty to the deprivation of necessities, families can access the primary needs but still live below the LIM thresholds. This situation may validate the LIM approach as a crude measure of inequality in society (UNICEF, 2012). Such discussions also pose the validity of the statistics from child poverty index at 16 percent before taxes and transfers (UNICE, 2012). Thus, necessitates the significance of social policy in establishing the framework of measuring child poverty.
Despite the high poverty index, the federal government of Canada introduced social policy mix in an attempt to alleviate poverty and contribute to the income security for the Canadians. The interventions include benefits for children, family members, people with special needs and other Aboriginal groups of people (McKen, 2006). Moreover, the policies promote other social systems which facilitate education programmes and market attachment program as the key solution to adequate income and thus reduce poverty. Despite the advancements, strategies such as MESO yielded fewer results since it accommodates the political interests, thus portrays more of a policy debate than a policy-making approach (McKen, 2006). Therefore, the successful eradication of child poverty in Canada should focus more on the policy-oriented mechanism that evades political uncertainties decelerating the solution seeking process.
Maltreatment; Data and Prevention
The child maltreatment data from UNICEF scorecard reveals a deplorable state of affairs. The study discloses 235, 842 cases relating to maltreatment which were either reported or speculated. Such incidence comprises of sexual harassment, severe punishments, and family-based violence. Such occurrence not only causes physical harm but also contribute to long term consequences such as persistent mental disorder which affects their relational behaviors and poor academic performance (Hardcastle, Bellis, Hughes & Sethi, 2015). Because of the adverse results, stringent legal policy frameworks are, therefore appropriate for perpetrators of child based violence, for instance, longer jail terms and hefty penalties to curb the atrocities.
Further, the government should fund initiatives that enact child rescue centers where the victims can access quality education and mental health counseling. It is also essential for such policies to promote proper parentage through awareness creation and training. Such policy formulation should advocate for parents involved in the children education by designing programmes like open days for parents, teachers, and students in the school curriculum which enhance participation of the community in respecting the children’s right. Moreover, the government should outlaw corporal punishment and advocate for alternative methods of instilling discipline such as rewarding good behavior, teaching new skills, and providing logical consequences.

Abstract and Figures
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) represent the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) most recent initiative for reducing the plight of the poor. This paper examines whether the PRSPs for Liberia, Afghanistan and Haiti follow World Bank guidance on health. The health data, analysis and strategy content of the three PRSPs are assessed with respect to the 'Health, Nutrition and Population' chapter of the World Bank's PRSP Sourcebook. This guidance states that PRSPs should include: health data on the poor and a clear analysis showing the determinants of ill health and pro-poor health strategies. Unfortunately, none of the PRSPs analysed comply with the guidance and, consequently, do not adequately portray the health situation within their countries. Thus health is not given a high priority in the PRSP process and is seemingly low on the agenda of both poor country governments and the International Financial Institutions (IFIs). If the situation for the world's poorest people is to improve, health and the right to health need to be promoted within PRSPs.

... Between 1999 and 2015, PRSPs were prepared by the poorest countries every 3 years to qualify for concessional lending from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 223, 224 PRSPs have since been replaced by sector-specific lending frame works, but remain a valuable record of how health-sector interventions have been positioned as part of poverty eradication.  ...

... The World Bank's guidelines state that PRSPs should include health data on the poor and a clear analysis showing the determinants of ill-health and detailing pro-poor health strategies. A recent study of the health content of three PRSPs, however, found that none of these comply with the World Bank's guidelines, and they neither adequately portray the health situation within the country nor recommend the necessary policy actions to improve the health situation of the most vulnerable members of society (Bartlett, 2011). Despite increasing recognition that poverty reduction strategies must have a social basis and should not undermine social goals, there is a tendency for adding on a social policy approach as an afterthought to traditional neoliberal macro-economic conditionalities, instead of moving towards a transformational approach that would mainstream social policy into macro-economic policies and thus produce better coherence between macro-economic and social policy objectives (Mohindra, 2007).  ...

... Like any other developing country, the bulk of its poverty was confined to the rural areas (Echeveria, 2000;Barichello, 2004). More than one billion people worldwide live in extreme poverty, with an income of US$ 1.25 per person per day (Bartlett 2011), and Thai conditions are no different. Nine out of 10 inhabitants categorized as poor were living in rural areas, with more than half of this population living in the North Eastern part of Thailand (Anonymous, 2005), which was one of the poorest regions in the country, having an average annual income of US $ 784 (Bowman, 2004).  ...

For nurses, improving health means fighting poverty
Nurses sat shelters and on the street know that homelessness and poor health are intertwined

A client of the Regent Park Community Health Centre had been homeless for years, going to emergency rooms almost daily for a variety of health problems. Nurses at the health centre, working together with other community agencies, decided on an intervention to help the man get back on his feet — starting by diagnosing conditions that hadn’t been addressed in the emergency room, helping him taking his medication regularly and, at long last, finding him supported housing.
“It’s transformed his life,” says Laura Hanson, a nurse with the Regent Park team. Though their clients include downtown residents of all income levels, many are struggling to get by. “Acute care is one aspect of health, but there are so many other factors that go into making you well or not well. Health is not something that’s just biological. Poverty is one of the biggest indicators of health, which really influenced the kind of work I decided to do.”
Research shows that, unsurprisingly, people who can’t afford housing and nutritious food are far more likely to be unhealthy. The grind of being poor, often combined with mental health issues, can make it hard for some people to even access health care services. Many nurses who take prevention to heart have made addressing poverty and homelessness central to their work. Eight months after the provincial government announced it would redouble efforts to achieve its poverty reduction targets, Ontario nurses remain on the front lines of that battle.

“I’m very passionate about health equity,” says Jessica Hales, who works with Toronto Street Health, a four-nurse team dedicated to improving the health and well-being of homeless and underhoused people in downtown Toronto. With more than 5,000 clients, some of whom visit regularly and others whose visits are more erratic, Street Health has adopted a model of health care that treats people more holistically. “The longer I’m in health care, the more I realize that being healthy really extends beyond what medical services can offer,” she says.
Hales started her nursing career in a hospital, where she realized that the increased reliance on technology was extending the lives of some people, but not necessarily helping those most in need. She started volunteering at Street Health and five years ago accepted a position with the team. In April she became Street Health’s first nurse practitioner, a designation which, among other things, allows her to prescribe medication and order diagnostic tests. Now she can offer more intensive care to people who have trouble accessing mainstream health-care services.
Hales’s commitment to getting at the root causes of poor health extends to advocacy outside work hours. Last November she and four other community workers were charged with mischief for staging a sit-in at a city housing office after the city failed to fund a proposal for a 24-hour drop-in shelter for homeless women. (Women in crisis often can’t make the curfews of traditional shelters.) Hales says the charges were dropped in March and the city has agreed to provide funding for two 24-hour drop-in shelters, the first opening in mid-May. “Hopefully it will reduce the rates of sexual and physical violence and will give women a safe place to go if they’re trying to leave unhealthy relationships,” she says.
Not all nurses fighting poverty work so close to the street. As a professor of nursing and psychiatry at Western University, assistant director at the Lawson Health Research Institute and a member on Ontario’s new advisory panel on homelessness, Dr. Cheryl Forchuk comes at poverty and homelessness from an academic angle. But she takes a seriously grassroots approach, improving health-care systems by talking directly to the people who most need help.

The obstacles are not always what the experts think. In one of her studies, Forchuk interviewed homeless veterans. The American literature suggested that post-traumatic stress was a major factor in veteran homelessness, but the Canadian veterans had mostly not served overseas and considered their military experience to be a highlight of their lives. Their military service had not given them post-traumatic stress, but hard-drinking habits emerged as serious drinking problems later in life. The pilot project that came out of the study employed a peer-supported approach that echoed the structure of military life — something that would not likely have worked with post-traumatic stress patients. Of the 56 men who took part in the program, all but one have remained housed.
For Forchuk, listening to patients is at the core of nursing. So is collaborating with other professionals whose decisions about social assistance and housing can be the major factor in how healthy a person is.
“If we’re all in our own corner trying to come up with solutions in a fragmented way, it’s simply not going to work,” Forchuk says. “Addressing homelessness is not at all stepping away from nursing. It’s looking at nursing in a different environment.”

Alright, I have some more information from these sources. Let's see what they're saying about poverty and healthcare.

First, there's a paper about poverty reduction strategies in three countries: Liberia, Afghanistan, and Haiti. It seems like the author is critiquing the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) created by the World Bank and IMF. The PRSPs are supposed to guide countries in reducing poverty, but the author argues that these papers don't adequately address health issues as per the World Bank's own guidelines.

The author suggests that health isn't given enough priority in these strategies, which could be a problem because poor health can perpetuate poverty. So, it seems like there's a disconnect between the intended goals and the actual implementation of these poverty reduction plans.

Another source is about the Lancet NCDI Poverty Commission, which focuses on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among the world's poorest people. It mentions that universal health coverage isn't reaching the bottom billion people, meaning those living in extreme poverty. The commission aims to bridge this gap by addressing the specific health needs of this population.

This suggests that even with global efforts towards universal health coverage, the very poorest are still being left behind. So, there's a need for targeted interventions to reach these individuals.

There's also a chapter from a book discussing global healthcare policy and the austerity agenda. It seems to argue that austerity measures, which often involve cutting public spending, can negatively impact health, especially for the poor.

Austerity can lead to reduced funding for healthcare and social services, which are crucial for the wellbeing of low-income populations. So, there's a concern that focusing on austerity might exacerbate health inequalities.

Another article is about rural poverty in Thailand. It highlights that the majority of poor people live in rural areas and face challenges like lack of access to healthcare and education. The author discusses a case study from a Thai village to illustrate the issues faced by the rural poor.

This aligns with what I've read before—that poverty is often concentrated in rural areas, where access to services is limited. So, addressing rural poverty is essential for improving health outcomes in these regions.

Lastly, there's an article from The Star about nurses working with homeless and low-income populations in Toronto. It emphasizes that nurses are not only providing medical care but also addressing the social determinants of health, like housing and poverty.

The nurses mentioned in the article are involved in finding housing for their clients and advocating for policies that support the homeless. This shows that healthcare providers are recognizing that health isn't just about treating illnesses but also about addressing the underlying social issues that contribute to poor health.

Overall, these sources reinforce the idea that poverty and health are intimately linked. Poverty can lead to poor health due to lack of access to healthcare, nutritious food, and safe housing. Conversely, poor health can trap people in poverty by limiting their ability to work and adding financial burdens from medical expenses.

To break this cycle, comprehensive approaches are needed that address both health and socioeconomic factors. This might include policies that improve access to healthcare, increase social services, and promote economic opportunities for the poor.

It's also clear that global health initiatives need to pay special attention to the poorest populations, as they are often the hardest to reach and have the greatest health needs.

I think the key takeaway is that improving health requires not just medical interventions but also addressing the social and economic conditions that lead to poor health in the first place.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Poverty significantly affects healthcare by limiting access to medical services, reducing the quality of care received, and exacerbating health issues due to poor living conditions and lack of resources.}} \]
