Alright, so I need to figure out how apartheid affected people. I know that apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa for many years. But I need to understand the specific ways it impacted people's lives. Maybe I should start by doing some research to get a better grasp of what apartheid entailed and then see how it played out in people's daily lives.

First, I need to recall what apartheid actually was. I think it was a policy enforced by the South African government that segregated people based on race, giving preferential treatment to white people. But I'm not entirely sure about the details. Perhaps I should look up a definition to start with.

ABOUT THIS WORD
What is Apartheid?
Apartheid refers to the system of racist segregation and political and economic oppression enacted and upheld by white people in South Africa to deny Black and other nonwhite people equal rights.
Apartheid became the official policy of South Africa in 1948 (though racist segregation policies had been employed before that). It was officially in place until the early 1990s, when it was begun to be dismantled after decades of resistance from Black and other nonwhite South Africans—notably Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko, among many others—and sanctions and pressure from the international community.
Apartheid, spelled with a capital A, is most commonly used to refer specifically to South African Apartheid. The lowercase form, apartheid, is used in a more general way to refer to any system that segregates people based on certain characteristics, such as skin color, ethnicity, or caste.

Alright, so from these definitions, I can see that apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that was officially practiced in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. It involved separating people based on race and giving preferential treatment to white people, while denying rights and opportunities to black and other non-white populations. The term itself comes from Afrikaans and Dutch, meaning "separateness" or "apartness."

But definitions only scratch the surface. I need to understand how this affected people's lives on a personal level. What were the day-to-day implications of apartheid for different racial groups in South Africa? How did it shape their experiences, opportunities, and quality of life?

Maybe I should look for information on the specific laws and policies that were part of apartheid. That might help me see how it played out in various aspects of life, like housing, education, employment, and politics.

“
Apartheid is an affront to human rights and human dignity. Normal and friendly relations cannot exist between the United States and South Africa until it becomes a dead policy. Americans are of one mind and one heart on this issue. Ronald Reagan [1]
”
Apartheid (meaning separateness in Afrikaans ), was a social, economic and political policy of racial segregation which was enforced by white minority governments in South Africa from 1948 until June 17, 1991 when the final Apartheid laws were abolished in Parliament. A form of apartheid still exists, however, this time against light-skinned people. A Black socialist majority has implemented race-based Nazi -style seizure laws against white people.

Verwoerd and the Bantustans
Laws passed in 1950 forced a separation of non-whites from whites in South African society.  The first, the Population Registration Act, had people register with a racial classification board to determine "officially" if they belonged to one of four racial groups: White, African, or Coloured (the later split into Coloured and Indian). The second, the Group Areas Act, was the enforced relocation of non-whites into designated urban areas; to compel these people into the new "townships", which were in essence little more than shanty towns. The government ordered the bulldozing of once-vibrant mixed-race communities; the non-white inhabitants, especially the Africans, were ordered to carry passbooks to go from place to place in white areas. [2] Likewise, whites were ordered to relocate from the areas which they settled, that historically belonged to blacks.
Dr. Hendrik F. Verwoerd, Prime Minister of South Africa from 1957 until 1966, designed a system that expanded the scope and impact of apartheid.  Blacks were given a limited education which guaranteed them menial job opportunities as opposed to Whites [5].  The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, passed in 1953, ordered the segregation of blacks at all public facilities, including post offices, public transportation, beaches, sports venues, parks, toilets, and even cemeteries. [3]
"There is no place for him [the African] in the European community above the level of certain forms of labor. Within his own community, however, all doors are open. For that reason it is to no avail for him to receive a training which has as its aim absorption in the European community, where he cannot be absorbed." Hendrik F. Verwoerd (1954) [4]
Verwoerd had also insisted – and succeeded – in getting limited self-administration in the black reservations (called "homelands") of the Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ganzankulu, KwaNdebele, KwaZulu, Lebowa, and QwaQwa, which meant they were semi-autonomous.  This had also meant that the homelands were now responsible for their own societal and economic problems. 'Africans' were denied citizenship and were instead granted full voting rights in several 'homelands' or bantustans. [5]
Independence of four Bantustans
Four of the Bantustans, Transkei (1976), Ciskei (1981), Bophuthatswana (1977), and Venda (1979), were eventually declared independent nations by South Africa, albeit without any international recognition other than from each other.
During their period of independence, these four nations were often derided by critics claiming they were puppet governments of South Africa, but the Transkei government had a rocky relationship with South Africa, breaking diplomatic relations between 1978 and 1980 over territorial disputes, and then undergoing a military coup d'état in 1987 after which Transkei became an ally of, and safe haven for, the African National Congress.
In Bophuthatswana on the other hand, an attempted coup in 1988 was suppressed by South Africa, who restored president Kgosi Lucas Manyane Mangope.  The Sun City casino was located in Bophuthatswana, where gambling was legal (it was illegal in South Africa).  Ciskei and Venda both underwent military coups in 1990, which South Africa did not suppress.
All four countries were re-incorporated into South Africa in April 1994 following the end of Apartheid and the adoption of a new South African constitution, but Bophuthatswana and Ciskei at first declared their refusal to re-integrate and their intention to remain independent nations.  Both stand-offs ended after mutinies and coup d'états deposed their respective leaders within two weeks of each other in March 1994.
1983 Whites-only referendum
In 1983 President PW Botha put the question of allowing Colored and Indian representation to the White electorate. 66% of whites voted to allow Coloreds and Indians their own houses of parliament (called the House of Representatives and the House of Delegates respectively).
Although many ultra-nationalistic and conservative Whites attacked the move as it was power-sharing (which they feared would result in Black rule)
The Troubles
The followers of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi (Zulu King) and his Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) were staunchly pro-separation and even entered into a short-lived non-aggression pact with the AWB in 1993.
However the African National Congress, who drew members from most other Black tribes, were pro-integration and, as such, Zulu workers who had migrated to White South Africa were frequently involved in clashes with ANC supporters in the townships (Black areas adjoining many White towns and cities).
Between 1986 and 1994 some 10,000 IFP members were murdered by ANC supporters, many in a brutal fashion, the practice of "necklacing" was very popular amongst ANC members. Necklacing entailed placing a petrol-filled tire around the neck of a victim and then setting it alight.
Since the abolition of apartheid due to changes demanded by liberal outsiders South Africa has struggled as a society.
Apartheid 2.0
The ANC created an apartheid 2.0 wich means white South Africans don't have the same rights as black South Africans. It results in an impoverished white population and mass murder of whites (the so-called plaasmoorden ). Western MSM doesn't report of this because of their anti-white political agenda. [6]

What were the laws of the apartheid system in South Africa?
Apartheid Becomes Law
By 1950, the government had banned marriages between whites and people of other races, and prohibited sexual relations between black and white South Africans. In some cases, the legislation split families; parents could be classified as white, while their children were classified as colored.
Who made the apartheid laws?
When did apartheid start? Racial segregation had long existed in white minority-governed South Africa, but the practice was extended under the government led by the National Party (1948–94), and the party named its racial segregation policies apartheid (Afrikaans: “apartness”).
What was the impact of apartheid laws?
An effect of the law was to exclude non-whites from living in the most developed areas. Many non-whites were forcibly removed for living in the wrong areas. In addition, the non-white majority was given a much smaller area of the country. Subsequently, the white minority owned most of the nation’s land.
What were the restrictions imposed on the Black in South Africa?
The Natives’ Land Act of 1913 defined less than one-tenth of South Africa as Black “reserves” and prohibited any purchase or lease of land by Blacks outside the reserves. The law also restricted the terms of tenure under which Blacks could live on white-owned farms.
What does segregation mean in South Africa?
Trains, buses, taxis, hotels, hospitals, schools and colleges, libraries, cinema halls, theaters, beaches, swimming pools, public toilets, were all separate for the whites and blacks in South Africa. This was called ‘Segregation’.
Who helped end apartheid in South Africa?
The apartheid system in South Africa was ended through a series of negotiations between 1990 and 1993 and through unilateral steps by the de Klerk government. These negotiations took place between the governing National Party, the African National Congress, and a wide variety of other political organizations.

The system of racial segregation in South Africa known as apartheid was implemented and enforced by many acts and other laws. This legislation served to institutionalise racial discrimination and the dominance by white people over people of other races. While the bulk of this legislation was enacted after the election of the National Party government in 1948, it was preceded by discriminatory legislation enacted under earlier British and Afrikaner governments. Apartheid is distinguished from segregation in other countries by the systematic way in which it was formalised in law.

Segregationist legislation before apartheid[edit]
Although apartheid as a comprehensive legislative project truly began after the National Party came into power in 1948, many of these statutes were preceded by the laws of the previous British and Afrikaner administrations in South Africa's provinces. [1] [2] An early example is the Glen Grey Act, passed in 1894 in Cape Colony, and which had the effect of diminishing the land rights of Africans in scheduled areas. [3]

Population registration and segregation[edit]
The Population Registration Act, 1950, required that every South African be classified into one of a number of racial "population groups". This act provided the foundation upon which the whole edifice of apartheid would be constructed.
The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, 1953 allowed public premises, vehicles and services to be segregated by race, even if equal facilities were not made available to all races.
The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act was repealed by the Discriminatory Legislation regarding Public Amenities Repeal Act, 1990, and the Population Registration Act was repealed by the Population Registration Act Repeal Act, 1991, but the racial classifications remained on the population register until 1992.

Political representation[edit]
The South Africa Act 1909, which united the four South African colonies into a unitary state, preserved electoral arrangements unchanged, meaning that qualified black voters in the Cape Province could vote for the House of Assembly. This was an entrenched clause, protected by a provision requiring a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of Parliament to alter the Cape Qualified Franchise.
The Representation of Natives Act, 1936, passed with the necessary two-thirds majority, removed black voters in the Cape from the common voters' roll and placed them on a separate roll, allowing them to elect only three members to the House of Assembly. The act also provided for four indirectly elected Senators to represent black people countrywide. Qualified coloured voters in the Cape remained on the common roll.
The Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act, 1946 allowed Indians in the Transvaal Province and Natal Province to elect three members of the House of Assembly and two Senators, but this representation was removed by the Asiatic Laws Amendment Act, 1948.
The Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951 removed coloured voters in the Cape from the common voters' roll and placed them on a separate roll, allowing them to elect only four members to the House of Assembly. It was not, initially, passed with a two-thirds majority, and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court invalidated it on this basis, precipitating the "coloured vote constitutional crisis ". The government subsequently altered the method of election of the Senate and passed the South Africa Act Amendment Act, 1956 with a two-thirds majority, validating the Separate Representation of Voters Act.
The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959 abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act.
The Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968, abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for coloured people, and the Coloured Persons Representative Council Amendment Act, 1968 replaced it with an elected "Representative Council" with limited powers.
The Prohibition of Political Interference Act, 1968 prohibited multi-racial political parties.
The Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1983 established a tricameral Parliament with separate houses representing whites, coloureds and Indians. Blacks remained unrepresented.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 established universal non-racial adult suffrage.
Separate development and bantustans[edit]
The Native Administration Act, 1927 gave the executive government wide-ranging authority to govern the "native reserves", and the people living in them, by proclamation.
The Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 established a hierarchy of tribal, regional and territorial authorities, led by chiefs and appointed councillors, to govern the reserves.
The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959 provided for the development of the territorial authorities into self-governing bantustans.
The Bantu Investment Corporation Act, 1959 established a corporation to develop the economies of the bantustans.
The Transkei Constitution Act, 1963 made the Transkei an autonomous self-governing territory, with a partially elected assembly.
The Bantu Homelands Development Corporations Act, 1965 established separate economic development corporations for the various homelands.
The Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970 made black people citizens of one of the bantustans, with the intention that when the bantustans became independent they would cease to be South African citizens.
The Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, 1971 allowed other homelands to become autonomous self-governing territories, similar to the Transkei.
The Status of the Transkei Act, 1976 declared the Transkei to be an independent state and no longer part of South Africa. This independence was not recognised by any country other than South Africa.
The Status of Bophuthatswana Act, 1977, the Status of Venda Act, 1979, and the Status of Ciskei Act, 1981, similarly declared Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei to be independent states.
The bantustans were abolished by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993, and the nominally independent states were integrated back into South Africa.

Answer:
Black citizens were denied access to the same public facilities as whites.
Marriages between white and nonwhite citizens were forbidden.
Nonwhite citizens were required to carry identification papers with them at all times.
Explanation:
Apartheid was the system of law that segregated the people based on their race and skin color. This is basically aimed at the Blacks who were discriminated and persecuted, with the whites claiming them to be inferior to them (the whites).
This racial segregation led to the numerous instances of protests and even killings, violent outbursts and encounters of citizens and the government. Among the numerous 'rules and regulations' for the Blacks, there are some prominent ones that they are required to be followed at all times. First and foremost is the denial of access to the same restrooms and even lunch halls in public. Seats in buses and public transport systems also have a separate side for them. Moreover, marriage of both races is strictly forbidden, and in case such unions happen, it becomes a life of torture for the mixed race children. Lastly, they are required to carry their identification papers at all times, which the must produce whenever they are asked to. This does not apply for the white folks.

So, apartheid was a system of laws that enforced racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. It was instituted by the National Party, which came to power in 1948, and it was based on the idea of separating different racial groups and maintaining white supremacy.

From the search results, I can see that there were numerous laws enacted to support this system. Let me try to categorize them to better understand how apartheid affected people's lives.

First, there were laws related to population registration and segregation. The Population Registration Act of 1950 required everyone in South Africa to be classified into one of four racial groups: White, African (black), Coloured, or Indian. This classification determined where people could live, work, and access public services.

Second, there were job reservation and economic apartheid laws. These laws reserved certain jobs for white people only and restricted non-whites from entering certain professions. This ensured that whites maintained economic优势 over other racial groups.

Third, there was segregation in education. The Bantu Education Act of 1953 established a separate educational system for black South Africans, which was inferior in quality compared to that provided for whites. This was intended to limit the intellectual development and opportunities for black people.

Fourth, there were laws prohibiting interracial relationships. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 and the Immorality Act of 1950 made it illegal for whites to marry or have sexual relations with non-whites.

Fifth, land tenure and geographic segregation were enforced through laws like the Group Areas Act of 1950, which designated certain areas for specific racial groups and forcibly removed non-whites from areas designated for whites.

Sixth, pass laws and influx control regulated the movement of non-whites, requiring them to carry passbooks when traveling in white areas and restricting their residency in urban areas.

Seventh, political representation was severely limited for non-whites. The Separate Representation of Voters Act of 1951 removed coloured voters from the common voters' roll and placed them on a separate roll with limited representation.

Lastly, the concept of "separate development" and the creation of bantustans, or homelands, was intended to create semi-autonomous territories for different black ethnic groups, effectively removing them from the South African body politic.

These laws collectively created a rigid social structure where non-white citizens had significantly fewer rights and opportunities compared to white citizens. They faced discrimination in housing, education, employment, and political participation. The system was designed to maintain white supremacy and control over the country's resources and institutions.

Moreover, the enforcement of these laws led to widespread human rights abuses, including forced removals, police brutality, and the criminalization of opposition to apartheid. The anti-apartheid movement, including figures like Nelson Mandela and organizations like the African National Congress, fought against these injustices through various forms of resistance, which eventually led to the dismantling of apartheid in the early 1990s.

In summary, apartheid was a comprehensive system of institutionalized racism that profoundly affected the lives of millions of South Africans, shaping their experiences and opportunities based solely on their racial classification.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Apartheid was a system of laws in South Africa from 1948 to 1994 that enforced racial segregation and discrimination, creating separate and unequal treatment for different racial groups, particularly disadvantaging black, coloured, and Indian populations in areas such as housing, education, employment, and political rights.}} \]
