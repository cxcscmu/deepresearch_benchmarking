Alright, so I've been asked, "Why is America divided?" Hmm, that's a pretty broad question, and there's probably not one single answer to it. I guess division in America can refer to political, social, economic, or even cultural differences among its people. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, I know that America is a diverse country with people from all walks of life. There are different races, ethnicities, religions, and beliefs. So, naturally, there might be some divisions based on these differences. But I think the question is more about the recent polarizations we've seen, especially in politics.

Political division seems to be a big part of it. I've noticed that in recent years, the gap between Democrats and Republicans has widened. It feels like they can't agree on much these days. I remember reading somewhere that partisan politics have become more extreme, with moderates being squeezed out. Maybe that's contributing to the division.

Also, social issues seem to be a major source of division. Things like abortion, same-sex marriage, immigration, and gun control are extremely polarizing. People have strong opinions about these topics, and often, those opinions are tied to their political affiliations. So, maybe the division is加深 because these issues are being used as battle grounds in political fights.

Economics could also be a factor. Income inequality has been on the rise in the US. There's a growing gap between the rich and the poor. This can lead to resentment and feelings of unfairness, which might divide people along class lines. Additionally, job insecurity and globalization have impacted many communities, leading to frustration and division.

Media plays a role too, I think. With the advent of cable news and social media, people can cherry-pick the sources that align with their beliefs. This creates echo chambers where people only hear viewpoints that reinforce their own, making it harder to find common ground with those who disagree.

History also hasn't helped. The US has a complicated past with slavery, civil rights movements, and ongoing issues with racism. These historical divisions still resonate today and affect how people perceive and interact with one another.

Moreover, the 2020 presidential election and its aftermath seem to have exacerbated divisions. The Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, was a stark reminder of how divided the country has become. Misinformation and distrust in institutions have fueled this division, making it difficult to have rational discussions.

I should also consider regional differences. The US is a large country with distinct regional identities. For example, the Northeast and the South have different cultures and priorities, which can lead to divisions on certain issues.

Perhaps another aspect is the urban-rural divide. Urban areas tend to be more progressive, while rural areas are more conservative. This difference in values and lifestyles can create divisions.

Education might play a role as well. Access to quality education varies across the country, and educational attainment is linked to political views and socioeconomic status. So, differences in education levels could contribute to division.

I should also think about generational differences. Younger generations have different priorities and beliefs compared to older generations. For instance, attitudes toward LGBTQ+ rights, climate change, and technology differ significantly across age groups.

Healthcare is another area where there's a lot of division. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, has been a contentious issue, with Republicans generally opposing it and Democrats supporting it. Access to healthcare is a fundamental concern for many Americans, and disagreements over how to provide it contribute to division.

Foreign policy also divides the nation. Opinions on immigration, trade agreements, and military interventions vary widely, reflecting different visions for America's role in the world.

Lastly, the pandemic has highlighted existing divisions and created new ones. Mask mandates, vaccine requirements, and government responses to the crisis have become politicized, further splitting the country along partisan lines.

So, in summary, America is divided due to a complex interplay of political polarization, social issues, economic inequalities, media influences, historical legacies, regional differences, urban-rural disparities, educational variations, generational shifts, healthcare debates, foreign policy disagreements, and the impact of the pandemic. It's a multifaceted problem without easy solutions.

I think to get a more nuanced understanding, I should look up some statistics and studies on this topic. Maybe see what experts have to say about the root causes of division in America.

Let me try searching for some information.

Political Division in America – What's Causing it, and How Do We Fix It?
Political Division in America – What’s Causing it, and How Do We Fix It?
Political division has become a serious problem in America. But what is causing this divide between right and left? I discuss that with Ross Benes, author of Rural Rebellion: How Nebraska Became a Republican Stronghold. In his book, Ross discusses what is causing the political division in the US, and what that means for real people. We’ll discuss his views of what’s dividing Americans and how we can address it.
What is Political Division?
A definition for political division that I use is “a situation in a country when people are incapable of coming together to discuss how the country should be run due to excessive partisanship or ideology.” We can see this in America today with our inability to have a political discussion.
Partisanship in America
These partisan divides are nothing new, though. In fact, the first partisan political division in the united states occurred between the federalists and anti-federalists. Or, if you want to include our time as colonies, we had deep divides between the Loyalists and Patriots. Our fervent and lively political dialogue has been a good thing, helping us move forward as a nation. Sadly, in the last few years, we've lost our ability to discuss ideas and do so in a productive way. Ever since the first partisan political division, we've been fighting these battles, but the tactics recently have been a bit out of bounds.
Why is Political Division so Bad?
The issue with division is that we ought to have some semblance of unity as a nation. We should be able to see our neighbor as a fellow countryman, even if we disagree.  The fever pitch in American politics today is largely due to a mistrust of our neighbor combined with economic and political trends that hurt some while helping others. We are not supposed to agree on everything, but we should be able to agree to respect each other and live in civil society together.
Diving into the Problems and Solutions
Benes' book looks at the data and the stories to understand why this is happening. And, I think that is the approach we need. Looking at the data helps us learn about the trends in society at large, but the anecdotes and stories give us a glimpse at the people that underly the statistics. To solve a big problem, we'll need both.
A few of the things Ross and I discuss in this interview:
1. The thesis of his book: Rural Rebellion: How Nebraska Became a Republican Stronghold
2. Is this political division in the US a problem or just a trend we ought to be aware of?
3. What is influencing this deepening divide between urban and rural?
4. Does the media exacerbate political division? Or, is there an issue with the face we consume different media in different areas?
5. What is the potential fallout of this trend of increasing divisions? What other problems could it cause?
6. What are some solutions if we want to counteract this trend? How can we move toward a more unified country?
So, if you're looking to heal the political divide, find unity, and mend our country, this is a great conversation.

In one sense political divisiveness has always been with us. The United States was birthed in political animosity. If you doubt it, go read about the contention between figures such as John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, or between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.
And, of course, there was that little matter between Hamilton and Aaron Burr that resulted in a duel–a fatal one for Hamilton.
So why do we think the divisiveness of modern politics is so historically unique? How can some people say that the debates of our own time are worse than those which not infrequently consummated in two men firing pistols at each other?
Is there some sense in which contemporary political debates are divisive in a way the older ones were not? How exactly does the attack on Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s home differ from a duel?
Although the debates of the founding era were indeed divisive, their worst excesses were largely the result of personal animosities, many of them cases in which confidences were broken or in which there was a personal insult that required satisfaction.
The political debates too–whether there should be a national bank, or what kind of relations we should have with revolutionary France–were largely matters of how some particular end might be accomplished. It was seldom about the end itself.
And this is the difference between today’s politics and the politics of yore: It is now not only the means that are in contention, but the ends themselves.
The American founders were revolutionaries not by nature, but by circumstance: They sought not to throw off, but to exercise the rights and values of their colonizers (unlike the French, who are the precursors, in this respect, of the modern left who did dispute them).
This is what we see today with the rise of what we might call the Jacobin Left (“Jacobin” being the label adopted by the most ruthless of the French Revolutionaries). While conservatives, by the very nature of their attitude toward life, are more inclined toward social and political stability founded on permanent verities, today’s left increasingly sees its purpose as the questioning of these verities.
Today’s left consists increasingly in the challenge to, not the perpetuation of, political and social norms and conventions. Today’s left doesn’t just bemoan a loss in a presidential election: It challenges the legitimacy of the electoral college. It doesn’t argue for better relations between the sexes, it contests what gender means in the first place. It doesn’t just contest conservative policies toward marriage, it questions the definition of marriage itself.
This is why we are likely to see more calls for “political action” that resolve into violent protest. The deeper the disagreement, the more acrimonious the debate. And it’s likely to get worse.

Making Up Is Hard to Do
This election has divided Americans like few in history. Can the country put itself back together again?
By Conor Friedersdorf
Edmon de Haro
November 2016 Issue
Are you ever nostalgic for the bygone days when the cable networks sorted Americans neatly into a red team and a blue team, and we fought over the patriot Act, the Iraq War, and gay marriage? There was a lot to lament. Many people felt anxious about how divided the country seemed. But then a charismatic young man with a white mother and a black father tried to comfort us. “The pundits like to slice and dice our country into … red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats,” he said. “But I’ve got news for them … We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don’t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and, yes, we’ve got gay friends in the red states … We are one people.”
Back in 2004, we didn’t know whether Barack Obama was right, but no matter. “Try to see it my way,” the Beatles counseled. “Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. While you see it your way, there’s a chance that we might fall apart before too long.” So we made him a senator, and then the president.
There was still a lot to lament.
But his successor will be someone Americans like less: This year, both major presidential candidates surpass all predecessors in the dislike they engender.
So I’m nostalgic for the days when the country appeared united, or at the very least united in halves. Today, people who recently seemed as though they were on the same team are at odds. (Even Jay Z and Beyoncé seem shaky!)
In politics, the GOP coalition that married on Fox News in 2000, honeymooned in Baghdad, and separated during the Tea Party was, by the time it convened in Cleveland in July, divorcing. Many social gatherings got awkward. Was it weird to invite pro-Trumpers and Never Trumpers?
Then Hillary Clinton went to Philadelphia to accept the Democratic nomination. Some Bernie Sanders supporters declared that the primaries had been rigged. One crowd in a public square cheered a speaker who vowed that there would be “a massive de-registration” from the Democratic Party. Another crowd with bernie or bust signs chanted “Revolution!”
On campus, kids of the same generation, who chose to enroll at the same colleges, having been selected by the same admissions officers, based largely on their similar cognitive profiles, spent the last school year feuding about the inclusiveness of their communities and how to regulate one another’s speech. We have witnessed Occupy Wall Street protests that vilified “the 1 percent.” The treatment of cops who have killed young black men has divided dozens of municipalities: Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee have erupted into riots. On the far right, dozens flocked to Ammon Bundy during his armed standoff with law enforcement in Oregon.
Confronted with a Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a Dylann Roof, or an Omar Mateen, Americans remain united: At minimum, the penalty for lethal terrorism or mass murder should be permanent removal from the community, regardless of the perpetrator’s allegiances.
But many people now seem inclined to favor banishment for ideological infractions, too. A common theme is fight or flight. Campaign events come to blows. An anti-Hillary faction has taken to chanting “Lock her up!” during Trump rallies. Some anti-Trump voters swear that, this time, they really will move abroad if he is elected (for more on this phenomenon, see “ How Voters Respond to Electoral Defeat ”). Some college students believe the penalty for hate speech ought to be expulsion; others say they need “safe spaces.” Libertarians have debated the wisdom of floating ocean platforms that are states unto themselves. On the secular left, many believe a Christian bakery that declines to bake a cake for a gay wedding or a Catholic hospital that doesn’t perform abortions should be compelled to do so. Rod Dreher, a thoughtful religious traditionalist, is leading a group of thinkers who believe the only way forward is withdrawal into enclaves apart from secular culture.
Edmon de Haro
Perhaps a lucky few Americans really can flee into what they regard as utopias. But for most, the impulse to withdraw, or to force the withdrawal of others, is rooted in a reluctance to face this reality: No matter who wins the election, or the next skirmish in the culture wars, most Americans must live together, and will live together, within these borders, with people whose actions or views are anathema to them.
How, then, can we get along? Many believe the country would be at peace if only we better educated our children. On the right, one ideal is for more kids to learn from both a mother and a father; attend Sunday school; study civics; and, in college, glean wisdom from the Great Books. Aristotle! Plutarch! Montesquieu! What could be a better foundation for good citizenship? Progressives, for their part, might propose a Montessori education, a gay-straight alliance at a diverse high school, college classes that teach “cultural competency,” time abroad, and a workplace where new hires go through sexual-harassment training.
In either case, trying to teach our way out of this problem could doom us to failure.
Karen Stenner, a political psychologist, has spent significant time studying the people who express an outsize share of political, racial, and moral intolerance. The threat this cohort poses to liberal democracies springs not from flawed or inadequate socialization, she argues, but from a largely immutable characteristic: They are inclined to want oneness and sameness. As long as they perceive their country to be sufficiently unified and in consensus, that need is met, and they are relatively tolerant.
But when their need for unity is threatened, as is inevitable in liberal democracies, they lash out. They may demand racial discrimination, restrictions on immigration, limits on free speech, stricter policies on homosexuality, and harsher punishments for criminals.
Stenner says that these people have a psychological predisposition to “authoritarianism”—and whole countries suffer when it is activated. This is not, to be clear, a political designation. Nor is it akin to conservatism, false stereotypes to the contrary.
Regrettably, nothing is more certain to trigger authoritarianism “than the likes of ‘multicultural education,’ bilingual policies, and nonassimilation,” Stenner writes. “Our showy celebration of, and absolute insistence upon, individual autonomy and unconstrained diversity pushes those by nature least equipped to live comfortably in a liberal democracy not to the limits of their tolerance, but to their intolerant extremes.” By contrast, she notes, “nothing inspires greater tolerance from the intolerant than an abundance of common and unifying beliefs, practices, rituals, institutions, and processes.”
Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and the author of The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion, believes that Stenner’s theory helps explain Donald Trump’s embrace of authoritarian logic and rhetoric. When the Democrats adopted “We are stronger together” as a convention slogan, Haidt observes, it was almost as if they were heeding the advice of scholars like Stenner to suppress intolerance by celebrating sameness. In Haidt’s telling, the convention’s most successful moment was when Khizr Khan stood onstage with his wife, brandishing a pocket Constitution and declaring, “We are honored to stand here as the parents of Captain Humayun Khan, and as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country.”
If progressives balk at this prescription—if they resent the idea of parading sameness or of dialing down the type of multiculturalist rhetoric that’s been shown to provoke the intolerant—they might reflect on Stenner’s warning: Given that immutable attributes constrain a person’s ability to deal with differences, “well-meaning programs celebrating multiculturalism … might aggravate more than educate, might intensify rather than diminish, intolerance.”
Progressives may find comfort in the fact that ideological conservatives wishing to fight balkanization must swallow an equally bitter pill. According to Stenner, another thing that triggers intolerance is the perception—promoted by many on the right since 2008—that a polity’s leaders are failing and untrustworthy.
Most conservatives will rightly decline to cease all criticism of politicians. But they could, while still holding officials accountable, cut out lies and wild hyperbole. Our ability to live together as a country is harmed when prominent intellectuals on the right assert, as Andrew C. McCarthy did in his book The Grand Jihad, that President Obama is allied with America’s Islamist enemy, or, as Dinesh D’Souza has, that Obama’s approach is best explained by African anticolonial ideology—just as it was harmed by those who compared George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler or insisted that his administration plotted the attacks of 9/11.
The incentives to spread polarizing allegations would shrink if the right reversed one of its biggest strategic errors: retreating from shared institutions, especially in academia and the mainstream media, to create shadow alternatives. The high-water mark of the Reagan Revolution preceded the rise of right-wing talk radio, Fox News, and Breitbart.com; movement conservatism has declined in the new, fragmented information ecosystem. Meanwhile, the dearth of ideological diversity harms both the media and academia, which are less rigorous than they would otherwise be, less likely to grasp conservative principles, and less likely to unify people.
Today, even people who recently seemed as though they were on the same team are at odds.
The left can help reintegrate conservatives into institutions where they face a hostile climate. This process should be eased by the realization that authoritarian psychology, not conservative ideology, is the main driver of intolerance. In fact, traditional conservatism has the potential to combat intolerance: Laissez-faire conservatives are predisposed to reject coerced sameness. Status quo conservatives, meanwhile, can be an important check against new demands for intolerance.
Reformers on the left and right alike must give up the fantasy that humans are blank slates who can be overwritten with ideal values, however discomfiting or disappointing the realization may be. As Stenner puts it, we can moralize all day about how we want ideal citizens to be, “but democracy is most secure, and tolerance is maximized, when we design systems to accommodate how people actually are.”
Nor can we take for granted that the next generation will overcome today’s divisions. After studying post-conflict Bosnia, Borislava Manojlovic, a researcher at Seton Hall University, found that members of the generation that started the Balkan wars now tend to be more tolerant toward one another than their children are. A 24-year-old explained why to World Affairs: “The people who fought the last war had lived together for forty-some years,” he said. “They still have memories of the good old times … We are a ticking time bomb.”
In the U.S., the World War II generation worked together by necessity. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that, as that generation passed from the scene—succeeded by Baby Boomers, who began coming of age in the polarized 1960s—the country began to splinter. This fragmentation has brought more intolerance. Indeed, the Baby Boomers’ kids, the Millennials, are more likely than past generations to favor political intolerance in the form of free-speech restrictions.
Even if America is unlikely to descend into another civil war, our present trajectory carries huge risks. Millennials may take charge of the country without much memory of a functional Congress, tolerant public discourse, or social circles that transcend our atomized subcultures. Today’s college students can scarcely recall a life free of internet trolls!
The good news is that counteracting polarization is not a lost cause, if only Americans are circumspect enough to recognize what we have in common. American identity—unlike, say, Danish identity—does not revolve around shared ancestry, or a culture that is existentially threatened by changing demographics. Rather, it is grounded in a shared if unrealized aspiration to guarantee the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
Nonauthoritarians on the left and right will always clash on how to achieve that goal. But better to cooperate with those you believe to be misguided than to risk mutual destruction.

Why America Is So Divided Today

There is no advanced industrial democracy in the world more politically divided, or politically dysfunctional, than the United States today. How did the world’s most powerful country get to this point? To paraphrase a great American writer—slowly, then suddenly. The Capitol riot was not just years in the making, but decades. That’s because of three distinct features of American society that have been ignored by U.S. politicians for far too long: the enduring legacy of race, the changing nature of capitalism, and the fracturing of our collective media landscape.

The U.S. Capitol Riot Was Years in the Making. Here's Why America Is So Divided
Ideas
By Ian Bremmer
January 16, 2021 11:30 AM EST
Bremmer is a foreign affairs columnist and editor-at-large at TIME. He is the president of Eurasia Group, a political-risk consultancy, and GZERO Media, a company dedicated to providing intelligent and engaging coverage of international affairs. He teaches applied geopolitics at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and his most recent book is Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism.
T here is no advanced industrial democracy in the world more politically divided, or politically dysfunctional, than the United States today. How did the world’s most powerful country get to this point? To paraphrase a great American writer —slowly, then suddenly. The Capitol riot was not just years in the making, but decades. That’s because of three distinct features of American society that have been ignored by U.S. politicians for far too long: the enduring legacy of race, the changing nature of capitalism, and the fracturing of our collective media landscape.
Begin with race; the U.S. is far from unique in having a troubled history with race relations. But it has been particularly slow to address the structural legacy of that racism—it took nearly a century following the end of the Civil War for the 1964 Civil Rights Act to get passed, to cite just one example. Steps have been taken in recent decades to begin addressing this legacy in earnest, from anti-discrimination laws to affirmative action efforts. It has worked to bring Black Americans toward a more even footing, even paving the way for the U.S. to elect its first Black president. But as the Black Lives Matter protests this past summer made all too clear there is still much work left unfinished.
And that’s only part of the story. The other part is the backlash, as a group of white Americans—many of them white rural—are seeing their status in society threatened as a result of demographics and the recent racial reckoning. That has manifested itself both in politics—see redistricting and voter suppression schemes—as well as the violence we witnessed at the Capitol. While this anxiety has economic elements (more about that in a bit), it is best understood in terms of broader identity (and if you haven’t read Isabel Wilkerson’s Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, you should). Years in the making, these feelings of resentment hit a fever pitch in the Trump years, culminating in last week’s deadly riot. To be clear, the U.S. is not the only country that has to deal with elements of racism in their populist movements—plenty of European countries can attest to that. But given the structural way racism has been woven into the country’s fabric combined with years of neglecting the problem, race relations have contributed mightily to the current state of U.S. political affairs.
Then there is the evolving nature of capitalism. Capitalism and the economic growth it drove is what made the U.S. the world’s preeminent superpower in the latter half of the 20th century. The entrepreneurial spirit of American-style capitalism in particular generated the kinds of innovations and growth that were exported around the world, helped along by globalization. America’s enduring faith in capitalism, and specifically the power of the individual, is the reason generations of immigrants made their way to the U.S., to give their dreams the best chance of succeeding. It’s also why the country today is home to the companies—especially technology companies—that power our modern world (at least in the West).
But there’s the flip side to U.S.-style capitalism—this capitalist, individualist economic system generates tremendous amounts of wealth, but it has also resulted in an average American worker with less of a social safety net (especially compared to European counterparts), not to mention a political system more prone to capture by moneyed special interests. Again, this is not something new that suddenly appeared with Trump’s arrival at the White House. Yet while U.S. capitalism has long allowed for inequality of outcomes, in the last thirty years we’ve increasingly seen the rise of inequality of opportunity as well. And this latter form is more devastating—when people feel that they never even got a shot to compete, let alone to succeed, they get angry. And it’s accelerating. 30 years ago, when we spoke about those who lost out from capitalism, we usually referred to a specific set of blue-collar workers left behind by free trade (in a globalized world, U.S. workers that earn more than the global average are less attractive to hire). But now we are getting to the point where automation and AI are slowly looking to displace a far wider set of workers, and across socio-economic classes. As the rise of politicians like Bernie Sanders shows, this is as much a concern for voters on the left side of the political spectrum as it is on the right. The end result is a more divided electorate, fueled by fear about how they are going to survive in an American future that gives the have’s more and the have-not’s less, with less prospect of moving from one group to the other.
Which brings us to the media. The same tech companies that power our modern world have also brought a revolution in our media consumption. Plenty are quick to point their fingers at the tech companies for fracturing our media landscape, but in hindsight the evolution of social media has followed a familiar path—talk radio, cable news and blogs were all once mass media ways of communicating that over time fragmented into more and more niche offerings until consumers could “enjoy” only those viewpoints that reinforced their own. The speed of technology is such that we’ve seen the fracturing happen much quicker with social media, but the truly disruptive element tech companies have introduced is algorithms—actively designed to capture more ad revenues and attention, often achieved by promoting extremist and misleading content. And it has come at the cost of a healthy and informed citizenry.
Compared to countries in Europe where tech platforms face more severe government regulation and must take more responsibility for content posted, the U.S. has a particular problem given its inclination to go lighter on private sector regulation. But the U.S. government won’t be able to sit on the sidelines much longer given recent developments—while plenty cheered at Twitter and Facebook’s decision to de-platform Trump in the wake of the Capitol riot, it opens serious questions about who has the democratic right to limit others’ speech. U.S. politicians will have to wade in lest they effectively cede that power to unelected tech CEOs, a recipe for a disaster of a whole other sort.
*
There are other contributing factors to today’s U.S. political divisions, but for me, these three are the most structural, and the most crucial. Even more worrying, no matter what happens with recent impeachment efforts, all three of these trends are set to grow stronger over the near-term. Absent more earnest efforts across the political spectrum to deal with these issues—and make the political compromises necessary to truly address them—these are problems that will grow worse.
Joe Biden faces numerous challenges when he takes office. And while tackling the pandemic may be his most immediate challenge, it isn’t his more daunting. Vaccines can end pandemics after all, but we don’t have a vaccine for our political divisions.

Alright, so I've got these five documents from my search on why America is divided. Let's see what they have to say.

The first one is from "Conversation of Our Generation" and it's about political division in America. It mentions that political division is nothing new, referencing historical partisan conflicts. It suggests that the current division is due to excessive partisanship and ideology, making it hard for people to have productive discussions. The author also points out that while partisanship has always existed, recent tactics have been "out of bounds." It seems like the article is setting the stage for a deeper discussion on the causes and possible solutions to this division.

The second document is from Intellectual Takeout, titled "Why is America Divided?" It argues that today's political divisiveness is different from the past because it's not just about the means but also about the ends. The author compares today's left to the Jacobins of the French Revolution, suggesting that the modern left questions fundamental norms and conventions, whereas conservatives are more inclined towards preserving existing structures. This seems to suggest that the depth of the disagreement is greater now, which might explain why the division feels more acute.

The third article is from The Atlantic, titled "Making Up Is Hard to Do." It reflects on the divisiveness of the 2016 election and how it exposed deep fractures in American society. The author, Conor Friedersdorf, notes that both major presidential candidates were disliked by significant portions of the population, which is unusual. He also mentions various instances of division, from political protests to campus clashes over speech codes. The article suggests that people are increasingly resorting to "fight or flight" responses, either engaging in physical confrontations or seeking to separate themselves from those with differing views.

The fourth piece is from RealClearPolitics, with the title "Why America Is So Divided Today," written by Ian Bremmer. This article identifies three key factors contributing to America's division: the enduring legacy of race, the changing nature of capitalism, and the fracturing of the media landscape. Bremmer argues that these issues have been neglected by politicians for too long, leading to a boiling point. He discusses how race relations, economic inequality, and the influence of social media have all contributed to the current state of political dysfunction.

The fifth document is from Time magazine, titled "The U.S. Capitol Riot Was Years in the Making. Here's Why America Is So Divided," also by Ian Bremmer. This article delves into similar themes as the previous RealClearPolitics piece, emphasizing the role of race, capitalism, and media in creating division. It highlights the backlash against progress in race relations and the anxieties of certain groups, particularly white rural Americans, who feel their status is being threatened. Additionally, it discusses the evolving nature of capitalism and how it has led to increased inequality, fostering resentment among those who feel left behind.

So, synthesizing these sources, it seems that America's division stems from a combination of historical and contemporary factors. Race remains a persistent issue, with ongoing struggles for equality and a backlash from those who feel marginalized by changes in societal norms. Economic shifts, particularly the impact of globalization and technological advancement, have led to widening income inequalities and job insecurities, further dividing the country along class lines. Moreover, the media landscape has fragmented, allowing people to inhabit echo chambers that reinforce their existing beliefs, making it harder to find common ground.

Additionally, political polarization has intensified, with parties moving further apart ideologically and becoming less willing to compromise. This has been exacerbated by gerrymandering and other electoral practices that entrench partisan positions. Social issues like abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, and immigration have become highly charged battlefields, deepening the rift between different demographic groups.

Furthermore, the historical legacy of events like slavery and the civil rights movement continues to influence contemporary politics, with racial tensions surfacing in various政策和文化辩论中。媒体的作用也不容忽视，它们不仅反映了这些分歧，还在某种程度上加剧了它们，通过选择性地报道和放大特定的观点。

总的来说，美国的分裂是多方面因素共同作用的结果，包括历史、经济、政治和文化等层面。要解决这个问题，需要跨党派的合作、对根本问题的认真对待以及促进包容性和理解的努力。

**最终答案**

\[ \boxed{\text{America is divided due to a combination of historical legacies, economic inequalities, political polarization, cultural differences, and media influence.}} \]
