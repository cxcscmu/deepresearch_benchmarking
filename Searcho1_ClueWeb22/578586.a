So I've been given this question: "Should violence be censored in the media?" Hmm, that's a tough one. There are probably lots of different opinions on this topic, and it's important to consider all sides before forming an answer. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First off, what does it mean to censor violence in the media? I guess it means restricting or editing out violent content from things like TV shows, movies, video games, and maybe even news reports. The idea is to protect people, especially kids, from being exposed to graphic or disturbing images and scenes.

But why is violence in media a concern in the first place? Some people believe that exposure to violent content can desensitize individuals to real-world violence, making them more likely to commit acts of aggression themselves. There's probably some research on this, so maybe I should look into that.

On the other hand, there are those who argue that censorship infringes on freedom of speech and expression. They might say that artists and content creators should have the right to portray violence if it's integral to their story or message, and that audiences can handle seeing such content without being negatively affected.

I also think about how different cultures and societies have different tolerances for violence in media. What's considered acceptable in one country might be deemed too graphic in another. So, maybe there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.

Let me start by considering the potential harms of violent media. I've heard stories about kids imitating violent behaviors they see in movies or video games, which can be concerning. There might be studies that link exposure to violence in media with increased aggression or fear in viewers.

But at the same time, correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation. Maybe people who are already predisposed to aggression are drawn to violent media, rather than the media causing their behavior. It's a chicken-and-egg problem.

I should probably look up some research on this topic to get a better understanding. Maybe there are reputable studies that can shed light on whether violent media causes real-world violence.

What is the connection between media violence and real-world violence?
What is the connection between media violence and real-world violence?
Posted on: April 14, 2021
Written by Christopher Kilmartin, an emeritus college professor, author, stand-up comedian, actor, playwright, consultant and professional psychologist. He is the author of The Fictions that Shape Men's Lives.
When I ask students in my General Psychology class if there is a connection between media portrayals of physical aggression and actual violent behavior, many, without hesitation, simply answer “no.” “What tells you that?” I ask. Generally, the responses take the form of stories about they and/or people they know who consume violent media and have never been violent.
Obviously, watching American Psycho or its ilk is not going to turn all viewers into serial killers. But does that fact mean that violent media has no effect at all on anyone? As my classroom discussion proceeds, I remind the students of two broad goals for the course:
To distinguish between a question that is merely a matter of taste or preference and an empirical question--one that can only be answered through careful scrutiny of research data. “Is violent television worthwhile entertainment?” is an example of the former—a question of preference. “Is there evidence of a connection between violent media and real-world violence?” is an example of the latter.
To think about behaviors as having multiple causes and multiple effects. Rarely do behaviors arise from singular sources. Rather, they more often come about from multiple influences.
Do we have research on the effects of violent media? Yes—at least 60 years of it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States began to see an exponential rise in the number of homes that had at least one television in them, and that increase has obviously continued, and beyond television, in much of the developing world. Shortly after television became nearly ubiquitous, behavioral researchers began to investigate the effects on exposure to aggressive programming. The body of research on violent media includes the following:
Television is remarkably violent. Although only one-half of one percent of crimes committed in the real world are murders, fifty percent of the crimes committed on television are murders. If real life were as violent as television, the entire population of the United States would be wiped out in fifty days.
The effects of violent media are subtle, cumulative, and indirect. For people who have other risk factors such as childhood trauma and exposure to violent role models, high levels of exposure to violent media has the effect of making it about ten percent more likely that they will cause physical harm to another human being. A parallel about the accumulation of adverse experiences: nobody is going to become obese from eating one fast food meal, nor to get lung cancer from smoking a single cigarette, and although there are undoubtedly people who eat fast food every day or smoke all of their lives and suffer no negative outcomes, clearly these unusual cases do not mean that there is no adverse effects from these unhealthy habits.
What’s the big deal about ten percent? Although violence is a low-frequency behavior, it is one with extreme consequences: physical and psychological injury, and even death. If media violence is associated with 1100 acts of physical aggression instead of 1000, the effect is small but very important.
So, what should we do about it? Ban all violent media?
I do not advocate banning anything, although we would do well to limit exposure to young children. At very early ages, they cannot even distinguish between a television program and the commercials that accompany it, and early exposure is another risk factor. But we can teach children media literacy by helping them to identify the stories being told and helping them to generate alternative narratives. More specifically, we can help children to:
Find low-probability outcomes in the story. James Bond is being shot at by 1000 people, and not only can nobody hit him, he is remarkably relaxed and cool while in extreme danger. One movie trope is the slow-motion walk of protagonists while there is an explosion taking place behind them, which they seem to not even notice. Ask yourself: if you heard something explode behind you, wouldn’t you at least turn around to see what has happened?
Generate alternative conflict resolution strategies by considering the question, “What else could have been done to solve the problem?” Like maybe instead of allowing a kid to bully a classmate during dodgeball, the school could take steps to help bullies to address their troubles more directly. As former NFL player and now coach Joe Ehrmann is fond of saying, “Hurt people hurt people.” And of course, I think we can do without dodgeball and other aggressive school activities.
Why is violent media so prevalent? Obviously, because it sells. Also, we live in an entertainment culture where stories must be mass produced, and every story needs an element of tension. A writer can produce instant tension simply by putting a gun in a character’s hand. There are many more creative ways to produce story tension, and in fact, viewers prefer stories that are well-told without the elements of violence.
The other thing we need to understand is that buying a movie ticket or turning on a certain television program is a political act. I can tell the difference between myself and a mean “professional wrestler,” but I am not sure that an 11-year-old can, and the more I watch this so-called sport, the more will be produced, and the more 11-year olds will see them. (I put “professional wrestler” in quotes because “professional wrestling” is not professional, nor is it wrestling.) We will see a sharp reduction in violent media when it becomes less profitable. It is incumbent upon all of us, the vast majority of whom are never violent, to take seriously what we are promoting with our money.

The link between media and violence
Each time there is a tragic shooting that makes the headlines, media pundits question whether the violence found in many U.S. movies, TV shows and video games is a contributing factor to real acts of violence.
Last weekend, the New York Times published a well-written editorial on the topic that summarizes the evidence available about the connection between media and real-life violence.
The editorial draws the conclusion – citing three separate systematic reviews – that exposure to violent imagery is a risk factor for carrying out violent acts in real life.  In other words, not everyone exposed to violent media will become violent in real life. But viewing violent media increases ones chances of acting out violently.
The first review published in the journal Communication Research analyzed 217 studies that looked at the effect of television violence on aggressive behavior. Specifically, they found that exposure to media violence increased the chances that the viewer would commit actual physical violence against another person in the short-term, and that habitual viewing of violent media increased the risk of acting violently toward another person over longer periods of time.
A second review published in Psychological Science analyzed 42 studies on exposure to violent video games and aggressive behavior among children. Researchers found a strong connection between playing violent video games and aggressive behavior across children and young adults. “These results clearly support the hypothesis that exposure to violent video games poses a public-health threat to children and youths, including college-age individuals,” the researchers wrote.
A third meta-analysis published in the Lancet combines all of the evidence available on media and violence through 2005. It pulls together five separate systematic reviews, including the two listed above. After reviewing all of the data, the researchers concluded there is “consistent evidence that violent imagery in television, film and video, and computer games has substantial short-term effects on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, increasing the likelihood of aggressive or fearful behavior in children, especially boys.” They also said” “The evidence becomes inconsistent when considering older children and teenagers, and long-term outcomes for all ages.”
That’s a lot of evidence on one topic. So what’s the take-home message?  While the evidence may not spell out the specifics of how violent media contributes to real-life behavior, one thing is clear: there is a definite connection between what we see on TV and how we act in real life.
In our house, we certainly prevent our children from watching anything violent in television shows or movies. It’s an easy rule to enforce now, but it’s one I hope to continue as my kids get older.

Does Fictional Violence Lead to Real Violence?
Why we worry too much about media violence
Posted January 15, 2013
Every year the website Edge.org gathers together leading scientists, scholars, and other intellectuals to answer their annual question. This year's question: "What should we be worried about? Tell us something that worries you (for scientific reasons), but doesn't seem to be on the popular radar yet—and why it should be. Or tell us something that you have stopped worrying about, even if others do, and why it should be taken off the radar." Here's my answer, which can also be found, along with scores of fascinating responses by other contributors at The Edge.
We Worry Too Much About Fictional Violence
In the wake of a mass shooting we feel a desperate need to know "why?" so we can get to "how"—how can we keep this from happening again? When someone shoots up a school, a mall, or an office, people on the left usually blame lax gun laws, and recommend a fix of stricter gun laws. On the right, people are apt to blame it on cultural factors—violent video games and films have sickened the culture, glorifying wanton violence and desensitizing young people to its effects. Loose gun regulation is not a cause of the massacres, but our best defense against them.
But this idea of blaming the media is an oldie and a baddy. First, practically, where would we draw the line? If we managed to ban trigger happy games like Doom, Call of Duty, and Halo, what would we do about violent films like Saving Private Ryan or equally gory classics like Homer's Iliad? Should we edit the kills out of Shakespeare's plays?
Second, the evidence that violent media promotes violent behavior is actually pretty shaky. Violence is a great—perhaps the great—staple of the entertainment economy. As a society we guzzle down huge amounts of fake violence in television shows, novels, films, and video games. And yet, a determined fifty year search for real-world consequences of fictive violence hasn't found conclusive evidence of a causal linkage. Some researchers argue that the more violent media we consume, generally speaking, the more likely we are to behave aggressively in the real world. But other researchers disagree, picking studies apart on methodological grounds and pointing out that many hundreds of millions of people watch violent television and play violent games without developing the slightest urge to kill. As scientists like Steven Pinker point out: we consume more violent entertainment than we ever have before and yet we've never been at lower risk of a bloody demise. The more violent entertainment we've consumed, the more peaceable and law-abiding we've become.
Has violent media consumption actually helped reduce criminal violence? The notion isn't as perverse as it may at first seem. Critics of media violence seem to envision scenarios that allow us to vicariously revel in wanton savagery. But the messages found in most video games are strongly pro-social. Adventure-style video games almost always insert players into imaginative scenarios where they play the role of a hero bravely confronting the forces of chaos and destruction. When you play a video game you aren't training to be a spree shooter; you are training to be the good guy who races to place himself between evil and its victims.
The same goes for more traditional fiction formats like film, television, and novels. Virtually without exception, when the villain of a story kills, his violence is condemned. When the hero kills, he does so righteously. Fiction preaches that violence is only acceptable under defined circumstances—to protect the good and the weak from the bad and the strong. Some games, like Grand Theft Auto, seem to glorify and reward bad behavior (although in a semi-satirical spirit), but those games are the notorious exceptions that prove the general rule. What Steven King says of horror stories in his book Danse Macabre, broadly applies to all forms of imaginary violence: "The horror story, beneath its fangs and fright wig, is really as conservative as an Illinois Republican in a three-piece pinstriped suit…It's main purpose is to reaffirm the virtues of the norm by showing us what awful things happen to people who venture into taboo lands. Within the framework of most horror tales we find a moral code so strong it would make a Puritan smile."
article continues after advertisement
So how should we respond to mass shooting tragedies? First we must resist the reflex to find and torch a scapegoat—whether in the entertainment industry or the gun lobby. Even if we could keep unstable people from consuming imaginary violence, they could still find plenty of inspiration from the nightly news, history, holy scripture, or their own fevered dreams. And even if we were able to pass laws that kept guns out of the hands of bad men (a tall order in a country with three hundred million guns in private circulation), how would we keep them from killing with improvised explosives or by plowing SUVs into dense crowds?
Second, hard as it is, we must struggle to keep these acts of terrorism in perspective. We worry a lot about mass shootings, but we are all in so much more danger from a simple traffic accident on the way to a school , a theatre, a political rally, than we are from gunfire once we get there. We’d save the lives of enormously more people by—say—focusing on highway safety than by putting guns in the hands of "good people", or rekindling culture wars over the role of guns and entertainment in American life. It’s cliché but true: when we overreact, the terrorist wins. When we overreact, we give the sicko meme of the mass shooting the attention it needs to thrive.
So here's what shouldn't worry us: fictional violence.
Here's what should: the way our very understandable pain and fear leads us to respond ineffectively to real violence.

Humans learn how to behave by copying the examples they see, humanity is a species that learns social behavior by the example of . This system works well enough when a child’s main observation of human behavior are humans they interact with in real life. However, the amount of time children spend consuming mass media and, by extent, the violence present in over sixty percent of all media not intended of audiences under the age of thirteen is generally thought to teach the wrong lessons. The various degrees of violence depicted in multiple different types of media affects behavior, but the extent of those effects are widely disputed. Violence in media is one of the many factors that may potentially cause violent behavior, but it has a far less direct correlation with criminal behavior, and the strength of the correlation between violent behavior and violence in media is questionable.

One of the main arguments for the correlation between criminal behavior and violence in media is video games, specifically first person shooter games, which are often linked to glamorization of mass shootings.  However, it would not be nearly as influential because the media  generally shows pain, blood, and other negative consequence to these actions, even in video games.(Annual Reviews). In addition, for the vast majority of people the reconnection with the real world allow them to rationalize the compulsiveness of these electronic, violent actions that occur only in fiction. For instance, people know that pain is real, and  introducing someone to the pain and anguish of the victim who is injured and the long term consequences that jail and being forced to flee from society has on the perpetrator would greatly discourage any passing thoughts of committing murder.
When a well publicized act of violence occurs, humans attempt to rationalize such behavior. The most frequently used claims are that the inflictor’s actions were influenced by drugs, a mental illness, or the way they were raised. One such question as to the manner in which a criminal was raised is their exposure to violence as a child or adolescent. Violent video games are commonly accused of causing or encouraging violent behavior that escalates to criminal behavior later in life.
The National Rifle Association frequently claims that criminal behavior, especially gun violence, being caused by drugs, mental illness, or exposure to violence in video games. The U.S. Supreme Court stated “Psychological studies designed to show a connection between exposure to violent video games and harmful effects on children do not prove that such exposure causes minors to act aggressively. Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media.” (AP NEWS). in response to the state of California attempting to ban the sale of violent video games to children in 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged that witnessing violent crimes and behavior in media may cause children to imitate the actions they see, but likewise  acknowledged that the connection between long term behavior and exposure to violence in various media forms is not certain or strongly proven. The mere fact that California was willing to blame violent video games for the actions and behavior of children is a prime example of a desperate attempt to rationalize behavior and failing to examine every possible cause or admit that numerous causes are responsible for the affirmation,  encouragement, and continuation of  criminal intentions that could lead to criminal actions.
One of the main reasons studies that analyze the correlation between violent behavior and exposure to violence in media are questionable is because the majority of studies usually only record and examine the behavior of prepubescent children for a few hours immediately after showing them a movie that does or does not contain violent or criminal actions. While studies such as these are useful for analyzing the immediate effects exposure to violence in media have on children, they do not gather data or properly examine the long term effects violence in media has on children.  One study conducted in 2004 had a sample group consisting of 1,254 students in seventh or eighth grade and 500 parents and was focusing on what video games kids were playing, the duration and frequency of play, and the possible relationship with violent or aggressive behavior.(Massachusetts General Hospital).  The study was supervised by Dr. Cheryl Olson and the  researchers were a team of Mass General research professionals. The study found some correlations between the amount of violent games played and the intensity and frequency of self-reported physical altercations and antagonistic behavior when subjects spent a longer sum of time  playing violent games. However, this relationship only occurred in a few children , all of which had previously exhibited high levels of stress and aggressive traits. (Massachusetts General Hospital). The results of this particular study indicate that increased use of violent video games is the result of combative tendencies and stress being channeled into violent games, instead of violent games causing the aggressive tendencies and stress.
Studies that examine the immediate results of children being shown physical violence in media have generally indicated a more direct relationship between combative behavior and seeing violence in media, and imply a relationship between aggressive behavior and the possibility of future criminal behavior. A study conducted in 1963 by Bandura, Ross, and Ross attempted to replicate the effects on violent media on children by showing preschoolers a clip of an adult physically assaulting an inflatable dummy or showing a clip that contained no violence.(Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). The  children that had been shown the clips were then placed in a playroom that contained inflatable dummies, and various other toys including toy mallets that resembled the kind used in the videos. The preschoolers’ behavior was monitored and the children who had been shown the violent clip replicated the actions of the adult on the inflatable dummies they had available. The study proved that  “the children found new and creative ways to beat up the doll, and they played more aggressively with the other toys in the room as well” (LoBue) as a result of the children performing violent actions that did not specifically occur in the clip. However, this study does little to prove or analyse the relationship between long term exposure to multiple  forms of media that contain violence. The conclusion that witnessing violence in media causes a temporary increase in aggression is well established, but the timespan of observation does not lend itself to making any concise decisions about the lingering effects of  media violence on young children nor does it examined the effects as a child ages into an adolescent.
Another reason  why violence in media is so commonly considered a primary cause of criminal behavior is the human tendency to place the majority of the blame on a single source. Politicians and celebrities have been known to state that the violence in media, such as movies and video games, shapes the way children and adolescents think and drastically increases their likelihood of committing violent criminal acts later in life. Following well publicized violent incidents, especially ones concerning youths, such as school shootings, politicians raise concerns over the influence of violent video games and films on young people. President Trump responds by claiming violent video games and films are “shaping young people’s thoughts.” (Schipani). With so many influential individuals who posses no expertise on the subject all claiming the same thing, that violence in media is responsible for influencing the actions of a recently famous criminal, the masses of concerned parents have turned against violence in media.This is because it is easier for them to control the media their children are exposed to than it is for them to assess and address any concerning factors in their child’s morals, and ability to empathize with others, handle stress, and manage anger.

The people who believe that violence in the media causes harm to the mental welfare of children, and encourages a child’s  aggressive behavior, have attempted to solve the problem by having the government regulate television and media to prevent children from being exposed to  excessive violence. The legality of the government regulating television is not in question, it is definitely illegal. Regulating excessive violence in media would require defining “excessive violence”, preventing all depictions of violence, positive or negative, and would be disconcerting  if only targeted towards regulating what children are allowed to view, given the impressionability of children. (Tribe pg. 92-98). It is illegal to have a law that uses overly vague language, so any law that regulates excessive violence would need to define what it  considers excessive violence. It is also a violation of the First Amendment to prevent the discussion of a topic based on the viewpoint expressed, so even if excessive violence was regulated, it would be required to prevent children from viewing negative portrayals of violence in which the horrifying aspects of violence are stressed to caution children of violence, as well as he positive portrayals of violence. While some respond the impossibility of legally preventing children from consuming violent recreational media by promoting media literacy, others are upset by it and respond by further vilifying violence in media.
One of the most frequently used arguments used to prove that violent media cause criminal activity are copycat shooters. Mass shooters, terrorists, and suicide victims are all highly covered in the news and on social media, and it is believed that the fame and attention perpetrators of such crimes receive is a motivation for others to commit similar crimes.  Since the2000s, the frequency of mass shootings has increased exponentially. The average time between mass shootings in 2018 was twelve and a half days, and an average of one attempted or successful school shooting every seven days. Prior to 2000, the average was roughly three mass shootings per year. The increase in mass shootings following 2002 can be partially attributed to the widespread reporting on the 1999 school shooting of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, with four hundred related incidents being reported in the following month. The shooter at Virginia Tech in 2007 killed thirty two people and several shooters have since claimed to be inspired to kill more than thirty two as if it is a competition or record to break.(Alex Pew et al.)  The media inspiring others to mimic widely reported crimes is called the media contagion effect, and is one of the significant reasons for the general association between media violence and criminal behavior. Unlike in the case of movies or video games, the problem with media’s attention to mass shootings is that too much attention is paid to the shooter, while the victims become nothing more than a statistic, a number the next shooter aims to surpass. In the case of news coverage of shootings, the coverage and exposure does increase the likelihood of more shootings, but not because the shooting itself is depicted in media. The problem is that the perpetrator gets far more attention than the victims or the victims’ families.
Media literacy is a generally suggested skill for anyone who makes frequent use of the internet, but many parents neglect to teach their children online precautions or media literacy until they are in their teens, despite children as young as eight years old consuming an average of six hours of media every day.  The lack of knowledge regarding media literacy, regulations or rating systems leaves children unguided, and in the absence of  general guidelines, many young children are attracted to the higher rated games because of they are not supposed to have or play such games, which is called the “forbidden-fruit” hypothesis. Rating guides are easily available for parents to learn what content would be found in the media given that rating, which would allow parents to put limits on what their children are exposed to in media.(Pediatrics, Media Violence) While media generally does not cause increased risk of criminal behavior, and the media that does can be easily changed to prevent such influence, media does expose children to violence and increase combative behavior. The increase in aggression is something parents may want to avoid and in the absence of clear , distinctive control of what their child is exposed to, parents generalize the media through which their child was exposed to violent behavior.
While violence in the media is one of the contributing factors  to violent behaviour , its relation to criminal behaviour is much less direct. News, social media, movies, video games, and TV shows all contain violence, and many claim that such content should be censored to regulated  despite ratings being an underused method of preventing children from being exposed to any content the parents wish to avoid. People generally agree that there is a relationship between violent and criminal behavior and exposure to violence through electronic means, however, the strength of this correlation is questionable.  A general increase in aggressive behavior is well proven, but criminal or violent behavior is not as studied or proven.

Violence in Media
Researchers from Ohio State did a study where they showed one group of 8-12 year olds a movie where the characters used guns and another group a movie where the characters did not use guns. When the group that watched the movie with guns were handed a real, unloaded gun, they pulled the trigger on average 2-3 times more than the group that was not shown the movie (LoBue). The idea that violence shown through media is the source of increased viciousness in children is an idea that has been heavily debated and researched. However, with a rapid rise in brutal acts like shootings, assaults, murders, etc. there must be a reason why these are becoming more common. The evidence gathered from studies points to the media as the root cause for an increase in this brutal behavior. Therefore, violence in media should be limited because it impacts children, making them more aggressive.
Increased exposure of children to violent video games can make these children start seeing reality as a violent video game. In these video games, often times they are simulating real life through a character controlled by the player. According to the Gale Student Resources in Context online research portal, “repeated exposure to violent video games over an extended period of time could affect how players perceive and react to real-life events and encourage further aggression in these situations” (“Video”). Lately, video games have gotten even better at imitating the actions and behavior of humans. Just imagine this, you spend hours per day playing a violent video game, pretending to be a character in a game. Once you turn off the game, how does one remember that they aren’t just in a game anymore and that it is actually real life? It gets worse when children become addicted to these games, spending more time playing video games rather than having real face-to-face interactions. The longer they spend exposed to this kind of violence, the more the definite line between a video game and reality begins to blur.

If video games demonstrating aggressive behavior were restricted from children, our world would experience a decrease in the number of violent incidents occurring. This is due to the fact that children are easily influenced because they are just beginning to form their own identity based on what they experience. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, violent video games are criticized because they set a bad example for children to follow (“Video”). Children follow what they see, and if all they see is violence, they are bound to follow that. Admittedly, some studies have found that children find a type of psychological relief from media violence, which makes them less aggressive (Cutler). However, this is not the case because the General Aggression Model (GAM) showed that “players who already exhibited a tendency toward hostile behavior were more likely to become increasingly aggressive after playing a violent video game” (“Video”). Therefore, children who already were more aggressive on average did not in fact find relief through video games; instead, the violence they witnessed contributed to an even greater increase in their vicious behavior. Children who repeatedly see brutal acts occur eventually get accustomed to violence and start to think it is normal to behave that way. According to a study done by Social Psychological and Personality Science, the more that children believe violence is normal, the more they are likely to engage in aggressive behavior against others (“Seeing”). This idea is also seen in Lord of the Flies, where the boys on the island had continued exposure to vicious behavior. This exposure started to alter the way the boys perceived violence. By the end of the story, all the boys attacked and brutally murdered the character, Simon (Golding). Since the boys kept witnessing violent behavior, they believed what they just did to Simon was normal and they felt no remorse for their actions. Their increased aggression was due to all the savageness they had observed on the island.
Aggression shown in children can be linked to the increase of violence shown in the media, so there should be a limit to the amount of violence children can witness. To reiterate, continued exposure to violence can have many detrimental effects on one’s mind and behavior. In some of the worst cases, children were not able to differentiate between real life and a video game. The normalization of violence in children’s mind leads to an increase in hostile behavior and vicious crimes. So next time you read a book, watch a movie, or play a video game that demonstrates violence, I urge you to think about the negative effect it has on you.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one.

The first document is from Routledge and it's titled "What is the connection between media violence and real-world violence?" It seems like a blog post written by Christopher Kilmartin, who is an emeritus college professor with various backgrounds, including being an author and a professional psychologist. He teaches a General Psychology class and discusses the question of whether violent media causes real-world violence.

He mentions that when he asks his students about this, many initially say no, often citing personal experiences where they or people they know consume violent media without exhibiting violent behavior. He then guides them to think about this as an empirical question that requires research data, not just personal anecdotes.

Kilmartin notes that there's over 60 years of research on this topic, starting from when television became widespread in the US. He points out that television is remarkably violent compared to real life—50% of crimes in TV are murders, whereas in reality, it's only half a percent. This discrepancy could potentially normalize violence in viewers' minds.

He emphasizes that the effects of violent media are subtle, cumulative, and indirect. For people with other risk factors like childhood trauma or exposure to violent role models, high levels of exposure to violent media can make them about 10% more likely to cause physical harm to others. He compares this to how smoking increases the risk of lung cancer but doesn't cause it in every smoker.

Kilmartin suggests that while complete bans aren't necessary, teaching media literacy to children can help them critically analyze what they see and consider alternative narratives. He also argues that violent media is prevalent because it sells, and that it's up to consumers to be mindful of what they support with their money.

This source seems quite informative and comes from an author with credible credentials. It provides a balanced view, acknowledging that not everyone exposed to violent media becomes violent but recognizing a small but significant increase in risk.

Moving on to the second document, which is from Evidence Based Living at Cornell University. The title is "The link between media and violence." It's a summary of an editorial in the New York Times that discusses the connection between media violence and real-life violence, particularly in the context of tragic shootings.

The editorial references three systematic reviews to support the conclusion that exposure to violent imagery is a risk factor for committing violent acts. The first review, published in Communication Research, analyzed 217 studies and found that exposure to television violence increases the short-term likelihood of aggressive behavior and that habitual viewing increases the long-term risk of violence.

The second review, in Psychological Science, looked at 42 studies on violent video games and aggressive behavior in children and found a strong connection between the two. The researchers concluded that violent video games pose a public health threat to children and youths.

The third meta-analysis, published in The Lancet, combined evidence from five systematic reviews and found consistent short-term effects of violent media on arousal, thoughts, and emotions, increasing the likelihood of aggressive or fearful behavior in children, especially boys. The evidence was less consistent for older children and long-term outcomes.

The author of this summary concludes that while the specifics of how media violence leads to real-life aggression aren't fully understood, there's clear evidence of a connection.

This source is concise and references multiple systematic reviews, which adds credibility to its claims. It seems to present a strong case for a link between media violence and real-life aggression, at least in the short term and among children.

The third document is from Psychology Today, written by Jonathan Gottschall, titled "Does Fictional Violence Lead to Real Violence?" Gottschall approaches the issue with skepticism, arguing that the evidence linking media violence to real violence is shaky. He notes that consumption of violent entertainment is at an all-time high, yet society is more peaceful and law-abiding than ever, citing Steven Pinker's work.

Gottschall suggests that violent media might even reduce criminal violence by providing a safe outlet for aggressive impulses. He points out that most violent media portray violence in a way that condemns it, with villains being punished and heroes using violence only in righteous causes. He argues that media violence can reinforce moral codes rather than undermine them.

Furthermore, he criticizes the rush to blame media violence after mass shootings, suggesting that this deflects attention from more effective solutions to preventing such tragedies.

This perspective is interesting because it challenges the conventional wisdom that media violence causes real violence. Gottschall presents an alternative view, suggesting that media violence might have benign or even positive effects.

The fourth document is an essay from UK Essays on "The Impact of Violence in Media; Does it Really Cause Criminal Behavior?" The essay discusses the debate over whether violence in media causes criminal behavior, focusing particularly on video games.

The author acknowledges that while there is a correlation between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior in the short term, the long-term effects are less clear. The essay cites a study by Bandura, Ross, and Ross from 1963, which showed that children who watched violent clips were more aggressive in their play immediately afterward. However, the essay notes that this doesn't necessarily translate to long-term behavioral changes.

The essay also mentions a study by Cheryl Olson on video game usage among seventh and eighth graders, which found that increased play of violent games correlated with aggressive behavior only in children who already had high levels of stress and aggression. This suggests that violent games may exacerbate existing issues rather than causing aggression de novo.

The author argues that while there is a tendency to blame media violence for criminal behavior, this is often a simplistic explanation that overlooks other factors such as mental health, upbringing, and socioeconomic conditions.

This essay provides a balanced view, recognizing that media violence can influence behavior but is likely just one of many factors contributing to criminal behavior.

The fifth and final document is from PapersOwl and is titled "Violence in Media." It's a student essay arguing that violence in media should be limited because it makes children more aggressive.

The essay cites a study where children who watched a movie with guns were more likely to pull the trigger on a real (unloaded) gun, demonstrating increased aggression. The author suggests that violent video games can make children see reality as a video game, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.

The essay references the American Academy of Pediatrics, which criticizes violent video games for setting bad examples for children. It also mentions the General Aggression Model, which suggests that children who are already prone to hostility become more aggressive after playing violent video games.

The author concludes by drawing a parallel to "Lord of the Flies," where children's exposure to violence leads them to commit atrocities, implying that similar dynamics can occur in real life.

This essay presents a more definitive stance, asserting that violence in media directly contributes to increased aggression in children and should therefore be restricted.

Overall, the search results present a range of perspectives on the relationship between media violence and real-world violence. Some sources, like the Routledge blog and the Cornell University summary, present evidence suggesting a link between media violence and increased aggression, at least in the short term and among children. Others, like the Psychology Today article, challenge this notion, arguing that the evidence is inconclusive and that media violence may not have the detrimental effects commonly assumed.

Given this diversity of opinion, it's clear that the issue is complex and multifaceted. To form a well-rounded answer to the question "Should violence be censored in the media?", it's important to consider not only the potential harms but also the potential benefits and the broader implications of censorship.

First, let's consider the arguments in favor of censorship. Proponents might argue that exposure to violent content can desensitize individuals to real-world violence, making them more likely to commit acts of aggression themselves. They may point to studies showing short-term increases in aggressive behavior after exposure to violent media. Additionally, they might contend that children, in particular, are vulnerable and unable to distinguish between fiction and reality, thus requiring protection from violent content.

On the other hand, opponents of censorship argue that there is no conclusive evidence linking media violence to real-world violence. They might cite studies that fail to find a direct causal relationship or note that correlation does not imply causation. Furthermore, they could argue that censorship infringes on freedom of speech and expression, limiting artistic and creative freedoms.

Moreover, some argue that violent content can serve important purposes, such as providing a cathartic outlet for aggression or serving as a means to explore and critique societal issues. For example, films and literature that depict violence often do so to comment on war, crime, or other social problems, thereby raising awareness and fostering discussion.

It's also worth considering that violence has been a part of human culture and storytelling for millennia. From ancient epics like Homer's "Iliad" to modern cinema, violence is a recurrent theme. The question, then, is not whether violence should be present in media but how it is portrayed and what messages it conveys.

In terms of regulation, many countries already have systems in place to rate media content based on its suitability for different age groups. These rating systems inform consumers about the nature of the content, allowing parents and individuals to make informed choices about what they or their children are exposed to. Some argue that improving and enforcing these rating systems is a better approach than outright censorship, as it respects freedom of expression while providing guidance to consumers.

Additionally, promoting media literacy can empower individuals to critically analyze and interpret media content, understanding the differences between fictional representations and real-world consequences. Education about the context and purposes of violent content can help viewers develop a more nuanced perspective.

Another aspect to consider is the role of parental supervision. Parents play a crucial role in guiding their children's media consumption. Open communication about media content, discussing the differences between fiction and reality, and setting appropriate boundaries can help mitigate any potential negative effects.

From a policy perspective, it's essential to weigh the potential benefits of censorship against the risks of infringing on individual rights and freedoms. Censorship can be a slippery slope, leading to suppression of ideas and限制表达自由。因此，任何关于媒体暴力的法规都应谨慎制定，并确保符合宪法和法律原则。

此外，还需要考虑文化差异和多样性。不同文化对暴力的接受程度各异，因此一刀切的审查标准可能不适用于所有社会。制定全球统一的审查标准是不现实的，因为每个国家和地区都有其独特的价值观和规范。

最后，值得注意的是，即使存在一些研究表明媒体暴力与现实生活中的暴力行为之间存在关联，但这种关联并不一定意味着因果关系。可能有其他因素在起作用，比如家庭环境、心理健康状况和社会经济地位等。因此，将媒体暴力作为唯一或主要的原因是不全面的。

综上所述，是否应该在媒体中审查暴力是一个复杂的问题，需要综合考虑多方面的因素。通过提高媒体素养、实施有效的评级系统和鼓励家长参与，可以在不牺牲言论自由的前提下，减少潜在的负面影响。最终，平衡保护公众利益和个人自由之间的关系是至关重要的。

**最终答案**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, violence should not be universally censored in the media, but age-appropriate ratings and media literacy should be promoted to help individuals make informed choices about their media consumption.}} \]
