Alright, so I've got this question: "Why is there a chlorine shortage?" Hmm, I don't know much about chlorine shortages, but I do know that chlorine is an important chemical used in various industries, like water treatment and sanitation. So, maybe there are some issues affecting its production or distribution. I need to find out more about this.

First, I should probably understand what chlorine is and its main uses. Chlorine is a chemical element with the symbol Cl and atomic number 17. It's a yellow-green gas at room temperature and is highly reactive. It's widely used in the production of bleach, disinfectants, and in water treatment to kill bacteria and other microbes. It's also used in the manufacturing of plastics, paper, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Given its importance, a shortage could have wide-ranging impacts. Maybe there are global events or economic factors causing this shortage. Let me think about recent events. There's been a lot going on worldwide, like the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions. Any of these could potentially affect the production or distribution of chlorine.

Perhaps I should look into the main producers of chlorine and see if they're facing any production issues. Or maybe there are environmental regulations that are limiting its production. Also, demand might have increased due to certain factors, leading to a shortage.

Wait, maybe I should start by finding out if there actually is a chlorine shortage right now. I feel like I've heard about it somewhere, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's more of a regional issue rather than a global one. Let me check that.

I think performing a web search would be helpful here. I can look up "chlorine shortage" and see what comes up. Maybe read some news articles or industry reports to get a better understanding.

Clearing Up Confusion Surrounding the 2021 Chlorine Shortage

Clearing Up Confusion Surrounding the 2021 Chlorine Shortage
Some outlets are calling it “Pool-mageddon.” Others are panicking over “the end of summer as we know it.” But how accurate are these statements, exactly?
If you haven’t caught on yet, we’re talking about this summer’s chlorine shortage. What started as a supply breakdown for chlorine tablets has now ballooned into an all-out chlorine scarcity.
Because of this shortage, the price of Trichlor chlorine tablets has nearly doubled, and is only expected to rise throughout the summer as supplies continue to dwindle. Keep reading if you’re looking for answers as to why this is happening, or what you can do about it.
Background
In August 2020, Hurricane Laura caused a massive chemical fire that destroyed one of the largest Trichlor chemical plants in the country. Trichlor is a very popular chlorine option in the form of slow-dissolving tablets. The fire also destroyed some granular chlorine supply.
This would be stressful on any supply chain during a normal year. But because of COVID-19, 2020 and 2021 are so far from normal that the chlorine supply shortage was exacerbated by this chemical fire. Now, as consumers flock in droves to tablet alternatives — such as salt, liquid, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV) — those same chains are beginning to see strain. Even liquid chlorine storage containers are in tight supply.
This isn’t a new phenomenon. Of course, there’s a rise and fall; a give-and-take to supply and demand that occurs within basic economics. But our friend Mike Fowler at Pentair says this year’s supply difficulties go beyond the pale because of the pandemic’s compounding effect.
Fowler said, “What you have right now is a domino effect of total overall business due to production issues. For example, manufacturers had production lines minimized to six people when there were usually 12 people on the line.”
He’s clearly not alone — the entire industry has been affected not just by longer wait times for materials, but also higher demand.
Fowler offers a caveat. “It’s wonderful because we’re seeing a tremendous increase in business. But it’s tough because people are used to waiting on product for seven to 10 days, and now they’re waiting three to four months.”
When will the 2021 chlorine shortage end?
Fowler says it’s really hard to tell right now, and we agree.
“I don’t see this getting back to normal until maybe the 2022 pool season. I think a lot of people have learned a lot of things as a result of this, the chlorine shortage and COVID combined. If you were a pool operator who didn’t take the necessary steps to treat and care for your pool, then your wallet is probably feeling it this summer.”
While there should be a healthy stock of Trichlor available by next summer, supply has been extremely limited this year compared to previous summers.
The good news is that there are so many alleys toward sanitizing your pool that this doesn’t mean your summer is in the dumps just yet. The problem, however, is deciding which one is best for your pool.
What does this mean for my pool?
Since there isn’t much efficacy using chlorine tablets with large community pools, you’re probably feeling this chlorine shortage more if your pool is on the smaller side.
Ultimately, your decision will depend on these three factors:
Your pool’s location (whether it’s on a rooftop, high rise, indoors, outdoors, etc.)
Storage space for chemicals
Budget
Pentair, which makes very popular Intellichlor salt chlorine generators, is noticing salt and salt systems fly off the shelves.
“As soon as everyone started hearing about it on the nightly news, salt became a big play as an option, along with UV,” Fowler said. “One of my good friends went to Lowe’s to get his pool salt last weekend. They normally have two or three pallets out. It was down to two or three bags.”
We’re big fans of salt chlorine because it offers a swim of amazing quality that you can feel, plus it doesn’t irritate your skin or sensory organs like other chlorine media can. But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right for your pool. Salt can also be a costly option for small- to medium-sized commercial pools, like those found in apartments and hotels.
But all is not bleak; whichever option you choose could end up being your pool’s sanitation solution for years to come. Ozone, for example, is another costly option; but it also works with a wide variety of pool sizes and construction materials. And while liquid chlorine is starting to run in short supply, there’s no practical reason to move away from it if you’re already using it in your pool.
COVID-19 taught us that adversity can force change and growth. Short-term problems often force change to generate feasible and convenient long-term solutions. It’s kind of like the opposite of buyer’s remorse, or buyer’s remorse in reverse. If you’re in need of a new chlorination system, let us know. We’ll be happy to help you figure out the best solution for your space and budget, so you can keep Poolmageddon at bay in 2021.

Why There's a Chlorine Shortage in 2021 and What It Means
By Kathryn Underwood
May. 3 2021, Published 12:37 p.m. ET
Pool owners should stock up on their chlorine sanitizing tabs whenever possible this year due to a serious shortage of chlorine supplies. Due to the combined one-two punch of increased demand for pool chlorine and a reduced supply following a chemical plant fire, the supply of chlorine tabs used to decontaminate pools will be limited.

Rudy Stankowitz, the CEO of Aquatic Facility Training & Consultants, raised the alarm and called the chlorine shortage “Poolmageddon” and “a chlorine crisis,” as reported by CNBC. A fire at a chemical plant in Louisiana last summer is largely to blame for less production and the resulting reduction in supplies.
Michael Egeck, the CEO of pool supply company Leslie’s, brought up the impending chlorine shortage in February. In an earnings conference call, he said, “With regard to retail pricing, it is a fact that we are seeing increases across the industry,” according to CNN .

Chemical plant fire impacts chlorine supplies.
BioLab, one of the nation’s primary chlorine tablet manufacturers, burned down in August 2020. The company isn't expected to resume normal operations until the spring of 2022. The fire leaves only two domestic chlorine tablet suppliers— Occidental Petroleum and Clearon Corp.

A spokesperson for BioLab’s parent company, KIK Consumer Products, said that it's investing $170 million into reconstruction and expects 30 percent higher production capacity after the plant is completed.
Pool buying amid the COVID-19 pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic fueled a surge in purchases of home swimming pools. In 2021, pool owners will be looking for chlorine solutions to get them through the upcoming summer months. Since many public pools will be open in 2021 after a hiatus in 2020, those businesses and individual pool owners will face limited chlorine supplies.

Chlorine is essential for pool owners because it prevents and kills algae and helps protect swimmers from waterborne illnesses. One alternative to chlorine is a saltwater pool system, although the supplies for that option are limited as well, according to CNBC.

What pool owners need to know
Leaders in the swimming pool industry have commented on the shortage and recommend that people get their chlorine supplies as soon as possible due to low supply and higher cost. Some retailers are already imposing limits on purchase quantities.
Allan Curtis is the owner of Ask The Pool Guy, which is a pool maintenance business in Michigan. He has 34 years of industry experience, according to CNBC. Curtis expects the demand to cause customers to move from buying chlorine tablets to other forms of chlorine-like powdered and liquid chlorine. Eventually, he expects all forms of chlorine to run out.

The owner of Texas Pool Professionals, Cody Saliture, said that he has already been to 15 cities in six different states searching for the chlorine supplies he will need to stock up for the season.
Going hand-in-hand with the reduced supply comes the logical increase in price, which is another reason pool owners need to purchase their supplies sooner rather than later. Financial services company IHS Markit predicted that chlorine prices will rise 70 percent this year.
For example, an Amazon pricing a few days ago showed a 50-pound bucket of In the Swim chlorine tablets priced at $169.99 or about double its typical price.

Just in Time for Pool Season: A Chlorine Shortage
A fire at a chemical plant and a pandemic-driven boom in the construction of backyard pools are the causes of a nationwide shortage of chlorine tablets, experts say. Panic buying could make it worse.

May 29, 2021
Stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, people who found themselves sitting on savings from canceled vacations and other cutbacks built pools in record numbers last year to make quarantine more enjoyable.
Then a fire at the end of last summer caused a shutdown at the plant that produces most of the country’s supply of chlorine tablets. This year, the arrival of Memorial Day and pool season has industry experts warning of a shortage that threatens to disrupt backyard plans from coast to coast.
“There is a very, very good possibility that we’re going to run out of chlorine tablets,” said Rudy Stankowitz, a swimming pool consultant and educator with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. “People should start looking into alternative methods of sanitizing swimming pools.”
The shortage, which Mr. Stankowitz described somewhat hyperbolically as a “poolocalypse,” will affect residential pools more than public ones, which typically use different forms of chlorine.
There are significant public health implications. Chlorine tablets are used to sanitize pools and to keep them free of algae and bacteria. Inadequately sanitized water can become turbid, making it a safety risk and a leading cause of drownings, Mr. Stankowitz said.
“If somebody falls in, you might not see them, or they can get disoriented and not figure out how to get out,” he said. “There’s even been cases where pools were green enough that they looked like a lawn.”
The chlorine shortage has caught some new pool owners like Stephanie Winslow off guard.
Ms. Winslow was accustomed to spending hot days with her daughter and friends at a local public pool. When it closed because of the pandemic, she bought an aboveground pool for the cattle farm where she lives with her family in Philippi, W.Va.
“We get a lot of use out of it,” Ms. Winslow, an online college financial aid specialist, said. “We pretty much use it every day.”
This spring, Ms. Winslow bought a month’s supply of chlorine tablets at Walmart for $26. After hearing about the shortage, she returned to buy enough to last through the summer, she said, but there were none available at Walmart or Ace Hardware. On Amazon, a bucket of tablets — the same size that had cost her $26 a week earlier — was listed for nearly $170.
“It’s just a shame that something that’s supposed to be really fun for people come summertime to enjoy now is almost a hassle because you don’t know if you’re going to be able to use it or not the whole summer,” she said.
Others have fared better. Nick Barboza, a recent Air Force retiree, built a pool in his backyard in San Antonio last May as a Mother’s Day gift for his wife, Julia. The purchase was possible, in part, because the pandemic had forced them to cancel their trips to Chicago and Hawaii.
The pool “improved our family’s quality of life,” said Mr. Barboza, whose children are 6, 13 and 18.
“We use the pool in the summertime maybe six days a week,” he said. “We’re always in the backyard just hanging out, and it kind of brought the family together when we were stuck in the house.”
The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates
Updated
May 13, 2022, 5:00 a.m. ET
The world tries to move beyond Covid. China may stand in the way.
North Korea says 6 are dead as Covid-19 spreads ‘explosively.’
As known cases climb in southern Africa, testing on the continent has fallen off.
The pool has a waterfall feature and is made of fiberglass, which requires less chlorine and fewer other chemicals. When he read about the chlorine shortage in a Facebook group this year, Mr. Barboza bought a 50-pound bucket of chlorine tablets from Sam’s Club — enough to last through the summer.
Mr. Barboza’s pool was one of about 96,000 that were built in the United States in 2020, a 23 percent increase over the previous year, according to a report on the chlorine shortage that Goldman Sachs released last month. The report, which is based on a survey of regional pool retailers, estimated that 110,000 new pools would be built this year, the most “in a single year since the Great Recession.”
In another report, the research firm IBISWorld attributed the growth in pool construction to “social-distancing guidelines and fears over the virus.”
The addition of so many new pools might have been enough on its own to strain the chlorine supply. But the real trouble began in August, when a large fire broke out at a plant that is just west of Lake Charles, La., and that is operated by Bio-Lab Inc., one of the country’s largest producers of pool and spa products.
The fire, which happened after the plant had already been damaged by Hurricane Laura, burned for three days, releasing chlorine gas into the air and halting the production of chlorine tablets. Bio-Lab told the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board that about 835 tons of the tablets were stored at the plant when the fire started. A spokesman for KIK Consumer Products, which owns Bio-Lab, declined to say how much of that was destroyed.
Trichlor chlorine tablets are used to sanitize about 70 percent of the nation’s residential pools, Mr. Stankowitz said. He and other industry experts said that the Bio-Lab plant produced a majority of the country’s supply of the tablets.
The resulting shortage was relatively unnoticed until recently, as pools in Northern states began to open for the season and owners noted higher prices and purchasing limits at some stores.
Of the 26 pool-supply shops that were surveyed by Goldman Sachs, “15 expressed uncertainty or doubt when asked about whether they will have enough chlorine for pool season,” the report said.
The spokesman for KIK Consumer Products said the company was rebuilding the Bio-Lab plant. It will have 30 percent more production capacity and will be “well positioned to rapidly address the shortage” when it reopens next year, he said.
Chlorine tablets are not the only way to keep a pool clean. Saltwater pools, for example, are equipped with a filtration system that uses electricity to generate chlorine, but retrofitting a pool can be prohibitively expensive, Mr. Stankowitz said. Less expensive options include adding chemicals like borate, which prevents algae, or liquid chlorine bleach.
To reduce the need for chlorine, the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance, an industry trade group, advises people to shower before swimming, to keep pets out of the pool and to run the filter daily. It also recommends that people “shock” their pools — adding chemicals that raise the chlorine level enough to kill algae and bacteria — with liquid chlorine, calcium hypochlorite or potassium monopersulfate instead of chlorine tablets.
Above all, pool owners should resist the urge to panic-buy chlorine, Mr. Stankowitz said. Doing so could risk making chlorine tablets as scarce as toilet paper was at the beginning of the pandemic.
“If people start to hoard and people start to take in more supplies than they need,” he said, “that’s only going to make the problem grow worse.”

An unprecedented chlorine shortage could affect summer swimming.
Several factors, including COVID-19 and a massive fire at a chlorine plant, are responsible for the chlorine shortage.
If you’re a pool owner, you have several alternative options to replace chlorine, including bromine and saltwater pools.
The U.S. isn’t just lacking lumber right now—experts say we’re also facing a national, record-setting chlorine shortage caused by interruptions in the supply chain. What’s behind the chlorine shortage? And if you own a swimming pool, could the looming problem jeopardize one of your favorite summer staples?
➡ Join Pop Mech Pro to get exclusive answers to your burning science questions.
Why Is There a Chlorine Shortage Right Now?
Blame two factors for the chlorine shortage, says CNBC. One, unsurprisingly, is COVID-19: Last summer, sales for swimming pools skyrocketed as people all over the planet stayed home during the pandemic, leading to an increased demand for prepared chlorine products.
But the other cause is more surprising: In August 2020, a chlorine plant just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana—responsible for making a bulk of the U.S.’s chlorine tablets—burned down in the wake of Hurricane Laura, putting a huge dent in the production of chlorine tablets.
9 Best Above-Ground Swimming Pools for Summer Fun
The BioLab facility will reopen in 2022, but in the meantime, its absence leaves just two domestic manufacturers of chlorine tablets: Occidental Petroleum and Clearon Corp. Even if both manufacturers increase production, they’d have to ramp up roughly 50 percent each to fill in the gap during the chlorine shortage.
Experts say the chlorine shortage will cause empty shelves in stores and extreme markups, which, because of the seasonal nature of pool usage, is about to come as a rude awakening to many outdoor pool owners. The financial services company IHS Markit says chlorine prices are expected to spike 70 percent this summer, compared to 2020.
If your average 50-pound bucket of chlorine used to cost $75 to $85, it now costs $140 and is expected to hit $158 in the near future, Scotty Heer, the owner of the Las Vegas-based Scotty’s Pool Service, told CNBC.

What Can I Do About the Chlorine Shortage?
Chlorine serves multiple purposes in swimming pools. It kills germs because it’s basically the same as bleach—just at a much lower concentration. And it keeps your pool water clear, which in turn keeps your pool safe. (After all, you can’t rescue someone if you can’t see them in the water.) But for as useful as chlorine is, it isn’t your only option for maintaining a healthy pool.

Chlorine Alternative #1: Bromine
Bromine is a sanitizing chemical that, like chlorine, kills algae and other gross stuff in your pool. It’s slightly more expensive, but slightly less irritating than chlorine. Both bromine and chlorine are halogen elements that are chemically related, but exist in different states of matter at room temperature—chlorine is a gas, while bromine is a liquid. Bromine is the only chlorine alternative that doesn’t require you to purchase additional equipment.
Bromine arrives as sodium bromide, usually powdered, with specific instructions for the right amount to use for your pool size. But before you get to that, you’ll need to test pH and balance your pool to 80-120 total alkalinity, according to Hunker. To do that, grab a pH testing kit and adjust up or down using baking soda or diluted hydrochloric acid. Your bromine concentration should be at least 80 parts per million, and you can periodically “refresh” it with a small amount of household bleach.

Chlorine Alternative #2: Saltwater
The term “saltwater pool” is a bit of misnomer, because pools with saltwater still have a small amount of chlorine. Still, no one is predicting a salt shortage this summer, and saltwater pools make their own chlorine via a chemical reaction. These pools work by salting the water and then using a generator to turn the salt into chlorine at a very slow rate. The resulting water is slightly salty, gently chlorinated, and 100 percent safe.
6 Things To Know Before Installing an Pool
To change over to a saltwater chlorination system, you first have to choose and buy the system—these are rated by pool size, and there are many options available. The poolside chlorinator registers chlorine levels and indicates when you need to add simple table salt to the pool as more “fuel” for the salt conversion cell, according to Pool Supply World. Carefully stir your pool until the salt is completely dissolved.

Chlorine Alternative #3: Ozone
Ozone-treated pools use plain water that continuously circulates through an ozone generator, making a safe, non-caustic environment that’s still free of germs and gunk. There’s a larger initial investment because of the extra equipment, but experts say ozone pools are safer in many ways and cost less to maintain, according to Green Garage.
Ozone generators are installed outdoors and in the pool’s circulation system, per Poolonomics. They work by passing the water continuously through a produced supply of ozone gas, where ozone molecules bond with contaminants and strip them from the water.
Ozone won’t damage your pool or alter its pH, but it only works for pools with PVC or stainless steel pipes, as ozone is corrosive to other metals. You may also opt to keep using a small amount of chlorine as a backup in the event of a power outage or other maintenance on the generator.
Chlorine Alternative #4: Copper and Silver
Copper is a naturally germicidal material that some experts believe can prevent the spread of COVID-19, says the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Copper is introduced into pools via electrolysis, so it’s similar to the way saltwater pools turn salt into chlorine. And silver has many of the same properties—it’s even used in the alloys of many copper pool treatment systems.

6 Best Pool Liners to Keep Your Pool Safe
According to IntecAmerica, copper ionization is plumbed into your pool’s return line, where electricity passes through electrodes in order to release metallic ions into the water. The resulting copper ions won’t harm your pool equipment or surface, and you’ll only need to balance the pool for pH using baking soda or hydrochloric acid. There’s an up-front cost for the copper ionization equipment and installation.
Chlorine Alternative #5: Catalytic Oxidation
In active catalytic oxidation (ACO) pools, a safe chemical agent is dissolved in the pool. Sunlight activates this catalyst material, releasing free radicals that are destructive to all the bugs that might get in your pool. The result is a sanitized, safe pool with no need for chlorine. ACO can even be used in conjunction with a small amount of chlorine to amplify its effects.
ACO takes 6 to 8 weeks to truly work, and you can cross-taper it with a reduction in chlorine. You can mix ACO directly into your pool’s water, or distribute it through a zeta potential mixer (ZPM) unit installed in the pool’s plumbing. You’ll still have to test the water and adjust for pH, and you can continue to use chlorine if you want. In fact, one manufacturer says chlorine will last 300 percent longer and work better with the addition of ACO.

Chlorine shortage leads to price increases for swimming pool owners after factory fire

The smell of chlorine could be more elusive than usual this summer.
That's because the swimming pool industry is grappling with a chlorine shortage that has caused prices of the chemical to soar, forcing pool owners to consider alternatives.
"Pool chlorine is not easy to get, and there's a chlorine shortage nationally that we're all going to have to deal with," John Swygert, CEO of Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, told investors on a conference call.
After chlorine demand jumped in 2020 as Americans spent more time at home with their pools during the coronavirus pandemic, this year's shortage stems largely  from an incident at a plant in Westlake, Louisiana, in August.
The Bio-Lab factory, which produces pool and spa treatment products, experienced a devastating fire on the morning of Aug. 27, 2020, after the landfall of Hurricane Laura. No one was injured, but the incident destroyed the facility's roof and hobbled production, according to a report by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. Chlorine gas was released during the incident.
Since then, the supply of chlorine products has been constrained.

As the summer pool season is poised to begin, pool owners should brace for a price jump of about 58% from June through August, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to IHS Markit data cited in a Goldman Sachs report on the chlorine shortage.
"It will probably remain at (an) elevated level because I believe that the industry is going to be short for the season," Peter Arvan, CEO of swimming pool distributor Pool Corp., said on an earnings call April 22.
Goldman Sachs conducted an unscientific survey of 26 pool supply shops, and 15 expressed "uncertainty or doubt when asked about whether they will have enough chlorine for pool season," analyst Kate McShane wrote in a research note.
“Our standard bucket of 3-inch chlorine tablets, which are the backbone of a lot of pools right now, have pretty much become scarce,” said Thomas Race, owner of Aqua Caribbean Swimming Pool Service in Gainesville, Florida.
Pool water chemistry expert Rudy Stankowitz suggested that pool owners buy only what they need for the season. For most, that will be only a single bucket of chlorine tablets.
“I think the severity of the shortage is going to be directly related to people buying in reasonable quantities,” said Stankowitz, CEO of Aquatic Facility Training & Consultants. “If you stock up, it will make it even harder to find.”

Though there are other pool sanitizers such as algaecide, they are more expensive and less effective than chlorine.
Many pool owners are due for a shock, having already experienced increased prices on other pool-related items during 2020.
Mia Bagby, a Gainesville pool owner, was unaware of the chlorine shortage.
"I hadn’t heard of it at all,” she said. “I’m going to read up on it now.”
Stankowitz said the chlorine shortage could snowball into panic buying of other pool sanitizers as chlorine supplies run low.
“You can easily find folks that can’t find chlorine tablets buying up all the bleach off the shelves in the supermarket,” he said, “and then we run into another bleach shortage because people are dumping it in their pools.”
Stankowitz said bleach is half the strength of chlorine and warned pool owners to avoid using splashless bleach as it contains little chlorine but mixes in several dangerous additives.

Alright, so I've got these search results about chlorine shortages. It seems like this is a thing, especially in 2021. From what I'm reading, there are a few key points here.

First, there was a significant increase in pool installations in 2020 due to the pandemic. People were staying home, and many decided to build pools for recreation. This led to higher demand for chlorine, which is essential for pool maintenance.

Second, there was a fire at a major chlorine production plant in Louisiana in August 2020. This fire damaged the facility and halted production, reducing the overall supply of chlorine tablets in the market.

So,供需失衡导致了氯短缺。需求增加，供应减少，自然价格就上涨了。从搜索结果来看，氯片的价格几乎翻了一倍，而且供应紧张。

Now, I'm curious about why this is specifically affecting chlorine tablets. Are there other forms of chlorine that are less affected by this shortage?

Looking back at the articles, it seems that chlorine tablets are the most commonly used form for residential pools. The fire-affected plant was a major producer of these tablets. Other forms of chlorine, like liquid chlorine or granular forms, might be less impacted, but still, the overall chlorine supply chain seems to be stressed.

One article mentions that some pool owners are turning to alternatives like saltwater pools or other sanitizing methods. It would be interesting to explore these alternatives and see if they could be viable options for those facing chlorine shortages.

Also, I notice that the shortage is more acute for residential pools. Public pools might be using different sanitization methods that are less reliant on chlorine tablets. Maybe they use liquid chlorine or have other systems in place.

Another point is that the shortage might not be uniform across all regions. Perhaps some areas are experiencing more severe shortages than others, depending on local supply chains and distribution networks.

I should also consider the environmental impact of chlorine production and if there are any regulations that might be affecting its supply.

Wait, in the search results, there's mention of a factory fire and a hurricane damaging the plant. That must have set back production significantly. And with the plant not expected to resume normal operations until 2022, it's going to take time for the supply to recover.

Moreover, the pandemic has disrupted global supply chains in numerous ways, from semiconductor shortages to lumber shortages. It's possible that the chlorine industry is also facing logistical challenges.

I recall reading about shortages of various products during the pandemic, so perhaps chlorine is just another item affected by the broader supply chain issues.

Let me think about the chemistry involved. Chlorine is a basic chemical, and its production processes might be interconnected with other industries. For example, chlorine is produced via electrolysis of brine, so issues with energy supplies or salt supplies could affect chlorine production.

But from the articles, it seems like the main issue is the destruction of the production facility in Louisiana, which was a significant player in chlorine tablet production.

I wonder how many such facilities are there globally and in the US. If one major plant is down, it can create a substantial缺口 in supply.

Also, perhaps there are import options from other countries, but with transportation delays and trade complexities, that might not be a quick fix.

Furthermore, the increase in pool constructions last year might have caught suppliers off guard, leading to insufficient inventory to meet the sudden surge in demand.

It's also possible that the plant was operating at full capacity before the fire, and now with reduced production, they can't meet the elevated demand.

Looking ahead, it seems like the situation might persist for some time, at least until the damaged plant is rebuilt and operational again.

In the meantime, pool owners are advised to purchase chlorine supplies early and perhaps consider alternative sanitization methods.

It's important for them to maintain proper pool hygiene to prevent health hazards, so finding suitable substitutes or managing existing chlorine supplies carefully is crucial.

Overall, the chlorine shortage appears to be a combination of increased demand due to pandemic-induced behaviors and reduced supply due to a major production disruption.

I think that sums up the situation based on the information I've gathered from the search results.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The chlorine shortage is primarily due to increased demand for pool chlorine during the pandemic and a reduction in supply following a chemical plant fire in Louisiana in 2020.}} \]
