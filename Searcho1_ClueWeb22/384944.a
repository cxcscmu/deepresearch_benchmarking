So I have this question: "What role does traditional news media play in contemporary American society?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I think I can tackle it. First off, I need to understand what's meant by "traditional news media." I guess that refers to newspapers, television news channels, and maybe radio. These are the more established forms of news dissemination as opposed to online blogs, social media, or other digital platforms.

Now, "contemporary American society" probably means today's United States. So, I need to think about how these traditional news outlets function and influence society now. Maybe I should start by considering the basic roles of any news media: informing the public, shaping opinions, and holding those in power accountable.

Let me jot down some key points:

1. **Informing the Public**: This is the primary function of news media. They report on events, both local and global, to keep citizens informed about what's happening around them. In contemporary society, where information is abundant, traditional media still play a crucial role in providing verified, reliable news.

2. **Shaping Opinions**: News isn't just about reporting facts; it also involves interpretation and analysis. Traditional media often have editorial boards and opinion columns that shape how people perceive events. Their coverage can influence public opinion on various issues.

3. **Holding Power Accountable**: One of the most important roles of journalism is to act as a watchdog over government and other powerful institutions. By investigating and reporting on misconduct or inefficiencies, they help maintain transparency and integrity in society.

But, I should also consider the challenges traditional media face in today's digital age. With the rise of the internet and social media, many people get their news from online sources, which might not always be reputable. This has led to issues like fake news and echo chambers, where people only encounter information that reinforces their existing beliefs.

Perhaps I should look into how traditional media are adapting to these changes. Are they incorporating digital platforms? How are they ensuring the reliability of their reporting in an era where anyone can publish anything online?

Also, it's worth considering the business side of things. Traditional media, especially print newspapers, have been struggling financially due to the shift to digital. This might affect their ability to invest in in-depth reporting and investigative journalism.

Maybe I should do some research to get more concrete examples and statistics. Let me see.

If you mean mainstream (tradtional) news media like big city newspapers and major network news, not as much as they used to prior to the advent of cable news and the 24-hour news cycle. Print media is far less important and seems to be losing ground daily. People just don’t read to get information and that is not only a shame, but is a whole new topic I will not get into.
TV news, news feeds, streaming of news and opinion shows play a bigger part in today’s news sources. Unfortunatly, because there is ongoing mistrust of media in general, the role of media is rather checkered. Media is somethin

Depends on which “part” of American society you reference. It the broadest of terms, there are two parts. One, ill-informed and under-informed regard the news media as an unreliable source of information presented by liberal leaning journalists. The other, traditionally holds that they provide a necessary check and balance on authority, especially governmental, by discovering and delivering the truth to the general public.

Not the role intended. They were supposed to report the news and be a check on politicians lying to the public or withholding information from the public. Today, the news media lies to the public. They also withhold pertinent information from the public if they think it would sway the public from believing what they want the public to think. In other words, the news media has become the very thing they were intended to prevent.

The news media’s traditional role, as the fourth estate, is to criticize our leaders. To provide a kind of an outlet for contrary opinions. Fortunately or unfortunately, as newspapers have become part of the big business landscape, the tides have been turning.
In Donald Trump, the past four and a half years have given much for the news media to criticize. Trump is the (sarcastic) gift that keeps on giving. These are the gold rush years for the news media.

It depends on the media outlet. The main-stream media, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, and ABC are little more than the communications arm of the democrat party, when it comes to politics. FOX and OAN serve as the more conservative approach to the political scene. Main-stream media continues to give way to the indoctrination methods of the democrat values at the expense of truth through opinions instead of news, causing FOX and OAN to drive harder the facts of reality, in opposition to political rhetoric designed to subjugate the populace.

Why is trust in US news and media at historic low levels?
Probably because the Americans want more unbiased news.
I think what has happened in the United States is that US media had to compete against social media and the Tech platforms taking over the presentation of news. To survive, the regular US media had to create their own following of what their audience wants to hear. It had to become partisan as a response to people being angry and wanting to hear things that reinforce their own views.

Role Of Mass Media In Contemporary Society.
Mass media is a means of communication that extends to a humongous audience in a small span of time. Nowadays our society lives under the sway of media. Whatever is exhibited in it is generally a reflection of the society, as communication plays a crucial role in an individual’s development. The media can provide information as well as education. Information comes in various forms, and it might sometimes be difficult to separate from entertainment. Media can be used to monitor government, business, and other institutions.
Now and then
We have shifted from “traditional media” to “new media”. Traditional media includes cable & satellite, print, broadcast technology, and billboards. New media includes the internet and smartphones. Both of them bear their own pros and cons.
Traditional media promotes more separation between consumers and businesses. But it remains a trusted source for information when it comes to the news since it’s hard to find a substitute for a factual, balanced story. Social media do deliver information but it in headline and sound bites. It is a tried-and-tested method and had helped many businesses to reach the apex. But unfortunately, it requires a huge advertising budget that may cause a financial burden on the owner. This is also one of the reasons for the increasing popularity of new media.
The advent of new media over the past 3 decades not only increased accessibility but also shifted some of the power and funding streams of traditional media. Nowadays people eventually spend more time with their smartphones and much less time watching television or listening to the radio. New media on the other hand seems more cost-efficient, adaptable, data-driven then traditional media.
Traditional and new media can complement each other with each of them playing an important role and making the campaign stronger. Both of them bear positive and negative aspects.
Keeps informed
The mass media plays a constructive role in contemporary society, which increases awareness among the public. They convey messages in such a manner which may change the public’s attitude towards certain issue. The mass media keeps people illuminated and renovated about diverse news, lifestyle, events, social activities, the political aspect of different countries, and advertisements regardless of the geographical barriers. media acts as a warehouse of knowledge and information. For instance: it provides news about meetings, summits, agreements, bilateral trade.etc taking place among various countries. It makes us informed about new schemes and policies being launched in our country. The media plays a crucial role in a disaster such as cyclones, earthquake.etc by informing the public about the effects, warnings, gathering, and transmitting information about areas which are badly affected. It also assists in assists the government to be alert and influence to aid for rescue and relief.
Sometimes due to a lack of coordination between government officials and media, reporters tend to rely on local informers. Beside media should indulge in creating an environment of unanimity and trust to assists in supplementing the collective responsibility to overcome obstacles faced by any disaster.
The positive and negative aspect
The influence of mass media is undeniable as it can make or break the belief of the people and can bear powerful consequences either in right or wrong issue. Social media acts as a platform for exchanging information and makes an individual feel better by boosting self-confidence. It is a creative workplace where one can analyze their ability and might get the opportunity to excel in their lives. One can be updated about what’s happening around the globe. Media in a democratic country enjoys power in pointing out injustice, wrong deeds, and can provide evidence of corruption. They have modified the political system and reevaluate the role of journalists. They re-evaluated and citizens’ commitment to policies.
Some of the negative impacts of media are: media can be held responsible for the escalation of hoaxes, conspiracy theory in social, political, and technical forms of phonies news spreads much quickly then authentic one via Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, and other social media. Audiences are being fooled and confused by that phony news. Legal action against such publishers is much more challenging, expensive, and time-consuming to sue the publisher. The media should avoid narrating the story based on gossip about the ongoing investigation of the crime that is being conducted by the official agencies. The over-emphasis on the glamour, film actors, models, successful men & women in fields of business, sports, politics, and art by media is out of the line of their business. Be it the advertisements, daily soaps, web series, and movies they often portray violence, sexually explicit content, drug abuse, and abusive languages. Messages they try to convey might not be ill-suited but unfortunately, the way people watch, they accept it as a part of their culture. The negative things controversies of so-called celebrities’ lives are highlighted by the media and teenagers often try to imitate them.
Conclusion
Media plays a crucial role in our society as a source of information but also as a scrutinizer to scan minute detail. They are at liberty to choose any stories to reflect on their channel, bearing a keen sense of knowledge about public taste. Therefore they bear positive as well as a negative aspect, it depends on us how we take it.

News is a source of information about current events and major changes worldwide. Traditional media, also named as old media, is the most basic form to report the daily news, involving television, newspaper, radio and magazine. Furthermore, social media is the online communication platform to spread the news and almost become a news source. As a matter of fact, the use of social media is increasing continuously. For example, there are nearly two-thirds of American adults using social network and the impact of social media on the people’s lives is much deeper based on the study (Perrin, 2015). However, traditional media still has its advantages and unshakable position being the source of news. Traditional media are not likely to be replaced …show more content…
Though traditional media continue playing the role of highly trusted sources of news, the credibility of the social media is continually increasing from a public perspective (MarketingCharts, 2015). Social media tend to be more timely than traditional press. The modern trend that people browse news actively on social media has become popular. Social media are more likely to provide much free news, and people can be easily attracted by the showy headlines. However, the realness of social media is often unknown. The references were not given in many cases. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect the existence of bias. Compared with poor credibility of social media, traditional media keep a better reputation. According to Noble (2014), the traditional media maintain the trustworthy information source. When it comes to the news, the straight fact cannot be substituted. Traditional media is a professional industry. Furthermore, it has a strong human and material resource for its business property so that the quality of news can be ensured. A study by Elite Daily demonstrated the traditional media are still valuable because more than half young respondents feel most enlightened when the news is from either newspapers or traditional press sites (Martinez, 2015). In summary, traditional media has better credibility than social …show more content…
Conversely, its evolution contributes to the unshakable position of the traditional media as a source of news. The appearance of social media motivated the traditional media which led to the evolution of traditional media along with the development of the era. From 2005 to 2015, the percentage of all grown-up men in America who use social media increased by 60% (Perrin, 2015). It means that Social media has a rapid development on the Internet. It depends on the improvement of technology to create highly interactive platforms for different users to share information and appeals many users to browse the news on it. To catch this indispensable and tremendous business opportunity, traditional media started its evolution connected to social technology. In recent years, traditional media spread the news to the public through the online platform. Nonetheless, traditional media keeps the same source of news in either online or print forms (Dimitrov, 2014). In short, traditional press may become irreplaceable due to its evolution as a source of

Does social media have a positive impact on society
Social media, a form of electronic communication channel which is useful for sharing information, pictures, personal texts, ideas, is one of the most popular technologies today. However, in recent years, the question of whether social media is a positive or negative trend has been raised. Although some people argue that social media has a negative impact on society, I believe that social media is beneficial for society in a number of ways. 
       Firstly, social media makes communication a lot easier than before. In the past, most people used phones and letters for communicating with others; they were not an effective way of communication because they were time consuming and not instant.

Social media has, especially become a dominant platform for activists to communicate and raise their agenda (Shorter 39). Cyber activism is based on the fact that digital media is perceived to be revolutionary. According to Barker, digital media has characteristics such as interactivity, interconnectivity, and informational activity which assist in explaining the ease with which people that are not professionals can produce and edit as well as consume content (365). Jenkins highlights the fact that new media technologies have enabled the flow of content through many channels (11). This is shown by how sharing of content, collection of content through the search for images and publication in platforms that material could easily be shared.

Social media are pervasive in today’s society and penetrate almost every facet of everyday life, be it within private interactions or the professional sphere (van Dijck & Poell, 2013).

With the growing importance of social media in modern life, you see the increase in the popularity of technology across all age groups.  Technology gives people a simple and easy way to communicate with others and to gather information.  Because social media comes with multiple benefits it is seen only as a positive in modern day.  This may not be exactly the case.  Through my recent readings, I have found that social media does in fact have significant drawbacks and because of this I feel that people should cut back on their daily routine of technology use and social media.

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let's see what they say about the role of traditional news media in contemporary American society.

First, from the Quora answer, it mentions that traditional news media, like big city newspapers and major network news, aren't as influential as they used to be. Print media is losing ground, and TV news and other forms are more prominent. There's a mention of mistrust in media, which seems to be a significant issue.

Another Quora answer talks about how traditional news media is supposed to represent political parties and promote their agendas. This suggests that there's a bias in traditional media, which aligns with the first answer about mistrust.

One answer from Quora says that traditional news media is dead, which seems extreme, but it reflects the sentiment that the role has changed significantly.

Moving on to the Chegg answer, it provides a more structured response, discussing the roles of traditional news media and social media in contemporary American society. It seems like the answer is incomplete, but it touches on the idea that traditional media provides factual news, while social media offers a platform for sharing opinions and information, but with less reliability.

The Medium article discusses the role of mass media in contemporary society more broadly, mentioning that it keeps people informed and plays a crucial role in emergencies. However, it also points out negative aspects like the spread of fake news and the influence of media on public opinion.

Lastly, the IPL essay emphasizes the importance of traditional media in providing credible news and the challenges it faces from social media. It argues that despite the rise of social media, traditional media remains a trusted source of information.

From these sources, I can gather that traditional news media still plays a vital role in informing the public and maintaining transparency, but its influence is declining due to the rise of social media. There's also a notable issue of mistrust in media, possibly due to perceived biases and the spread of misinformation.

I should also consider the business side of traditional media. Many newspapers and TV stations are struggling financially, which might affect their ability to produce high-quality journalism. At the same time, social media platforms are becoming dominant in news consumption, but they often lack the fact-checking and editorial standards of traditional media.

Perhaps I should look into some statistics on news consumption in the US to get a better understanding. Let me see.

News consumption now most commonly occurs online or via television. Although Gannett, owner of daily middle-market newspaper USA Today, remains the leading newspaper company in the United States ranked by circulation, the function of newspapers has changed and consumers now prefer social media and network news for keeping up to date. Data from a 2021 survey found that close to 48 percent of U.S. adults used social media for news often or semi-regularly. By contrast, an investigation into the frequency of newspaper use revealed that most adults never read newspapers at all.

Introduction
When we ran our Media Consumption Report for 2020 in June last year, the country and the world was changing rapidly. The pandemic had closed businesses and halted travel, and the Black Lives Matter protests were triggering a long overdue change to the national debate on social issues.
People everywhere were consuming content in unprecedented levels – there was little else to do during lockdowns. But what’s changed a year on? In this report we’ll give you the latest data on Americans’ media consumption for 2021, and guide brands on how to reach their customers this year and beyond.
What are the highlights from our data?
Streaming overtakes live TV
For the first time since we launched the Media Consumption Report in 2019, the number of Americans streaming TV content (83%) has surpassed those watching live TV (81%)
Decrease in TV bingeing
It’s perhaps no surprise to discover that the time Americans spend watching TV has reduced compared with 2020. What is a surprise is that time spent watching TV is also considerably lower than pre-pandemic levels.
Switching off the news and escaping reality
Our research reveals a collapse in consumers watching TV news, with just under a third (32%) regularly tuning in, compared with 46% in 2020.
In this report, we’ve broken the data down by age demographic, making it easy for you to see the best ways to access your target audience. Covering everything from printed publications to podcasts, this insight (from 2,000 US working-age consumers) will help guide your media buying across TV, print, audio and digital. And, what’s more, you can slice and dice the data to your own specifications in our interactive dashboard.

By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, Ben Kamisar and Benjy Sarlin
WASHINGTON — Our latest NBC News poll continues to show an enormous divide in opinion by how Americans get their news — either conservative media, liberal media, social media and those who still get their news from broadcast TV and newspapers.
Check out these numbers:

All adults: 49 precent
Among those who get their news from conservative media: 24 percent
Among those who get news from liberal media: 69 percent
Among those who get news from newspapers/broadcast TV (not cable or social media): 60 percent
Among those who get news from social media: 47 percent

Social media: 41 percent
Jan 6 was act of terrorism
All: 52 percent
Conservative media: 29 percent
Liberal media: 69 percent
Newspapers/broadcast: 58 percent
Social media: 52 percent
It’s a chicken-or-egg question: What came first — the media Americans are getting that are informing their views?
Or did they already have these views first — and they decided to get their news from them as a result?
Or it is a combination of the two?
Profound — and fatal — consequences
Regardless of what came first, this news silo-ing also has profound — even fatal — consequences during a pandemic.
Look at these additional numbers, per the MTP Daily team. (Note: the Covid numbers come from the New York Times county data, as of Wednesday night.)

25+ Remarkable News Consumption Statistics [2021 Edition]

25+ Remarkable News Consumption Statistics [2021 Edition]
Imagine a society without news.
A dark world where no one knows what’s going on outside the home or workplace.
The scenario doesn’t sound very appealing or even practical. News is a very critical part of our daily lives.
Here’s why:
News helps us keep tabs on what is happening around the world and how it may affect us. Also, news can be a source of entertainment for many people.
As these news consumption statistics will show, a lot has changed with the availability of the internet. The world has become a transnational network, and global news is just a click away. More and more people are looking for news online, and many of them use social media to learn about the latest events.
Top News Consumption Trends (Editor’s Choice)
Nordic countries have the highest number of paying online news readers.
Only one US newspaper had a daily circulation above 500,000 copies in 2020.
In 2020, the US cable news viewership reached an all-time high.
More than 30 million Americans tuned in to major-network evening news in 2020.
48% of Americans receive breaking news from social media.
WhatsApp is the fastest-growing social news app worldwide.
Globally, 56% of media consumers are worried about fake news.
Fox News overtook local TV as the leading offline news source in 2020.
Trends in the News 2021
1. Nordic countries had the highest number of paying online news readers in 2020.
(Reuters Institute)
Internet publications require money to run, whether it’s in the form of subscriptions, donations, or memberships. For this reason, online news agencies have been trying to push users to pay for a long time.
So far, they’ve been most successful in Sweden and Norway, but the US is slowly catching up. Many people in these countries chose to pay to read their favorite news on the internet in 2020. In some cases, the year-over-year increases were significant.
News consumption stats show that 26% of media consumers from the Nordic countries paid for their news at least once in 2020. Norway is in the lead with 42% (up from 34% in 2019), and Sweden is second with 27% (same as in 2019). The US is at 20%, up from 16% in 2019.
2. Only one US newspaper had a daily circulation above 500,000 copies in 2020.
(PressGazette)
With an average of 994,600 copies sold daily in the first quarter of 2020, The Wall Street Journal was the only US newspaper with circulation above 500,000 copies.
News consumption statistics from Q1 of 2020 show that USA Today, once the country’s most popular newspaper, was now in a distant second with 486,579 copies sold daily. The New York Times ranked third (410,562 copies), The Washington Post was fourth (206,824), and Los Angeles Times rounded out the top five (193,015 copies).
The COVID-19 pandemic took a massive toll on print media. Many publishers laid off staff, while some even filed for bankruptcy. The annual print circulation data for 2020 is unavailable, but the numbers are likely to be significantly lower than in the year’s first quarter.
3. 47% of 45 to 54-year-olds rely on the local news to stay informed.
(Statista)
Looking at media consumption habits, the 45 to 54-year-old demographic loves local news. Only 6% of that age group doesn’t follow localized news at all.
Local news is least popular with 18 to 29-year-olds (32% ). As you can see, the difference between these two age groups isn’t that large, suggesting that local news has a level of importance to both demographics.
4. The United States cable news viewership reached an all-time high in 2020.
(Variety, CNN)
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election, cable news networks had a very successful year, statistics on news consumption show.
Fox News grew its audience by 43% in 2020 and ranked among the top 10 networks overall in the advertiser-preferred 18–49 demographic. What’s more, the network had its most successful year ever, averaging more than 3 million viewers in primetime.
Other cable news networks also posted significant increases in 2020. MSNBC was up by 23%, while CNN grew its audience by a whopping 83%. In November 2020, CNN had the biggest monthly viewership in its 40-year history.
Where People Get Their News?
5. 35% of Americans preferred getting their news from TV in 2020.
(Pew Research Center)
Interestingly, the percentage of American adults who enjoy watching the news on TV is higher among older audiences. News consumption statistics by age show that 68% of media consumers over the age of 65 and 54% of those aged 50–64 get their news from television. For comparison, only 16% of news watchers aged 18–29 cited TV as their go-to source of information.
As for other traditional media outlets, 7% of American adults say they listen to the radio for news, while print publications have just a 5% share.
6. In 2020, 52% of US adults preferred getting their news from digital platforms.
(Pew Research Center)
Online news consumption saw significant growth in 2020, with more than half of adults preferring digital platforms. A closer look at news industry trends shows that 50% of digital news consumers primarily rely on news websites. Another 23.1% get their news from web searches, 22% from social media, and 4.9% from podcasts.
7. 18 to 29-year-olds were the most avid digital news consumers in 2020.
(Pew Research Center)
A staggering 71% of media consumers in this age group got their news from digital sources in 2020. The 30–49 bracket follows closely with 67%, the 50–69 age group is third with 52%, and the over-65 are fourth with 48% of digital news consumers.
8. 69% of people worldwide use their smartphones to access news.
(Reuters Institute)
According to 2020 mobile news consumption trends,more than two-thirds of people worldwide use their smartphones at least once a week to access news.
Somewhat surprisingly, smartphone news consumption rates are highest in places where flat-rate internet is less common, such as Kenya (83% of mobile users) and South Africa (82%).
More developed countries tend to have the lowest rates — for example, Canada is at 55% and Japan at 52%. However, recent trends indicate that, even in these countries, smartphones are quickly becoming the primary platform for digital news consumption.
9. More than 30 million viewers tuned in to major-network evening news in March and April 2020.
(Variety)
How many people watch the news?
Any other year, the numbers would’ve been unimpressive. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted US TV viewers to go back to watching the evening news live.
Between March and April 2020, close to 31 million people combined tuned in to watch the evening news across the three major networks — ABC, CBS, and NBC. This marked a record-breaking 42% rise from the same period in 2019 when about 21.9 million watched major broadcasters’ evening news.
Even PBS, a public broadcaster that doesn’t usually publish its ratings, boasted about a 34% rise in live viewership for the PBS NewsHour.
Many people still relied on digital platforms for the latest news, which brings us to the next question:
How many people get news from social media?
10. 48% of Americans receive breaking news from social media.
(Statista, Pew Research Center)
Billions of people have access to social media platforms and have started relying on them for the most recent news. Globally, the use of social media as a news source in 2020 was highest in Kenya (77%), Greece (73%), and Chile (73%).
The US ranked 15th out of 20 surveyed countries. Millennials are the most avid social media news consumers here — 57% say they read the news on social media daily.
Facebook is the most popular site with US adult news lovers at 36%. YouTube follows with 32%, and Twitter is third with 15% . In 2020, TikTok established itself as one of the most popular social media platforms, and 3% of Americans now get their news there.
11. 62% of US adults believe social media ’s effect on the news is too big.
(Pew Research Center)
Social media platforms have algorithms that tailor their news content to each user’s interests and online behavior. However, 55% of Americans think this results in a worse combination of news than users would normally get.
According to a recent survey, 88% of US adults believe social media favors sensational content designed to attract clicks. Additionally, 79% believe certain media outlets get preferential treatment from social platforms.
For 55% of Americans, the most significant problem stemming from this is the distribution of one-sided news. Furthermore, 51% believe this enables the sharing of inaccurate or fake information.
12. The New York Times tops the list of the most respected newspapers in the US.
(Pew Research Center)
In this era of fake news, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories, readers are very skeptical about the news in general. There are also too many biased publications willing to fabricate facts that favor their political allies.
It’s not all bad, though, as recent facts about the news media reveal.
There are newspaper brands that will go the extra mile to ensure the news they publish strictly follows ethics codes. Some publications will even fire staff who plagiarize or exaggerate rather than report facts.
Many Americans still trust print journalism. According to a 2020 survey, the three most trusted newspapers are The New York Times (35%), The Wall Street Journal (32%), and USA Today (30%).
World News Consumption Statistics
13. Only 38% of people worldwide trust the news.
(Reuters Institute)
Globally, people’s trust in the news has been decreasing for years.
In 2020, there were only five countries where more than 50% of people said they have complete faith in the news they hear. These include Portugal (56%), Finland (56%), Turkey (55%), The Netherlands (54%), and Brazil (51%). In the US, only 29% of news consumers said they trust mainstream media, down from 32% in 2019.
14. WhatsApp is among the fastest-growing social news apps worldwide.
(Reuters Institute)
Although Facebook and YouTube remain the leading social apps for news, online news consumption statistics show that the use of WhatsApp is increasing worldwide. In 2020, 47% of news readers used this app to learn the latest information and discuss it in WhatsApp’s private groups.
WhatsApp is most used in Latin America, South-East Asia, and Africa. Its social news market share is high in countries like Chile (40%), Brazil (48%), Mexico (39%), and Argentina (38%). Furthermore, 51% of news consumers in Malaysia, 50% in Hong Kong, and 47% in Singapore also use WhatsApp to get the latest information.
The app is most popular in Kenya, where 67% of people use it to get news.
15. 56% of people worldwide worry about fake news.
(Reuters Institute)
Statistics about news consumption worldwide reveal that the level of concern is highest in Brazil, where 84% of media consumers say they don’t always know if the news they’re reading is fake.
Similar levels of concern exist in Portugal and Kenya (76% each). The US ranks fifth with 67% of concerned media consumers, behind fourth-placed South Africa (72%).
Statistics of News Consumption Over Time
16. China had the earliest form of news media in 202 BC.
(PsPrint)
Way back in 202 BC, China had local news media referred to as Tipao. Tipao mainly focused on imperial bulletins and palace reports, and runners only distributed the news to bureaucrats.
In ancient Rome, the government distributed news sheets to the public as early as 131 BC. The news was mostly about executions, trials, military PR campaigns, and politics.
Moving to Colonial America, Benjamin Harris was the first person to print an actual newspaper in 1690. Unfortunately, the government arrested Harris because his paper included political criticism.
Let’s look at more historical news consumption statistics.
17. John Campbell published the first successful US newspaper in 1704.
(PsPrint)
Campbell, a Boston postmaster, stayed away from politics to avoid upsetting the government.
In 1722, the colonial government jailed another popular publisher for criticism over the government’s failure to protect people in New England from pirates.
But things started changing during the industrial revolution:
By 1890, some newspapers circulated millions of copies. During this time, newspaper suppression was unheard of, giving publishers more liberty to print unbiased news.
18. US newspaper circulation in 2020 was at an 80-year low.
(Pew Research Center, PressGazette)
In 2020, the newspaper circulation in the US was the lowest since 1940.
The downward print media consumption trends started in the 1970s when publishers began cutting costs by shutting down many evening newspapers.
Sunday papers held their ground until the end of the 1980s. By the early 1990s, their circulation also started gradually declining, just as the popularity of 24-hour news channels began growing.
As news consumption statistics over the century show, the US newspaper circulation has been steadily dropping each year since then.
With no national newspaper managing to cross the one-million mark and only one selling more than 500,000 copies in 2020, it was the least successful year for print journalism in the 80 years that official circulation numbers have been monitored.
19. In 2020, TV reclaimed its position as one of the most popular news consumption sources, statistics show.
(Reuters Institute)
According to a 2020 report, the COVID-19 pandemic helped television — local, network, and cable — grow its viewership and strengthen its dominance in the media landscape.
For an entire decade, the internet was gradually overtaking television as the go-to source of information. However, 60% of US media consumers and 71% of their UK peers said they got their news from TV in 2020, marking a 5% uptick from January 2020, right before the pandemic hit these countries.
And while most news channels had their most successful year in 2020, online news statistics show that the internet is still the number-one news source worldwide.
20. 67% of global news consumers now watch online video news.
(Reuters Institute)
Besides social media, news websites with video content are very popular among media consumers worldwide.
News consumption statistics from 2020 reveal that Turkey had the highest share of online news viewers (95%), followed closely by Kenya (93%) and the Philippines and Hong Kong (89% each).
In the US, 61% of news consumers get their information in the form of online videos. These include individual video stories, on-demand broadcasts of network news shows, and satirical takes on the daily news (e.g., The Daily Show and Last Week Tonight ).
Statistics on News Consumption and Generations
21. 48% of millennials prefer news that contains augmented reality.
(Agility PR Solutions)
Augmented reality is a hit with millennials, with nearly 50% opting for it compared to traditional news presentation. Generation Z also shows a considerable interest in technology, at 47%. Only 20% of baby boomers care about virtual reality, while 33% of Gen-Xers prefer it to the traditional way of presenting news.
22. Millennials consider 76% of the news they consume to be entertainment.
(Agility PR Solutions)
Media consumption statistics show that just over three-quarters of millennials consider what they read or watch as entertainment. The demographic least interested in entertainment news is baby boomers (50%).
23. 44% of millennials don’t think journalism is relevant to them.
(Agility PR Solutions)
Shockingly, 44% of millennials don’t care for journalism. Generation X statistics aren’t that good either, with just 41%. As for Gen-Zers, 39% don’t find journalism relevant.
This is yet another learning point for media companies.
Media outlets and journalism companies should consider looking for better ways to appeal to these demographics. Millennials, Generation Z, and Generation X all prefer sensory news.
24. In 2020, 57% of millennials got their daily news from social media.
(Statista)
Where do millennials get their news?
Unsurprisingly, a vast majority of US millennials get their daily news from social media.
However, it is surprising to learn that 28% of them also listen to news radio every day. Television comes in third with 25%, online-only media outlets are fourth with 24%, and cable news rounds out the top five with 21% millennials watching it daily.
Only 10% of millennials read newspapers every day in 2020. Meanwhile, podcasts are becoming more and more relevant as a news source — 8% of US millennials listen to them daily to stay informed, another 10% multiple times a week, and 8% once a week.
TV News Consumption Statistics
25. Local TV news stations saw a drop in ad revenue in 2020.
(Statista, Pew Research Center)
Back in 2017, the US local TV news market had combined revenue of $27.87 billion.
Since then, however, the five major local TV companies have experienced a steady drop in ad revenue — and it continued in 2020. Overall, these companies and the 600 local stations they operate saw a median ad revenue decrease of 24% from 2019.
But 2020 was far from gloomy for local news broadcasters.
Due to the positive trends in news consumption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people turned to local news for the latest information. As a result, their cable carriage fees grew by an unprecedented 37% year-over-year, resulting in a median revenue bump of more than $87 million.
26. Fox News overtook local TV as the leading source of offline news in 2020.
(Statista)
Fox News had its strongest year ever in terms of viewership, but it also managed to dethrone local TV stations as the top offline news source in the US.
According to 2020 facts about news consumption, 29% of media consumers cited Fox News as their go-to offline news source. Local news is right behind with 28%, while NBC (and its cable news channel MSNBC) and CNN tied for third place with 24% each.
This certainly makes sense.
In a year full of major events — including the global pandemic and the presidential election — TV stations kept viewers glued to their screens with regular updates and live reporting throughout the day. Print media couldn’t compete with this, which explains why only 18% of Americans chose local newspapers as their preferred offline news source.
Media Consumption Statistics: In Conclusion
How people consume news has changed over the years. Different demographics also have unique preferences and are not afraid to choose one news source over the other.
Although 2020 was very successful for TV and online media outlets, recent news media consumption trends show there’s a lot that media companies need to work on to appeal to different audiences.
Bottom line:
Online news sources have gained momentum in recent years. However, we can’t ignore other news sources like newspapers, as generations of media consumers still love them. Television has also seen a massive spike in ratings due to major global events in 2020, but maintaining those high ratings will certainly be challenging.
Ultimately, each demographic likes their news a certain way, so there’s a clear need for every media outlet to develop ways to engage all of them.
FAQ
What is news consumption?
News consumption is the consumer’s intake of news. Whether it’s through conventional (newspapers, radio, and television) or online news sources, different demographics have different ways of gratifying their need for news.
What percentage of Americans watch TV news?
According to a 2020 survey , 60% of Americans watch the news on TV. The percentage is much bigger than in previous years, but it’s hardly surprising. In 2020, the whole world fought with the COVID-19 pandemic, and many media consumers turned to TV for the latest updates. The US presidential election and the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump also undoubtedly contributed to the rise in TV news viewership.
How much is the news industry worth?
It’s difficult to assess the news industry’s exact value, as most news outlets are part of large corporations. For example, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal are both part of the NewsCorp, AT&T’s Time Warner owns CNN, and MSNBC is part of Comcast’s NBCUniversal conglomerate.
For this reason, financial reports put news outlets in a broader category — media and entertainment. According to industry insiders, the US market was worth $720 billion in 2020, while the global entertainment and media industry was worth about $2 trillion.
How much time do people spend watching the news?
According to data from September 2020, Americans spent an average of 7 hours and 5 minutes per week watching the news. For comparison, the average weekly time spent watching the news was 5 hours and 46 minutes just a year earlier, indicating a 13% year-over-year increase.
How do millennials get news?
Most millennials prefer getting their news online, with 57% citing social media as their go-to source of information. Surprisingly, 28% of millennials said they got their news from the radio in 2020, 25% watched major-network news, and 21% watched cable news broadcasts daily. Only 10% of millennials got their daily news from newspapers.
How many people get their news from Facebook?
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform for news, with 36% of US adults getting their news there in 2020. YouTube is in second place with 23%, and Twitter rounds out the top three with 15%, news consumption statistics show.

Where Do People Get Their News? [+10 Other Questions About News Consumption]

Where Do People Get Their News? [+10 Other Questions About News Consumption]
The US media landscape is oversaturated with all types of media outlets — from the traditional (newspapers, radio, and TV) to the modern (news websites, apps, and social media platforms).
With so much choice out there, where do people get their news? Does a person’s preference for a specific news source depend on their political affiliation? Is television still relevant in 2021?
Here you’ll find the answers to these and other questions about modern-day media consumption.
Where Do Americans Get Their News?
Americans of all ages keep up with current affairs and are very particular about their preferred news sources. Let’s examine the US news consumers’ habits and see where they get their news, which platforms they use most often, and what role — if any — their political affiliation plays.
1. Where Do Most People Get Their News?
(Pew Research Center)
The rise of the internet as a news source has changed the way people get information.
According to a 2020 survey, 52% of American adults prefer getting their news on digital platforms — be it an app, a website, a social media platform, or even a podcast.
This doesn’t mean traditional media outlets aren’t influential anymore.
More than one-third of Americans (35%) still get their news from television, 7% listen to the radio for updates, while another 5% read print publications to learn about the latest events.
2. Where Do Most Americans Get Their Political News?
(Pew Research Center)
Regarding major political events, television is by far the leading news source in the US.
A 2020 study found an impressive 45% of Americans still watch TV to stay updated on the political news. Cable and local news broadcasts are the most popular, attracting 16% of US adults each, while another 13% prefer watching the news on network television.
Other commonly used information sources include news apps and websites (25%) and social media (18%). Another 8% of Americans get their political updates from the radio, and 3% read newspapers for political news and commentary.
3. How Do People Get Their News?
(Pew Research Center)
The most common way that Americans get their news is from digital platforms.
Recent research reveals that a staggering 86% of Americans use their smartphones, tablets, and computers to catch up on the latest news. While 26% only do it sometimes, the remaining 60% say they do it regularly.
Watching television is the second most popular way of getting the news — 40% of Americans say they watch it often and another 28% occasionally. Radio ranks third, with 50% of US adults listening to it either regularly (16%) or from time to time (34%). Finally, print media is fourth, with 10% of Americans reading it often and another 22% doing so occasionally.
4. Where Do Millennials Get Their News?
(Statista)
Younger Americans are most likely to get their news from online sources.
Most millennials (57%) say they get their daily news updates from social media. The radio is also surprisingly popular among millennials, with 28% listening to the news every day.
Just under half of US millennials regularly watch television news — 25% opt for major networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC), while 21% prefer watching cable news broadcasts.
Further news consumption statistics from 2020 show that 24% of millennials search for news on online-only outlets, 10% also read newspapers, and 8% listen to podcasts for news.
5. What Percentage of Adults Read the News Online?
(Pew Research Center)
As mentioned, 52% of Americans prefer getting their news from digital sources.
A more in-depth look into their habits reveals that the majority (69%) reads news on specialized apps and websites — 34% do so often and 35% from time to time. Many (65%) also use search engines like Google to see if there’s any news on the topics that interest them.
Statistics show that 53% of US adults use social media as a news source. While 23% say they do this regularly, the remaining 30% say they only do it occasionally. News podcasts are also growing in popularity, with 6% of Americans listening often and another 10% sometimes.
6. How Many People Get Their News from Social Media?
(Pew Research Center)
More than half of US adults (53%) say they regularly or periodically get their news from social media. Social platforms rank among the main news sources for most Americans; only 21% say they’ve never relied on social media to stay informed.
Interestingly, even though they read the news on social media, not all Americans believe in its accuracy. According to a 2020 survey, only 39% of people who read updates on social apps believe the information they get is accurate. However, the large majority (59%) finds that most of the news they read is largely inaccurate or entirely fabricated — so-called “fake news.”
7. How Many People Get Their News from Facebook?
(Pew Research Center)
Facebook is the undisputed leader among social media news sources.
Online news consumption statistics show that 36% of all US adults get the latest updates from this platform. Facebook news consumers are predominantly women (63%) aged 30–49 (41%).
Looking at the racial breakdown, an overwhelming 60% of people who get their news from Facebook are white, compared to a combined 40% of people of all other races. In terms of education, all groups are evenly distributed — 39% have a high school degree or less, 32% are college graduates, and 29% are studying for or have already obtained a master’s degree or higher.
8. Where Do Republicans Get Their News?
(Pew Research Center)
Like all Americans, Republicans prefer getting their news from television.
As for the most popular news sources among the Republican Party supporters, Fox News is in the lead, with 60% citing it as their go-to source of information. Major networks are in a distant second — 30% of Republicans watch ABC News, 28% NBC News, and 26% CBS News.
Despite the channel being perceived as democratic-leaning, 24% of Republicans say they watch CNN. Sean Hannity’s syndicated daily radio show is also very influential, with 19% of people identifying as Republicans saying they regularly listen to it.
9. Where Do Democrats Get Their News?
(Pew Research Center)
Most Democrats get the latest updates from traditional news sources.
With 55% of Democrats watching the channel regularly, CNN leads the list of their preferred news sources. Similar to Republicans, major-network news broadcasts are also very popular. NBC News leads with 40%, followed closely by ABC News (37%) and CBS News (33%).
One notable difference between Democrats and Republicans is that the former read newspapers in much larger numbers. Namely, 31% say they read The New York Times, 26% get their news from The Washington Post, while 15% regularly read The Wall Street Journal.
10. What Percentage of Americans Watch the News?
(Pew Research Center, Variety)
With the global pandemic raging and the presidential election approaching, most Americans turned to television when looking for unbiased news sources in 2020. Almost half of all Americans (45%) still watch television news, and in 2020, this was more evident than ever.
The growing trust in TV news reflected on the ratings. All cable news networks saw massive viewership increases in 2020 — CNN was up 83%, Fox News 43%, and MSNBC 23% year-over-year. Major networks were also up, with rating increases of 42% from 2019.
In late March and early April 2020, more than 31 million people watched one of the network TV news broadcasts (ABC, CBS, and NBC) — 10 million more viewers than the previous year.
11. What Is America’s Main Media Source?
(Pew Research Center)
Despite TV’s renewed popularity, the modern news consumer prefers digital news sources.
More than half of Americans (52%) used digital platforms to get their news in 2020, and it’s not surprising. With so many important events throughout the year, digital sources could provide the latest information and updates in real-time, something “old” media still struggled to achieve.
Final Thoughts
US news consumption has changed drastically over the last few decades, with many people turning to digital news sources. But this doesn’t mean traditional media is dead — 2020 was a record-breaking year for TV news, with almost half of Americans tuning in for the latest updates.
We will soon see if TV can maintain these viewership trends or if the gains were just temporary.

So, according to these statistics, digital platforms have become the primary source of news for Americans, with 52% preferring them over traditional media. TV still holds a significant portion at 35%, but it's clear that the trend is shifting towards online sources. Social media is also a major player, with 48% of Americans receiving breaking news from these platforms.

Moreover, there's a generational divide in news consumption habits. Millennials are more likely to get their news from social media and digital platforms, while older age groups still prefer TV and print media.

In terms of political affiliation, there are distinct differences in preferred news sources. Republicans tend to favor Fox News, while Democrats lean towards CNN and major network news.

These trends suggest that traditional news media is facing challenges in maintaining its audience share, but it still holds considerable influence, especially among older demographics.

I should also consider how the credibility and trust in different news sources vary among the public. From the earlier responses, there's a notable issue of mistrust in media, particularly with social media being seen as a less reliable source compared to traditional media.

Perhaps I should look into some studies or articles that discuss the trustworthiness of different news sources.

Simmons Research Releases News Media Trust Index
October 3, 2018
New Ranking Sheds Light on Consumers’ Trust of Various News Outlets
NEW YORK, October 3, 2018 -- Simmons Research, the leading source of essential consumer intelligence, today released its News Media Trust Index, a trustworthiness ranking of 38 of the largest and well-known new sources. Among its many findings, the News Media Trust Index found that the average percentage of respondents who rated news sources as trustworthy or very trustworthy was just 40%, a clear sign the news media is in crisis.
Topping the list across all news sources, and the only newspaper in the top five, was the Wall Street Journal with 57.7% of Americans trusting them. Also performing well were the major television network news organizations, with ABC (55.9%), CBS (55.4%), and NBC (54.1%) ranking as the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th most trusted sources. Forbes was the most trusted magazine and rounded out the top five, trusted by 54.2% of Americans.
Among cable news, the most trusted network in the US was ironically not American. BBC News was trusted by 55.2% of Americans and was the fourth most trusted news source. CNN was fourth behind BBC News, MSNBC (47.4%), and Bloomberg (46.3%). Fox News came in 17th place, with just 44.7% of Americans trusting them.
The least trusted news sources were all Internet-first and hyper-partisan in nature (both liberal and conservative) representing brands that have been consistently rated as misleading and inaccurate by fact-checkers. The six organizations trusted least were split evenly between far-left and far-right news sources, and on average were trusted by only about one in four Americans.
Thirteen percent of Americans found none of these news sources to be trustworthy.  This segment of consumers, identified by Simmons as “doubters” seem to think all news is fake news.  Interestingly, this group, while they were less likely to vote overall, voted heavily for Donald Trump (62.2% Trump v. 27.8% Clinton).

Here’s how much Americans trust 38 major news organizations (hint: not all that much!)
About 13 percent of Americans don’t trust any news outlet at all. (They went 2-to-1 for Trump in 2016.)

Surveys about “media trust” suffer from a definitional problem. “Do you trust the media?” is a meaningful question only if we know what “the media” is. Is it The New York Times and CNN? Fox News and Breitbart? Occupy Democrats and your uncle’s memes on Facebook?
In Gallup’s data on that question — which asks about “the mass media, such as newspapers, TV, and radio” — 72 percent of Americans trusted the media in 1976, post-Watergate. By 2016, that was down to 32 percent. But the media in 1976 was your local daily, Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor, and Harry Reasoner. “The media” is something fundamentally different now, and a decline in trust is a rational reaction to that, even in an environment less polarized than our own.
All this is to say that I find trust questions about specific news organizations a bit more useful, since you know with much greater confidence what the person being queried has in mind. And we have a new data set looking at just that, from Simmons Research.
Simmons surveyed 2,009 Americans in August asking them whether or not they trusted 38 different news organizations. Here are the results:
A few things pop out here. The bottom six — Breitbart, DailyKos, Palmer Report, Occupy Democrats, InfoWars, and in last place, Daily Caller — are all explicitly partisan sites without a pre-Internet legacy brand to fall back on. (Three liberal, three conservative.) I’d argue there are important distinctions to be made between them — InfoWars’ status as our nation’s leading lizard-people conspiracy den makes it stand out — but the average American seems to lump them together as untrustworthy.
At the top sits The Wall Street Journal, whose combination of respected news pages and conservative editorial pages seem to be a magic formula for generating trust across the ideological spectrum. (When Pew Research did a similar exercise in 2014, the Journal was the only publisher to be more trusted than untrusted in all ideological subgroups.) Then come the major networks, then the national newspapers, then wire services. A few surprises, to me: Forbes and The Washington Times ranking as highly as they did, and Mother Jones and Slate ranking as poorly as they did.
Fox News finished roughly in the middle, behind all the other cable and network news operations, but still with 44.7 percent saying they trust it. (In completely unrelated news, Donald Trump got 46.1 percent of the vote in 2016.) Fox finished tied with The Economist.
“The Doubters”
Simmons highlights one depressing finding: 13 percent of Americans said they found none of these news outlets trustworthy. Simmons terms this group “the Doubters.” (Passing up the equally applicable “the LOL Nothing Matters.”)
This group of info-nihilists is less likely to vote than the median American, but Simmons nonetheless estimates they made up about 6 million of the 129 million who cast votes in 2016. And they were much more likely to support Trump (62.2 percent) than Hillary Clinton (27.8 percent).
(This is my math, not Simmons’, but if those percentages are right, the Doubters netted out to contribute a 1.464 million vote margin for Trump. That’s about 1.13 percent of all votes cast. Trump won Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin by 0.22, 0.72, and 0.76 percent, respectively.)
Who are these Doubters? Simmons asked these questions in the context of a larger consumer survey, so they have some interesting detail. Doubters are:
Much less likely [than the average American] to be a Democrat, much more likely to not identify with any political party at all, but just as likely to be Republican as anyone else
More likely to have married at some point, but also more likely to be widowed/divorced
Much less likely to be well educated
Less affluent
Less likely to be politically knowledgeable
Less likely to spend their time on social media, and less likely to spend time online in general
Somewhat less likely to consume any media, including television, radio, newspapers, and magazines
What are the consumption behaviors that Doubters are particularly into? They’re significantly more likely to read Soap Opera Digest, FamilyFun, Seventeen, TV Guide, InStyle, and…Playboy. (The issue of trust in centerfolds goes unexplored in this study.) They watch We TV, TLC, and “Married at First Sight.” They drive Chevys, have cell service through MetroPCS, and eat at Bob Evans.
At the same time, though, “Doubters were very much like the rest of the country demographically, in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.”
Debates about media trust often end up debating a list of things news organizations could do in order to regain it. (Greater transparency! Events in the community! Solutions journalism! Um, blockchain!) But this data suggests that, at least for a small but significant share of the American public, the mistrust goes far, far deeper than a better corrections policy or hiring an ombudsman. It’s a deep-seated, core belief.

Trust in media hits new crisis low

Media trust hits new low

Trust in traditional media has declined to an all-time low, and many news professionals are determined to do something about it.
Why it matters: Faith in society's central institutions, especially in government and the media, is the glue that holds society together. That glue was visibly dissolving a decade ago, and has now, for many millions of Americans, disappeared entirely.
By the numbers: For the first time ever, fewer than half of all Americans have trust in traditional media, according to data from Edelman's annual trust barometer shared exclusively with Axios. Trust in social media has hit an all-time low of 27%.
56% of Americans agree with the statement that "Journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations."
58% think that "most news organizations are more concerned with supporting an ideology or political position than with informing the public."
When Edelman re-polled Americans after the election, the figures had deteriorated even further, with 57% of Democrats trusting the media and only 18% of Republicans.

The big picture: These numbers are echoed across the rest of the world: They're mostly not a function of Donald Trump's war on "fake news".
As vaccine rumor hunter Heidi Larson puts it, "we don’t have a misinformation problem, we have a trust problem.”
News organizations have historically relied mainly on advertising income, and as those dollars flow increasingly to Google and Facebook, that has created institutional weakness that shows up in trust data.
Reversing the decline is a monster task — and one that some journalists and news organizations have taken upon themselves. They're going to need help — perhaps from America's CEOs.
The catch: Mistrust of media is now a central part of many Americans' personal identity — an article of faith that they weren't argued into and can't be argued out of.
What they're saying:
Former Financial Times editor Lionel Barber talks of factual reporting as a means of "regaining the trust of the reading public".
Axios has a stated mission to "help restore trust in fact-based news".
Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan writes that "our goal should go beyond merely putting truthful information in front of the public. We should also do our best to make sure it’s widely accepted."
How it works: Media outlets can continue to report reliable facts, but that won't turn the trend around on its own. What's needed is for trusted institutions to visibly embrace the news media.
CEOs (a/k/a the fourth branch of government) are at or near the top of Edelman's list of trusted institutions.
By the numbers: 61% of Trump voters say that they trust their employer's CEO. That compares to just 28% who trust government leaders, and a mere 21% who trust journalists.
The bottom line: CEOs have long put themselves forward as the people able to upgrade America's physical infrastructure. Now it's time for them to use the trust they've built up to help rebuild our civic infrastructure.

Big Tech is outsourcing its hardest content moderation decisions
Illustration: Aïda Amer/Axios
Faced with the increasingly daunting task of consistent content moderation at scale, Big Tech companies are tossing their hardest decisions to outsiders, hoping to deflect some of the pressure they face for how they govern their platforms.
Why it matters: Every policy change, enforcement action or lack thereof prompts accusations that platforms like Facebook and Twitter are making politically motivated decisions to either be too lax or too harsh. Ceding responsibility to others outside the company may be the future of content moderation if it works.

Ev Williams, a co-founder of Twitter and its former CEO, said on Tuesday night that he's "excited to see what happens" with Elon Musk at the helm.
Yes, but: He also cautioned  that he has "respect for the people who have been shepherding" the company, "especially on the trust and safety side."
Why it matters: These comments, made during a Fortune Magazine dinner in San Francisco, are Williams' first since Musk first offered to buy Twitter two weeks ago.

Data on trust in various news media organizations in the United States revealed that as of February 2022, One America News Network was the least trusted news outlet, with 47 percent of respondents admitting that they had little or no trust in the accuracy of the news and information they read there. ABC was considered the most trustworthy organization with 61 percent having a lot or some trust in the network, and CBS and NBC fared similarly in this regard.

From these search results, it's clear that trust in news media is a significant issue, with varying levels of trust depending on the source and the political affiliation of the audience. Traditional media, particularly network news and newspapers, still hold a certain level of trust, but social media is generally viewed with skepticism.

I should also consider the role of fact-checking and the impact of misinformation on public trust. Perhaps I can look into how traditional media handle fact-checking compared to social media.

Fact Checking is Important, and Here’s Why
Author: Anita Sthankiya
Have you ever wondered how facts turn into fiction, and then turn into viral stories? It’s almost bewildering how something completely off topic can become a “fact” for something unrelated, but it happens more often than you might think. Welcome to the world of alternative facts: a new world where hoaxes often spread at lightning speed on social media, spark angry backlashes and prompt readers to take content at face value.
The focus of fake news is often thought of as being created by the mainstream media, but social media is also a predominant aggregator of fake news, as this article will point out. For example, somewhere along the line it became common practice to share memes on social media, with a significant percentage of readers presuming the content to be fact, rather than fake or satirical. In fact, a recent study by Eschelon Insights and Hart Research found that adults ages 18 to 49 trust news and political information shared from friends more than news delivered from other sources.
More pointedly, think about your experiences with Facebook. Every time we login to our accounts, we’re often bombarded with information, making it difficult to sort through content and find facts. For instance, consider this “infographic” that made its rounds on social media in October 2017.

Regarding the poster above, citizen Carole De Lorenzi asked Canadian news organization, Global News, whether or not the information was true. The media outlet quickly debunked the picture in a news article, but unfortunately, the damage from the post had already been done. According to the executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, the highest ranked page on the group’s website is one that debunks the refugee-pensioner myth. Shares like this one are not only extremely damaging to the reputation of organizations, such as the Canadian Council for Refugees, but they are also hugely detrimental to the overall productivity of said organization, as resources are sequentially dedicated to debunking myths instead of addressing pressing issues.
This meme was shared thousands of times, according to the Canadian Council for Refugees, and blatantly included fake information. On the other hand, sometimes viral images are completely taken out of context, primarily as a means of inciting hate towards marginalized groups.
The ongoing debate around the refugee crisis is a perfect example of the above mentioned scenario playing out in practice, as several right-wing groups have been cited as using photos and memes to demonise fleeing refugees.
In 2015, online news media outlet, Independent.co.uk, debunked several viral photos on social media that were claiming to show refugees as rioting militants that were inciting hate.
Photo Credit: presstv.com
In fact, a widely shared photo that claimed refugees attacked police with an ISIS flag made the rounds on social media and was shared tens of thousands of times. The photo turned out to be a copyrighted image from www.presstv.com, and was actually shot from a protest in Germany in 2012. It had absolutely nothing to do with refugees. The Muslims in the picture were part of a counter-protest at an anti-Islam rally in Bonn.
While the photo was three-years-old and not related to the refugee crisis in Europe at the time, it was stolen and passed off with malicious intent.
You may also remember seeing a meme circulating that claimed refugees are not victims, but rather bodybuilders who are planning to invade British towns.

The photo was taken out of context, and a reverse image search shows that it was taken in 2013 by a photographer on Christmas Island off the coast of Australia. The men in the photos are even wearing blue Australian Customs and Border Protection uniforms.
When memes and information are shared in this way, it can be difficult to discern what is fact and what is fiction.
The first set of hard data on fake-news consumption has been released, as researchers published an analysis of the browsing histories of thousands of adults ahead of the US 2016 election. It offers a real-time picture of who viewed which fake stories, and what real stories those same people were seeing at the same time.
The study, conducted by Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth College, Andrew Guess of Princeton University, and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter, analyzed web traffic from 2,525 Americans who consented to having their online activity monitored anonymously, and the research discovered that one in four Americans read at least one false news story.
The team defined a visited website as fake news if it posted at least two demonstrably false stories. While participants read only a small fraction of fake stories, it still amounted to one false story per week.
Of course, there is no way to determine from this data how much was believed by these people, or whether they did believe the information at all. What is important is to recognize that such stories reached people whether they were knowledgeable of it or not.
The study also found that Facebook was the the highest ranking platform directing people to a fake news site, and that those individuals 60 years old and older were more likely to visit a fake news site than younger people.
As more and more false information lands in front of us, it is becoming more difficult to identify something as inaccurate, especially if it has been shared tens of thousands of times.
A survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre found 64 percent of American adults said made-up news stories were causing confusion about basic facts on current issues and events. In the past, poorly photoshopped images were the go-to source for spreading misinformation, and it was relatively easy to spot a fake image. But things have changed and the sheer number of fake memes and posts makes it virtually impossible to fact check each one, especially when high resolution photos are being misused and widely shared.
There are plenty of sites available working to bust fake news including www.snopes.com.
But, if the counter information isn’t shared in the same manner of the viral post, the damage from the false post cannot be counteracted. Facebook and Twitter have initiated algorithm changes, policies, and new systems to catch these fake posts, but it isn’t a perfect system.
If a source cannot be found, it is next to impossible to hold someone responsible for misinformation.
What can be even more challenging is finding the original source of the fake news or meme once it goes viral. If a source cannot be found, it is next to impossible to hold someone responsible for misinforming people. Those people whose photos are stolen for the purpose of disseminating fake news have no way to take control of their intellectual property and stop the viral image from being shared.
Ultimately, it is up to users to spend the time to fact check information that is presented to them and to use discretion before sharing something that could be inaccurate.

The Dangers of Social Media News: Why Fact-Checking Is Important – The Register Forum
The Dangers of Social Media News: Why Fact-Checking Is Important

The word “news” has seemingly evolved over just the short span of our lifetime. What was once the near-sole purview of institutions such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, journalism has now become host to a litany of internet news companies and independent reporters. However, even that does not tell the whole story, for our generation, especially now, gets much of its news from non-traditional sources on social media. With no fact-checkers or competing opinions, a Tweet or Facebook post is increasingly seen as gospel. Don’t get me wrong, the diversification of Americans’ news consumption is positive in many ways. These new platforms give more Americans the ability to exercise their constitutional rights to free speech and a free press. However, we must be extremely wary of the outsized influence that unproven and uncorroborated social media claims can have in today’s digital world.
According to the Pew Research Center, 68% of American adults get news from social media, and that number is likely much higher for young people in particular. In 2018, social media news actually outpaced print newspapers for the percent of Americans who used it often to access journalism. Unlike traditional forms of journalism, social media posts are not fact-checked. There is no editorial staff reviewing the veracity of claims made on Facebook or Twitter that may garner millions of likes and shares. Similarly, there is rarely any follow-up if a post’s claims are proven to be false. The people who have already seen the post with inaccurate information continue to operate under the belief that it was true, and large groups end up wildly misinformed. According to Pew, 57% of Americans think social media news is “largely inaccurate.” Despite this, most Americans still regularly use it for news. In an interview with Quartz, Paul Barret, the Deputy Director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, described the tendency to “get news from social media sites, even as large percentages of Pew respondents say they’re wary about whether that news is biased or sensationalized” as a “recipe for voter cynicism and intensified political polarization.”
Sadly, our own president is a great example of this. President Trump has made thousands of blatantly false statements to his massive Twitter audience, such as making wildly inaccurate claims about the path of a hurricane and lying about the number of new jobs created under his presidency. While these claims are widely reported as false by many news outlets, there are so many of them that it is impossible to address them all, and millions of Americans believe what he says.
“
We must be extremely wary of the outsized influence that unproven and uncorroborated social media claims can have in today’s digital world.”
Another example is Shaun King who, in addition to many similar cases, falsely accused a Texas State Trooper in 2018 of raping a woman. Police dashcam video completely disproved this claim, but not before the trooper received countless death threats and was the subject of a social media smear campaign. King, unlike attorney Lee Merrit who was also involved, never apologized or made any attempt to correct the record, he simply deleted the Tweets about it. After seven-year-old Jazmine Barnes was killed in a drive-by shooting in Houston, King plastered the face of Robert Paul Cantrell across social media baselessly describing the man as a racist and accusing him of murdering Barnes. As it turned out Cantrell had absolutely no connection to the horrific crime, which another man was arrested for, but still recieved numerous threats to himself and his family, eventually leading him to committing suicide.
Those are just a few examples of what has become so disturbingly common. False narratives online are very easy to make believable, and can have a significant effect on people’s perceptions of the world and of certain groups or institutions. The issue is not just of inaccurate reporting, but also of selective reporting, choosing to publish certain stories in order to forward a single narrative. This is a problem throughout the media, but especially so on social networks where there are no editors and little accountability.
Social media “reporting” is not going away any time soon. With 243.6 million social media users in the US, it is unlikely that that many people will change their news habits. What can be done however, is to educate people on the shortfalls and regular inaccuracies of social media coverage of current events. In light of the campaign of voter influence that was (allegedly) undertaken by the Russian government in the leadup to the 2016 presidential election, in addition to the everyday false claims and selective reporting, we must be discerning about what we believe on social media. As psychologist Jean Kim writes in an article for Psychology Today, “The key is to proceed with caution; everything we read and respond to, designed to tug at our instant emotions and instincts, needs to be viewed with a skeptical eye.” We can never rely on just one perspective and can never take a single news report as incontrovertible truth. The reality of any issue has many dimensions, which is rarely on display in a Facebook post or Tweet. So, continue scrolling down your timeline and reading Tweets, but always think about the motivations of those posting, and keep in mind how easy it is to be misled.

Media Relations Social Media
In the past, traditional forms of media were the only ways you could get your message out to the public. But in today’s digital landscape, there are a variety of new methods for reaching a mass (or niche) audience.
It begs the question, traditional media vs. social media. How do you decide which works best? Or do you need to decide at all?
Well, before you start waxing philosophical, let’s figure out what we’re really examining in the first place.
What is traditional media?
Traditional media refers to forms of mass media that focus on delivering news to the general public or a targeted group of the public.
Traditional forms of media include print publications (newspapers and magazines), broadcast news (television and radio) and, in recent years, the digital version of those media outlets, such as digital newspapers and blogs.
What is social media?
The term “social media” is used a lot these days to describe a variety of different digital platforms.
For the purpose of this piece, social media refers to social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.
The differences between traditional media and social media
Where traditional media generally offers a wider audience pool, social media allows for more targeted distribution
If you’re pitching correctly, your earned media hits should be reaching a more narrow target audience. However, even the best of pitches distributed to the best of media outlets are still going to hit a broader audience than you originally set out to target.
After all, that’s half the reason why traditional forms of media were so coveted in the past. If your story aired on the 6 o’clock news, you knew your impression count was going to be through the roof.
Social media on the other hand, gives PR pros the opportunity to really target their messages, selecting everything from the demographics and geography of an audience to the time of day the post will go live.
Social media is immediate, while traditional can be delayed due to press times
Every PR pro has been there: you pitched a story in mid-September that doesn’t result in a finished piece until the following March. It happens.
Traditional media tends to have a longer timeline than social media. Not only can press times slow you down, pieces for traditional media tend to take longer to put together (think of all those hours drafting and distributing a pitch, connecting reporters with sources and providing useful imagery).
Social media posts are generally shorter, usually meaning they take less time to put together, and can be published immediately.
Traditional media pieces are more final, where social media is dynamic
For the most part, once a story is published on a traditional form of media, it’s final.
If you’re lucky, the reporter you worked with on a story may be willing to make changes after the fact to an online piece, but if your story hit newsstands or went live on television or radio, chances are it’s too late.
Because social media is a form of owned media, you have the control to make updates whenever you need to.
PR pros have the freedom to issue retractions, edit posts after they’re pushed live or even delete messages entirely. And since social media happens immediately, there is absolutely no delay between the time a change is needed and when it reaches audiences.
Social media offers more control over the message than traditional media
Similar to the above, where the PR pro controls the publication date and time of a social media post, social also offers greater control over the message.
Although you can’t control how the public will respond once the message is out there, you do have the opportunity to control what is said in the first place.
Social media is a two-way conversation, and traditional is one-way
The typical flow of a traditional piece looks a lot like this: the PR pro pitches the story, the reporter publishes the story and the public reads the story.
The cycle ends there, until it begins again.
With social media, the public has the opportunity to voice their opinions, and boy do they!
Read our pointers for dealing with a social media crisis.
Not only does the public expect to be heard when they share their opinions on a story or current event, they also expect the brand to respond. PR pros using social media in their day-to-day should be prepared to act fast and respond appropriately.
The best of both worlds
The media industry is rapidly changing, and PR must keep up to survive.
However, that doesn’t mean all of the old ways are obsolete.
As you can probably see from the above comparison, traditional media and social media both have their pros and cons.
Depending on the situation, the goal or the strategy, one method may work better than another for your brand.
Instead of thinking as traditional vs. social in the sense that one is slowly replacing the other, think instead of how the two tactics can work together to help you achieve your overall goals.
One important thing to remember whether incorporating traditional or social media (or both!)  into your scope of work is that your strategy needs to change depending on the medium.
Traditional media public relations tactics are going to be very different from the tactics you take on social media.

Social Media vs. Traditional Journalism
Is social media replacing traditional journalism or do they work well together?
Social media, as you can imagine, has monumentally changed the world of journalism, in ways that no one could have comprehended before its colossal rise.
Social media users often report on news via their pages before the story has even been assigned to a journalist, and this alone has completely altered the concept of breaking news.
Journalists don’t even decide what the biggest story of the day is anymore, rather, society does, and the news that goes viral is often produced by social media users themselves.
These days, people want real-time information, which is why so many of us turn to social media sites such as Twitter to stay up-to-date with the news. It was even found that two-thirds of U.S. adults get news from social media, demonstrating just how popular it is as a media outlet.
This then poses as a threat to journalists. If they have gathered a news story second-hand from social media, which is often the case, and they find a new angle that isn’t yet out there but sit on it for too long, they risk having the new angle reported on first by other competitors, or worse, social media users (dun dun dunnnn)!
Social media could therefore be seen as the rawest form of journalism — it provides eyewitness and first-hand accounts and is the fastest channel for breaking news.
The news of the death of Michael Jackson in 2009 broke on social media before any major news networks. TMZ.com, the American entertainment website, released the story first, before the mass of tweets about it forced Twitter to temporarily shut down. This was two hours before it was confirmed by the LA Times and Associated Press.

“We saw an instant doubling of tweets per second the moment the story broke.” — Biz Stone, Twitter co-founder.
I remember this day; I was rehearsing for a dance competition at home in Guernsey, Channel Islands, when one of my team mates who was watching at the time stood up to announce that Michael Jackson had just passed away. She found the news on Twitter, not from a major media outlet. This is how powerful social media is as a tool for news reporting.
So could social media be replacing traditional journalism?
While some do believe that social media is a true form of journalism and could potentially be the future of it, others (including me) believe that social media and traditional journalism can work together in acting as message diffusing systems. By this I mean journalists can provide the news stories that social media is able to spread far and wide, or vice versa. In this sense, social media accentuates and compliments journalism, rather than replacing it.
In ways, social media has introduced a new layer to the world of journalism; interaction and communication with audiences, which journalists can seriously benefit from.
Some other advantages of this new dimension for journalists are that they are able to partake in wider newsgathering, reach out to sources directly, build personal relationships and increase engagement with audiences, just to name a few.
“New technology enables normal people to do reporting. But new technology also improves the monitoring quality of journalism as well.” — Sarah Hartley, the Guardian
So, I don’t believe that journalism is dying in the current world of social media. I do believe however, that social media in one way or another technically is a form of journalism, because it’s a channel that allows people to report on news. But, it is not replacing traditional journalism as such because more so, it can be used to enhance it, and the two can work together in informing the world effectively.

Social vs. Traditional Media
Hans Peter Ibold and John Adams debate the unique advantages of different forms of media, each author championing one side of the traditional media versus new media argument. Ibold, a journalism professor, is optimistic about the future of social media and argues that social media will eventually surpass traditional media in effectiveness and popularity. Social media provides an interactive platform for widespread discussion, and news postings can occur almost instantly. On the other side, Adams favors traditional media. He wants to be able to hold a newspaper in his hand. He argues that traditional media is more reliable, explaining that newspaper journalists are more experienced and undergo more editing processes than their new-media counterparts, which results in more accurate reporting.

New Media, Old Media
Is it fair to compare new media and old media, two sources that differ in their focus? This study looks at the level of attention given to technology, foreign events and politics via traditional media and three social media platforms, Twitter, YouTube and blogs. Traditional media sources do not concentrate their stories in one area; they spread their coverage relatively equally. Furthermore, traditional media and new media rarely share the same top story. In this 49-week study, blogs and traditional media sources shared the same lead story for only 13 of those weeks, less than a third of the study’s duration. This article argues that although new media and old media do not always cover the same material and are generally incomparable, they do depend on one another.

Watching the Watchdog: Notes from the Future of Journalism
In a Canadian university, a class of journalism students was asked to respond to a chapter in Tim Knight’s book, Storytelling and the Anima Factor. After sifting through the responses, Tim Knight included sixteen of them in this article to show the different beliefs among today’s youth, which is the generation that is most affected by the growth of social media. Some students favored new media and others traditional, and each supports his or her statement with unique arguments and perspectives. The reader can clearly see both sides of the argument and decide for him or herself which side they support.
