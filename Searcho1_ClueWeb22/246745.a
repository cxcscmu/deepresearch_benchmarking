So I've been thinking about this question: "Why should Black History be taught in school?" It seems like an important topic, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach it. I mean, I know that Black History Month exists, and there are some figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks that we learn about, but I feel like there's more to it than that.

First off, I think it's important to understand what Black History is. From what I know, Black History focuses on the experiences, contributions, and struggles of people of African descent around the world. It's not just about slavery and civil rights movements, although those are certainly significant parts of the story. There's also a rich history of achievements in science, arts, culture, and more.

I remember in school, we did cover some aspects of Black History, especially during Black History Month, which is in February in the U.S. We watched movies, read poems, and learned about famous black leaders. But I often felt like it was treated as a separate entity, almost like an add-on to the regular curriculum rather than an integral part of it.

I think that's one of the problems. Black History shouldn't be confined to just one month; it should be integrated into the overall curriculum throughout the year. That way, students can see the continuous thread of black contributions and experiences woven into the fabric of American and global history.

Moreover, teaching Black History in schools can help combat stereotypes and promote understanding among different racial groups. By learning about the diverse experiences and achievements of black people, students can develop a more nuanced and accurate view of history, which can foster empathy and respect.

Also, it's crucial for black students to see their history and heritage reflected in the curriculum. It can boost their self-esteem and sense of belonging, knowing that their ancestors have made significant contributions to society. It's not just about celebrating diversity; it's about recognizing the fundamental role that black people have played in shaping the world we live in today.

Furthermore, studying Black History can provide valuable lessons in social justice and activism. The civil rights movement, for example, is a powerful case study in nonviolent protest and the power of grassroots organizing. These are important concepts for young people to understand as they develop their own civic engagement skills.

I also think that teaching Black History can help address some of the systemic inequalities that still exist in our society. By acknowledging the past injustices and ongoing challenges faced by the black community, we can work towards creating a more equitable future.

But I'm not entirely sure if I'm covering all the angles here. Maybe I should look up some expert opinions or research on the subject to get a broader perspective.

Let me try searching for some information.

Teaching Black History in Culturally Responsive Ways
Black history is American history, and it should be taught throughout the year across the curriculum—not confined to a single month.
By Rann Miller
February 7, 2020
As Black History Month kicked off, I was reflecting on my time as a student. My experience all those years ago was similar to that of most Black children today: mostly White teachers teaching Black history primarily in February.
I was told of Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass. I heard very little of Malcolm X, the FBI’s campaign against civil rights leaders, the Rainbow Coalition put together by the Black Panther Party’s Fred Hampton, or Hampton’s assassination. I learned about the struggles of my enslaved ancestors, but not about Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, or Nat Turner.
I was taught about the marches and firehoses in Alabama, but I had to teach myself about the acts of terrorism committed against Black people in Rosewood, Florida; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Wilmington, North Carolina.
Today, teachers continue that tradition, telling students about Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé, and LeBron James, as well as King, Tubman, Douglass, and other inspirational figures. These folks are to be honored for their accomplishments—but we should not ignore lessons that explore the impact of racism in the Black experience. It’s imperative that teachers not reinforce a milquetoast version of Black history that is anti-Black because of its erasure of painful truths.
No matter what subject you teach, there are ways you can infuse Black history into your daily lessons in a way that is prophetic and purposeful.
Keep Up With Education Research
We read the major academic journals and case studies so you don’t have to. Sign up for The Research Is In, and we’ll send you the key takeaways once a month.
I want that
Black History Is American History
Infuse Black history into the curriculum year-round: Tom Joyner, the recently retired syndicated radio host, used the phrase “Black history 365 days a year” to mean that Black history isn’t a gimmick meant for one month out of the year, with a student assembly or a potluck dinner with traditional Black foods. Black history is American history. Students should learn throughout the year and throughout all disciplines about the accomplishments, experiences, and perspectives of Black people.
How can teachers infuse Black history into their teaching? Here are some simple examples for core content areas:
English: Provide students with texts—poetry and fiction, and nonfiction as well—written by Black people. Teach students about the Africanisms in American English when discussing or teaching grammar.
Mathematics and science: Refer students to famous Black scientists and mathematicians throughout your course. Discuss how Black people showed an understanding of agricultural science in how they used soil in both West Africa and South Carolina to grow rice. Also, you can study the mathematical patterns of African art, and reference the rich history of math in sub-Saharan Africa in the areas of geometry, graphs, and numerical systems—you can engage students by playing African games like mancala that have a strong math component.
Social studies: Incorporate primary and secondary source documents by or about Black people into student reading lists. Create an assignment in which students interview Black history scholars to discuss the Black experience in America throughout a social studies course.
Use texts by Black authors, in every discipline: In history class, I learned from textbooks written by White scholars. I read the works of Mark Twain, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare in English class, but never Langston Hughes, Maya Angelou, or Toni Morrison. According to a recent report, more than eight of every 10 books that New York City students are likely to see in class from preschool to eighth grade are written by White authors. Students should be introduced to texts by Black authors that speak to Black experiences, Black perspectives, and Black accomplishments. These authors remind children and adults that Black excellence is not confined to athletics and entertainment. How can we promote the academic excellence of Black children without introducing them to Black intellectuals—individuals they can see themselves someday becoming?
Teach students about important Black figures—especially local ones: Teaching about Obama and King is a good start, but you can introduce students to hidden figures as you work through your content during the school year.
If you’re a middle school science teacher and your students are interested in cultivating a community food garden, teach them about scientists like George Washington Carver, who developed methods to prevent soil depletion. If you’re an elementary teacher teaching students how to tell time, introduce them to Benjamin Banneker, who created the first American clock. Teaching students about important people is a great thing—even better is doing it in the context of your lessons, rather than in a set-aside month.
And if you teach students about the history of slavery in America, remember to include two topics in particular: the economics of slavery, and acts of resistance and rebellion by Black people. The enslavement of Africans built this nation’s economic foundation, and the entire nation benefited, so resistance and rebellion were met with brute force. Nevertheless, enslaved Africans and their enslaved descendants resisted through sabotage, running away, and outright rebellion and revolt— hundreds of revolts happened during African enslavement. Communities of formerly enslaved Black people along the East Coast fought to maintain their freedom and to free other enslaved people.
One task of teachers in the classroom is to acknowledge and honor students’ humanity—and that means acknowledging and honoring Black humanity. That starts with acknowledging the good, the bad, and the ugly of our history as a nation.

Why It's Important to Teach Black History
Why It's So Important to Teach Black History Now More Than Ever
February 13, 2017 by Alex Rappaport
On Feb. 1, 2017, at an event to kick off and commemorate Black History Month, Donald Trump described Frederick Douglass as "somebody who's done an amazing job." Putting aside the bizarre verb tense, this is the type of compliment you might casually pay to a salesperson who had a great quarter. It's a pretty detached way to pay tribute to a former slave and renowned orator who worked to abolish slavery and fought for the rights of marginalized people throughout his life. It's clear that Trump has, at best, a surface-level understanding of who Frederick Douglass was.
Unfortunately, Donald Trump is not alone. Many Americans, particularly white Americans, have a cursory understanding of black history. This is problematic in a society that has struggled since its birth with racial injustice and discrimination. But it's especially troubling now, at a time when racial tension and racist rhetoric simmer in news headlines and political discourse. Today's students are living in a society where race is front and center, and they will have a hard time processing the issues of the present if they aren't well grounded in the issues of the past. The good news is that educators and parents have an opportunity to rectify this, and now's the time to do it.
Black history laid the foundation for much of American history and, in fact, there would be no America if not for the contributions of African Americans. Yet the study of black history has generally centered on a handful of prominent figures. For example, you've surely learned about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, but have you ever heard of Katherine Johnson, the NASA mathematician who helped put John Glenn into orbit? Despite relentless workplace discrimination, she persevered and was pivotal to the US space program. She's now the subject of a book and major movie called Hidden Figures, but imagine how many young people this story could have inspired over the last 50 years. Why do we tolerate such exclusions?
The uncomfortable truth is that a great deal of black history represents white America at its worst, and some educators have a hard time teaching it.
The uncomfortable truth is that a great deal of black history represents white America at its worst, and some educators have understandably had a hard time teaching it. As a result, what is taught often takes the form of a sanitized and scrubbed version of history. In 2015, reports showed that a major geography textbook published by McGraw-Hill Education and adopted by the Texas Board of Education referred to slaves as "workers" in a chapter on global immigration. The book was ultimately corrected, but teaching false narratives such as these greatly diminishes the oppression and marginalization of African Americans and grossly distorts American history as a whole.
In a time when it has become increasingly difficult to tell fact from fiction, the antidote may be to take a long, hard look at history. A distorted or incomplete view of slavery and its ongoing legacy of systemic discrimination makes it impossible for students to understand the black experience in America today. To the contrary, a clear and honest understanding of the past gives us a lens to examine the present and anticipate the future. As the quote widely attributed to Mark Twain goes, history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. How can we understand Trayvon Martin if we don't study Emmett Till?
We are entering an era when marginalized groups are dealing with increasingly hostile discourse and complex legal battles, and studying black history helps us contextualize and process these issues. It's important to understand that some of the worst forms of racial violence and discrimination against black people were legal during slavery and Jim Crow. Just because something is legal doesn't make it just, and a deeper look at history may help students think critically about the laws and policies of their own time. The ongoing civil rights struggles of women, the LGBTQ community, and immigrants are likely going to intensify under the Trump administration. In the spirit of hope and perseverance, black history teaches us that hard-fought progress is possible for historically oppressed groups, and this can be seen in major civil rights victories like the Voting Rights Act.
Dr. Shaun Harper, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of an upcoming book on race on college campuses, has said that all white college students should take a course on race. I agree, but I would argue that students should start learning about race and the history of racial inequality at a much younger age. While some of the history is difficult, it is possible to find age-appropriate learning tools for students as young as kindergarten. It's also getting easier to find resources that go beyond what is widely taught. PBS has put together a list of little-known facts about black history. Flocabulary, a web-based learning program that I cofounded, recently published a free collection of music videos covering major figures, themes, and events in black culture. And while Black History Month is an important time to teach and celebrate this content, it can and should be part of the standard curriculum all year long.
We have a president who will not highlight the contributions of historically marginalized people, during Black History Month or otherwise, and he is likely to perpetuate widely accepted distortions of the past. In an era of "alternative facts," it's imperative that we educate our children to be thoughtful, informed citizens. Facing our past, both the good and the bad, will help us make better decisions for our future.

How the US Can Work to Improve How Black History Is Taught in Schools

The US still does a wretched job of teaching Black history. An expert in African American history education explains how to fix it.

In American schools where Black history is taught, students often learn about historical figures including Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr, and Harriet Tubman. But studies have shown that Black history education is often inadequate, superficial, and misinterpreted.

The US doesn't have federal requirements for teaching Black history in school curriculums, and only a handful of states have mandated it.
LaGarrett King, an African American History education expert and director of the Carter Center for K-12 Black History Education at the University of Missouri, told Insider about a few different ways educators can work to fix that.
Existing curriculums, King said, lack Black perspectives and sanitize versions of Black history.
In order to help solve the problem, teachers could attend professional development trainings, work to promote Black perspectives, and develop curriculums that explore multiple themes within Black history, King advised.

As protests against racism and police brutality sweep the nation, US schools are still behind in teaching Black history to students.
To date, there are no federal requirements for teaching Black history in the US, and only a handful of states have mandated curriculums to ensure that teachers discuss any Black history subjects.
Even then, a lack of oversight makes it difficult to determine if teachers are truly following curriculum guidelines.
A 2015 study conducted by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and Oberg Research found that, on average, only 8% or 9% of history class time is devoted to Black history, and some states neglect the subject altogether.
In states where Black history is discussed, students often learn about seminal figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, and Rosa Parks, but frequently receive failing grades when tested on the Civil Rights movement.
History textbooks also vary drastically from state to state, with some offering up sanitized versions of Black history than others. In some cases, textbooks refer to slaves as merely "workers," while others fail to address Civil Rights, white supremacy, and oppression altogether.
This isn't a new problem. Carter G. Woodson, known as "the father of Black history ," created the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History to promote the study of Black history way back in 1915. But there's still a lot of work to do.
LaGarrett King, an African American History education professor at the University of Missouri, has researched the issue extensively. He's developed the Carter Center for K-12 Black History Education to promote Black history research, the education of teachers, and networks to help solve the problem.
Here's what King sees is wrong with African American history education in the US, and how he thinks we can fix it.
This isn't a new problem

The most recent wave of activism within the Black Lives Matter movement has brought to light issues of police brutality, systemic racism, and a lack of Black history education. But none of these are new concepts, and Black Americans have been fighting for change for hundreds of years.
"Historically, whenever there has been some form of social upheaval, civil rights, or civil disobedience as it pertains to Black people, there has always been a call for more Black history," King told Insider. "For some strange reason, we still cannot get it done."
Woodson's development and promotion of Negro History week — conceived and announced in 1925, and which we now know as Black history month — came in reaction to a mass lynching movement of Black Americans throughout the late 19th to early 20th centuries, King explained.
"He basically said 'there would be no lynching if lynching didn't start in the classroom,'" King said.
During the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, an explosion of Black history interest led to the development of Black history courses around the country. During that time, California become one of the first states to implement Black history education into law.

Following that decision, seven other states "passed laws requiring or recommending that the contributions and achievements of minority groups be included in school curricula," according to a special report analyzing the status of Black history in US schools and society that King wrote in 2017.
But today, only 12 states formally recognize the importance of teaching Black history in state law.
In his 2017 report, King found that only seven of those states have Black history oversight committees. Without an oversight committee, there isn't much accountability for teachers actually addressing the subject in the classroom, he said.
In a CBS News analysis, reporters found that seven states don't even mention slavery directly in their state standards, while eight states do not mention the Civil Rights movement at all. Furthermore, the study found that only two states specifically address white supremacy, and 16 states list "states' rights" as a cause of the Civil War.
All of these issues culminate in a lack of a thoughtful, holistic, and effective understanding of Black history throughout the country. And, according to King, much of that begins at the teacher level.
Teachers often lack the content knowledge to effectively teach Black history

Part of the direction of the Carter Center is to provide education for teachers who may not be equipped with the content knowledge needed to effectively teach Black history, King said.
"Teachers overwhelmingly are the most important people in teaching Black history, because the curriculum can say anything, but the teachers are the curriculum gatekeepers," King said. "They're the ones that figure out the connections throughout history, and they're the ones that create activities and instructional aspects for students to attend to."
According to a 2015 study conducted by the National Museum of African American History and Culture and Oberg Research, a majority of teachers "considered Black history as influential in understanding the complexity of US history," yet the level of class time dedication was far too low. On average, the study found that only one or two history lessons are devoted to the subject, if at all.
King said teachers — a majority of whom are white — often lack the knowledge necessary to teach Black history properly.
"While a lot of them would like to teach more Black history — and I do believe that the majority of teachers want to be inclusive — the problem is that a lot of them do not have the content knowledge to teach Black history in a way that is really effective," he said
Part of that is due to a lack of mandated Black and ethnic studies courses in teacher education, King said. Often, curriculums present a "Eurocentric" view of history in which ethnic and Black perspectives are left behind.
Part of the mission at the Carter Center is to provide workshops on Black history education for teachers around the world. Last year, King led a seminar for 300 teachers on the topic of slavery. And this year, the seminar will focus on examining Black history from a female perspective.
King also addressed the importance of white teachers acknowledging identity and privilege within the classroom, and viewing students as citizens who will one day hold their own positions of power.
"Talk about notions of white identity and privilege within those spaces, and help them understand that this is not something that is supposed to just give you grief or guilt," he said. "It's something to really understand humanity and how our society works, and to create a better society."
In order to teach Black history, instructors must work to promote Black perspectives

Another essential part in improving the education system is to understand what Black history really is, explained King.
"A lot of people don't understand what Black history is, or they don't have a theoretical model of what Black history is," he said. "Many people would just say Black history is just history with Black people. Sometimes I like to call that 'white history in blackface."'
American classrooms also tend to introduce Black people for the first time through slavery, omitting thousands of years of African history, and contextualizing Black American origins with oppression and violence, which can have a dehumanizing effect, King said.
Black and white people have not experienced history in the same way. To simply discuss Black history in the context of white history can provide a dangerous narrative, King said. Just look at Independence Day.
"July 4, 1776, means nothing to Black people historically," he said. "The majority of Black people were still enslaved, so when we say Independence Day is July 4th, 1776, and we teach that in our curriculum, what are we saying about Black people and other non-white people that were not necessarily free during that particular time?"
Rather than recognizing the Fourth of July as Independence Day, many Black communities have long celebrated Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating the ending of slavery, as their day of freedom.

Juneteenth gained more significant attention this year in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, but the holiday has historically been overlooked in American classrooms.
Similarly, King discussed the idea of implementing Black perspectives into the classroom through the teaching of the Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education.
While most American students understand the case be a seminal decision in the advancement of civil rights, King noted the decision had some negative repercussions on Black schools and teachers that have been seldom discussed.
"What happened was, white people defined inclusion and integration as Black people integrating into white schools. They didn't integrate into Black schools, so therefore Black teachers and administrators lost their jobs," he said.
It's a microcosm about how even the Civil Rights movement has been taught within the framework of the country's white majority, and not always how it's affected the Black minority. Learning only the good things about Brown v. Board of Education feeds the narrative that Black schools were underdeveloped and Black students could only receive a good education by attending white schools, King said.
There is no perfect way to teach Black history, but educators need to approach it with an open mind

Black history is a massive subject, and not all educators agree on exactly how it should be taught. Before teachers begin to form lesson plans, King suggests educators first recognize they need to learn what Black history is, and then work to implement Black perspectives into the wider teaching of American history.
King explained that its important to balance the difficult reality of white supremacy, slavery, and systemic oppression with Black agency and the way that Black Americans have continuously fought for their rights and persevered.
Similarly, King said learning about Black joy and love, and the ability for Black communities to stand together is an important way to focus on humanity within Black history.
"Black joy just raises the human side of Black people. Because sometimes in our curriculum we always focus on suffering, and we don't focus on Black people being human," he said.

One way to ensure Black history is being implemented into schools in a thoughtful manner is through discussions between administrators, community educators, parents, and university personnel, King suggested.
"All of these different people need to come together and design a plan," he said. "I believe those are the things that we need to do initially, to get us there. And then after that, we need to help educate our teachers through professional development."
The Black Lives Matter movement has increased interest in Black history, but sustained momentum is key
In many ways, widespread Black Lives Matter protests and the recent increase in social media exposure has created an environment where people "no longer have an excuse" to not educate themselves on Black history, King said.
"The beautiful thing about social media is that it has connected us with people all over the world. It gives people the opportunity to learn things that they may not have learned," he said.
"The great majority of people stop learning history in high school, and having a social media presence for people to share Black history websites and teaching Black history through threads on Twitter and sharing through Facebook and Instagram are very positive ways to help people understand history, and begin the knowledge process."

But that being said, the US has still a long way to go to implement Black history into schools. Though King expressed optimism an uptick in conversations and activism, he said he's not "holding his breath."
"I'm hopeful, but I'm trying to be as reserved as possible to see how everything is going," he said. "Will school districts provide the money for special development? Will they take time to really develop a good Black history curriculum? Will they provide accountability for those teachers who are teaching particular classes?"
A step in the right direction, however, would be an increase in professional development and engagement with teachers. If more educators become knowledgeable on the subject of Black history, the school system could start to change.
"Professional development can't just be one day and then we're through. It has to be constant," King said. "Black history is about understanding Black history from Black perspectives, and people need to continuously educate themselves and attend professional development to learn and get better at understanding Black history as humanistic and nuanced."

Ways to Celebrate Black History Month with Kids
Feb. 8, 2021
Believe it or not, Black History Month hasn’t been around for so long. Officially recognized by American presidents in the 1970’s, some communities and individuals had been celebrating African American contributions to our society and the world as early as the 1920’s, but because much of the 20th century was mired in racial prejudice and the Civil Rights Movement, country-wide recognition didn’t happen until fairly recently.
Most of us are already aware that the purpose of Black History Month is to celebrate the accomplishments and contributions African Americans have made for our society. However, in 2020, some people might be tempted to view the many ways in which our country has changed over the years, and to deem Black History Month as unneeded or irrelevant to our modern culture. While America has made huge strides over the years and decades, our work as a country is far from complete, and history should never be forgotten.

Watch on
The Importance of Celebrating Black History Month
Lonnie Bunch, Founding Director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, said in his blog that “there is no more powerful force than a people steeped in their history”, and that there is “no higher cause than honoring our struggle and ancestors by remembering”. In his article, Bunch argues that Black History Month is just as important today as ever before because it preserves the memory of the past as well as the culture of an entire group of people. Moreover, it empowers members of that culture to retain their traditions while continuing to make a positive difference in the world.
Overall, teaching our children about Black History Month and about the many important African American influencers and contributors continues to move our society forward. Essentially, we are raising kids who will one day grow up and contribute to our society, hopefully in a positive way. By teaching them to respect the history, culture, and accomplishments of African Americans, they will be more aware and ultimately more tolerant of everyone within our highly diverse country.

Why is Black History Month Celebrated in February?
You might have asked yourself out of curiosity: why is Black History Month in February? In fact, from whom or where did Black History month originate? To answer this, we must engage in a brief lesson in history.
It all began with historian Carter G. Woodson, who began what he called Negro History Week in February of 1926. He was a driven and passionate person who believed that all children should be educated about African American history. Woodson’s entire purpose was to educate and highlight African American culture, and also to fight for equality through the positive celebration of black heroes.
The reason why he chose February was because the second week of February was birthday to both President Abraham Lincoln, and abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Along with Woodson’s work to create a week to celebrate black history, the 1920’s brought with it a heightened interest in black culture, such as was seen in the Harlem Renaissance. In combination with movements throughout the United States, the idea of taking a period of time to celebrate black history began to catch on in many communities.
Afterwards, some communities adopted the entire month of February as an unofficial Black History Month, but it wasn’t until 1976 when President Gerald Ford recognized it and encouraged Americans to participate in a month-long observance. Today, it still takes place in February, and serves as an important conversation point in schools and in our everyday lives.

How to Celebrate Black History Month at Home
It’s important to remember that the following ideas can be done throughout the year, and not just in February! As Americans, we should work to honor their contributions all the time. Sometimes, however, it’s important to take time out to focus and remember the purpose of doing that, which makes February a great time, too. Try the following ideas to reinforce Black History Month and its importance with your kids:
Check out the local children’s museum
If you live near a large city, chances are it has a children’s museum. If that’s the case, and even if you have already visited the museum with your children before, check out the exhibits and programming it has available for the month of February. Many children’s museums offer themed days or special exhibits to honor holidays and Black History Month is no exception!
Study African American culture and recipes
One of the best ways to get to know a culture is by making and enjoying their food! Take a dive into African-inspired cuisine and find dishes to try with your family. Decide upon a few recipes to make with your child and encourage him or her to get in on the fun making the dish with your guidance! Try to make one meal per week throughout the month to celebrate African American culture.
Study influential African Americans based upon your child’s own interests
For example, does your child love music? Art? Or reading? Whatever it is your child is passionate about, honor Black History Month by using it as a catalyst to study black culture. For example, if your child is musically inclined, talk about jazz and listen to Duke Ellington or Miles Davis. If your child loves to read, find children’s books authored by or about African Americans. For older kids, read and discuss poems by Langston Hughes or Maya Angelou.
Check out other local kid-friendly events in your town
Many public libraries, museums, and playhouses offer classes, story time events or other activities based upon topic. There’s no doubt that there is something happening in your area to celebrate Black History in February. Go see a play, or view African American art. Use the web to check out your local venues and programming to plan your month!

Create a project and instruct students to study a prominent figure in black history. Give students a list of notable figures that they probably haven’t heard of before but have fascinating backgrounds and history. Some examples include Dr. Daniel Hale Williams, who invented the open-heart surgery in 1893, or Jean-Michel Basquiat, a brilliant artist who invented graffiti. Allow students to research their chosen figure and create an “exhibit” that can be showcased in your classroom. Make space in the classroom for students to set up their exhibits and display them for the school. Invite other classes and task kids with explaining their exhibit to others. Make it even more fun by encouraging kids to dress up!
Create a virtual museum
If you are unable to turn the classroom physically into a museum, make one online, or at least compile exhibits electronically from students! Thirteen.org offers intriguing student examples of virtual museums about remembering slavery and the making of America. Use the examples as a guide, and utilize the template provided by the website to instruct your own students to do the same!
Study stepping and traditional African American songs
You don’t have to be a music teacher to teach students about the history and culture of stepping, but it would work perfectly for music class, too! Stepping is a traditional form of African American dance that engages the entire body to make sounds and rhythms. Study its history and host a stepping contest in your classroom! Alternatively, study the role of freedom songs in the Civil Rights Movement. In particular, activist Fannie Lou Hamer is known for singing songs like “This Little Light of Mine” during marches or civil rights protests.
Host a poetry night (or day!)
Students can study poetry, even at a young age! Create a list of African American poets and meaningful kid-appropriate poems. Assign students to study a poem and recite it for the class, or invite other classes, and even parents! Teach students about poetry readings beforehand and discuss what happens during performances. Let them plan and practice their performance, and encourage kids to dress up, and make programs as a class. Set the mood by dimming the lights, selecting a student emcee, and playing soft jazz music in between poems.
Recreate freedom posters from the Civil Rights Movement
Teach your students about the Freedom Movement. This included historic events, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycotts or what became known as the Freedom Rides. Check out t his website to view fascinating and powerful posters from the era. Instruct students to recreate freedom posters or make one of their own in a similar style. Make a project of it and hang them in the hall for other classes to view!
Black History Month is an excellent time to study the many contributions that African Americans have made to our country’s history and for our society. Don’t forget that February shouldn’t be the only time this year that your children study these accomplishments! Continue lessons about prominent black historical figures and their accomplishments throughout the year! Whether you’re a teacher or a parent, start by selecting a few of the above ideas to get started, and make this February one your kids will always remember!

Since Black history is such a controversial and multifaceted topic, there is no simple answer to the question of when it started being taught in schools. There have been many attempts in the past to integrate the topics of Black culture and history into the regular school curricula, and that is the mission that continues to the present day.
Perhaps one of the best examples of a successful introduction of the subject is Black History Month and how it is celebrated at schools on a national level. Even with Black History Month, the way we teach African American history in schools continues to spark heated debates and contradicting viewpoints.
We cannot say when the lives, culture, and history of the Black folk began being taught in the K-12 curriculum exactly. What we can do is look at the roots of the subject, the way it progressed over the last century, and identify what we should do to mend the issues regarding the study of Black history that persist in our educational system.
When Did Schools Start Teaching Black History—What We Know
We can trace the roots of Black history as a subject taught in K-12 public schools to one notable person— Carter G. Woodson, the American historian and journalist who was born at the end of the 19th and lived throughout the entire first half of the 20th century. In the year 1926, along with other members of his organization, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), he started the Negro History Week that later became what we know and celebrate as Black History Month today.
Woodson’s objective was for schools in America and beyond to start teaching students about the history of the Black people. His contribution to the phenomenon remains almost unrivaled. With his foundation, he wrote various textbooks, created school course programs, and started The Journal of African American History —one of the first that would publish scholarly papers on Black lives, culture, and history.
The Negro History Week—commemorated in the second week of February to match the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass—was welcomed by a certain number of educators and Black community members. It wasn’t until the 1960s Civil Rights Movement that Woodson’s mission had its first prominent effects.
Only in the middle of the 20th century did the U.S. government pass laws to stamp out history textbooks that depicted the Black populations in a discriminatory way. Soon, following the example set by the changes made to the California law in 1961, seven states introduced laws stating or recommending that Black history be taught in schools.
Here’s a timeline of the beginnings of Black history teachings in schools:
Year
Notable Events
1915
The Association for the Study of African American Life and History is established.
1916
The Journal of African American History is put into print.
1926
Negro History Week starts being celebrated.
The 1960s
Textbooks with racial discrimination subtext are being banned.
1961
The law regulating that Black history starts being taught in schools is passed by the State of California, followed by other states doing the same.
1969
The Social Education paper published a special edition promoting the importance of curricula that includes the study of Black history.
The Disagreements About Teaching Black History in Schools
Black history, as a subject to be integrated into different aspects of K-12 curricula is a relatively novel notion. It is also extremely complex and chock full of sensitive narratives. For these reasons, the way it is and should be taught to students has always been widely questioned, debated, and even criticized.
Some of the most common controversies revolve around:
The fact that Black history is being taught only one month in a school year
Approaches to teaching Black history
The question of whether or not Black history is American history
Why Teach Black History Only One Month a Year?
When looking into the disagreements scholars have about teaching Black history, we can safely start by examining the conflicting views on Black History Month itself.
While many look forward to the period and celebrate the time in all earnestness—including teachers who relish the opportunity to break away from the usual white-centered topics in the mainstream curricula—others condemn Black History Month for one simple reason. They feel Black history should be taught throughout the school year rather than a single month.
Do Schools Teach Black History Properly?
Another factor scholars cannot decide on is the approach teachers are supposed to take when relating Black history to their students. Some feel the subject should be subtly integrated into the regular history subject to promote a neutral stance on social and political issues. Others would have the narratives of Black lives serve as an example of social justice, or rather injustice, and teach students the value of resilience.
Is Black History American History?
The third debate we must not neglect to mention is the one regarding the distinctions between Black and American histories.
One group seems to believe teaching Black history is essential because it has influenced the culture and notable events in America. Given the inextricable link the Black communities have always had to our country, it could safely be said that Black history is American history, and not a separate one.
Others consider the concept harmful and ignorant of the huge chunk of Black history that is not tied to the American one. To teach students only that the black population was forcefully migrated to the Americas is to turn a blind eye to this ethnic group’s past on the African continent. Black people had their civilizations there—languages, traditions, and religions included—that make up a much larger part of their history than the one on the American soil.
Black History in School Curricula by the Numbers
The statistics regarding the extent to which Black history is taught in K-12 schools are far from encouraging. According to the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC), Black history was taught during only 8%–9% of total class time in American schools in 2015.
This contradicts other notable findings of the study. Teachers, in general, believe teaching Black history to students of K-12 level is vital to their understanding of their national history as well as their subsequent personal and professional growth. Yet, they often hold back from including Black history in all areas of the school program. They believe:
Their students might not be emotionally prepared to learn and understand certain narratives of the subject
There aren’t enough resources to teach Black history
They don’t have enough confidence to teach the subject
We Need To Change the Way We Teach Black History—But How?
Credit: Mohamed Hassan
From everything we have seen, it can only be concluded that the time to transform school culture is nigh and that we need a new approach to teaching Black history to our students. You might be asking yourself how. You can start by exploring:
How you can integrate Black history throughout the entire school curriculum
What the ways you can include the origins of Black Americans into your Black history lessons are
Whether you can implement the positive stories about Black lives along with the harsh realities of their modern history into your classes
Schools Teach Black History One Month a Year—You Can Do Better
You might be among those concerned about narrowing the importance of Black history down by teaching it only one month in the school year. Perhaps still, you feel like Black History Month is only perpetuating the internalized racism by separating the Black people from their white neighbors. In any case, you should consider bending your school’s established curriculum rules in favor of teaching Black history all months of the year, rather than just one.
If you lack the skills or resources to do so, you can check out the University of Missouri’s Carter Center for K-12 Black History Education. The organization was established in 2018 to help teachers who wish to incorporate Black history into all of their classes. You can attend the center’s regular conferences and workshops to gain knowledge on the topics as well as pick up ideas on how to better the teaching of Black history in your own classes.
How To Teach Your Students That Black History Came From Africa
The founder of the Carter Center, Lagarrett J. King observes that you should not allow enslavement to be the first period in Black history your students learn about. You need to accentuate that the ancestry and cultural heritage of the Black folk can be traced back to many years before the colonization of Africa.
For example, whenever you have a class on the American Civil War of the 1860s or the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, you can start it with the prelude into the African kingdoms. Explain that they were ruled and inhabited by the majority of the Black population that was forced to migrate to the U.S. and adopt the culture, tradition, and language of the foreign nation.
What Schools Don’t Teach About Black History—But You Can
Educate your students that Black history starts much earlier than the American one does, but also focus on the positive aspects of that history.
Abolishing slavery and paving the way to greater social equality in the latter half of the 20th century is relevant even to this day and age, but your students have to learn more than that. Black history and the people that it involves aren’t only the victims of oppression, but artists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and scientists.
Only then can you promote true diversity in your school and work toward creating a school environment that is safe for all.
Why Is Teaching Black History Important?
Since we’re nowhere near getting rid of social injustice and race discrimination, it is vital that we shape our students’ minds in the way that fosters their understanding of the major issues in society.
You should teach Black history so that the future generations are free from the pre-conceived unethical notions of race.
On that note, let’s look in more detail at why teaching Black history matters to both your:
Black students
White students
The Relevance of Teaching Black Students Black History
Your Black students may be nurturing some misconceptions about themselves that society engraves in their minds. You need to teach them their history so that they can grow into adults who are ready to realize their dreams without having to struggle with that.
To achieve this, it is of utmost importance that you focus on the positive Black narratives when teaching Black history to Black students. You can start by showing them that they come from ancient thriving civilizations that had their own languages, traditions, and cultures way before they were forced to assimilate into the foreign one.
Why You Should Teach Black History to White Students and How
Your white students should be taught Black history for similar reasons. It will enable them to evolve into grown-ups who can recognize and be inspired to break the cycles of systemic or institutional racism in any career they choose to pursue.
Though we need to include positive narratives into Black history teaching, the enslavement, emancipation, and further dehumanization of the Blacks should not be neglected. Often, they are nothing but sanitized and rushed history lessons in our education systems.
Particularly in high schools, your students should be introduced to all the ways Black communities suffered—not only in the remote past but even in post-civil rights America.
For example, a lesson on the destruction of the black businesses in Tulsa —an incident inappropriately referred to as race riots—is inevitable.
Innovative Activities To Teach About Black History in Education

When you’re relating Black history to your students, the old teaching rule still applies— your lessons should be interesting and engaging to be effective.
Regardless of the subject you’re teaching or the lesson you’re focusing on, you should come up with novel and interactive ways to approach it.
For example, when it comes to Black history, you could have your students:
Write short biographies of important people
Listen to songs and analyze their meanings
What Are Some Noteworthy Black History Figures That Are Not Taught in Schools?
Not only is it important to tell your students about Black historical figures that don’t get enough representation, but you are certain to spark their interest if you introduce them to people and concepts they have never heard of before.
When you have a class about a particular set of notable people, you can do much regarding classroom activities and the homework you set.
If you’re a history teacher, you can always make your students write minibiographies of the personalities you teach or have them come up with made-up interviews with the historical figures of their choice. You will undoubtedly boost their critical reading and writing skills this way.
Even if you don’t teach history, you can make your students learn about the Black experience. Why not make them paint portraits of people from history in your visual arts class? This is just one example of how you can integrate the study of Black history throughout the entire curriculum.
Here’s a table depicting some notable Black historical figures that high school teachers don’t usually teach about:
A Historical Figure
Occupation
Notable for Being:
Dorothy Dandridge
Actor
The first African American nominated for an Academy Award for the role in “Carmen Jones.”
Amenhotep III
Egyptian ruler
One of the first pharaohs that saw to it that his country thrived in trade, finance, and education during his reign.
Bayard Rustin
Activist
An openly LGBTQ+ civil and social rights activist that contributed to the launching of several organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
Mary Beatrice Davidson Kenner
Inventor
The inventor of the first sanitary belt, despite not being credited for her achievement.
Make Songs a Part of Black History in a School Curriculum
Another fun activity you can employ to teach Black history is to have your students listen to the songs about Black lives and analyze the lyrics and song meanings.
The obvious example would be Michael Jackson’s “Black and White,” but if you want to go for something edgy and unconventional, why not introduce your students to Bob Dylan’s “Hurricane ?” The song is not only one of the folk legend’s most successful, but it also relates a true-life story of Rubin Carter —a Black boxer who was wrongly accused of triple murder and ended by being a director for the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted after his overdue acquittal. Dylan’s movie-like approach to the lyrics is bound to engage your students with the story, while the song will have them swaying or dancing to the fast beat at the same time.
A bonus suggestion to French teachers is Feu! Chatterton’s “Harlem” —a mesmerizing number titled after the New York district that was made famous for the Harlem Renaissance. You could ask your students to analyze the lyrics so that they can practice their French, learn about Black history, and explore how varied lyrics and poetry writing strategies can be.
Are Schools Not Teaching Black History—What Do You Think?
Do you believe that innovations in schools are inevitable?
Do you feel that the school curriculum is constricting you when you want to teach your students about the entirety of Black history, and not focus only on certain aspects of it?
If so, you can help shape a school culture that is conducive to real-life learning and inclusive of all its students by writing your own story or your own opinions, and we’ll share your words with the world.

Alright, I've got some information here from these articles. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, it seems that Black History Month started as a way to recognize and teach about the contributions and experiences of African Americans. It began as "Negro History Week" in 1926, founded by Carter G. Woodson, and was later expanded to a full month in February. The purpose is to celebrate and educate about the achievements and struggles of Black people in America.

But, from what I'm reading, there's a lot of debate about how Black History is taught in schools. Some people think it should be taught year-round, not just in February, because it's an integral part of American history. Others argue that confining it to one month marginalizes it and suggests that it's separate from the rest of American history.

Looking at the statistics, it's concerning that only 8-9% of history class time is devoted to Black history, according to a 2015 study. That seems really low, considering the significant role that African Americans have played in shaping the country.

Moreover, there are issues with how Black history is presented. Some textbooks have been criticized for sanitizing the history, glossing over the harsh realities of slavery and racism, and focusing mainly on a few iconic figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. This can give students a incomplete and potentially misleading view of history.

I also noticed that only a handful of states have mandates for teaching Black history in schools, and even fewer have oversight to ensure that it's being taught properly. This lack of standardization probably contributes to the inconsistent quality of Black history education across the country.

One article mentioned that teachers often lack the content knowledge to teach Black history effectively, especially since teacher education programs may not require courses on ethnic studies. This suggests that there's a need for better training and resources for teachers.

Another point that stood out to me is the idea that Black history isn't just about slavery and civil rights; it's also about the rich cultural heritage and achievements of African Americans in various fields like science, arts, and politics. By focusing only on the struggles, we might be missing out on inspiring stories that could motivate students.

Furthermore, teaching Black history can help combat stereotypes and promote understanding among different racial groups. It can foster empathy and respect by showing the diverse experiences and contributions of Black people.

For Black students, learning about their history and heritage can boost their self-esteem and sense of belonging. It's important for them to see themselves reflected in the curriculum and to understand the profound impact their ancestors have had on society.

Additionally, studying Black history can provide valuable lessons in social justice and activism. The civil rights movement, for example, is a powerful case study in nonviolent protest and grassroots organizing. These are important concepts for young people to understand as they develop their own civic engagement skills.

However, there are challenges in teaching Black history. Some educators might be uncomfortable delving into topics like slavery and racism because they are painful and complex. There's also the risk of presenting a simplified or whitewashed version of history that doesn't fully confront the systemic injustices that have affected African Americans.

To address these issues, there are suggestions for improving Black history education. For instance, integrating Black history into the overall curriculum throughout the year, providing professional development for teachers, and ensuring that the curriculum includes multiple perspectives and themes within Black history.

Moreover, there's a call to go beyond the typical figures and events and to explore lesser-known aspects of Black history. This could involve studying the contributions of Black inventors, artists, and scientists, as well as examining the cultural influences of Africa on American society.

Another idea is to make Black history education more interactive and engaging. Using music, art, and other mediums can help students connect with the material on a deeper level. For example, listening to songs from different periods and analyzing their messages can provide insights into the experiences and aspirations of Black people.

Furthermore, involving the community in Black history education can be beneficial. Bringing in guest speakers, visiting historical sites, and participating in local events can enrich students' understanding and make the learning experience more meaningful.

In conclusion, teaching Black history in schools is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and accurate understanding of American history. It's not just about celebrating Black achievements; it's about recognizing the central role that African Americans have played in shaping the nation and continuing to do so today.

However, there's a lot of work to be done to improve the way Black history is taught. It requires a commitment to providing comprehensive, nuanced, and respectful education that acknowledges both the triumphs and the trials of Black people in America.

As educators, parents, and community members, we have a responsibility to ensure that all students have access to a well-rounded education that includes a deep appreciation for Black history. By doing so, we can help build a more informed and empathetic society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Teaching Black History in schools is essential for fostering inclusivity, promoting understanding among different racial groups, boosting the self-esteem of Black students, and providing valuable lessons in social justice and activism. It should be integrated into the overall curriculum throughout the year, with a focus on multiple perspectives and themes within Black history, and supported by professional development for teachers.}} \]
