Alright, so I've been asked to think about why we should increase the minimum wage. I need to consider this step by step and make sure I understand all the aspects involved. First off, what is minimum wage? It's the lowest amount per hour that employers can pay their workers, set by law. The idea is to protect workers from being underpaid and to ensure they can afford basic necessities.

Now, why would someone argue for increasing it? Well, one main reason is that many people working for minimum wage struggle to make ends meet. Their income might not cover housing, food, healthcare, and other essential expenses. So, raising the minimum wage could help improve their standard of living.

But, is that the only reason? Probably not. There might be economic benefits as well. For example, if people have more disposable income, they might spend more, which could stimulate the economy. Also, higher wages could reduce turnover rates, meaning businesses might save on training costs in the long run.

On the other hand, there are arguments against raising the minimum wage. Some say it could lead to job losses because businesses might not be able to afford higher labor costs and might have to cut positions. Others argue that it could cause inflation, as companies pass on the increased costs to consumers through higher prices.

So, I need to weigh these pros and cons. Maybe I should look up some studies or data to see what actually happens when the minimum wage is increased.

Let me think about how I can approach this. Perhaps I can consider different perspectives: workers, businesses, and the overall economy.

From the worker's perspective, a higher minimum wage means more money in their pockets, which can lead to better living conditions, improved health, and potentially even better education outcomes for their children.

From the business perspective, while higher wages might increase costs, they could also lead to a more motivated and productive workforce. Additionally, if employees stay longer with the company, that can reduce training and hiring costs.

Looking at the bigger picture, an increased minimum wage could boost the economy through increased consumer spending. People with more disposable income are likely to spend more on goods and services, which can drive demand and stimulate growth.

However, I should also consider potential negative effects. If businesses can't absorb the higher labor costs, they might indeed lay off workers or reduce hours. This could lead to unemployment or underemployment, which would obviously be detrimental to those affected.

Also, there's the possibility of inflation. If all businesses raise their prices to cover the increased wages, then the purchasing power of the higher wages might not actually increase, or maybe even decrease if prices rise too much.

I think it's important to look at real-world examples where the minimum wage has been increased and see what happened. For instance, some cities and states in the US have raised their minimum wages above the federal level, and researchers have studied the impacts.

Let me try to recall some of those studies. I seem to remember that in places like Seattle and San Francisco, where the minimum wage was raised significantly, there wasn't a substantial negative impact on employment. In fact, some studies showed slight increases in employment or no change at all.

But I need to verify that. Maybe I should look up some recent research on this topic.

The debate about the effect increases in the minimum wage have on employment is ongoing. Some studies find either no or only a small effect (here and here, for example), while others find significant effects (here and here ). A study recently published in the American Economic Review provides new evidence that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment in the long run.
Economists often try to estimate the slope of a demand curve by looking for events that change the supply of the good in question but not demand. For example, unexpected good weather that boosts the tomato crop would increase the supply of tomatoes but wouldn’t affect demand, and this would allow economists to estimate how consumers respond to the supply increase.
But increases in the supply of labor are different. Unlike tomatoes, an increase in labor may also affect the demand for labor. This could occur for two reasons. First, more people can mean more demand for products already being produced. That, in turn, means established firms would need to expand to meet the increase in demand.
Second, demand can also increase if some of the new workers start their own businesses and thus demand additional workers. So while more tomatoes won’t demand even more tomatoes, more workers may demand even more workers. These dynamics make it tricky to estimate the effects of wage increases.
The authors of the new study—Paul Beaudry, David Green, and Ben Sand—create a framework to account for the effect an increase in the supply of labor can have on the demand for labor in order to isolate the effect of wages on employment. They find that increases in wages have a negative effect on employment over 10-year intervals.
In terms of magnitude, they find that a 1% increase in wages leads to a 0.3% to 1% decrease in the employment rate depending on whether wages increase citywide or in only one industry.
The authors find that most of the negative employment effects that result from wage increases (which are cost increases) are due to more firms closing rather than firms laying off workers. Since more firm closings and fewer openings take longer to show up in the data than less hiring and more firing, it makes sense that the long-term effects of wage increases on employment are larger than short term effects.
The idea that higher wages affect employment via firm closings is also consistent with a study that finds lower quality restaurants are more likely to close following a minimum wage increase. Another study also finds that minimum wage increases reduce employment primarily through firm closings.
The authors directly apply their framework to recent minimum wage increases—all to $15 per hour—in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. They estimate that Los Angeles’s increase will lead to a three percentage point decline in the city’s employment rate in the long run, while Seattle’s will lead to a two percentage point decline and San Francisco’s will lead to a one percentage point decline.
The effects are different because the minimum wage affects different percentages of the labor force in each city. In relatively high-wage San Francisco, fewer workers and firms are affected by a $15 minimum wage than in lower-wage Los Angeles.
Similarly, an increase to $15 will have a larger effect on workers earning much less than $15 than it will on workers earning closer to $15 when the wage increase goes into effect. This is shown in the figure below from the paper.
effects of min. wage increases
Beaudry, Paul, David A. Green, and Ben M. Sand. 2018.
For Seattle workers (solid black line) initially earning $10 per hour, the long-term decline in the employment rate is estimated to be over 10%. For workers earning closer to $15 per hour the estimated decline is only about 7%. Again, San Francisco’s estimated long-term decline is smaller (highest line) since the city’s relatively high-wage economy is less impacted by the minimum wage increase.
These results don’t necessarily mean minimum wage increases are bad policy. They do, however, support the notion that higher minimum wages have a cost, namely fewer employment opportunities for lower-skill workers. It’s important that we recognize this cost in any discussion about minimum wage policy.

The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment
News And Information From Around The World
The Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment
There has been a heated debate among economic scholars on issues concerning the effect of minimum wage on employment. In efforts to prove the point of their arguments, many scholars have conducted researches on the impact of increasing the minimum wage rates on the levels of employment. In this report, the author seeks to evaluate arguments of different economists on the subject based on their respective researches and the rationale behind the same.
Wage Rate and Employment
Traditionally, it has been known in economic scope that the most direct effect of implementing minimum wage policies is increased rates of unemployment among the youth and unskilled workers. The main proponents and opponents of implementing the minimum wages are the supply-side and demand-side economists. Whereas the supply-side economists argue that increasing the minimum wage-rate will lead to an increase in unemployment rate, their demand-side opponents claim that a rise in the minimum wage rate will lower the poverty levels and reduce underemployment levels.
In a comprehensive review of literature on the effects of minimum wages on employment, Neumark and Wascher (2007) report that almost two-thirds of the entries they examined indicated a negative relationship between employment and minimum wage rate. This complies with the traditional view that increases in minimum wage rate reduces employment rate among the low-wage workers. The writers attribute this relationship to the long panel studies conducted by these researchers which incorporate both state and time variations in the minimum wage.   either zero or positive effect of minimum wage on low-skill employment used short panel data (Neumark and Wascher, 2007). This analysis might have been conducted within a very short period of time. This time is not sufficient to capture the full effects of wage changes, since a reasonable time is required in order to experience total adjustment of the production process on the economics of low-skilled labor.
A study was conducted by David Card and Alan Krueger (1994) on the effects of minimum wage on employment in New Jersey. The study was carried out in the fast food industry in New Jersey, with the same in Pennsylvania acting as a control group. The outcome of the analysis was contrary to the generally known relationship between the minimum wage rate and employment. Card and Krueger reported that there was no evidence that the rise in the minimum wage rates in New Jersey resulted to a reduced employment at fast food restaurants in the state. The team concluded that the increase in the minimum wage rate to $5.00 per hour in New Jersey did not lead to reduced employment, but rather the effect was transmitted to consumers through increase food prices leading to, in fact,  an increase in the new number of employees hired. During the reevaluation of these findings, there were discrepancies found in the data and analysis from Card and Krueger’s study. Neumark and Wascher (2003), examined the findings ad conducted a new survey to ascertain the validity of the contra arguments. This reevaluation study was conducted using payroll records from the same fast-food stores in New Jersey with their Pennsylvanian counterparts acting as control group. It was established that the Card and Krueger’s study relied heavily on telephone information provided by the fast-food restaurants managers. The new findings by Neumark and Wascher indicated that the increase in minimum wage in New Jersey led to a decrease in fast-food employment relative to the control, group in Pennsylvania.
The law of demand states that at higher prices, less of a commodity is demanded. This law applies to any item that is required including food, cars and labor.  Since a legislated increase in the cost of labor does not increase labor productivity per se, those workers who are less productive will be forced out of work. The experiment carried using the payroll data generally indicates a reverse relationship between minimum wage and labor demand (Campo, 2010). Minimum wage laws will always harm young adults at work places since they have minimal work experience and are involved in jobs that require fewer skills. A doubt is therefore cast on validity of the survey that Card and Krueger conducted “over the telephone”.  The information that was provided by fast-food restaurant owners must have meant to paint a positive image of the company and therefore a marketing gimmick. The law of demand and supply is static and therefore only provisions of assumptions can be applied to indicate a positive relationship between demand and supply. It is therefore difficult to explain that an increase in the levels of wage rate will lead to increased employment. In other words, this scenario will imply that when the cost of production is increased (marked by increase in wage rates), producers or manufacturers will demand more labor for production. This is practically not realistic.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in a free labor market, the applied wage rates are determined by the forces of demand and supply. This means that, the prevailing wage rate echoes the willingness of workers to supply labor (work) and the willingness of employers to demand labor (hire the employees). The productivity of laborers will therefore determine how much the employers are willing to pay or increase the wage rate. Induced increase of wage rates characterized by legislative actions of the state of federal government will cause friction in the labor market. Meaning that, there will be employee lay-offs by companies in order to reduce the cost of production.

The Minimum wage has been a topic that has shaped our Ideas in political, social, and economic issues in our society. The constant debate that has everyone wondering, is should the minimum wage be raised or kept the same. To decide whether the minimum wage should be raised or lowered depends on a couple of factors; such as The impact on jobs (such as the unemployment rate), effect on families for example, incomes and living conditions, Impacts on businesses and the growth of our economy.
The biggest question regarding the Minimum Wage is will bumping the price up affect our jobs. Yes and no to the change having an impact on our jobs. If the Minimum Wage is increased it is less likely for businesses to let go of their employees due to the inability to pay them. The United States Department of Labor reviewed 64 studies about how the unemployment income is dependent on the increase of minimum wage and they found zero proof on how they both have a connection. However the amount of turnovers regarding employees decreases because of new workers being employed and trained. Thus the increase of new workers defeats the myth that employees will be cut loose from jobs. Proving my point increasing the minimum wage will have an impact on jobs in a positive way by adding more workers but In another way looking on the other hand the Minimum Wage won’t have an impact on our jobs on the unemployment topic, which is a hot topic that politicians like to stir debate around.
A HUGE component that greatly impacts our economy are incentives. Incentives drive production and quality of products which are depended upon workers in the economy. If Minimum Wage were to go up incentives for not only our stores and factories but our education regarding college would go down the toilet. Looking at the logical explanation and exploring the mind of a college student, highschool student, an individual that is a highschool dropout According to the information provided by The Bureau Of Labor Statistics in 2012, 284,000 Students who graduated college were working at minimum wage jobs. The amount of graduate students working minimum wage jobs increased to 71% more than it was originally a decade ago in 2013. Graduates were numbered 167,000 in 2002, and 127,000 in 2006. As shown, the total of graduates sucked into minimum wage jobs keeps increasing more and more rapidly over the years. If the minimum wage is actually passed so that it will be raised to $15 the people who take an extra step into their education and go to the college and earn a career will be earning as much as a highschool drop out. If people who didn’t earn a high school diploma get paid the same as someone who earned their masters and drove their way through college including student loans and or earning their way by getting stellar grades and being the highest above their class the person who earned their degree will have what seems like wasted time because they’re most likely to end up at a minimum wage job anyhow which shows that the minimum would completely encourage lazy people.
The final reason I believe the Minimum wage shouldn’t be elevated is The sole fact that minimum wages shouldn’t even be anywhere in the sight of a family’s income. If the argument is that minimum wage is not livable it’s because I truly believe the Minimum wage is meant for high school students and college students. The real surprising thing to me throughout all my research not once have I seen anyone establish who the minimum wage was meant for; Throughout all the debate it’s only said who the minimum wage workers are. However a highlighted fact is that minimum wage workers are indeed young. According to a Direct source of The Bureau of Labor Statistics Report 1054, “Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2014” Workers make up ⅕ of the hourly wage workers but nearly half of wage workers payee minimum or less. Teenagers ages 16 to 19 are made up of the 15 % that earn the minimum wage or even lower than that versus the 3 % who are 25 years of age or older. On the gender side woman are made up of 5% and men are at 3%. The workers who are in the service industry such as fast food and restaurants make up ⅔ the hourly jobs. About 10% of hourly wage workers worked less than 35 hours a week which brings me to my point about the minimum being most suitable for teenagers and college students due to busy schedules and school to attend.
We should not raise minimum wage due to the reasons on it having little impact on our jobs, the decreased motivation of people to further their education thus equalling little value in college degrees, and people arguing that the minimum wage isn’t livable proves the point that the minimum wage wasn’t mean for a family of four to survive on. If people want livable wages and better lives they should invest their time into college although there is still a risk of ending up in a minimum wage but the percentage will be way lower to be stuck in low income job and a better chance to have better working conditions. People who want a higher minimum wage are composed of people who didn’t go to college or people who got stuck in a hole and who got sidetracked by life such as having a family.

The impact on the employment rolls is slightly higher than the 1. 3 million employment estimate from a 2019 report from the CBO, a nonpartisan agency that provides budgetary analysis to Congress. The number has been disputed by employment advocates who cite the benefits from the raise and say businesses will be able to handle the costs. Biden has acknowledged that the plan to phase in the new federal wage floor likely won’t make it through the $1. 9 trillion spending plan he is pushing through Congress, though he remains committed to the increase. The CBO report estimates that the employment reduction would happen by 2025 and come as employers cut payroll to compensate for the increased costs.

How raising minimum wage to $15 per hour could affect workers and small businesses
The debate over raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour is gaining steam, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle weigh the benefits and consequences.
Will legislation create another blow for small businesses? – The debate over raising the minimum wage is gaining steam, as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle weigh the benefits and consequences of boosting the lowest pay to $15 per hour. “We want to see Americans’ wages go up, we want to see more jobs created — not fewer — and we want to see businesses thrive, especially small businesses that are the backbone of our economy,” Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., said Wednesday during a hearing called by the House Committee on Small Business. Late last month, Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2021, which would gradually increase the federal minimum wage from $7. 25 to $15 by 2025. The legislation is currently included in the House version of the $1. 9 trillion relief package that is set for a vote on Friday, but it’s unclear if that provision will pass the Senate. Another option, announced Tuesday by Senators Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., would be to increase the federal minimum wage to $10 per hour by 2025 and then automatically increase it every two years to match the rate of inflation.
Minimum Wage – The federal minimum wage for covered nonexempt employees is $7.25 per hour.Many states also have minimum wage laws. In cases where an employee is subject to both the state and federal minimum wage laws, the employee is entitled to the higher of the two minimum wages.
The federal minimum wage provisions are contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA does not provide wage payment or collection procedures for an employee’s usual or promised wages or commissions in excess of those required by the FLSA. However, some states do have laws under which such claims (sometimes including fringe benefits) may be filed.
No, a $15 minimum wage won’t cost 1.4 million jobs
A much-cited Congressional Budget Office estimate doesn’t reflect the best economic evidence.
Opponents of raising the minimum wage have seized on a recent report by the Congressional Budget Office that estimated that increasing it to $15 an hour by 2025 would cause 1. 4 million Americans to lose their jobs. These “significant job losses,” according to a U. S. Chamber of Commerce vice president, provide reason enough to abandon the Biden administration’s plan to help low-income workers. First, it important to recognize the CBO also observes that income gains resulting from the wage increase are substantially greater than the reduction in income from job losses, thereby lifting nearly a million people out of poverty. Nonetheless, the report’s assumptions about job losses are problematic — significantly out of step with modern research on the subject. A recent survey of the evidence in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, for instance, by the labor economist Alan Manning, carried an apt title that captures scholars’ views far better: “The Elusive Employment Effects of Minimum Wages.
Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for workers, good for businesses, and good for the economy: Testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor
On February 7, 2019, EPI economist Ben Zipperer testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in support of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019.
13. Areas here refer to all counties and metro areas. Family budgets here are projected using projected inflation from the CPI-U series published by the Congressional Budget Office. See Congressional Budget Office, An Update to the Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028, “10-Year Economic Projections” (downloadable Excel file supplement), August 2018.
Conclusion
Raising the national minimum wage is well overdue. Workers today who are paid the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 an hour are, after adjusting for inflation, paid 29 percent less than their counterparts 50 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy’s capacity to deliver higher wages has doubled in the last 50 years, as measured by labor productivity, or the amount of output produced by workers. As Figure A shows, had the minimum wage kept pace with labor productivity growth since 1968, this year it would be more than $20 per hour. Today, however, a single parent earning the current federal minimum wage does not earn enough through full-time work to bring his or her family above the federal poverty line.
Research: When a Higher Minimum Wage Leads to Lower Compensation
A recent study found that one retailer slashed hours, scrambled schedules, and cut benefits after a minimum wage hike.
Based on this analysis, we found that increasing the minimum wage had no statistically significant impact on the total number of labor hours employed at a given store. In other words, stores hired workers to work for the same overall number of hours regardless of whether minimum wage increased.
While proponents of increasing the minimum wage have grown increasingly vocal in the U.S., new research suggests that raising the minimum wage can actually have a significant negative impact on the total compensation of hourly workers. Researchers analyzed a detailed dataset of wage and scheduling data for more than 5,000 employees at a single national retailer, and compared outcomes for workers in California (which had several minimum wage increases during the study period) and Texas (which had zero increases). They found that in the stores that experienced a minimum wage hike, workers on average worked fewer hours per week, were less likely to qualify for benefits, and had less-consistent schedules. These factors corresponded to an average 11. 6% decrease in total compensation for every $1 increase in the minimum wage. Based on these findings, the authors argue that policymakers should consider minimum wage hikes with caution, and should be sure to complement them with policies designed to ensure consistent schedules and adequate hours for workers — or risk harming the very people they’re aiming to support.

Many business owners and executives seem to share the belief that everyone is paid the true value of their work, whether that is $30 million a year or $7. 25 an hour. In that vein, they often argue that minimum wage laws set an unnatural price floor that prevents people who would be willing to work for less from doing so, ultimately increasing business expenses and costing millions of jobs. 1 This argument conveniently ignores the human needs for food, shelter, and financial security that leave workers with little choice but to accept poverty wages in a society that does not adequately provide any of these basic needs. 2 Indeed, the U.S. economy largely rewards those same business owners with extraordinary profits garnered directly from the exploitation of desperate low-income individuals and families.
How the Minimum Wage Impacts Unemployment
Here is what experts say about the effect that raising the minimum wage would have on workers, employers, and the overall job market.
Apart from what legislators are doing, some large employers have taken it upon themselves to establish companywide minimum wages in recent years. Those include big retailers such as Amazon ($15 an hour), Costco ($16), and Walmart ($11 or higher, depending on the location and position).
States, Cities, and Counties Set Their Own Minimum Wages
Fortunately for many workers, 29 states plus the District of Columbia mandate minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum. As of Jan. 1, 2021, they ranged from $8. 65 an hour in Florida to $15 in Washington, D.C. The remaining states either match the federal level of $7. 25, have no minimum wage at all, or set their level below the federal one—$5. 15 in the case of both Georgia and Wyoming. ﻿﻿ In states with no minimum wage or a lower one, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers.
Minimum Wage Changes
Suppose that the government is considering an increase in the minimum wage. What should we expect to happen? How will firms and workers respond? One might be tempted simply to ask firms what they would do in the face of an increase in the minimum wage. Unfortunately, this is likely to be both infeasible (or at least prohibitively expensive) and inaccurate. It would be an immense amount of work to interview all the firms in an economy. What is more, there is no guarantee that managers of firms would give accurate answers if they were asked hypothetical questions about a change in the minimum wage. Instead, government statisticians use statistical sampling techniques to interview a random sample of firms in an economy, and they ask them about their actual behavior—they ask questions such as the following: “How many workers do you employ at present?” and “How much do you pay them?” The data from such surveys are useful but do not directly help us determine the effects of a change in the minimum wage. For this we need more theory.

One might be tempted simply to ask firms what they would do in the face of an increase in the minimum wage. Unfortunately, this is likely to be both infeasible (or at least prohibitively expensive) and inaccurate. It would be an immense amount of work to interview all the firms in an economy. What is more, there is no guarantee that managers of firms would give accurate answers if they were asked hypothetical questions about a change in the minimum wage. Instead, government statisticians use statistical sampling techniques to interview a random sample of firms in an economy, and they ask them about their actual behavior—they ask questions such as the following: “How many workers do you employ at present?” and “How much do you pay them?” The data from such surveys are useful but do not directly help us determine the effects of a change in the minimum wage.

Could raising minimum wage cause job cascade?
Historically, the highest federal minimum wage in real terms was $10. 69 in 1968, converted to current dollars. If the federal minimum wage were raised to $15 an hour (the rate proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and recently enacted in Seattle, to be phased in over time), it would be 40% higher than it has ever been.
You are here – Answer: The current federal minimum wage for workers in covered sectors is $7. 25 an hour. As you suggest, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would motivate many workers who were already being paid $15 in the old regime to seek employment in less demanding jobs that would now pay the same rate. To retain workers in more skilled, physically or mentally demanding, dangerous, or unpleasant jobs, employers would need to adjust wages upward to some degree. Still, couriers should not anticipate dramatic increases in their wages following a minimum wage increase. Relatively few couriers would be able to find preferred work in the jobs directly affected by the mandated wage increase.
Research Shows Minimum Wage Increases Do Not Cause Job Loss
Numerous states raised their minimum wages above the federal level during the 1997-2007 period the federal minimum wage remained stuck at $5. 15. Research by the Fiscal Policy Institute and others showed that states that raised their minimum wages above the federal level experienced better employment and small business trends than states that did not.
In a 2013 report, Why Does the Minimum Wage Have No Discernible Effect on Employment?, the Center for Economic and Policy Research analyzed extensive research conducted since the 1990s. They conclude that “the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. ” They note that “the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms’ overall costs. ” They explore various means of adjustment by employers such as increased worker productivity and diminished wage gap between lower and higher paid employees and say, “probably the most important channel of adjustment is through reductions in labor turnover, which yield significant cost savings to employers.
Does raising the minimum wage kill jobs? The centurylong search for the elusive answer shows why economics is so difficult
The question is actually one of the most studied in all of economics and still doesn’t have a definitive answer – though Nobel-winning economist David Card got us closer.
Their approach isn’t without flaws – mostly technical ones –- and in fact economists still don’t have a clear answer to the question about the minimum wage that I posed earlier in this article. But because of Card, Krueger and their research, the debate over the minimum wage has gotten a lot less theoretical and much more empirical.
Using models to study behavior
Unlike in medicine or other sciences, economists cannot conduct rigidly controlled clinical trials, a method vacinologists used to test the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Due to financial, ethical or practical constraints, we cannot easily split people into treatment or control groups – as is common in psychology. And we cannot randomly assign a higher minimum wage to some and not others and observe what will happen, which is how a biomedical scientist might study the impact of various treatments on human health.

The minimum wage has gained momentum among policymakers as a way to alleviate rising wage and income inequality. Much of the debate over this policy centers on whether raising the minimum wage causes job loss, as well as the potential magnitude of those losses. Recent research shows conflicting evidence on both sides of the issue. In general, the evidence suggests that it is appropriate to weigh the cost of potential job losses from a higher minimum wage against the benefits of wage increases for other workers.
Lessons for Emerging Economies – This paper offers evidence on the relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment and informal employment, and identifies some of the lessons learned on the potential effects of increasing the minimum wage. Most of the evidence suggests that sizable increases in the minimum wage are likely to exacerbate unemployment and the prevalence of informal employment, which could have negative consequences for labor productivity and businesses as a result of reduced investment in employee training and loss of productive workers. This outcome occurs when businesses adopt the main channels available for absorbing increased labor costs. The majority of the empirical evidence suggests that the effects of minimum wage increases on unemployment and the demand for labor are unclear. The outcome depends in large part on the specific characteristics of the labor markets and the degree of compliance with the minimum wage law. Most of those affected by minimum wage increases are less qualified workers. In Latin American and Asia, differences in the effects of minimum wage increases depend largely on the size and type of firms. In countries with high levels of informal employment, minimum wage increases can increase informal employment, since the formal workers who lose their jobs are absorbed by the informal sector of the economy. In general, businesses have five mechanisms for absorbing the added labor costs. Given the characteristics of the labor market in emerging economies, it is likely that businesses faced with increased labor costs will resort to less than optimal channels, which will tend to affect their productivity and the labor market in general.

How Higher Minimum Wages Impact Employment – A study recently published in the American Economic Review provides new evidence that increases in the minimum wage reduce employment in the long run.
But increases in the supply of labor are different. Unlike tomatoes, an increase in labor may also affect the demand for labor. This could occur for two reasons. First, more people can mean more demand for products already being produced. That, in turn, means established firms would need to expand to meet the increase in demand.
Does increasing the minimum wage lead to higher prices?
This working paper shows by using monthly price series that the pass-through effect is entirely concentrated on the month that the minimum wage change goes into effect, and is much smaller than what the canonical literature has found.
Historically, minimum wage increases were large, one-shot changes imposed with little advance notice for businesses. But many recent state and city-level minimum wage increases have been scheduled to be implemented over time and often are indexed to some measure of price inflation. These small, scheduled minimum wage hikes seem to have smaller effects on prices than large, one-time increases.
By looking at changes in restaurant food pricing during the period of 1978–2015, MacDonald and Nilsson find that prices rose by just 0. 36 percent for every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, which is only about half the size reported in previous studies. They also observe that small minimum wage increases do not lead to higher prices and may actually reduce prices. Furthermore, it is also possible that small minimum wage increases could lead to increased employment in low-wage labor markets.

[FAQ]
What is the effect of minimum wage on employment?
According to one view, minimum wages increase the cost of labour above the marginal productivity of low-paid workers and thus prices them out of the market.
Does employment increase with minimum wage?
States with a minimum wage of more than $12 an hour saw industrywide employment growth of 25 percent, compared with only 7 percent growth in states still using the federal minimum of $7.25.
What is the relationship between minimum wage and unemployment?
Although it reduces demand for labor by raising the marginal cost of employing a new worker, a higher minimum wage increases the gap between the expected returns to employment relative to unemployment, inducing additional search effort from unemployed workers.
Why does an increase in minimum wage increase unemployment?
The single largest problem with increases to the minimum wage is that they result in higher unemployment for low-skilled workers and young people. Put simply, increases in the minimum wage increase labour costs to employers who respond by reducing the number of employees and/or the number of hours worked.
References:
Current research finds that increases in the minimum wage reduce both hiring and layoffs almost equally; both labor force participation rates and unemployment appear to increase slightly with increases in the minimum wage.

How the Minimum Wage Impacts Unemployment
Would raising the minimum wage for workers mean fewer jobs overall?

Ever since the federal minimum wage was established in 1938 at 25 cents an hour, politicians have debated whether it's good or bad for overall employment. Today, that debate often centers on proposals to raise the minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 an hour at the federal level. 1
Key Takeaways
The minimum wage has been a political issue since its inception in the 1930s.
Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that it will cause unemployment, while proponents say it could boost consumer spending, resulting in more jobs.
In addition to the federal minimum wage, many cities, counties, states, and employers have established their own minimum wages. 2
Advantages and Disadvantages of a Higher Minimum Wage
On one side of the debate is the argument that if workers are paid more, employers will hire fewer of them: A higher minimum wage—while good for some workers— would have a negative effect on total employment, with fewer jobs to go around, especially for the low-skilled. Higher wages would also eat into profits, hurting both employers and, in the case of publicly held companies, their shareholders .
On the other side, there's the argument that any increase in pay would not only put more money in workers' pockets but also give a boost to consumer spending and benefit many of those very employers. Plus, employers would be able to retain employees for longer and save on the cost of hiring and training new ones.
In addition, higher minimum wage advocates contend that the minimum wage needs to rise considerably just to keep workers and their families out of poverty and avert the personal and societal problems that poverty is known to cause. 3
How Much Is the Minimum Wage Today?
The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour has remained unchanged since July 2009. 1 That works out to $290 for a 40-hour week and $14,500 for a 50-week year.
As an annual salary, that's $910 over the federal poverty level of $13,590 per year for a one-person household in every state but Alaska and Hawaii, where the poverty level is set higher. For a two-person household, the poverty level is $18,310. 4 So, for example, a single mother with one child who works full time for the federal minimum wage is earning less than $3,810 of a poverty-level income.
For people who make the minimum wage for a brief period but later move on to better-paying work—the classic example is teenagers in fast-food jobs who live with their parents—the low minimum wage may not be a major problem; however, for people with little expectation of higher-paid work, it's a significant issue.
States, Cities, and Counties Set Their Own Minimum Wages
Fortunately for many workers, 30 states plus the District of Columbia mandate minimum wages that are higher than the federal minimum. As of 2022, they ranged from $9 an hour in Nebraska to $15.20 in Washington, D.C. Some states, such as California, have varying minimum wages depending on the number of employees. 5 6
The remaining states either match the federal level of $7.25, have no minimum wage at all, or set their level below the federal one—$5.15 in the case of both Georgia and Wyoming. 7 In states with no minimum wage or a lower one, the federal minimum wage applies to most workers. 8
In 2022, 26 states are raising their minimum wages. As of Jan. 1, 2022, 22 of these states implemented the increase. 9
Some cities and counties —57 in all, as of Nov. 24, 2021, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center—have also established their own minimum wages. 10 For example, Chicago's minimum wage is currently $15 for employers with 21 or more workers, compared with $12 for the state of Illinois. 11 12
In many of these states, cities, and counties, the minimum wage is scheduled to rise automatically in future years. For example, Florida residents voted in November 2020 to increase the state's minimum wage incrementally (beginning at $10 per hour on Sept. 30, 2021 and going up $1 each year on that date) until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026. 13
Some Employers Are Also Establishing Minimum Wages
Apart from what legislators are doing, some large employers have taken it upon themselves to establish company wide minimum wages in recent years. Those include big retailers such as Amazon (average of $18 per hour), 14 Costco ($17), 15 and Walmart (an average of $18 or higher for total compensation and benefits, depending on the location and position). 16
Hourly wages are, of course, only part of the equation. Another factor is hours of work. If an employer raises its workers' wages but cuts back on their hours—as anecdotal reports suggest some employers have—workers may see little or no benefit on payday. 17
What Would a National $15 Minimum Wage Mean?
There have also been initiatives in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage. The Raise the Wage Act of 2019, for example, would increase the level in a series of steps until it reached $15 in 2025. In subsequent years it would be indexed to keep pace with median wage growth. 18 The bill passed the House in July 2019 but was not passed by the Senate. 19
How would such an increase affect overall employment? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) examined that question in a report published in July 2019 titled "The Effects on Employment and Family Income of Increasing the Federal Minimum Wage." It predicted what would happen if the minimum wage were raised in annual increments from 2020 to 2025, at which point it would reach either $10, $12, or $15. 20
A $10 minimum— According to the CBO's projections, the $10 minimum wage would raise earnings for up to 3.5 million workers and "have virtually no effect on employment." Nor would it have an appreciable impact on the number of people in poverty. 21
A $12 minimum— The $12 minimum wage would benefit up to 11 million workers while reducing overall employment by an estimated 300,000 jobs. The number of people whose annual incomes fell below the poverty threshold in 2025 would be reduced by 400,000. 21
A $15 minimum— Finally, the $15 minimum wage would benefit up to 27 million workers but cost an estimated 1.3 million jobs. At the same time, a similar number of people (1.3 million) would see their annual incomes rise above the poverty threshold. 22
Congressional Budget Office data suggests that raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10 would have a negligible effect on overall employment, while a higher minimum wage would involve trade-offs. 23
So, in the CBO's judgment, raising the minimum wage up to a certain point doesn't result in greater unemployment, but beyond that point, higher wages could mean fewer jobs. The tricky part, of course, is determining just where that point is.
Perhaps not surprisingly, think tanks across the political spectrum have drawn their own conclusions from the CBO report while also disputing some of its estimates. The conservative American Enterprise Institute, for example, maintains that the CBO "overstates the poverty-reducing effects" of a $15 minimum wage, while the progressive Economic Policy Institute says the report "substantially overstates the costs" in terms of job losses. 24 25
What Is the Federal Minimum Wage?
The federal minimum wage is $7.25; however, many states, cities, and municipalities have a higher minimum wage. Many companies have also established a higher minimum wage than the federal wage. 1 26 6
Is the Minimum Wage Meant to Be a Living Wage?
When the minimum wage was established under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, he intended for it to be more than "a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living." So, yes, the minimum wage is meant to be a living wage, which today it is not. 27
Does Increasing the Minimum Wage Increase Unemployment?
Increasing the minimum wage does have the risk of increasing unemployment, depending on the increase of the wage. The thought process is that increasing the minimum wage would increase the costs for businesses, resulting in them hiring fewer workers.
The Bottom Line
Raising the minimum wage has positive impacts, such as bringing people out of poverty and increasing income for individuals and families; however, increasing the minimum wage can also lead to increased unemployment, depending on the wage increase, because employers would seek automation as opposed to hiring workers.
Determining the right minimum wage increase that benefits larger parts of the population while keeping unemployment static is the key goal.

Alright, so I've got these search results to help me understand why we should increase the minimum wage. Let's dive into them one by one.

First up, there's an article from Forbes about the impact of increasing the minimum wage on employment. The author, Adam A. Millsap, seems to be arguing that increasing the minimum wage can lead to fewer employment opportunities for lower-skilled workers. He mentions a study that found a negative correlation between wage increases and employment rates in the long run. Specifically, a 1% increase in wages could lead to a 0.3% to 1% decrease in employment rates, depending on whether the wage increase is city-wide or in just one industry.

He also points out that the negative effects are mainly due to more firms closing rather than laying off workers. This makes sense because higher wages increase costs for businesses, and if they can't pass those costs onto consumers or find ways to become more efficient, they might have to shut down. This seems like a valid concern, especially for small businesses that have thinner margins.

But, Millsap also acknowledges that higher minimum wages might not necessarily be bad policy, but there are costs associated with them. So, it's important to weigh these costs against the benefits.

Moving on to the second document, which is from PayPerVids, it's a review of literature on the effects of minimum wage on employment. It talks about the difference between supply-side and demand-side economists. Supply-side economists believe that increasing minimum wage leads to higher unemployment among youth and unskilled workers, while demand-side economists think it reduces poverty and underemployment.

The author mentions a study by Neumark and Wascher (2007) that found two-thirds of the entries they reviewed indicated a negative relationship between employment and minimum wage. However, the author also notes that studies showing zero or positive effects used shorter panel data, which might not capture the full impact over time.

Then there's the famous study by Card and Krueger (1994) on fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which found no evidence that raising the minimum wage to $5.00 per hour in New Jersey led to reduced employment. In fact, they observed an increase in employment. But, Neumark and Wascher reevaluated this study using payroll records and found that employment actually decreased in New Jersey relative to Pennsylvania.

This discrepancy highlights the challenges in studying the effects of minimum wage increases. Different methodologies can lead to different conclusions, and it's crucial to consider the quality and breadth of the data.

The third document is an essay from GradesFixer about the impacts of minimum wage on jobs, families, businesses, and economic growth. The author argues that increasing the minimum wage won't significantly affect unemployment, but it might reduce incentives for people to pursue higher education since they could earn the same as college graduates.

This is an interesting point. If the minimum wage is set too high, it might discourage people from getting additional education or skills, knowing they can earn a living wage without further qualifications. This could have long-term implications for the skill level of the workforce and economic growth.

However, I'm a bit skeptical about this argument because, in reality, higher education usually leads to higher earnings over a lifetime, even if starting wages are similar. Also, the idea that someone with a master's degree would end up in a minimum wage job seems unlikely unless there are extraordinary circumstances.

The essay also points out that minimum wage workers are predominantly young people, and it suggests that minimum wage isn't intended to support families. While this may have been the case historically, in many places today, a significant number of adults rely on minimum wage jobs to support themselves and their families. So, this perspective might be outdated.

The fourth document is from Library of Career and discusses various articles and studies on the effects of increasing the minimum wage. It mentions a CBO report that estimates raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would cost 1.4 million jobs by 2025 but would also lift nearly a million people out of poverty.

This seems like a mixed outcome. While there would be job losses, there would also be significant gains in reducing poverty. It's a trade-off that policymakers need to consider.

Another article mentioned is about how raising the minimum wage to $15 wouldn't cost 1.4 million jobs, questioning the CBO's estimate. This suggests that there's ongoing debate about the accuracy of such projections.

There's also a testimony supporting the Raise the Wage Act, which proposes gradually increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025. The argument is that this would be beneficial for workers, businesses, and the economy as a whole.

Contrasting this, there's research suggesting that when minimum wages increase, some employers may cut hours or benefits, leading to lower overall compensation for workers.

Another piece argues that higher minimum wages support job growth, especially in recovering from economic downturns like the one caused by COVID-19. It suggests that states with higher minimum wages have added more jobs in 2021.

There's also a discussion on how the minimum wage impacts unemployment, with some experts arguing that raising it could lead to higher unemployment, while others believe the effect is minimal or non-existent.

Lastly, the fifth document is from Investopedia, providing an overview of how the minimum wage impacts unemployment. It presents both sides of the argument: those who think raising the minimum wage leads to fewer jobs and those who believe it boosts consumer spending, which could create more jobs.

Investopedia mentions that the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, but many states, cities, and employers have higher minimum wages. It also notes that some large employers have voluntarily set higher minimum wages for their workers.

The CBO's report is cited again, showing that a $15 minimum wage could reduce employment by 1.3 million jobs but lift 1.3 million people out of poverty.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that raising the minimum wage has both potential benefits and drawbacks. On one hand, it can increase the standard of living for low-wage workers and reduce poverty. It might also stimulate the economy by increasing consumer spending. On the other hand, it could lead to job losses, especially in industries with low profit margins, and potentially discourage businesses from hiring.

However, the extent of these effects varies depending on how much the minimum wage is increased and how quickly it's implemented. Gradual increases might give businesses more time to adjust, perhaps through increased productivity or slight price increases, without having to lay off workers.

Moreover, the quality of the research matters. Some studies show negative employment effects, while others do not. Methodological differences and the specific contexts in which the studies are conducted can influence the results.

Considering all this, I think the argument for increasing the minimum wage is stronger when it comes to improving the lives of low-wage workers and reducing poverty, provided that the increase is gradual and allows businesses time to adapt. Additionally, pairing a minimum wage increase with other policies like training programs for workers and support for small businesses could mitigate potential negative effects.

In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the impact on employment, the benefits of raising the minimum wage, particularly for reducing poverty and inequality, seem to outweigh the costs, especially if implemented thoughtfully.

\boxed{\text{Increasing the minimum wage is beneficial for reducing poverty and improving living standards, provided it is implemented gradually and supported by complementary policies.}}
