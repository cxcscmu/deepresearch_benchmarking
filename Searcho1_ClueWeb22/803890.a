I'm trying to understand why animals become endangered. I know that there are many species out there, and some of them are at risk of disappearing. But what exactly causes this? I think there are probably multiple factors involved. Maybe it has something to do with their habitats being destroyed, or maybe it's because of hunting or pollution. I need to think this through carefully.

First off, what does it mean for an animal to be endangered? I believe it means that the species is at risk of becoming extinct, meaning there are so few of them left that they might not survive into the future. So, why does that happen?

One thing that comes to mind is habitat loss. Animals need places to live, breed, and find food. If their natural habitats are destroyed or altered in ways that they can't adapt to, they might not be able to survive. For example, deforestation removes the homes of many forest-dwelling animals, leaving them without shelter and resources.

Another factor could be hunting and poaching. Humans have hunted animals for various reasons, including food, fur, and traditional medicines. Sometimes, this hunting is regulated, but when it's excessive or illegal, it can decimate animal populations.

Pollution is also a significant issue. Chemicals, plastics, and other pollutants can contaminate an animal's environment, making it hard for them to survive. For instance, oil spills can devastate marine life, and air pollution can affect birds and other creatures.

Climate change is another major threat. As global temperatures rise, it affects ecosystems and can make certain areas uninhabitable for some species. Animals that are adapted to specific temperature ranges may struggle to survive if those conditions change.

In addition to these, there's also the issue of invasive species. When non-native species are introduced to an ecosystem, either deliberately or accidentally, they can outcompete native species for resources, leading to a decline in the native population.

Disease can also play a role. Sometimes, diseases can spread rapidly through a population, especially if the animals have no natural immunity to them.

Lastly, I think that lack of genetic diversity can make a species more vulnerable. If there aren't many individuals left, inbreeding can occur, leading to health problems and a reduced ability to adapt to changes in their environment.

So, to sum it up, animals become endangered due to a combination of factors including habitat loss, overhunting, pollution, climate change, invasive species, disease, and lack of genetic diversity. It's likely that for any given endangered species, multiple these factors are at play.

I should probably look into this a bit more to confirm my thoughts. Maybe there's more to it than what I've considered so far.

Let me try to find some reliable sources to back this up.

Why Do Animals Become Endangered?
Updated February 21, 2017 | Factmonster Staff
Humans are largely responsible when animals become extinct, endangered or threatened. Here are some reasons why animals become endangered:
Destruction of Habitat
Humans destroy precious habitat--the natural environment of a living thing--when they fill swamps and marshes, dam rivers and cut down trees to build homes, roads and other developments.
Pollution
Oil spills, acid rain and water pollution have been devastating for many species of fish and birds.
Hunting and Fishing
Many animals are over-hunted because their meat, fur and other parts are very valuable.
Exotic Species
When animals or plants arrive into a new habitat from a foreign place they sometimes introduce diseases that the native species can't fight. These "exotic" species can also prey on the native species.

When an animal species is considered endangered, it means that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has evaluated it as nearly extinct, which means that a significant portion of its range has already died off and the rate of birth is lower than the species' death rate.
Today, more and more animal and plant species are on the verge of extinction because of a variety of major factors that cause a species to become endangered, and as you might expect, humans play a role in quite a few of them. In fact, the biggest threat to endangered animals is human encroachment on their habitats. 1
Fortunately, conservation efforts around the world are bent on helping these endangered animals revitalize their dwindling populations through a variety of humanitarian efforts, including curtailing illegal poaching, halting pollution, and habitat destruction, and curtailing the introduction of exotic species into new habitats.
Habitat Destruction
Every living organism needs a place to live, but a habitat is not just a residence, it is also where an animal finds food, raises its young and allows the next generation to take over. Unfortunately, humans destroy animal habitats in a number of different ways: building houses, clearing forests to get lumber and plant crops, draining rivers to bring water to those crops, and paving over meadows to make streets and parking lots.
Habitat destruction is the number one reason for animal endangerment, which is why conservation groups work diligently to reverse the effects of human developments. 1 Many non-profit groups like the Nature Conservancy clean up coastlines and establish nature preserves to prevent further harm to native environments and species around the world.
Pollution
In addition to physical encroachment, human development of animals' habitats pollutes the natural landscape with petroleum products, pesticides, and other chemicals, which destroy food sources and viable shelters for the creatures and plants of that area.
As a result, some species die outright while others are pushed into areas where they can't find food and shelter. Worse yet, when one animal population suffers it affects many other species in its food web so more than one species' population is likely to decline.
Introduction of Exotic Species
An exotic species is an animal, plant, or insect that is introduced into a place where it did not evolve naturally. Exotic species often have a predatory or competitive advantage over native species, which have been a part of a particular biological environment for centuries, because even though native species are well adapted to their surroundings, they may not be able to deal with species that closely compete with them for food. Basically, native species haven't developed natural defenses for an exotic species and vice versa.
One example of endangerment due to both competition and predation is the Galápagos tortoise. Non-native goats were introduced to the Galápagos Islands during the 20th century. These goats fed on the tortoises' food supply, causing the number of tortoises to decline rapidly. Because the tortoises could not defend themselves or stop the overpopulation of goats on the island, they were forced to abandon their native feeding grounds. 2
Many countries have passed laws banning specific exotic species known to endanger native habitats from entering the country. Exotic species are sometimes referred to as invasive species, especially in cases of banning them. For instance, the United Kingdom has placed raccoons, mongooses, and cabbages on their invasive species list, all of which are barred from entering the country. 3
Illegal Hunting and Fishing
When hunters ignore rules that regulate the number of animals that should be hunted (a practice known as poaching), they can reduce populations to the point that species become endangered. Unfortunately, poachers are often hard to catch because they are deliberately trying to evade authorities, and they operate in areas where enforcement is weak.
Furthermore, poachers have developed sophisticated techniques for smuggling animals. Baby bears, leopards, and monkeys have been sedated and stuffed into suitcases for transport. Live animals have been sold to people who want exotic pets or medical research subjects. And, animal pelts and other body parts are also secretly smuggled across borders and sold through black market networks of buyers who pay high prices for illegal animal products.
Even legal hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild species can lead to population reductions that cause species to become endangered. A lack of restriction on the whaling industry in the 20th century is one example. It wasn't until several whale species were nearing extinction that countries agreed to abide by an international moratorium. 4 Some whale species have rebounded thanks to this moratorium but others remain at risk.
International laws forbid these practices, and there are a number of government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) whose sole purpose is to stop illegal poaching, especially of animals like elephants and rhinoceroses. Thanks to the efforts of groups like the International Anti-Poaching Foundation and local conservation groups like the PAMS Foundation in Tanzania, these endangered species have human advocates fighting to protect them from outright extinction.
Natural Causes
Of course, species endangerment and extinction can happen without human interference. Extinction is a natural part of evolution. Fossil records show that long before people came along, factors such as overpopulation, competition, sudden climatic change, and catastrophic events like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes drove the decline of numerous species.
Determining Which Species Are at Risk
There are a few warning signs that a species could become extinct. If a species has some economic importance, such as the Atlantic salmon, it may be at risk. Surprisingly, large predators, who we might expect to have an advantage over other species, are often at risk as well. This list includes grizzly bears, bald eagles, and gray wolves .
A species whose gestational period is lengthy, or who have small numbers of offspring at each birth has the potential to become endangered more readily. The mountain gorilla and California condor are two examples. And species with weak genetic makeup, like manatees or giant pandas, have more risk of extinction with each generation.

What Are the Causes of Animals Becoming Endangered?
•••
Updated November 22, 2019
By David Chandler
Although natural forces can destroy or strain an animal population, increasingly the activities of man have caused a large numbers of animals to become endangered. Admittedly some animals and plants, especially domesticated ones such as crops, livestock, and pets, have benefited and even flourished from the alterations man has made to the world. However, some animal populations have been placed under tremendous pressure as the result of these changes and, in some cases, the populations are dropping to significantly lower levels. Small populations or organisms with a limited distribution are extremely sensitive to the factors causing endangerment, whether one relies on the ordinary sense of the word or the endangered species definition embodied in federal law.
Loss of Habitat
One of the most significant causes of endangered animals is habitat loss. While habitat may be lost due to natural forces (climate shifts, geologic changes), much of the habitat lost today is due to human activity. The construction of dams, highways, canals, urbanization, and agriculture dramatically affect the inhabitants of native ecosystems. Even when portions of the ecosystem remain intact creating “islands,” the resulting habitat may be too small or too widely dispersed to support a species.
Invasive Species
Invasive species are one of the key biotic reasons for animals being endangered. Many species arriving in a new ecosystem are ill-adapted and quickly die off. However, some species are able to exploit the ecosystem to the detriment of native organisms. Small ecosystems such as those on islands are significantly affected by the introduction of invasive species but even native continental and oceanic populations can be devastated through competition or predation by the invader.
Overexploitation of Resources
Overfishing a particular fish species is an obvious and direct cause for an animal to become endangered. But other organisms within the ecosystem may also be harmed (or benefitted) by the overexploitation of a particular species. For example, concern that the California sea otter was devastating the abalone population led to indiscriminate killing of the sea otters, altering the balance of the biotic competition between several organisms. The reduction of sea otters led to an explosion in the population of sea urchins which grazed upon the hold fasts of kelp. As the kelp broke free of the bottom and washed ashore, organisms that depended on the kelp forests were placed under increased strain.
Pathogens and Disease
The spread of domesticated animals has also spread the diseases associated with them to new areas of the world. In some cases, the diseases infected native populations which had little resistance to the invading pathogen. These diseases may reach epidemic levels in the native population, decimating their numbers.
Environmental Pollution
Pollution in many forms has endangered many animals. Pesticides and other chemicals introduced to an ecosystem may significantly harm untargeted species. For example, DDT used to fight mosquitoes was eventually linked to declines in the reproductive rates of birds. Other forms of pollution such as thermal, light and noise pollution can each reduce survival rates of local animal populations.

Many wild animals have become endangered.Why has this happened? What can goverments do to stop from continuing to happen.
Numurous species of wild animals are now endangered. For example, the number of black rhinos has declined from over 65, 000 in the 1960s to just 2, 500 today. Sea animals like some types of whale are also at risk. In this essay I will look at some of the causes of the situations. I will then move on to consider what goverments can do to deal with this problem. It is clear that animals are dying out becouse of human activity. People have hunted animals for sport or for their fur, horns or other body parts. For instance, they hunted tigers for their bones, which were used for medicine. Another reason for species to become extict is that humans have destroyed their natural habits. One example of this is gorillas in the rainforest, which are now endangered. Finally, pollution from industry has created problems for many sea creatures. Goverments can help in several ways. First of all they need to make strong laws and give puneshment to those who hunt illegally. Next, they need education programmes in schools and on telivision to help everyone understand the problem. Finally goverments should invest in renewable and clean energy sources such as solar and wind power. So, in conclusion, we can say that hunting and damageto the envirovment are the main threals that animals face. Goverment should use the law, educatiopn and clean energy to improve the stuation. Everyone must work together to save endangerd animals

Endangered Animals: How They Become Extinct

Back to Animals
Species of animals or organisms are considered extinct when there are no more of them alive. Animals that are classified as "endangered" are at risk of becoming extinct.
Some animals are considered extinct in the wild. This means that the only surviving members of the species live in captivity, like in a zoo.
Animals become extinct for a variety of reasons. Today many animals are endangered or have become extinct due to the influence of humans. Some of the ways that animals become extinct are described below.
Natural Forces
Over the course of history many species have become extinct. This is part of the natural process. Species may become extinct because of changes in climate (i.e. the ice age), competition with other species, a reduced food supply, or combinations of all of these.
Most natural extinctions are isolated events that happen over a fairly long period of time. Some, however, are major events that can cause mass extinctions and happen quickly. Perhaps the most famous of these was the extinction of the dinosaurs, which may have been due to a large meteorite striking the Earth.
Human Interaction
Today many conservationists are concerned with human interaction causing species to become extinct. This is because human interaction has increased the rate of extinctions beyond what normally should occur in nature. More extinctions reduces the planet's biodiversity and can have adverse affects for all life on Earth.
Hunting
Many species have been hunted to extinction or to the point where they are critically endangered. One example of this is the American Bison. There were millions of bison in the Great Plains of North America until the arrival of the Europeans. Hunting was so intense that only a few hundred were left by the time the animals became protected. Fortunately, they have survived on farms and ranches and are no longer endangered.
Species that live only on islands can also be easily hunted to extinction. Even the arrival of a small tribe can quickly eliminate an island species.

Furs, Skins, Feathers, Horns
Besides food, animals are often hunted for specific body parts like their fur, feathers, or horns. Sometimes these animals are the top predators and, therefore, do not have a large population to begin with. These species can be quickly hunted to extinction.
In Africa, the elephant was heavily hunted for its prized ivory horns. The population went from many millions to a few hundred thousand. Today the elephant is protected, but the population continues to drop in some areas due to poachers.
Another example is the tiger in China. The tiger was nearly hunted to extinction for both its valuable fur as well as its bones, which were traditionally used for medicine. Today it remains classified as an endangered species.
Loss of Habitat
One of the main threats to animals today is loss of habitat. This comes from the expansion of humans, especially from agriculture. As vast areas of land are cultivated to grow food, natural habitats are destroyed. This can destroy many of the cycles of life necessary for organisms to survive and for biomes to thrive.
Pollution
Pollution from humans can kill off a species as well. This is especially true in fresh water biomes such as rivers and lakes. Sewage and run-off from industrial plants can poison the water. When one species is affected, other species can die off as well causing a chain reaction as the balance of the ecosystem is destroyed.
Introduced Species
When a new species of plant or animal is brought into an ecosystem it can become invasive, quickly taking over and killing off other species. It may also destroy an important part of the food chain causing many other species to suffer.

Alright, I've got some information from these documents. Let's see what they say about why animals become endangered.

From Doc 1, it mentions that humans are largely responsible for animals becoming extinct, endangered, or threatened. It lists several reasons: destruction of habitat, pollution, hunting and fishing, and introduction of exotic species. It also mentions disease, but that seems to be related to exotic species.

Doc 2 delves deeper into these causes. Habitat destruction is the number one reason, due to human developments like building houses, clearing forests, and paving over meadows. Pollution from oil spills, acid rain, and water pollution harms many species. Illegal hunting and fishing, especially poaching, reduces animal populations. Introduction of exotic species can outcompete native species for resources or introduce diseases.

Doc 3 reiterates these points, adding that natural causes like overpopulation, competition, climate change, and catastrophic events can also lead to endangerment. It also notes that some species are more at risk due to their economic importance, being large predators, having low reproductive rates, or poor genetic diversity.

Doc 4 seems to be an essay about endangered animals, probably for an exam or assignment. It mentions hunting, habitat destruction, and pollution as causes, and suggests that governments can help by making laws against illegal hunting, educating the public, and investing in clean energy.

Doc 5 is about how animals become extinct, focusing on both natural and human-induced causes. Natural causes include climate change, competition, and reduced food supplies. Human influences include hunting for food, fur, feathers, or horns, loss of habitat due to agriculture, pollution, and introduction of invasive species.

So, synthesizing this information, the main reasons animals become endangered are:

1. **Habitat Destruction**: Due to human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture. This removes the places where animals live and find food.

2. **Pollution**: Chemicals, oils, and other pollutants harm animals directly and contaminate their environments.

3. **Overhunting and Poaching**: Especially for valuable parts like fur, horns, or bones. This reduces populations faster than they can reproduce.

4. **Introduction of Exotic Species**: These can outcompete native species for resources or introduce new diseases.

5. **Natural Causes**: Such as climate change, competition, and catastrophic events, though human impacts are often more significant today.

Additionally, factors like low reproductive rates, small population sizes, and poor genetic diversity make some species more vulnerable to these threats.

It's clear that human activities are the primary drivers of endangerment today. Governments and conservation organizations play crucial roles in protecting endangered species through laws, education, and habitat preservation.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Animals become endangered primarily due to habitat destruction, pollution, overhunting, introduction of exotic species, and natural causes exacerbated by human activities.}}
