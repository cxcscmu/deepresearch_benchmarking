So I've got this question: "Are nuclear hazards any different from other hazards we accept every day?" Hmm, that's an interesting one. I guess the first thing I need to do is understand what nuclear hazards are and compare them to other common hazards that people accept as part of daily life.

First off, what are nuclear hazards? From what I know, nuclear hazards typically involve radiation or radioactive materials, which can come from nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, medical treatments, or even natural sources like radon gas. The main concern with these hazards is exposure to ionizing radiation, which can cause damage to living tissues and increase the risk of cancer and other health problems.

Now, comparing that to other everyday hazards, what comes to mind? Well, there are traffic accidents, for one. Every time we get in a car or cross the street, there's a small risk involved. There's also the risk of slipping and falling at home, or getting sick from eating contaminated food. These are all hazards that most people accept as part of normal life, probably because the risks are relatively low, or the benefits outweigh the risks.

So, are nuclear hazards different from these? Let me think about some key differences.

First, the potential impact of a nuclear hazard can be much greater than that of a typical everyday hazard. A single nuclear accident, like Chernobyl or Fukushima, can affect large areas and have long-lasting consequences for public health and the environment. In contrast, most everyday hazards affect individuals or small groups at a time.

Second, nuclear hazards often involve risks that are not immediately apparent. Radiation can't be seen, smelled, or felt, so people might not even know they're being exposed to it until years later when health problems arise. This is different from, say, crossing the street, where the risk is more immediate and visible.

Third, the consequences of nuclear hazards can be intergenerational. Radioactive waste can remain hazardous for thousands of years, posing risks to future generations. This adds a temporal dimension to the risk that isn't present in many other hazards we accept every day.

On the other hand, some might argue that nuclear hazards are no different from other risks that society accepts for the greater good. For example, we accept the risk of air travel because it provides significant benefits in terms of connectivity and efficiency. Similarly, nuclear power provides a source of energy that is relatively low in carbon emissions, which could be beneficial for combating climate change.

But even so, there are some unique aspects to nuclear risks that make them stand out. For instance, the potential for catastrophic failure in nuclear power plants, despite stringent safety measures, cannot be entirely eliminated. Additionally, the military use of nuclear weapons introduces an entirely different level of risk, with potentially global consequences.

Moreover, the way society perceives nuclear risks might also play a role. There's often a lot of fear and misinformation surrounding nuclear issues, which can amplify the perceived danger beyond the actual statistical risk. This phenomenon is sometimes called "nuclearophobia."

I wonder if there are any studies or research on how people perceive nuclear risks compared to other risks. Maybe looking into some psychology or risk assessment literature would help here.

Risk perception
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Factors of risk perceptions
Risk perception is the subjective judgement that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk.[1] [2] [3] Risk perceptions are different for the real risks since they are affected by a wide range of affective (emotions, feelings, moods, etc.), cognitive (gravity of events, media coverage, risk-mitigating measures, etc.), contextual (framing of risk information, availability of alternative information sources, etc.), and individual (personality traits, previous experience, age, etc.) factors. [3] Several theories have been proposed to explain why different people make different estimates of the dangerousness of risks. [4] [5] Three major families of theory have been developed: psychology approaches (heuristics and cognitive), anthropology/sociology approaches (cultural theory) and interdisciplinary approaches (social amplification of risk framework).

Early theories[edit]
The study of risk perception arose out of the observation that experts and lay people often disagreed about how risky various technologies and natural hazards were.
The mid 1960s saw the rapid rise of nuclear technologies and the promise of clean and safe energy.  However, public perception shifted against this new technology.  Fears of both longitudinal dangers to the environment and immediate disasters creating radioactive wastelands turned the public against this new technology.  The scientific and governmental communities asked why public perception was against the use of nuclear energy when all the scientific experts were declaring how safe it really was.  The problem, as non-experts perceived it, was a difference between scientific facts and an exaggerated public perception of the dangers. [6]
A key early paper was written in 1969 by Chauncey Starr.[7] Starr used a revealed preference approach to find out what risks are considered acceptable by society. He assumed that society had reached equilibrium in its judgment of risks, so whatever risk levels actually existed in society were acceptable. His major finding was that people will accept risks 1,000 times greater if they are voluntary (e.g. driving a car) than if they are involuntary (e.g. a nuclear disaster).
This early approach assumed that individuals behave rationally by weighing information before making a decision, and that individuals have exaggerated fears due to inadequate or incorrect information. Implied in this assumption is that additional information can help people understand true risk and hence lessen their opinion of danger. [6] While researchers in the engineering school did pioneer research in risk perception, by adapting theories from economics, it has little use in a practical setting. Numerous studies have rejected the belief that additional information alone will shift perceptions. [8]
Psychological approach[edit]
The psychological approach began with research in trying to understand how people process information.  These early works maintained that people use cognitive heuristics in sorting and simplifying information, leading to biases in comprehension.  Later work built on this foundation and became the psychometric paradigm. This approach identifies numerous factors responsible for influencing individual perceptions of risk, including dread, novelty, stigma, and other factors. [9]
Research also shows that risk perceptions are influenced by the emotional state of the perceiver. [10] The valence theory  of risk perception only differentiates between positive emotions, such as happiness and optimism, and negative ones, such as fear and anger.  According to valence theory, positive emotions lead to optimistic risk perceptions whereas negative emotions influence a more pessimistic view of risk. [11]
Research also has found that, whereas risk and benefit tend to be positively correlated across hazardous activities in the world, they are negatively correlated in people's minds and judgements. [12]
Heuristics and biases[edit]
The earliest psychometric research was done by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, who performed a series of gambling experiments to see how people evaluated probabilities. Their major finding was that people use a number of heuristics to evaluate information. These heuristics are usually useful shortcuts for thinking, but they may lead to inaccurate judgments in some situations – in which case they become cognitive biases .
Representativeness: is usually employed when people are asked to judge the probability that an object or event belongs to a class / processes by its similarity:
insensitivity to prior probability
insensitivity to sample size
misconception of chance
insensitivity to predictability
illusion of validity
misconception of regression
Availability heuristic: events that can be more easily brought to mind or imagined are judged to be more likely than events that could not easily be imagined:
biases due to retrievability of instances
biases due to the effectiveness of research set
biases of imaginability
illusory correlation
Anchoring and Adjustment heuristic: people will often start with one piece of known information and then adjust it to create an estimate of an unknown risk – but the adjustment will usually not be big enough:
insufficient adjustment
biases in the evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive event (conjunction fallacy)
anchoring in the assessment of subjective probability distributions
Asymmetry between gains and losses: People are risk averse with respect to gains, preferring a sure thing over a gamble with a higher expected utility but which presents the possibility of getting nothing. On the other hand, people will be risk-seeking about losses, preferring to hope for the chance of losing nothing rather than taking a sure, but smaller, loss (e.g. insurance ).
Threshold effects: People prefer to move from uncertainty to certainty over making a similar gain in certainty that does not lead to full certainty. For example, most people would choose a vaccine that reduces the incidence of disease A from 10% to 0% over one that reduces the incidence of disease B from 20% to 10%.
Another key finding was that the experts are not necessarily any better at estimating probabilities than lay people. Experts were often overconfident in the exactness of their estimates, and put too much stock in small samples of data. [13]
Cognitive Psychology[edit]
The majority of people in the public express a greater concern for problems which appear to possess an immediate effect on everyday life such as hazardous waste or pesticide-use than for long-term problems that may affect future generations such as climate change or population growth. [14] People greatly rely on the scientific community to assess the threat of environmental problems because they usually do not directly experience the effects of phenomena such as climate change. The exposure most people have to climate change has been impersonal; most people only have virtual experience through documentaries and news media in what may seem like a “remote” area of the world. [15] However, coupled with the population’s wait-and-see attitude, people do not understand the importance of changing environmentally destructive behaviors even when experts provide detailed and clear risks caused by climate change. [16]
Psychometric paradigm[edit]
Research within the psychometric paradigm turned to focus on the roles of affect, emotion, and stigma in influencing risk perception. Melissa Finucane and Paul Slovic have been among the key researchers here.  These researchers first challenged Starr's article by examining expressed preference – how much risk people say they are willing to accept. They found that, contrary to Starr's basic assumption, people generally saw most risks in society as being unacceptably high. They also found that the gap between voluntary and involuntary risks was not nearly as great as Starr claimed.
Slovic and team found that perceived risk is quantifiable and predictable.  People tend to view current risk levels as unacceptably high for most activities. [17] All things being equal, the greater people perceived a benefit, the greater the tolerance for a risk. [13] If a person derived pleasure from using a product, people tended to judge its benefits as high and its risks as low.  If the activity was disliked, the judgments were opposite. [18] Research in psychometrics has proven that risk perception is highly dependent on intuition, experiential thinking, and emotions.
Psychometric research identified a broad domain of characteristics that may be condensed into three high order factors: 1) the degree to which a risk is understood, 2) the degree to which it evokes a feeling of dread, and 3) the number of people exposed to the risk. A dread risk elicits visceral feelings of terror, uncontrollable, catastrophe, inequality, and uncontrolled. An unknown risk is new and unknown to science.  The more a person dreads an activity, the higher its perceived risk and the more that person wants the risk reduced. [13]
Anthropology/sociology approach[edit]
The anthropology/sociology approach posits risk perceptions as produced by and supporting social institutions. [19] In this view, perceptions are socially constructed by institutions, cultural values, and ways of life.
Cultural theory[edit]
One line of the Cultural Theory of risk is based on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas and political scientist Aaron Wildavsky first published in 1982. [20] In cultural theory, Douglas and Wildavsky outline four “ways of life” in a grid/group arrangement.  Each way of life corresponds to a specific social structure and a particular outlook on risk.  Grid categorizes the degree to which people are constrained and circumscribed in their social role.  The tighter binding of social constraints limits individual negotiation.  Group refers to the extent to which individuals are bounded by feelings of belonging or solidarity.  The greater the bonds, the less individual choice are subject to personal control. [21] Four ways of life include: Hierarchical, Individualist, Egalitarian, and Fatalist.
Risk perception researchers have not widely accepted this version of cultural theory.  Even Douglas says that the theory is controversial; it poses a danger of moving out of the favored paradigm of individual rational choice of which many researchers are comfortable. [22]
On the other hand, writers who drawn upon a broader cultural theory perspective have argued that risk-perception analysis helps understand the public response to terrorism in a way that goes far beyond 'rational choice'. As John Handmer and Paul James write:
In the area of embodied risk, people are not as fearful of themselves as perhaps they should be on the issues of illicit drug use, unsafe sex and so on. Yet with the compounding of both more abstract and more embodied risk this package appears to have met its goal to generate support for government policy. Fear of 'outsiders' and of a non-specific, invisible and uncontrollable threat was a powerful motivator in shaping perception. [23]
National Culture and Risk Survey[edit]
The First National Culture and Risk Survey of cultural cognition found that a person's worldview on the two social and cultural dimensions of "hierarchy-egalitarianism," and "individualism-solidarism" was predictive of their response to risk. [24]
Interdisciplinary approach[edit]
Social amplification of risk framework[edit]
The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), combines research in psychology, sociology, anthropology, and communications theory.  SARF outlines how communications of risk events pass from the sender through intermediate stations to a receiver and in the process serve to amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk.  All links in the communication chain, individuals, groups, media, etc., contain filters through which information is sorted and understood.
The framework attempts to explain the process by which risks are amplified, receiving public attention, or attenuated, receiving less public attention.  The framework may be used to compare responses from different groups in a single event, or analyze the same risk issue in multiple events.  In a single risk event, some groups may amplify their perception of risks while other groups may attenuate, or decrease, their perceptions of risk.
The main thesis of SARF states that risk events interact with individual psychological, social and other cultural factors in ways that either increase or decrease public perceptions of risk.  Behaviors of individuals and groups then generate secondary social or economic impacts while also increasing or decreasing the physical risk itself. [25]
These ripple effects caused by the amplification of risk include enduring mental perceptions, impacts on business sales, and change in residential property values, changes in training and education, or social disorder.  These secondary changes are perceived and reacted to by individuals and groups resulting in third-order impacts.  As each higher-order impacts are reacted to, they may ripple to other parties and locations.  Traditional risk analyses neglect these ripple effect impacts and thus greatly underestimate the adverse effects from certain risk events.  Public distortion of risk signals provides a corrective mechanism by which society assesses a fuller determination of the risk and its impacts to such things not traditionally factored into a risk analysis.

Abstract
The concept of risk is an outgrowth of our society's great concern about coping with the dangers of modern life. This book brings together the work of Paul Slovic, one of the world's leading analysts of risk, risk perception, and risk management, to examine the gap between expert views of risk and public perceptions. The chapters allow the reader to see the evolution of our understanding of such perceptions, from early studies identifying public misconceptions of risk to recent work that recognizes the importance and legitimacy of equity, trust, power, and other value-laden issues underlying public concerns. New methods for assessing perceptions of risk are described, and the implications for regulation and public policy are discussed. The issues covered include: societal risk taking; decision-making in mental health law; rating risks; facts versus fears; informing and educating the public about risk; intuitive toxicology; perceived risks and the politics of nuclear waste; perceived risk, trust, and democracy; and technological stigma.

Event Overview
Date/Time
TBD
Format
Online (Zoom Webinar)
Theme
Understanding Different Perspectives around Nuclear Risk Perception & Deterrence
Nuclear risk reduction efforts have gained traction among nuclear weapon states in recent years, with the hope of identifying long term risk reduction measures. The perception of risk, however, differs across the nuclear community: not only between nuclear weapon states themselves but also, between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states. The nuclear risk reduction discussion is connected to new technologies, deterrence, strategic stability, and nuclear disarmament.
At this event, experts will explore how states (both nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states) perceive and address nuclear risks. Speakers will also address how states can aim to eliminate and/or mitigate these risks and how they have done so in the past. Experts will discuss the level and type of risks that are acceptable (if any), manageable, or unacceptable.
This discussion will also address the critical relationship between deterrence and nuclear risk and within that, whether nuclear weapon states agree on the same parameters of nuclear deterrence – a discussion critical to mitigating nuclear risk. Experts will further explore the role played by emerging technologies and the challenges that these technologies may pose to the function of nuclear deterrence, the perception of nuclear risk, and risk mitigation.

1. Introduction
Nuclear power is considered one type of clean energy in China, who has the most ambitious nuclear power project in the world (Huang et al., 2018; Hao et al. 2019). The nuclear power plants (NPPs) not only generate electricity, but also provide heating in winter (World Nuclear News 2019) and produce hydrogen (Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, public acceptance of nuclear power has been one of the key challenges for the development of nuclear power after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident (Wu 2017 ). Wang et al. (2019) suggested that perceived risk played an important role in people's acceptance of nuclear power. In their study, perceived risk referred to people's perceptions of the uncertainty and the possible negative consequences. The respondents' perceived risk was measured by three statements and a Likert-type scale: “I am concerned about the effects of nuclear radiation exposure,” “The operation of an NPP and nuclear waste constitutes a continuous threat to human health and the environment,” and “Nuclear accident may occur and cause irreparable damages to large geographical areas and people.” Huang et al. (2018) also suggested a higher level of acceptance of nuclear power when people perceived lower risk. In their study, seven statements and a Likert-type scale were used to measure perceived risk: “I'm worried that an accident accompanied by environmental pollution, property loss, or health damage may occur in the NPP in the future,” “NPP accidents accompanied by environmental pollution, property loss, or health damage occur frequently,” “Within my lifetime, a severe NPP accident will eventually occur somewhere in the world, accompanied by serious health damage or massive property loss,” “a severe accident accompanied by serious health damage or massive property loss at an NPP will eventually occur in China as well,” “If you are a resident of the city constructing a nuclear power station, you feel very terrified,” “If a nuclear power accident happens in your city, the danger is catastrophic and dreadful to you,” and “The risk degree of NPP accidents is greater than that of traffic accidents .” Zhu et al. (2016) found that risk perception appeared to have significantly positive influences on anti-nuclear behavioral intentions. They measured risk perception using four items and a Likert-type scale: “the operation of the NPP brings threat to the health and life of the residents,” “The operation of the NPP bring threat to the future generations,” “Nuclear accident with significant property damage may occur in the NPP,” and “The NPP will increase the possibility of nuclear accidents.” All of the abovementioned statements are considered directly or indirectly related to radiation risks. Previous studies analyzed perceived risk, which included perceived radiological risk, but people's opinions did not seem well captured from the perspective of different perceived radiological risk. For example, when answering the Wang et al.‘s questionnaire (2019), they might agree that nuclear accident may occur and cause irreparable damage to large geographical areas and people because fear of radiation has hindered the reuse of once contaminated area (Stawkowski 2017 ). However, they might not agree that the operation of an NPP and nuclear waste constitutes a continuous threat to human health and the environment if they acknowledged the study that compared the health risks and beneﬁts of nuclear power and concluded that developing nuclear power is risk-beneﬁt feasible (Dai et al., 2019 ). As filling Huang et al.‘s questionnaire (2018), they might worry that an accident accompanied by environmental pollution, property loss, or health damage may occur in the NPP in the future, but they might not feel very terrified if they were residents of the city constructing a nuclear power station as most NPP neighbors have a favorable impression of the nearby plant and how it has operated recently. In addition, these favorable impressions of the nearby plant are constant over time (Ann Stouffer Bisconti, 2018 ). Regarding Zhu, Wei and Zhao's questionnaire (2016), they might consider the possibility of a serious nuclear accident as more unlikely than the public (Kivimäki and Kalimo 1993 ). However, they might consider that a nuclear accident—instead of the operation of an NPP—would bring threat to the health and life of the residents. The perceived risk in the previous studies may be interpreted differently by people with different perceived risk of radiation. Therefore, this study was intended to fill the gap and analyze the correlations between young Chinese people's beliefs about radiation and their opinions toward nuclear power.
In addition, it is noted that people perceive different types of radiation risks in very different ways. Surveys of the public have consistently shown that people perceive nuclear power and nuclear waste as having high risk, but perceive other sources of radioactivity—such as medical x-rays and naturally occurring radon gas—posing much lower risk (Slovic 2012 ). However, articles on the increased cancer risks associated with computed tomography (CT) and cases of excess radiation exposure from CT scans have caused anxiety and fear about radiation exposure from medical imaging (Lin, 2010). Fear of radiation—radiophobia—is prevalent and influences parents' decisions to give consent for the imaging of their children (Oakley and Harrison 2018 ). Medical imaging examinations may be delayed or deferred consequently, resulting in a much greater risk to patients than that associated with imaging examinations (Hendee and O'Connor 2012 ). Radiophobia has been obstruction of the use of nuclear technology arising from concerns disproportionately greater than actual risks would merit. Radiophobia also does far more harm to human health than the radiation released by nuclear accidents. The primary health effect of Chernobyl and Fukushima has been widespread psychoneurological syndromes which are unrelated to radiation exposure (Pastel 2002; Orita et al., 2015; Hasegawa et al., 2016 ). Mental health effects have insidious and debilitating impact upon the people with a greater prevalence and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality than all physical health cases combined (Martin 2015 ). It is noticed that fear of radiation is more dangerous than radiation itself (Ropeik 2017 ). The previous studies discussed the impact of radiophobia on patients, but few analyses about the impact of radiophobia on people's opinions on nuclear power are found. Therefore, we examined if radiophobia is associated with young Chinese people's opinions on nuclear power in this study. Radiophobia refers to people's beliefs that radiation is dangerous or bad, and we would like to confirm if people with different perceptions of radiological risk view risk of nuclear power differently. Specifically, we analyze the relationship between young Chinese people's beliefs about radiation and seven factors, which are the proximity to a nuclear facility, gender, occupation, the NIMBY (Not In My Back-Yard) syndrome, perception of nuclear power, support for nuclear power, and opinions on consequences after receiving 100 mSv of radiation.
2. Methodology
A national online survey was conducted to gain a better understanding of the relationship of young Chinese people's beliefs about radiation and their opinions on nuclear power. Young Chinese people were defined as those at the age between 18 and 39 living in China when filling the questionnaire. Eighteen was chosen because it was the age of majority in China (The Library of Congress 2015 ). The online questionnaire survey was conducted nationally via a professional questionnaire survey platform, Tencent (https://wj.qq.com/ ). We were registered members of the platform to be informed of an opportunity to complete a questionnaire and earn a little remuneration, so we were familiar with its features and functions. The Tencent platform asks the questioners to specify the sample size and qualification if there is any, such as location or age. Then, a qualified sample (slightly larger than the set sample size) is randomly drawn from the registered members. They will be notified of the opportunity to complete the questionnaire, its subject, the amount of remuneration after their responses are considered valid, and the data collection period. Based on our experience as respondents, we agreed that economic incentives do not cause respondents to choose the answers that they think the researchers want, and the remuneration gets people to say more how they really feel rather than giving the easy middle answer (Goldstein 2018 ). In addition, remuneration increases a person's likelihood to complete a questionnaire. We also assured that all responses would remain confidential, so the respondents would feel more secure in providing frank and complete information (Pope et al. 2006 ). Finally, each Internet Protocol (IP) address was restricted to submitting a completed questionnaire once to avoid duplication.
2.1. Measures
The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part simply stated that this questionnaire was intended to learn about perceptions of nuclear power-related subjects. The second part included multiple questions written in Chinese and given in English in Table 1. Some questions ask about inland NPPs because many protests have been made about the idea of construction of inland NPPs (Wu 2017 ). We conducted three pre-survey tests to refine the questions so that the respondents could understand what was being asked of them as quickly, easily, and completely as possible to increase their willingness to express their real opinions. The design of our questionnaire differed from previous studies in two ways. First, the questionnaires in previous studies used a Likert-type scale with a choice of several pre-coded responses, and the respondents' opinions were assessed based on their answers (Huang et al., 2018; Wang et al. 2019, 2020 ). In this study, the pre-populated responses were vivid descriptions in plain language instead of a scale. Most were choice questions that provided both pre-coded response categories and an open-ended response category. The respondents could choose the latter to provide feedback in their own words. Each open-ended response was evaluated carefully to determine the corresponding category. Second, it is noted that the Chinese educational system trains students to sense what the questioner expects and select the expected answer (Zhao 2014 ). Therefore, only 11 questions—instead of all questions in Table 1 —were analyzed, and the select questions were not always placed next to each other. This was design to prevent respondents from guessing what the researchers expected and giving the expected answers automatically. In addition, it was assumed that the respondents’ answers were not affected by the words in the questionnaire shown in Table 1.

2.2. Sample and data collection
A sample size calculator (https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) was used to determine the appropriate number of respondents. A confidence level of 99% with a 5% margin of error required 666 respondents when the population size was more than 10 million people. According to China Internet Network Information Center (http://www.cnnic.net.cn/hlwfzyj/hlwxzbg/ ), about 400 million Chinese people at the age between 18 and 39 had access to the Internet in 2019. Therefore, more than 666 valid responses were needed. The national questionnaire was open from October 14 to October 20, 2019, and 1120 responses were collected. Illogical responses were eliminated. For example, one response was eliminated because the respondent chose “Other” whenever it was available and commented “I am an intern.” Then, 1071 responses were considered valid (valid rate of 95.6%), and those respondents received 2.5 RMB as remuneration. Among them, 893 respondents were born between 1980 and 2001, and their responses were analyzed in this study. Table 2 shows the demographic data of these respondents, including gender, birth year, occupation, and region. While most of the respondents were male (79%), gender reportedly exerted no significant effects on public acceptance of nuclear energy in China (Wang et al., 2019 ). Regarding occupation, respondents who chose “Civil officer,” “Management,” “Support staff (white-collar),” “Skilled laborer,” or “Entrepreneur or Partner” were considered “white-collar workers.” Those who chose “Raw material extraction sector or manufacturing sector” or “Support staff (blue collar)” were considered “blue-collar workers.” Those who chose “Other” were reviewed individually and grouped accordingly. Table 2 shows that about half of the respondents were white-collar workers, and 29% of respondents were students. This profile may be attributed to their easy access to the Internet. The respondents reported living in 31 provinces of China. More than 63% of respondents lived in East China and Southern Central China. In addition, 47% of respondents reported living in inland provinces and 53% in coastal provinces.

3. Results
Responses to 11 questions are analyzed. They are Questions 1, 4, 5, 12, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, and 24. The correlations between the respondents' beliefs about radiation and their demographic profile are discussed. Following is the analysis of the influences of respondents’ beliefs about radiation on their opinions about nuclear power. Chi-square test statistic is calculated following SPSS tutorial (https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/ ), and p value is found via an online Chi-Square Calculator (https://www.socscistatistics.com/pvalues/chidistribution.aspx ). In addition, odds ratios are used to quantify the strength of the association.
3.1. Respondents sorted into “radiophobia” and “no radiophobia” groups
Respondents were sorted into two groups based on their responses to Question 16 in Table 1. One is “radiophobia” if the respondents denied the statement in Question 16 that 100 mSv of radiation would not be harmful and refused to receive 1 mSv of radiation at work per year despite a monetary incentive. They refused to receive 1 mSv of radiation at work despite a clear statement that receiving 1 mSv should not result in any negative consequence and a monetary incentive, and therefore they are considered to have a negative perception of a small amount of radiation. The rest is in the “no radiophobia” group. Fig. 1 shows that about a quarter of respondents were in the “radiophobia” group. This is the basis of the following analyses.

3.2. Opinion on recovery after receiving 100 mSv significantly associated with radiophobia
Fig. 2 shows respondents’ opinions about whether an individual can fully recover after receiving 100 mSv of radiation with respect to their beliefs about radiation based on Questions 16 and 17. Most of those who chose “Other” stated that they did not know the answer to this question, and they remain in the third group. Even though it was stated that “Receiving less than 100 mSv over a short period of time is not harmful to health” right before Question 17, most respondents considered that it would be impossible to fully recover after receiving 100 mSv. Fig. 2 shows that 82% of those in the “radiophobia” group did not believe that a person could fully recover after receiving 100 mSv, while 55% of those in the “no radiophobia” group chose this opinion. A significant correlation is found between beliefs about radiation and the belief about fully recovering from receiving 100 mSv (p < 0.00001). People in the “radiophobia” group have 5.8 times the odds to believe that it would be impossible to fully recover after receiving 100 mSv.

3.3. Correlation between the proximity to a nuclear facility and radiophobia
An insignificant correlation is found between gender and radiophobia (p < 0.01), and no correlation is found between it and occupation (p > 0.1). However, correlation between distance to a nuclear facility and beliefs about radiation is found. The result shows that 34% of the respondents with no idea whether they live near a nuclear facility feared a small amount of radiation, and 27% of those who did not live near a nuclear facility are in the “radiophobia” group. The percentage drops to 22% for those living near a nuclear facility, 11% for those living near a construction of a nuclear facility and 14% for those living near a predetermined site for a nuclear facility. Considering the government's campaign in places where NPPs were planned, constructed, or operated (Guo and Wei 2019 ), those who did not know if a nuclear facility was nearby were likely not near a nuclear facility or they would have received information about it. Therefore, they and those who chose “not living near a nuclear facility” are grouped into the category “ not living near a nuclear facility” and those who chose the other options into the category “ living near a nuclear facility .” Then a correlation between distance from a nuclear facility and beliefs about radiation is found (p < 0.005). The odds ratio of 1.7 shows that people who did not live near a nuclear facility tend to fear a small amount of radiation. Those who live near a nuclear facility tend to accept the idea that small amount of radiation would not be harmful or the monetary incentive. This may be results of active communication with local residents, and those who disagreed might have relocated.
3.4. Radiophobia linked to a negative perception of nuclear power
Fig. 3 shows the respondents' first impressions of nuclear power with respect to different beliefs about radiation according to responses to Questions 5 and 16. The solid line and dotted line represent “no radiophobia” and “radiophobia,” respectively. It is found that the respondents’ beliefs about radiation plays a role in their first impression of nuclear power (p < 0.0005). The top three responses are “Atomic bomb explosions,” “Clean energy,” and “Radiation leakage” in both groups. However, the order appears different. The first is “Clean energy” (37%), the second is “Radiation leakage” (24%), and the third is “Atomic bomb explosions” (20%) for the “no radiophobia” group. The first is “Radiation leakage” (33%) the second is “Atomic bomb explosions” (27%), and third is “Clean energy” (21%) for the “radiophobia” group. In addition, it is noted that most of the respondents chose reasons unrelated to the normal operation of an NPP (radiation leakage and atomic bomb explosions).

Fig. 3. Respondents' first impressions of nuclear power.
Those who chose “Atomic bomb explosions,” “Radiation leakage,” “Radioactive waste,” or “Cancer” are considered to have a negative perception of nuclear power. Nuclear waste itself is neutral. However, if it was the first thing that came to mind when thinking about nuclear power, then she or he is considered to have a negative perception of nuclear power. On the other hand, even though the relationship between an NPP and cancer is controversial (Kaatsch et al., 2008; Cuttler and Pollycove 2009; Fairlie 2010 ), respondents are considered to have a negative perception of nuclear power if they first thought of cancer. Those who chose “Clean energy” or “Fission” are considered to have a nonnegative perception of nuclear power. Those who chose “Other” are evaluated individually and grouped accordingly. Most of them left neutral comments such as “a nuclear power plant,” and they are considered to have a nonnegative perception. Fig. 4 shows that 52% of those in the “no radiophobia” group have a nonnegative perception of nuclear power, but 66% of those in the “radiophobia” group have a negative perception of nuclear power. A significant correlation between beliefs about radiation and perceptions of nuclear power is found (p < 0.00001). The odds ratio of 2.1 shows that people who fear a small about of radiation tend to have a negative impression of nuclear power.

3.5. Radiophobia linked to more serious NIMBY attitude
Fig. 5 shows the support for inland NPPs with respect to radiophobia based on responses to Questions 16 and 20. Most of those who chose “Other” commented “it depends” or “not sure.” Therefore, they remain in the third group. Most respondents support inland NPPs regardless of their beliefs about radiation. Specifically, 84% of people in the “no radiophobia” group supported inland NPPs, but the percentage drops to 66% in the “radiophobia” group. It suggests that people's beliefs about radiation significantly affect their support for inland NPPs (p < 0.00001). The odds ratio of 2.8 suggests that people who do not fear a small amount of radiation tend to support development of inland NPPs.

Fig. 6 analyzes Questions 16 and 21. Those who chose “Other” in Question 21 left comments such as “it is hard to decide now” or “not sure,” and therefore they remain in the third group. Fig. 6 shows that 74% of those who did not fear a small amount of radiation support construction of an NPP nearby, but support among those in another group drops the percentage to 42%. The respondents’ support for construction of an NPP near their residence is significantly associated with their beliefs about radiation (p < 0.00001). The odds ratio of 4.1 shows that people who did not fear a small amount of radiation tend to support construction of an NPP near their residence. Fig. 7 combines Fig. 5, Fig. 6. It shows that the support among the radiophobia group drops rapidly if an NPP would be constructed near their residence, which implies a more serious NIMBY syndrome.

3.6. Negative impact of radiation from an NPP worry most respondents, who want information on emergency and radiation protection
Fig. 8 shows the biggest concerns about inland NPPs with respect to different beliefs about radiation based on responses to Questions 16 and 23. The solid line and dotted line represent “no radiophobia” and “radiophobia,” respectively. Most of those who chose “other” did not leave any comment, and two commented “all of the above”. An insignificant correlation between the biggest concerns about inland NPPs and beliefs about radiation is found (p < 0.01). The most chosen answer is “Radiation leakage,” the second is “The negative impact on environment and public health,” and the third is “A nuclear accident” for both groups. It is noted that more than half of those in the “radiophobia” group showed concerns about radiation leakage from an NPP. In addition, all of these concerns appear directly or indirectly related to a negative impact of radiation released from an NPP. According to Questions 14 and 16, 78% and 84% of respondents in the “no radiophobia” group and in the “radiophobia” group agreed that harm from radiation is the worst drawback of nuclear power, respectively. In other words, most respondents considered harm from radiation is the worst drawback of nuclear power regardless their beliefs about radiation.

The solid line and dotted line represent “no radiophobia” and “radiophobia,” respectively. Those who chose “other” commented that they would like to know more about multiple subjects if not all. A correlation between respondents’ beliefs about radiation and what they wanted to know about inland NPPs is found (p < 0.005). For the “radiophobia” group, the top want-to-know is “Radiation protection” (40%), the second is “Emergency procedures” (29%), and the third is “Radioactive waste management” (12%). For the “no radiophobia” group, the top want-to-know is “Emergency procedure” (37%). the second is “Radiation protection” (28%). and the third is “Compensation to local residents” (15%). While compensation is commonly given to people living around an NPP, it does not seem attractive to young Chinese people, especially those in the “radiophobia” group.

4. Discussion
Fig. 2 shows that most respondents considered it impossible to recover after receiving 100 mSv of radiation, which suggests that they had disproportionate concerns that are greater than actual risk about low-dose radiation. This is consistent with a previous study that found most Chinese college students did not know much about nuclear power and radiation (Deng et al. 2016 ). Radiation with cumulative dose up to 100 mSv is usually referred to as low-dose radiation, and it is generally accepted that radiation exposures in doses of less than 100 mSv are too low to detect any statistically significant cancer excess in the presence of naturally occurring malignancies. The National Academies “Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation” studies, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) agree that while cancer can occur because of low doses of radiation, the incidence of radiation-induced cancer is so low that it cannot be distinguished from the natural occurrence of the same cancer (Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission 2019). Actually, several studies suggest low-dose radiation results in beneficial (hormetic) effects (Vaiserman et al., 2018). It appears that most young Chinese people and the nuclear experts have disagreement over the impact of low-dose radiation. Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show that young Chinese people's beliefs about radiation are significantly associated with perceptions of and support for nuclear power. Even though a negative perception of radiation may be one of many reasons that results in negative perceptions of nuclear power, young Chinese people's viewpoints on nuclear power may shift once they change opinions on radiation. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 suggest that radiation is the center of concerns about an inland NPP. This is consistent with American Nuclear Society's observation that many nuclear issues are driven by a fear of radiation. It is suggested to focus on improving communication surrounding nuclear exposure, especially low-dose radiation and its impact (Simmons 2020). Fig. 8 shows that most respondents feared a negative impact of the release of radioactive materials from an inland NPP. Fig. 9 shows that most respondents wanted to learn more about radiation protection and emergency procedures despite information on these topics have been given in various forms, such as propaganda, education, training, and nuclear science museums (Guo and Wei 2019 ). This phenomenon may be attributed to a perception gap existing between the nuclear experts and the public. For example, nuclear experts tend to rate nuclear waste and a nuclear accident as less risky than the public does (Perko 2014 ), and the dose limit does not represent a line between “safe” and “not safe” for the public (Orita et al., 2015 ). Sometimes, an event is not considered to be an emergency to experts but is perceived very differently by the public (INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY, 2012 ). These different perceptions of radiological risk may lead to disagreement over radiation protection and emergency procedures, which are designed to minimize negative consequences from radiation exposure through protective actions. Therefore, opinions on perceived radiological risk appear crucial to the implementation of protective actions. The communication between the nuclear experts and young Chinese people is also expected to be more effective when they are of the same mind on radiological risk.
5. Policy implication
China has recognized the importance of public acceptance of nuclear power and worked on it, such as sharing information about (1) fundamental knowledge about nuclear energy, (2) news and prospect of nuclear power around the world, (3) related policy and regulation, (4) nuclear safety, radiation protection and emergency, (5) the benefits of nuclear facilities and (6) the emergency plan and preparation of nuclear facilities (Yue et al., 2012 ). It is found that most campaign and promotion materials available in China emphasize that radiation is everywhere and radiation from an NPP is not terrifying with common approaches such as comparison with other risks (Murakami et al., 2016) or comparison between different radiation exposures (Slovic 2012 ). However, the information appears incomplete: what do we need protection if radiation is not terrifying? In addition, even though residents near a nuclear facility did not report fearing radiation, Fig. 2 shows that most respondents over-estimated the consequence of receiving 100 mSv of radiation, which is significantly correlated with their beliefs about radiation, which is significantly correlated with their perceptions of and support for nuclear power. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 suggest that most young Chinese people's concerns about NPPs surround concerns about radiation. Therefore, we suggest that instead of including all possible factors in a campaign, it may be more effective and efficient to tackle a crucial issue: fear of radiation. One approach may be dissemination of more information about radiation to the public because knowledge is reported to be positively correlated with support for nuclear power (Sjöberg and Drottz-Sjöberg, 1991 Sjöberg and Drottz‐Sjöberg, 1991; Slovic 2012; Skarlatidou et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016 ), such as possible consequences of receiving different amounts of radiation, the fact that three units in Chernobyl were operated for many years safely after the accident and the application of radiation in our modern lives. In addition, we suggest that professionals from fields related to nuclear technology—such as nuclear power, agriculture and radiopharmaceuticals— should work together to fight against the same obstruction, radiophobia. Working together may result in better effectiveness and greater influences than working separately. This effect is expected to be better before the occurrence of the next nuclear accident because the perceptions of radiation may not be changed easily in the aftermath of a nuclear accident (Orita et al., 2015; Covello 2011 ).
6. Conclusions
Previous studies suggest a significant correlation between risk perception and acceptance of nuclear power, but opinions from people with different perceived radiological risk seemed not captured. Just like radiophobia has resulted in people's concerns about medical imaging and negative influences of a nuclear accident, our study suggests that it has affected young Chinese people's opinions about nuclear power. A national online survey was conducted to learn about the correlation between young Chinese people's beliefs about radiation and their opinions on nuclear power. Respondents were sorted into two groups, “radiophobia” and “no radiophobia” based on their willingness to receive an extra 1 mSv of radiation at work per year after scanning through a statement saying that it should not hurt. Correlation between the proximity to a nuclear facility and beliefs about radiation is found. On the other hand, gender and occupation are not revealed as statistically influential. In addition, it is found that fear of radiation tends to lead to negative perceptions of nuclear power. Therefore, their support for nuclear power may increase after they change perceptions of radiological risks. Even though most respondents supported inland NPPs, fear of radiation is linked to a more serious NIMBY syndrome. Most respondents overstated the effect of low-dose radiation, worried about a negative impact of radioactive material released from an NPP, and wanted to learn more about radiation protection and emergency procedures even though these topics have been the focus of the campaign. A perception gap between young Chinese people and nuclear experts is considered a possible reason. Communication is expected to become more effective when they are of the same on radiological risk, which is also expected to help the implementation of protective actions. Note that results of this study may only apply to young Chinese people having access to the Internet.

RELATED ARTICLE
“Journalists Can Be Seduced By Aspects of Risk”
– David Ropeik What follows is a basic list of risk perception factors. (They are culled from 20 years of research and are reviewed for this article by Paul Slovic.) Often, several of these factors can be involved simultaneously. For example, fear of West Nile virus is high in some areas because awareness is high, it’s new, and there remains some uncertainty. However, fear of particulate air pollution remains low (compared with what scientists say is the actual risk) because it’s chronic and awareness is still low. Factors can compete. Vaccines are human-made, threaten children, and state laws impose the risk on parents and kids, all of which raise fear. But for some people, the risk outweighs the benefit enough to counterbalance these other factors. Some people fear a risk more than other people do. While all of us fear similar things, for similar reasons, individual circumstances overlay those factors. We all fear cancer, for example, but men have a greater fear of prostate cancer and women of breast cancer. Parents fear child abductions more than nonparents do. Risk perception factors are dynamic over time. Awareness goes up or down. With time, new risks become familiar. Uncertainty, as with electrical and magnetic fields, ultimately gets resolved as scientific information develops. —D.R.
Trust vs. lack of trust: The more we trust the people informing us about a risk, the less afraid we are. The more we trust the process used in deciding whether we will be exposed to a hazard, the less afraid we are. When we trust the agency or company exposing us to the risk, we are less afraid. When we trust government agencies that are supposed to be protecting us, we are less afraid. The less we trust the people informing us, the people protecting us, or the process determining our exposure to a risk, the more afraid we are.
Imposed vs. voluntary: We are much more afraid of a risk that is imposed on us (the driver in the car next to us using his cell phone) than when we voluntarily expose ourselves to the same risk (we are using a cell phone while we drive).
Natural vs. human-made: If the risk is natural, such as radiation from the sun, we are less afraid. If it’s human-made, such as radiation from nuclear power or some industrial process, we are more afraid. This factor helps explain excessive public fear of pesticides and industrial chemicals.
Catastrophic vs. chronic: We tend to be more afraid of things that can kill a lot of us, suddenly and violently and all in one place, such as a plane crash, than things like heart disease, which causes hundreds of thousands more deaths, but one at a time, over time, and not all in the same place.
The dread factor: The worse the outcome from a risk, such as being eaten alive by a shark, the more afraid of it we are. This helps explain our excessive fear of carcinogens or potential carcinogens. Cancer ranks high on the dread scale.
Hard to understand: The harder a potential risk is to understand—such as nuclear power or industrial chemicals—the more afraid we are likely to be. And when the risk is invisible, the fear gets even worse.
Uncertainty: This is less a matter of the science being hard to understand and more a matter of not having enough answers. This factor explains widespread fear of new technologies and why, as the answers come in (artificial sweeteners, silicone in breast implants, electrical and magnetic fields), fear goes down.
Familiar vs. new: When we first encounter a risk (West Nile virus as it spreads to new communities), we are more afraid than after we have lived with the risk for a while. When mad cow disease first showed up in just a handful of cows in Germany in 2000, a poll found that 85 percent of the public thought this new risk was a serious threat to public health. That poll also asked people in Great Britain, where the disease had killed more than 100 people and hundreds of thousands of animals. But because people in the U.K. had lived with it for 14 years, only 40 percent of them said mad cow disease was a serious threat to public health.
Awareness: When the news is full of stories about a given risk, like ozone depletion, our fear of that risk is greater. For example, on July 3, 2002, amid a flurry of “Will the terrorists strike on July 4th?” stories, the FBI said requests for handgun purchases were one-third higher than expected. But awareness doesn’t just come from the news media. When, as individuals, we’ve recently experienced something bad, such as the death of a friend or relative to cancer, or witnessed a crime or an accident, awareness of that risk is greater, and so is our fear.
A known victim: A risk that is made real by a specific victim, such as the recent child abductions making news, becomes more frightening, even though the actual risk may be no greater than it was before it was personified by this victim.
Future generations: When kids are at risk, our fear is greater. Asbestos in a workplace doesn’t frighten us as much as asbestos in schools.
Does it affect me?: We don’t perceive risk to “them,” to society, as fearfully as we do risks to ourselves. This explains the desire for zero risk. A person doesn’t care if the risk of cancer from pesticides on food is one in a million, if he or she could be that one.
Risk vs. benefit: The more we perceive a benefit from a potentially hazardous agent or process or activity, such as drugs or vaccines or skiing or bungee jumping, the less fearful we are of the risk.
Control vs. no control: If a person feels as though he or she can control the outcome of a hazard, that individual is less likely to be afraid. Driving is one obvious example, as is riding a bike and not wearing a helmet. Control can either be physical (driving the car, operating the bicycle) or a feeling of controlling a process, as when a person participates, setting risk management policy through involvement in public hearings or voting.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, I've got some search results here on risk perception, particularly focusing on how people perceive nuclear hazards compared to other everyday risks. Let's dive into this.

First, I need to understand what risk perception is. From Doc 1, which is from Wikipedia, risk perception seems to be about how people judge the dangers of different risks. It's not just about the actual statistics but also about how people feel and think about those risks. There are different approaches to studying this, like psychological, sociological, and interdisciplinary approaches.

The psychological approach looks at how people process information and make judgments about risks. It seems like people use mental shortcuts called heuristics, which can sometimes lead to biases in how they perceive risks. For example, if something is more memorable or easier to imagine, people might think it's more likely to happen.

The sociological approach considers how culture and society shape risk perceptions. Different cultures might have different ways of thinking about risks, and social institutions can influence how risks are perceived and managed.

Then there's the interdisciplinary approach, which brings together ideas from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and communications theory to understand how risks are communicated and how that affects public perception.

Now, specifically regarding nuclear hazards, I need to see how they differ from other everyday risks. One key point is that nuclear risks can have very serious, long-term consequences. Accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have shown that nuclear hazards can affect large areas and have lasting impacts on public health and the environment. This is different from, say, the risk of getting in a car accident, which is more immediate and affects fewer people.

Also, nuclear hazards often involve radiation, which is invisible and can be difficult to understand. People might not know when they're being exposed to it, and the health effects might not show up for many years. This uncertainty can make people more afraid.

Moreover, nuclear risks have a temporal dimension because radioactive waste can remain dangerous for thousands of years, affecting future generations. This is something that's not really present in most everyday risks.

On the other hand, people accept various risks in their daily lives, like driving a car or eating food that might be contaminated. These risks are generally considered acceptable because the benefits outweigh the risks, and the risks are relatively low.

So, are nuclear hazards different? It seems like yes, due to their potential for catastrophic events, their invisibility, and their long-term impacts.

But, it's also important to consider that people's perceptions of risk aren't always based on factual information. Sometimes, emotions and cultural factors play a big role. For example, some people might be more afraid of nuclear risks because of historical events like atomic bombings, even if the actual risk from nuclear power is different.

I remember reading about the concept of "dread" in risk perception. Some risks are just inherently more frightening to people, and nuclear risks seem to fall into that category. There's a sense of dread associated with nuclear accidents that might not be present with other types of risks.

Also, the way nuclear risks are communicated can greatly affect people's perceptions. If information is not transparent or if there's a lack of trust in the institutions managing nuclear facilities, people might perceive the risks as higher.

I think it's also worth considering that not all nuclear risks are the same. For example, the risk from nuclear power plants is different from the risk from nuclear weapons or medical uses of radiation. So, people's perceptions might vary depending on the context.

Furthermore, there's the issue of control. People might feel more afraid of risks that are imposed on them, like living near a nuclear power plant, compared to risks they choose to take, like flying in an airplane.

I recall that in some studies, experts and the general public don't always agree on what risks are acceptable. Experts might consider certain levels of radiation exposure to be safe, but the public might have a different threshold due to fear and uncertainty.

Perhaps I should look into some specific examples or studies that compare nuclear risks to other risks. Maybe there are surveys or research papers that can provide more insight.

Let me see... in Doc 4, there's a study about young Chinese people's perceptions of nuclear power and their beliefs about radiation. It seems like a lot of their concerns are related to radiation risks, and their perceptions influence their support for nuclear power.

This suggests that radiation is a central concern for many people when it comes to nuclear power. If they fear radiation more, they're less likely to support nuclear power.

Also, the study mentions that even people living near nuclear facilities have certain fears and concerns, although maybe to a lesser extent than those who don't live near them.

I wonder if this is universal or specific to certain cultures. Maybe in countries with more positive experiences with nuclear power, public perception is different.

Doc 5 is an article from Nieman Reports about understanding factors of risk perception. It lists various factors that influence how people perceive risks, such as trust, imposed vs. voluntary risks, natural vs. human-made risks, catastrophic vs. chronic risks, and so on.

This could be a useful framework for analyzing how people perceive nuclear hazards compared to other risks.

For example, nuclear risks are often human-made, which can increase fear, and they can be imposed on people, especially if they live near nuclear facilities.

Also, nuclear risks can be catastrophic, involving sudden, large-scale disasters, which tend to be more feared than chronic risks that cause harm over time.

Moreover, radiation is hard to understand and invisible, which can heighten fear.

On the other hand, risks like driving are more familiar and voluntary, which might make them seem less scary, even though statistically they might be more dangerous.

It's interesting to think about how media coverage affects risk perception. For instance, if there's a lot of news about a particular risk, like West Nile virus, people might perceive it as more dangerous than it actually is.

Similarly, the way risks are communicated by experts and authorities can shape public perception. If people trust the sources of information, they might be less afraid.

In the context of nuclear risks, if there's a lack of transparency or trust in the institutions managing nuclear facilities, that could exacerbate fears.

I also recall that some research suggests that people are more afraid of risks that they don't feel they have control over. With nuclear power, individuals have little control over how it's managed, which could contribute to higher fear levels.

Comparatively, when it comes to everyday risks like crossing the street or cooking at home, people feel they have more control, which might make those risks seem more acceptable.

Another factor is the benefit versus the risk. People are often willing to accept higher risks if there are significant benefits. For nuclear power, the benefit is a source of energy that doesn't emit greenhouse gases, which is appealing in the context of climate change.

However, if people perceive the risks as too high, they might not accept nuclear power, even if the benefits are substantial.

I think it's also important to consider the way risks are communicated to the public. If the information is clear, transparent, and comes from trusted sources, people might be more accepting of nuclear power.

Conversely, if there's a history of cover-ups or mistrust, as in some countries, that can fuel fears and opposition to nuclear power.

Moreover, the way risks are framed can influence perception. For example, emphasizing the safety record of nuclear power plants might help alleviate fears, while focusing on the potential for catastrophic accidents could increase anxiety.

It's also worth noting that different people have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable risks. Some might be more risk-averse than others, and this can influence their perceptions.

In summary, nuclear hazards seem to be perceived differently from other everyday risks due to factors like potential for catastrophic events, invisibility of radiation, long-term impacts, and lack of control over the risks.

However, it's essential to communicate effectively about these risks, addressing public concerns and building trust, to help people make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting nuclear technologies.

I think the key takeaway is that risk perception is complex and influenced by多种因素，不仅仅是实际的风险水平。因此，理解和应对公众对核风险的担忧需要综合考虑这些心理和社会因素。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, nuclear hazards are perceived differently from other everyday risks due to factors like potential for catastrophic events, invisibility of radiation, long-term impacts, and lack of control over the risks. Effective communication and building trust are crucial in addressing public concerns.}} \]
