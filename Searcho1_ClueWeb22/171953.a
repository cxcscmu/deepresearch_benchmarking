Alright, so I need to figure out how the Industrial Revolution affects us today. I know that the Industrial Revolution was a period of significant industrialization and technological change that started in the late 18th century, mainly in Britain, and then spread to other parts of the world. But how does something that happened so long ago still impact our lives today? I need to think this through step by step.

First, I should probably recall what exactly happened during the Industrial Revolution. It was a time when there was a shift from manual labor to machine-based manufacturing. There were inventions like the steam engine, the spinning jenny, and improvements in iron production. These innovations led to mass production, which in turn led to urbanization as people moved to cities for factory jobs.

So, one way it affects us today is through the infrastructure and urban planning of our cities. Many of the cities we live in today were shaped during or after the Industrial Revolution. The layout, transportation systems, and even the social structures can be traced back to that period.

Moreover, the Industrial Revolution laid the foundation for modern industries. The factories, machinery, and production methods that were developed then are the ancestors of today's manufacturing processes. Even though technology has advanced tremendously since then, the basic principles of mass production and division of labor are still in use.

Another important aspect is the economic systems. The Industrial Revolution is closely linked to the rise of capitalism. The growth of private ownership of businesses, the pursuit of profit, and the expansion of markets are all concepts that were strengthened during that time. Today's global economy is largely based on these principles.

Additionally, the Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on society. It led to the growth of the middle class and changes in social structures. Education also became more widespread as literacy rates increased with the availability of printed materials.

Environmentally, the Industrial Revolution marks the beginning of large-scale industrial pollution. The burning of fossil fuels and the release of pollutants from factories have contributed to environmental issues that we are still dealing with today, such as climate change and air pollution.

In terms of technology, many of the inventions from that period are the precursors to modern devices. For example, the steam engine led to the development of internal combustion engines, which power most of our vehicles today.

Also, the Industrial Revolution spurred advances in science and engineering, setting the stage for further innovations in the electrical age and beyond. Without the groundwork laid during that period, many of the technologies we take for granted today might not exist.

Furthermore, the Industrial Revolution influenced political systems. The rise of industrial nations led to shifts in global power dynamics and played a role in shaping international relations.

In summary, the Industrial Revolution has had a lasting impact on virtually every aspect of modern life, from the way we work and live to the way our societies and economies are structured. Its effects are still very much present and continue to shape our world today.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Industrial Revolution has profoundly shaped modern society, economy, technology, and environment, with its impacts still evident in contemporary urban structures, industrial practices, economic systems, social stratification, educational standards, environmental conditions, technological foundations, and political landscapes.}} \]
