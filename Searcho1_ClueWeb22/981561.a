So I've been given this question: "Should the government have a say in abortion?" It's a pretty sensitive and complex issue, and I know that people have really strong opinions about it. I need to think this through carefully.

First off, I need to understand what it means for the government to "have a say" in abortion. Does this mean making laws about when and how abortions can be performed, regulating access to abortion services, or maybe even deciding whether abortion should be allowed at all? It seems like "having a say" encompasses all of these aspects.

I think it's important to consider the different perspectives on this issue. There are those who believe that abortion is a fundamental right, part of personal autonomy and women's reproductive rights. From this viewpoint, the government should not interfere with an individual's ability to make decisions about their own body. On the other side, there are those who view abortion as morally wrong, often equating it to murder, and they might argue that the government has a responsibility to protect innocent life.

Let me try to explore both sides more deeply.

Starting with the pro-choice perspective: They argue that reproduction is a private matter and that individuals should have the freedom to make decisions about their bodies without governmental interference. They might also point out that banning abortion doesn't eliminate it; instead, it pushes it underground where it can be unsafe. So, from this angle, government involvement could potentially harm women by forcing them into risky procedures.

On the other hand, pro-life advocates believe that unborn children have a right to life, and therefore, the government should protect that right by restricting or banning abortion. They might argue that the potential for life is valuable from the moment of conception and that the state has an interest in preserving all human lives.

I think it's also crucial to consider the implications of government involvement beyond just the legal status of abortion. For example, even if abortion is legal, government policies can affect access to abortion services through funding restrictions, mandatory waiting periods, counseling requirements, and so on. These regulations can make it more difficult for some people to obtain abortions, effectively limiting their reproductive choices.

Moreover, there's the question of whose interests the government should prioritize. Is it the fetus's right to life, the mother's right to choose, or perhaps both? Balancing these interests is challenging, and different societies have come up with different solutions.

Maybe I should look into what other countries do regarding abortion laws. That might give me some perspective on the range of possibilities and their outcomes.

Abortion laws around the world
Across the world, abortion is a controversial and emotional topic. Pro-choice activists are adamant that abortion is a fundamental human right that gives women control over their own bodies and reproductive futures. Their conservative opponents are equally obstinate, with many believing that life begins at conception, and that aborting a fetus is tantamount to murder.
And in countries all around the world right now, abortion laws are shifting rapidly. In some conservative countries and provinces—like Turkey and the American state of Texas—longstanding protections of the right to an abortion are being curtailed. In other countries with dominant Catholic religious traditions—such as Argentina and Ireland—activists have waged and won years-long campaigns to make access to abortion the law of the land. In the case of one such country, Mexico, activists have hypothesized that the country’s new legalization of abortion may end up making it a destination for women from Texas, who previously had greater access to abortions than Mexican women, but no longer do.
Stacker compiled a list of abortion laws in 15 countries around the world from news and government reports. Keep reading for a look at the shifting tides of abortion access around the world in 2021.

Poland
In 2021, Poland made international headlines for instituting a near-total abortion ban. Although the majority of Poles support access to abortion, the country’s conservative government is aligned with the Catholic church, which opposes abortion. Upon the ruling that access to abortion would only be permitted in the cases of rape and incest, huge crowds of Poles took to the streets to protest. Poland already had highly restrictive abortion laws, and an estimated 200,000 women leave the country each year to seek access to abortion elsewhere.

Mexico
Until 2021, having an abortion in Mexico was considered a crime. The Supreme Court decriminalized abortion in September of that year, but pro-choice activists warn there is a long road ahead to ensure open access to abortions in the country. The same month in the United States, however, restrictive abortion laws went into effect in Texas, across the border, raising the prospect of Mexico becoming a destination for American women looking for abortions, in a reversal of longstanding trends.

United States
In September 2021, the Supreme Court refused to block a piece of Texas legislation that bans abortions in the state after six weeks. Pro-choice activists in Texas—and their allies across the nation—decried the move as a de facto near total ban on abortions, as many women do not even know they are pregnant at six weeks. The court’s decision may set up a showdown over abortion rights on a national level at the Supreme Court, as current conditions in Texas cut against the landmark ruling guaranteeing abortion access across the country, Roe vs. Wade.

Japan
Abortions are legal in Japan up to 21 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy. One key difference between abortion laws in Japan and much of the rest of the world is that Japan requires the father of the baby to give consent before a pregnancy is terminated, although many women circumvent this by bringing a man along who is not the father but has agreed to pretend he is. Japan is only one of 11 countries in the world that require third-party consent, and activists are pushing the country to end this requirement.

Russia
Russia has one of the world’s highest abortion rates. President Vladimir Putin is attempting to stop Russia’s high rate of termination in an attempt to redress the country’s population decline. Russia currently pays for abortions under the country’s medical insurance program. Putin’s government—along with the country’s conservative church leaders—are trying to redirect this funding into material support for women who choose to continue the pregnancy.

China
China is moving to limit abortion access in order to increase its falling birthrate. The country’s birth rate has fallen to its lowest level since 1961, which concerned government officials enough to reverse China’s decades-long one-child policy in 2015. The announcement that China would attempt to limit abortions via improved contraceptive access or restricted abortion access or both has worried some women in the country, who fear they may be left without control of their reproductive futures should the state ban abortions entirely.

Argentina
Until 2020, abortion was only legal in Argentina in the case of rape and incest. But at the end of 2020, Argentina’s congress voted to legalize abortion up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. The legislation’s success was attributed in part to a massive protest movement of Argentinian women and their allies, whose years-long campaign culminated in the new law. Legalization is a blow to the country’s religious establishment, the Catholic church, which opposes abortion access.

South Africa
Abortion was legalized in South Africa in 1996, during the country’s transition from apartheid to democracy. A 2008 amendment to the law expanded access by allowing trained nurses to administer abortions. However, despite the strength of existing laws protecting the right to an abortion, there is a significant access divide in the country, with women in rural areas experiencing difficulty in finding a willing provider compared to their urban counterparts.

Australia
Expanded access to abortion in Australia has been a piecemeal effort, as various states across the country moved to decriminalize the procedure. The most populous state, Sydney, voted to allow abortions up to 22 weeks in 2019, overturning a 119-year-old law prohibiting it. In 2021, South Australia became the final state to overturn the prohibition of abortions, making the procedure legal across the entire country.

Italy
Italy’s highly Catholic culture has led to restrictive abortion laws in the country. Although legal for the first 90 days of pregnancy, acquiring an abortion in Italy is a cumbersome process. Providers are allowed to opt out of providing abortions due to “conscientious objection,” which leaves many women and girls scrambling to find providers in the required time frame. This difficulty was exacerbated during the coronavirus pandemic, when borders were sealed and women could not travel outside the country to find a willing provider.

Saudi Arabia
In Saudi Arabia, abortion is allowed only in cases where the mother’s life is at risk, or to protect her physical or mental health. Rape and incest exceptions are taken on a case-by-case basis, and can be allowed under the aegis of potential harm to a woman’s mental health. Despite the restrictions, abortion activists have pointed out that women actually have greater access to abortions in Saudi Arabia than they do in American states like Alabama and Georgia, where politicians decry Islamic law in countries like Saudi Arabia as hostile to women’s rights, while curtailing them even further at home.

Turkey
Although abortion has been legal in Turkey since 1983, the procedure is becoming increasingly difficult to access. The country’s conservative president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has said that he believes abortion is a crime, and that women should all have three children. Public hospitals are allowed to refuse to provide abortions based simply on the president’s point of view, making it difficult for many women to afford abortions at private clinics, and thus access abortions at all.

South Korea
In 2021, South Korea decriminalized abortion across the country. Before this landmark ruling legalizing abortion, an estimated 50,000–500,000 dangerous illegal abortions were performed in the country each year. Women caught trying to get illegal abortions were subject to punishments of up to a year in prison.

India
In 2021, India passed a law significantly expanding access to abortions. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Act of 2021 extends the grounds on which abortions will be permitted to include therapeutic, humanitarian, eugenic, and social grounds, allowing for near-universal access. India’s stated goal in expanding access is to decrease the country’s maternal mortality rate.

Ireland
Ireland legalized abortion across the country in a seismic 2018 referendum. The Catholic nation imposed a near-total abortion ban in 1983 that gave the mother and fetus equal legal rights. Thirty-five years later, voters rejected this provision by nearly 2-to-1, and a law was passed the following year establishing the country’s state-run abortion service providers.

December 10, 2021, 9:45 AM · 3 min read
(Reuters) - New limits on abortion rights are being pursued in the United States and other countries.
Here is a look at global abortion statistics and some of the world's strictest abortion laws based on information from the U.N. World Health Organization as well as from the Guttmacher Institute research group and the Center for Reproductive Rights legal advocacy group, both of which support abortion rights.
- Approximately 73 million abortions occur worldwide annually, with 61% of all unintended pregnancies and 29% of all pregnancies ending in abortion, according to the World Health Organization. It said about 45% of all abortions are unsafe, of which 97% occur in developing countries. A WHO fact sheet said, "Unsafe abortion is a leading - but preventable - cause of maternal deaths and morbidities."
- There are about two dozen countries where abortion is prohibited altogether, a list that includes Egypt, Iraq, the Philippines, Laos, Senegal, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to the Guttmacher Institute. About three dozen other countries allow it only to save the life of the mother, a list that includes Nigeria, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Ireland, Iran, Afghanistan and Myanmar, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Around 40% of women of reproductive age live in places where abortion access is illegal or limited.
- In the United States, a series of restrictive Republican-backed laws have been passed at the state level, with the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court considering overturning a 1973 precedent that legalized the procedure nationwide in a case involving a Mississippi abortion ban - blocked by lower courts - beginning at 15 weeks of pregnancy. The court on Friday allowed a legal challenge brought by abortion providers to proceed against a Texas law that went into effect in September that bans the procedure at about six weeks of pregnancy.
- Poland in January put into effect a constitutional court decision prohibiting abortions performed due to fetal defects, banning the most common of the few legal grounds for terminating a pregnancy in the largely Catholic country.
- El Salvador has some of the world's strictest abortion laws, with the procedure banned without exception since 1998. More than 180 women who experienced obstetric emergencies were prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide in the past 20 years.
- Women in Malta are denied access to abortion, even if their lives are at risk. It is the only EU member state that completely prohibits the procedure. Women face up to three years in jail.
- Senegal prohibits abortion but its code of medical ethics allows it if three doctors agree it is needed to save a woman's life. A 2014 study showed the rules force women to seek clandestine abortions and, as a last resort, kill their own infants.
- In the United Arab Emirates, abortion is illegal except if the pregnancy endangers the woman's life or there is evidence the baby will not survive. Women could face up to one year in prison and a hefty fine. Women who seek hospital treatment for a miscarriage may be accused of attempted abortion.
- Anti-abortion laws in the Philippines derive from its time as a colony of Spain. Abortion has been prohibited for more than a century. About 1,000 Filipino women die each year from complications. Spain is among more than 50 countries that have liberalized abortion laws over the past quarter century.

What abortion laws are like around the world
In the predominantly Catholic state of Malta, abortion is banned
Web Desk Updated: September 28, 2021 18:12 IST
China, on Monday, issued new guidelines limiting the number of abortions performed for ‘non-medical purposes’. The country’s government in 2018 warned that abortions performed to end unwanted pregnancies was harmful to a woman’s body and could affect fertility.
According to the state council, the new guidelines aim in making pre-pregnancy and healthcare services more accessible to women.
This announcement sparks new debates around abortion rights. The debate around women’s reproductive rights was most recently brought to focus after Texas imposed the six weeks or the fetal heartbeat bill.
The bill which was passed-- Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) makes abortions in Texas illegal after the heartbeat of the fetus is detected, unless it is a medical emergency, effectively impacting 85 per cent of abortions and wiping out abortion rights in Texas altogether. President Joe Biden lambasted the Supreme Court's decision not to block the new law and directed federal agencies to do what they can to insulate women and healthcare providers from the impact.

Biden is right to be taken aback by the law, as several women aren’t even aware that they are pregnant until six weeks. While the Supreme Court will be reviewing cases around abortion rights for months to come, the judgement has sparked some strong debates around abortion rights.
World over, governments have had different takes on a woman’s reproductive rights.
In the predominantly Catholic state of Malta, abortion is banned and the offender could face imprisonment between 18 months to three years.
Mexico’s Supreme Court, on September 7, voted to decriminalise abortion. This is a landmark ruling in a nation that is predominantly Roman Catholic. Women in Brazil, in the meantime, continue to fight for abortion rights. In Argentina, abortion was made legal in January, but, the termination should take place in the first 14 weeks of conception and following a Senate law that allows the procedure.
In several Latin American nations, women can avail of abortion only if the pregnancy is the result of rape, incest or there is fatal fetal impairments or threats to the health of the mother. Nations like Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Suriname have blanket prohibitions on abortion.
In April 2021, Ecuador legalised abortion for all pregnancies that were a result of rape. Abortion is banned in states in Europe, but aren’t part of the EU like Andorra, the Vatican and San Marino.
In countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Guatemala, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Paraguay, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Uganda, Venezuela, the West Bank/Gaza and Yemen, abortions can be availed if the pregnancy poses to be a threat to the mother’s life.
Chile decriminalised abortion in 2017.
Abortion is considered a crime in India under section 312. Under the MTP Act 1971, however, a woman can avail of abortion until 20 weeks on the advice of one doctor. And in case the pregnancy is the result of incest, sexual abuse or if the mother is differently-abled, abortion can be availed until 24 weeks. Abortion can be availed at any time during the gestation period in case of foetal anomalies.
South Korea, in 2019, ordered the country's decades-old abortion ban to be lifted in a landmark ruling.
New Zealand decriminalised abortion in March 2020.
In Australia, the state of Queensland legalised abortion in 2018. New South Wales continues to ban abortion. Abortion was legalised in Ireland in 2018.

Alright, so I've looked up some information about abortion laws around the world. It's interesting to see such a wide range of approaches. Some countries have very restrictive laws, even outright bans, while others have legalized abortion under certain conditions or more broadly.

Looking at the global landscape, it seems that religion plays a significant role in shaping abortion laws. Countries with strong Catholic influences, like Poland, Malta, and several Latin American nations, tend to have stricter abortion laws. In contrast, more secular countries or those with different religious backgrounds may have more permissive abortion laws.

It's also noteworthy that even in countries where abortion is legal, there can be significant restrictions or practical barriers that limit access. For example, in the United States, while Roe v. Wade established a constitutional right to abortion, state-level restrictions can make it difficult for women to access abortion services, especially in certain regions.

Another aspect is the relationship between abortion laws and public health. The World Health Organization mentions that unsafe abortions are a leading cause of maternal mortality, particularly in developing countries where abortion is illegal or highly restricted. This suggests that prohibiting abortion doesn't eliminate the practice but may push it underground, leading to dangerous conditions.

Considering this, perhaps the government's role should be to ensure safe and accessible reproductive healthcare, including abortion services, rather than outright bans. After all, making something illegal doesn't necessarily stop it from happening; it might just make it more hazardous.

But then again, there are those who argue that the government has a moral obligation to protect all human life, including that of the fetus. From this perspective, allowing abortion is seen as condoning the taking of an innocent life.

I think it's essential to consider the ethical dimensions here. When does human life begin, and at what point does the fetus gain moral status? These are profound questions that different cultures and philosophies answer in various ways.

Some argue that life begins at conception, while others might say it's at viability outside the womb or at birth. The legal and moral status of the fetus depends on where one draws the line.

Moreover, one must consider the circumstances surrounding the abortion. Is it because of rape or incest? Is the mother's life at risk? Are there severe fetal abnormalities? These factors can influence opinions on whether abortion should be permitted.

It's also important to think about the consequences of government intervention. If the government bans abortion, does that reduce the number of abortions, or does it just drive the practice underground, potentially increasing health risks for women?

Alternatively, if abortion is legal and accessible, does that lead to more responsible sexual behavior or perhaps to a casual attitude toward abortion as a form of contraception?

I suppose there are arguments on both sides. Some might argue that legal abortion empowers women by giving them control over their bodies and reproductive choices, which is crucial for gender equality and social progress.

On the other hand, others might contend that legal abortion objectifies and devalues human life, particularly the lives of the unborn.

Perhaps a middle ground could be found in allowing abortion under certain circumstances, such as in cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother's life, or severe fetal abnormalities, while restricting it otherwise.

This approach acknowledges both the importance of protecting fetal life and the necessity of accommodating exceptional situations where abortion may be the lesser evil.

However, even this compromise may not satisfy everyone, as some will argue that life is sacred from conception and cannot be taken under any circumstances, while others may feel that women should have the autonomy to decide about their own bodies without governmental interference.

Another angle to consider is the impact of abortion on society as a whole. For instance, in countries with declining birth rates, such as Japan and South Korea, there might be pressure to restrict abortion to boost population growth.

Conversely, in countries with overpopulation issues, abortion might be promoted as a means of controlling population size.

But this raises questions about individual rights versus collective needs. Should personal choices be subordinate to societal demands? Or should the government respect individual autonomy even if it conflicts with demographic goals?

Furthermore, the role of religion in shaping public policy is a contentious issue. In many countries, religious beliefs heavily influence laws regarding abortion and other moral issues.

However, in secular democracies, there's a trend toward separating church and state, meaning that laws should be based on rational, evidence-based arguments rather than religious doctrines.

Therefore, when the government makes decisions about abortion, it should strive to be neutral regarding different religious and philosophical viewpoints, focusing instead on protecting the rights and well-being of its citizens.

In conclusion, whether the government should have a say in abortion is a complex question with no easy answers. It involves balancing competing values such as individual liberty, protection of life, public health, and social welfare.

Different societies will reach different conclusions based on their cultural, religious, and political contexts. What's crucial is that any regulations or policies regarding abortion are designed with careful consideration of the rights and needs of all parties involved and are grounded in respect for human dignity and compassion.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, the government should have a say in abortion, but within limits that respect individual rights and public health.}} \]
