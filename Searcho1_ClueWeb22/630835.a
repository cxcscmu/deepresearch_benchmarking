Alright, so I need to figure out how humans are causing climate change. I know that climate change is a big topic, and there's a lot of information out there, but I need to get a handle on it. First, I should probably start by understanding what climate change is. Climate change refers to long-term changes in global temperature and weather patterns, mostly due to human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat from the sun and warm the planet. This is known as the greenhouse effect, and it's natural and necessary for life on Earth. However, human activities, especially burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, have increased the concentration of these gases in the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming.

Besides burning fossil fuels, other human activities contribute to climate change. For example, deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide, thereby increasing its concentration in the atmosphere. Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, releases methane, another potent greenhouse gas. Industrial processes also emit greenhouse gases.

So, to sum it up, human activities that release greenhouse gases are the primary cause of climate change. These activities include burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes.

But I should probably look into this a bit more to make sure I have all the details right. Maybe I can find some reliable sources to back this up.

Let me try searching for "human causes of climate change" to see what comes up.

Climate change (global warming) is a problematic issue, and this problem is growing. To make matters worse, this problem is a manifestation of human activities. People’s actions are resulting in devastating impacts to the environment. Unfortunately, not everyone concurs to this reasoning. Even with empirical data presented, there are skeptics who attribute climate change to natural causes rather than man-made causes. In order to prevent global warming from exacerbating, it is crucial for people to understand that climate change is happening; it is changing “even more radically,” (Emanuel 6) than ever, and humanity is the cause.  As of recent years, global warming has made a significant impact on Earth (Weeks, “Climate Change” 523). “Certain …show more content…
Climate change caused by people is known as anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change (Reuss 35). Due to increased human activity, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas which traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, concentrations in the atmosphere have reached to its highest in three million years (Weeks “Climate Change” 521), and the concentrations are proliferating. With an abundance of carbon dioxide already emitted, Kevin Trenberth, a scientist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, asserted that, “Even if we all decided to stop emitting CO2 immediately, it would take at least 20 years to start putting new [low-carbon or carbon-free] systems in place, and another 50 years for the climate to adjust (qtd. in Weeks, “Climate Change” …show more content…
According to the International Agency, “More than 40 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2010 came from electricity and heat generation” (qtd. in Weeks, “Climate Change” 528). Meanwhile, natural events, such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions, account for less than 10% of carbon dioxide emission (528). Furthermore, there are cases where human emissions of greenhouse gases cause other factors to amplify the progress of climate change (Reuss 35). When humans emit greenhouse gases and cause the global temperature to rise, ice melts (35). As a result of the ice melting, the earth has less ice to reflect light back into outer space (35). Consequently, the earth absorbs more sunlight and increases the global temperature. Even indirect actions, such as deforestation, contribute to climate change (35). When deforestation occurs, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (35). This is because there are less trees to undergo a process call carbon sequestration—the act of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it to oxygen (35).  Additionally, the technology used to cut down trees operates on fossil fuels, and this contributes to the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere

Climate is changing in a horrid way. The change is influenced both by natural reason and human activities. El Nino, the Earth surface temperature increased, acid rains and many phenomenons are damaging the environment. Experts are worried about the rapid changing climate, because the change may fetch people many big disasters. Worldwide people are trying to find the solution and save humanity. This essay will discuss how human activities contribute to climate change, and give some advice how to prevent the Earth.
Human activities in causing climate change
It is clear that human activities accelerate the climate change. The first part of essay will canvass 2 human activities that effect climate change.
Burning fossil fuels
The earth surface temperature increasing owe to greenhouse gases, because they carry the short-wave radiation from the Sun to the Earth (NSW Department of Primary Industries, 2008). Obviously, more greenhouse gases mean severe climate change. Before showing the reasons of greenhouse gases growth, people need to understand what greenhouse gases are. The reason why people call these gases greenhouse gases is because they work like a glass greenhouse that heats up with the radiation trapped by the glass (NSW Department of Primary Industries, 2008). Greenhouse gases are not just one kind of gas, actually it includes ‘water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide’ (NSW Department of Primary Industries, 2008:2). Obviously, because of the high-level greenhouse gases concentration, the temperature became higher than before. However, burning fossil fuels are the arch-criminal of rising greenhouse gases in atmospheric has accelerated. Excessive human emissions also caused 1.4 Â°F gone up in the past century (Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, 2008b). Burning fossil fuels not only cause greenhouse gases to contribute to climate change, but also sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contribute to climate change because of their ability to create acid rain. Acid rains which have baneful influences on buildings, trees and animals are also bad for climate (John, S et al. 2006).

Overuse of the natural resources
Apart from burning fossil fuels, the reason why climate change in such a fast way is overuse of the natural resources. The natural resources on the Earth are limited, no matter non-renewable resources or renewable resources. It seems that the growing population of mankind does not realize the facts; people always exploit more resources than people’s requirement to make sure the trend of growth. Conspicuously, overuse the nature resources becomes one part of causation led to climate change. People knows that many daily supplies made from wood, such as papers, some clothes and furniture, ordered more and more trees felled. As previously mentioned, greenhouse gases are bad for climate, and one of the methods to decrease is more plants. Tress can absorb carbon dioxide, and mitigate the consistency of greenhouse gases. However, the bad news is that the solution is dissatisfying for overusing the natural resources. As a result, deforestation exacerbates the climate. On the other hand, deforestation also conduces to desertification which contributes on climate change. Land degradation can also lead to environmental degradation, poverty, migration and the cycle of conflict, but also often affected countries and regions, political stability risks (UNCCD: United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, 2009). People who live here need to deforest to earn money to make live.
Outline further deterioration may be prevented
After discussing the human activities, the second part of essay will bring forward 2 solutions that may protect the environment.
Government regime
As mentioned above, burning fossil fuels is one of the human activities that contribute to climate change. Factories create electricity by burning fossil fuels. To solve the problems, government regime seems to be an indispensable method. Nowadays, there is an effective policy that is accepted in Australia and some European countries, which named ‘cap and trade’ (Minter-Ellison, 2007). The regime relate to ‘electricity generation, transport, industrial process, forestry, agriculture and waste’ (Minter-Ellison, 2007). The policy means government will cap the greenhouse gases emissions for every factory or else. For instance, a factory has to pay for the emissions if it emit more greenhouse gases than the cap, also a factory can sale its emissions if it emit less greenhouse gases than the cap. With government regime, people and factories are encouraged to reduce the measure of burning fossil fuels. This is a good example for government to constitute some policies, order emitters prevent environment on their own inititiative.

Exploit new energy and find how to use the new energy
The second solution is to exploit new energy, and find how to use the new energy. Because people is used to manufacture some fuels by wooden, deforestation is hard to avoid. Account for the problem, to exploit new energy is imminent. Actually some new energy like wind and solar power have been found for many years, but for the limit of science, people can not use the new energy well. For example, people have no idea about solar power when it is cloudy. Fortunately, PSEG Global, a company found the method to use wind and store wind. According to their announcement, when wind power beyond the need of consumer, they will store the wind in underground caverns or in tanks. During the peak hours, the stored wind will release and become energy (Davidson, P. 2008). Besides, scientist also exploited some other new energy and found how to use. E-Coal is one kind of new energy which substitutes for coal. E-Coal was called no greenhouse gases emission fuel, because it was made by biomass, though E-Coal liberate carbon dioxide when burning, E-Coal can absorb equal carbon dioxide during their life (Davidson, P. 2008).
In conclusion, human activities like burning fossil fuels and overusing the natural resources changed climate a lot. Only nowadays people are aware of the importance of environmental, and start to solve the problems. Government and scientists have been working to find the solution. Everyone lives in the Earth, so everybody has to do their best to protect environment.

Burning of fossil fuels: People drive cars. Heat and cool their houses. People cook food. All those activities take energy.
Burning coal, oil, and gas to generate energy ? Burning these things emit gases into the air. The gases cause the air to heat up. This can change the climate of a place
In its 5th Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded that there’s a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth’s temperatures over the past 50 years.
Other causes: Deforestation, changes in land use, soil erosion and agriculture (including livestock), the Industrial revolution, and Mining and Quarrying.
Climate Forcing:
There are a number of natural mechanisms that can upset the global energy balance, for example, fluctuations in the Earth’s orbit, variations in ocean circulation, and changes in the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere.
By altering the global energy balance, such mechanisms “force” the climate to change. Consequently, scientists call them “climate forcing” mechanisms.
Climate ‘ forcing ’ are factors in the climate that either increase or decrease the effects to the climate system.
Positive ‘ forcing ’ such as greenhouse gases warm the earth while the negative ‘ forcing ’ such as the volcanic eruptions, etc. cools the earth system.
Examples of forcing include:
Surface reflectivity (albedo)
Human induced changes in greenhouse gases
Atmospheric aerosols (volcanic sulfates, industrial output)
These examples influence the balance of energy entering and leaving the Earth system.

Climate
1. Climate is the weather conditions that are happening in certain areas for a long period of time. The climate has an affect on everything that is living on this planet. Right now the Earth is experiencing climate change. Climate change is when the temperature and weather conditions of the Earth are changing. Climate change is something that has been naturally occurring on the Earth for millions of years, but right now we are experiencing the most rapid climate change the Earth has ever undergone.
2. Climate change used to happen naturally, but right now we are having the first climate change that has been caused by humans. Humans have are the key reason to climate change right now, and it is because of the massive amounts of pollutants we are putting into our atmosphere. Gasses like methane and carbon dioxide are causing the Earth’s temperature to rise 1.53 degrees fahrenheit from 1880 to 2012.
3. Climate change is causing natural disasters like tsunamis, hurricanes, and droughts which are affecting humans, animals, plants, and many other organisms. Many arctic animals are running out of places to live or find food due to melting ice caps, pants and crops are dying due to natural disasters like droughts, and humans are experiencing water shortages and poor crop yields because of climate change.

According to the new Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2013, in Southeast Asia, temperature has been increasing at a rate of 0.14 to 0.20 degree Celsius per decade since the 1960s while rainfall from extreme rain days has increased by 10 millimeters per decade. Both of these increments are caused by climate change. In addition to increase of temperature and extreme precipitations, climate change also increases landslides, exacerbates soil erosion, causes flooding, and raises the sea level (Barnett et al. 2007). Previously, climate change was believed to happen naturally. However, over the years, scientists have started to argue that anthropogenic factors are the main contributor. Scientists have also been more confident and forthright in informing the public that climate change is caused by human activities. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report mentions that “human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history” (2013). In addition, most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic Green House Gas (GHG) concentrations (IPCC AR4 2007). In fact, there are many other anthropogenic impacts that cause climate change. In this paper, I will discuss the impacts of climate change on wetlands, forest fires and tropical cyclones in Southeast Asia, and the adaptations

What Role Has Human Activity Played in Causing Climate Change?
The change in global climate is the most powerful problem that currently occurs on the earth. The problems of climate change may be caused by both of human activities and natural events. Climate change is the changes that affect the world’s weather, including shifts in temperature, ocean level, land, and precipitation. The climate change phenomenon can affect everything in the world not only natural environment, but also human society, and the world economy. This essay aims to evaluate the role of

Introduction
Do Humans Cause Climate Change Or Not Is Too Broad?
The question of whether humans caused climate change or not is too broad. There are many theories saying global warming was caused by humans, but there are also many saying the way the Earth evolves naturally causes global warming. There are so many scientific ideas on this, but overall it is people’s opinions.
Personally I am on both sides of the cause. I think it is both true and false that humans have caused climate change. I cannot decide which one makes more sense or could be a greater cause
Climate change is a change in the atmospheric layers of Earth that is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide levels concentrated in the atmosphere.This change is impacting Earth and will continue to do so if nothing is going to be done to reduce its effects. Climate change is the main cause of many natural disasters that happened in the past and are still happening today such as Hurricane Irma which is considered to be the strongest hurricane to ever hit the United States after Hurricane Katrina
The climatic changes have been an issue of controversies around scientists, politicians, and people in general. Indeed, there are many aspects in which climatic changes and global warming step in, being sources of controversies and disagreements. In this opportunity, the discussion about climatic changes will be divided into two different aspects, the first one involves how scientists think about the main cause of climatic changes while analyzing the question “Are humans responsible for climatic

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one to get a better understanding of how humans are causing climate change.

First document is from 123HelpMe, titled "The Causes Of Climate Change." It explains that climate change is a serious issue exacerbated by human activities, and it's important to understand that humanity is the primary cause. The essay mentions that carbon dioxide concentrations are at their highest in three million years due to increased human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. It also explains the feedback loops, like melting ice reducing reflection of sunlight and leading to further warming.

Second document is from UK Essays, titled "Human activity causing climate change." This essay reiterates that human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels and overusing natural resources, are accelerating climate change. It discusses how burning fossil fuels increases greenhouse gases and causes acid rain, while overusing natural resources leads to deforestation and desertification. The essay then proposes solutions like government policies (cap and trade) and exploiting new energy sources to mitigate these issues.

Third document is from ForumIAS Blog, titled "CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE: Anthropogenic." It concisely lists human activities causing climate change, including burning fossil fuels, deforestation, changes in land use, agriculture, the industrial revolution, and mining and quarrying. It also mentions the concept of climate forcing, where certain mechanisms can alter the global energy balance, leading to climate change.

Fourth and fifth documents are both from Bartleby, with similar titles: "Climate Change Is Caused By Humans" and "Climate Change Is Caused By Human Activities." Both essays emphasize that human activities are the main cause of current climate change, supported by scientific reports like those from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They discuss the impacts of climate change, such as natural disasters and environmental degradation, and the need for adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Looking across these documents, there's a consistent message: human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices, are the main drivers of current climate change. These activities increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and associated climate changes.

I think I have enough information to summarize how humans are causing climate change. Let me organize my thoughts:

1. **Burning Fossil Fuels:** The combustion of coal, oil, and gas for energy releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This increases the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and leading to global warming.

2. **Deforestation:** Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 through photosynthesis. This not only decreases the planet's capacity to remove CO2 but also releases stored carbon when trees are burned or left to decompose.

3. **Agricultural Practices:** Livestock farming, especially cattle, produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Rice paddies and other agricultural activities also emit methane and nitrous oxide, another strong greenhouse gas.

4. **Industrial Processes:** Various industrial activities release greenhouse gases and other pollutants that contribute to climate change.

5. **Land Use Changes:** Conversion of natural landscapes for urban development or agriculture can alter the local and global climate by changing how heat and moisture are exchanged between the land and the atmosphere.

These human activities have led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, surpassing natural variability. The evidence for this is substantial, supported by scientific research and international bodies like the IPCC.

In conclusion, human activities are the primary cause of current climate change, mainly through the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices. Addressing climate change requires substantial reductions in these emissions and adoption of sustainable practices.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices, are the main causes of current climate change by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.}}
