Alright, I need to think about the lasting effects of World War II on international relations. That's a big topic, so I should probably break it down into smaller parts. First, I need to recall when World War II took place. It was from 1939 to 1945, right? So, it ended over 70 years ago, but its impacts are still felt today in various ways.

I remember that after World War I, there were efforts to prevent another large-scale conflict through organizations like the League of Nations, but that didn't stop World War II from happening. After World War II, the United Nations was established with the aim of maintaining international peace and security. So, that's one significant effect on international relations.

Let me think about other organizations that came out of World War II. There's also the NATO alliance, which was formed in 1949 by the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Warsaw Pact on the other side during the Cold War. These were both direct responses to the geopolitical tensions that arose after World War II.

Speaking of the Cold War, that was a prolonged period of political and military tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies. It started shortly after World War II and lasted until the early 1990s. So, the division of the world into two opposing blocs can be traced back to the aftermath of World War II.

Another aspect is the decolonization process. Many countries in Asia and Africa gained independence in the decades following World War II. This was partly due to the weakening of European powers during the war and the shifting global dynamics. So, the end of colonial empires is another lasting effect on international relations.

I should also consider the establishment of new nation-states and the redrawing of borders after the war. For example, Israel was created in 1948, which has had profound implications for Middle Eastern politics ever since.

Economically, the Marshall Plan was implemented to rebuild European economies after the war, which not only helped in recovery but also strengthened ties between the U.S. and Europe.

Additionally, the development and use of nuclear weapons during World War II led to a arms race and the concept of mutually assured destruction, which has shaped international relations and diplomacy in the nuclear age.

I should probably look up some specific details to make sure I have accurate information. Maybe I can search for "lasting effects of World War II on international relations" to get some concrete points.

8 Factors that have Changed International Relations after World War II
8 Factors that have Changed International Relations after World War II

ADVERTISEMENTS:
International Relations has been defined in various ways. Writers differ  greatly on the definition of the subject.
It appears quite natural, as does Stanley Hoffman says: ”How could one agree  once for all upon the definition of a field whose scope is in constant flux,  indeed, a field whose fluctuation is one of the principal charac­teristics.”
International Relations defined. Prof. Charles Schleicher defines  international relations as the relations among States.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Quincy Wright defines international politics as “relations between groups of  major impor­tance in the life of the world at any period of history.”
According to Prof. Hans J. Morgenthau, international relations is a struggle  for power among nations. Norman Padelford and George Lincoln define  interna­tional relations as the interaction of State-politics within the  changing pattern of power relationships.
However, a good working definition of international relations has been given  by Harold and Margaret Sprout.
They define international relations as “those aspects of interactions and  relations of independent political communities in which some element of  opposition, resistance, or conflict of purpose or interest is present.”

Factors that have influenced International Relations after Second World War.  Since the Second World War, international relations has changed very much in  content and nature.
This is due to the result of various factors in national and international  spheres. It means study of international relations must take into account the  sociological nature of current events.
But it should also be borne in mind that it also requires an understanding of  the pre-Second World War period because interna­tional relations has retained  many of the old features also.
In those days, nations were eager to acquire and increase their power while  preventing other States from doing so. “Politics among nations in those by-gone  days, accordingly, became prescriptive, competitive, hostile and basically enemy  based.”
ADVERTISEMENTS:
It was a world of nation-States possessing sovereignty that must be  safeguarded at every cost.
But after the Second World War, a great change in the concept of sovereignty,  nature of conflict among nations, concept of national interest, and means to  achieving it has occurred. This change has come about in international relations  due to the following factors:
1. Politico-geographic setting:
The politico-geographic setting of the world has changed considerably after  the end of the Second World War. With decolonization, a number of new nations  have developed that want to assert themselves in the community of nations.
There is an increase in population but not evenly. Although colonization has  come to an end formally, the exploitation of the poor by the richer and  developed countries still continues.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
All these things have made an impact on inter­national relations as discussed  under.
(a) Increase in the number of States:
Up to the beginning of the Second World War, Europe continued to decide upon  the question of war and peace in the world. A few European States determined the  destinies of the whole world.
These States included Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, the  Netherlands, Spain etc. International politics at the time was not only  Europe-dominated, it was also Europe- centered.
However, the Second World War brought about a complete change in this  picture. With the defeat of Germany, Italy and Japan, the inter­national centers  of powers shifted from Europe to the United States and the Soviet Union.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The European colonial powers were so weakened that they could no longer  maintain their overseas colonies. With decolonization a large number of  independent nations grew up in Asia and Africa.
The number of U.N. membership that was only 51 in 1945 has risen to 155. This  shows that there is almost a triple multiplication in the number of States. All  the States are eager to assert their interest in international relations.
So, international relations of today is really international in character  because all the States insist on participating actively. Thus, the scope and  nature of international politics has entirely changed. It has become highly  complex and complicated.
Consequently, the concept of national interest has also changed. The methods  of achieving national interest have also changed. In place of national interest,  accommodation has to be made for the international interest.
In addition, the new States are faced with the problems of modernisation,  political stability, economic development, administrative efficiency and  territorial integrity. The smaller nations have thus to deter­mine their  national interest keeping well in mind those problems.
It has its effect upon the multi-State interest which determines the .nature  of conflict and consequently of international politics.
(b) Rapid but uneven growth of population in various  countries:
Population is increasing rapidly throughout the world. But it is increasing  unevenly. In China and India it is growing at a terrific speed. It is estimated  that by the year 2,000, Asia will have two-thirds of the world’s people living  in it.
More population demands more production of food-stuffs. It drains fastly the  mineral, food and energy sources. It means housing shortage leading to  over-crowding as also shrinking of living space.
It means great pressure on services such as public health, education,  transportation and the like. All this will naturally lead to social frictions,  tensions, competition and eventual conflict.
Politics in the internal sphere has its effect upon international politics  leading to great explosion and destruction.
This explosive situation would be increased by the uneven growth of  population. The over-populated countries will exert undue pressure on the less  populated countries who would naturally resent resulting in tension and conflict  in international politics.
(c) Ever widening gap between the Rich and Poor Countries:
The gap in riches is also a result of over-population. The thickly popu­lated  countries become poor due to lack of proper resources.
A vicious circle is set in which the rich countries get richer while the poor  countries become poorer. The rich countries are not ready to help the poor  countries with the result that they become a target of jealously of the poor  countries.
Even in spite of the best of the efforts made, the new and the poor nations,  have not been in a position to set their economy on a sound footing. People in  those countries live even below the line of poverty.
They cannot raise the standard of living of their people. The rich nations  are reluctant to lend aid without conditions. They keep their own national  interest in view. Under these circumstances, pressures and tension develop.
India has consistently been warning the richer nations to help the poor  nations to bridge the gulf separating them or the events would turn dangerously  against them.
A realisation has come upon the developing countries that their lot cannot be  improved unless and until the richer and developed countries help in the  creation of a new international economic order where exploi­tation of the poor  and underdeveloped countries of the world stops.
The developing countries have formed a sort of a trade union known as the  Group of 77, to press for a new international economic order both in and outside  the United Nations.
In all the United Nations conferences on Trade and Development and the  Industrial Development, collective stand is taken by the Group of 77.
But the sad fact that still continues is that the richer and developed  nations are not still prepared to bring the under­developed and developing  countries at par and end their exploitation.
2. Mad race for Modernisation and Development:
All the new emergent States of the world are trying to modernise and develop  them­selves. They have placed before themselves the Western models of  development.
They want to attain the same standard of living as prevailing in those  countries. In this attempt, they do not appear to be a success in view of the  fact that the conditions prevailing in Western countries are far different from  those prevailing in their country.
Moreover the Western countries took centuries to achieve their present  standard of modernisation and political development while the new nations want  to achieve the same results within only a few years. This is not possible. In  their effort, they have rather seen decline and decay.
The democratic apparatus as for instance parliamentary system, party system  etc. have failed to work well. Rather, they have declined.
The urge for satisfying material wants and achieving higher standard of  living has brought about changes accompanied by wide-spread political and  economic developments which have created an unprecedented ferment and change in  the internal life of those countries.
Internal circumstances influence external behaviour of the States. This  results sometimes in aggressive and dangerous attitudes.
3. Nation-State today:
There has developed a great change in the position and character of the  nation-State which has in turn affected international relations.
Prof. John H. Herz and Kenneth Boulding hold that the nuclear age has  rendered the nation-State and the concept of sovereignty quite out of date and  meaningless.
According to Herz, in the classical system of international relations the  weaker States were always exposed to the threat of stronger powers. It was the  duty of the nation-State to protect those living in its territory.
The main characteristics of the State were power, independence and  sovereignty. With the development of new military techniques and technology,  modern techniques of administration, economic growth, transport and  communications, the rise of nationalism, grew the modern State system.
The modern State system differs radically from that of the past. But still it  retains some of the old characteristics. The old State system was confined  almost exclusively to Europe.
The modern State system has spread all over the world. The spirit of  nationalism has inspired States into self-determining national groups.
The spirit of nationalism has led to the birth of new States out of ruins of  old empires built by the colonial powers. No one can deprive a nation of its  independence.
At the same time, there has been a great increase in the military power,  sustained progress in culture and steady economic growth in the world. There has  also been seen an increased competence of the States to maintain effective  administrative controls over its people.
Moreover, the new trends and factors such as Economic Welfare,  Ideological-Political generation, Air Warfare and Nuclear Warfare have changed  the character of war and consequently of international system. Rapid economic  growth and industrialisation has shown that no State is self-sufficient.
This has lead to the realisation that economic independence among themselves  is a must. Efforts have also been made to bring under one’s influence areas  which produce raw-materials, especially the strategic ones.
One has now to defend not only the territory of its State but also the  raw-material producing areas under its control. More than anything else, the air  warfare in this nuclear age has affected the territoriality of States and made  them totally subject to invasion and penetration.
War has also become total and no part of the earth can remain safe. Herz  concludes that all these factors have changed the principles of territoriality  and sovereignty.
Boulding goes a step further-and holds that the revolution in com­munications  has shrunk the world in size and exposed every part of the world to aerial  warfare. Every nation can destroy every other nation with equal danger of  self-destruction.
So every nation today exists with the permission of other States. So  sovereignty has been replaced by conditional viability of the State.
Thus, modern State can no longer discharge its function of defense which is a  manifestation of sovereignty.
Secondly, this sovereignty has restricted with the establishment of  international organisations with truly world-wide scope The regional  organisations like European Common Market, NATO etc., have also worked in the  same direction.
Complete independence is thus hard to think and realise. Consequently, it is  groups rather than individual States that deal with one another. The State  system has thus been replaced by International System.
(4) Democratization of International Politics:
Up to the end of the nineteenth century, the foreign policy of a State was  formulated by a very small number of chosen people.
The common masses had no say whatsoever in the process of Government and,  therefore, no say in diplo­macy. Diplomacy was thus conducted by a small  privileged or elite group. International politics was thus a game between a few  selected people of the world.
Moreover, the number of States involved in international politics was very  small. The whole of Asia and Africa was under the control of colonial powers  such as Great Britain, France etc.
International relations was thus confined within a few states of Europe. It  was essentially Europe- based. Europe decided the fate of the whole world. Thus  not only the masses in various States but also a great number of States in the  world did not take part in the game of international relations.
With the death of colonialism and the spread of egalitarianism (social  welfare), more and more people are concerned with the formulation of foreign  policy. They come not from any particular class in society but from the society  as a whole.
All the political parties have their own respective views on foreign policy.  The people conducting foreign policy are chosen on the basis of competitive  examination. It is not the privilege of a single class.
This has resulted in the effectiveness of public opinion in foreign policy.  We are familiar how V.K. Krishna Menon was forced to resign as the Defense  Minister of India at his failure to handle properly the Indian Defense at the  time of Chinese aggression in 1962.
We can understand very well that no Government in India can afford to sustain  by taking an un favorable stand on the Kashmir issue.
Democratisation has led to what is sometimes called the ‘socialisa­tion of  foreign policy’ also. It means no State can afford to pursue a fore­ign policy  that goes against the ideals of peace.
That is, no State can afford to ignore the material welfare of its people.  Foreign policy thus serves an instrument through which standard of living of the  people and overall economic development is secured.
This is especially so in the case of developing countries who have become  independent only recently. Foreign policy is no longer the sole concern of the  Ministry of External Affairs. It also deals with defense, trade and commerce,  culture, economic affairs etc.
(5) The Four Revolutions:
Since Second World War. We have witnessed four kinds of revolutions working  in different countries of the world. These revolutions are:
(a) Social Revolution;
(b) National Revolution;
(c) Information Revolution; and
(d) Technological Revolution.
(a) Social Revolution:
It refers to the various movements that aim at eliminating discrimination  based on caste, creed, class etc., and to bring about equality in society.  Social evils like casteism, untouchability etc., have been sought to be  eradicated.
The Constitutions of almost all the newly independent countries of the world  have sought to promote equality, social justice and universal civil liberty.  Chances have, therefore, been created to ensure equality of opportunity and  participation.
This aspect of revolution is particularly important for international  relations in so far as the African countries dominated by the whites are  concerned. The coloured people are waging a relentless struggle to end white  supremacy.
The most recent example of the success of the coloured people against the  whites is provided by the freedom of Zimbabwe Rhodesia from the rule of the  whites.
The impact of such like struggles does not remain confined to the internal  affairs of that country alone but has repercussions on international relations  also.
(b)National Revolution:
It refers to the consciousness on the part of a nation to get freedom from  foreign domination. This conscious­ness came as a result of the arrogance and  exploitation shown by the colonial powers.
This consciousness was also stimulated as a result of the fact that the  people of these countries fought at various fronts in various parts of the world  and thus became acquainted with democratic institu­tions running in European  countries.
They felt the urge to have the same kind of democratic institutions in their  own countries as well. Even the Allies declared that they were fighting to make  the world safer for democracy.
Naturally, this slogan gave encouragement to the slave nations to rise and to  strive for independence. Moreover, the colonial powers had themselves become so  weak economically and otherwise that they were no longer in a position to  continue with their old colonial policy.
All these factors gave rise the spirit of nationalism. Even some great  countries like the United States took a sympathetic attitude towards these  nationalist movements. It is why America favoured and worked for Indian  independence.
Soviet Russian also took a leading role in the cause of national freedom in  Asia and Africa.
(c)Information Revolution:
There has been great advance in almost every kind of knowledge. This has been  particularly so in the scientific field with the result that today we know  everything about the various regions and countries of the world. No corner of  the world remains unexplored.
Our knowledge of the geographical features and phenomena such as economic,  political and cultural, in every part of the world, is quite complete and up to  date. Information in every branch of science particularly outer space, planets  and stars has grown particularly during the last thirty years.
All this is the result of revolution brought in the media of information such  as newspapers, radio, T.V., journals and information services all over the  world.
Correct information helps a country to know reality about other countries and  to formulate balanced and rational policy towards others.
Information removes ignorance and misunderstanding. Naturally, international  relations has been affected by this revolution in information.
(d)Technological Revolution:
Above all, the present age has been called “the century of technology”. It is  because great advances have been made in the field of technology.
Developments in technology have helped industrial revolution and built sound  economy of the nation concerned to the extent that political prestige and power  of those countries in the world has increased.
As a result of technological advances, there has been improvement in the  means of communications. This has helped in shortening distance. The area of the  world has shrunk. In addition, the mobility of the people has increased.
Goods and services move from one part to the other part of the world bringing  about interdepen­dence. Ideas fly and have effect on the people living in other  parts of the world.
But this technological revolution has affected the conduct of war the most.  It is in this field that technology has brought destructive element.
The atomic, thermo-nuclear and neutron weapons, the supersonic air-craft  fitted with nuclear weapons and inter-continental range, unmanned missiles with  nuclear warheads, nuclear powered submarines etc. have made war so destructive  that no trace of humanity will be left after it.
Consequently, war has become total in which not only all the people take part  but it is fought with total risks also. The overkill potentiality of these  developments have created in the world, what Churchill called, the balance of  terror.
This balance of terror is responsible for averting Third World- War. Any  future war will mean destruction of the whole world. It will mean destruction of  the whole humanity.
It will mean no existence after war as a restrict of radio-active radiation.  The nations having atomic power are fully aware of this fact and that is why  they avoid con­frontation.
It is on this basis that Prof. P.M.S. Blacket, a well-known physicist,  believed that nuclear weapons will never be used.
No denying the fact that any nation who takes initiative in unleash­ing  nuclear warfare will score in the beginning.
But retaliation within minutes will destroy the initiator also. There will be  no victor and no vanquished. It will be a victory of “dying over the dead”.
War has thus become an unreliable means of international relations. Although  war is the final decisive factor, yet it has become difficult to resort to war.  War has to fought but it cannot be fought.
To use force or not, has thus become a dilemma in international relations. An  ordinary war may at any moment turn out to be a nuclear war. The risk involved  may lead to perpetuation of injustice.
We find that Soviet Russia had to yield in 1962 over the question of Cuba  when the United States asked Russia to dismantle its nuclear warheads in Cuba or  be prepared to face -the risk.
It is due to the risks involved in war that the boundary dispute between  India and China, the problem of Palestine and Pakhtoonistan still continue.  These problems would have been solved through war in the pre-nuclear days.
Then, the fantastic pace of research, innovations and advances in military  technology in the nuclear age make the world quite unstable. Nobody can say  certainly what will happen the next hour.
This is what Professor John Herz calls as the ‘Indefinite/less of the Nuclear  Age Indefiniteness refers to uncertainty regarding the nature of a possible  future war and the number of countries that may become nuclear powers in the  near future.
As a result of technological revolution, says Herz, the concept of  territorial State has become meaningless. This revolution has its impact upon  economics and politics of contemporary international relations.
Zbligniew Brezezlnski holds that “under the pressure of economics, science  and technology, mankind is moving steadily toward large scale co-opera­tion.
Despite periodic reverses, all human history clearly indicates progress in  this direction.” In this way, technology has served as a kind of force  responsible for bringing about a large scale co-operation resulting in the death  of the concept of the system of separate nation-States.
The requirements of economic and technological advances have gone beyond the  frontiers of political units called nation-States.
Even for the satisfac­tion of domestic needs, Governments have to pursue  foreign policy objectives through international means.
We find that the multinational corporations have afforded new means for the  developed nations to exploit their industrial and intellectual advantages.
On the other hand, certain scholars believe that technological revolution  enhance rather then undermines national autonomy. Karl W. Deutscn holds that  “the increase in the responsibilities of national Government for such matters,  as social welfare and the regulation of economic life has greatly increased the  importance of the nation in the lives of its members “
Summing up the impact of technological revolution on international relations  we can say that it has made war the most dreadful course and instead increased  co-operation among States.
The traditional use of force has declined and in its place economic and  commercial relations have developed. This has led to the cultivation of new  political arrangements.
(6) Emergence of Bipolarity:
The net result of the (Second World-War was a death blow to the concept of  Multi polarity and the rise of Bipolarity. Before the Second World-War, about  seven nations of the world were great powers around which the relations of the  world revolved.
The war brought about their ruin to the extent that they could, no longer  continue as great powers. They lost not only the position but also the will to  continue as such. It was the U.S.A. and the USSR with opposite ideologies and  economic systems that rose as the two super-powers.
In order to widen their areas of influence, they indulged in propaganda  advocating the benefits of their respective ideology and economic system to the  newly independent States of Asia and Africa.
As a result of the emergence of bipolarity, a substantial change occurred in  the structure of the international system. A mad race for the alliances was  started by USA and USSR.
The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in April. 1949 in reaction to the Prague  Coup of 1948 and the Soviet blockade of Berlin. The NATO was to serve as an  instrument of Western Political solidarity and collective defense.
This resulted in the creation of an atmosphere of Cold-War. In response to  the entry of West Germany into NATO in 1955, the USSR concluded Warsaw Treaty  with other East European nations.
(7) End of Bipolarity:
However, the period between 1962 and 1972 is the most confused and  revolutionary period in the history of the international system. The unrivalled  supremacy of the two super powers came to an end.
Dispute between USSR and China erupted and USA had to readjust its relations  with Europe on a new basis. Various new nations emerged in Asia and Africa as a  result of the concept of nationa­lism that grew in these continents.
All these things changed international environment to a considerable extent.  The newly-born nations felt secure by the rivalry of the super powers. They had  good reason to believe that their defense is secured by the over-whelming  interest of their senior partners.
They felt that they need not purchase the support of the super-power by  acquiescing in its policies. Consequently, they began to assert themselves also.  France began to aspire for its old position of superiority in the world.
It began to have talks with the USSR without the approval of the American  bloc. However, the death of President De Gaulle of France brought about a change  in this direction. Great Britain also tried to develop relations with USSR but  failed miserably.
On the other hand, fissures developed in the Communist bloc also. China  developed ideological differences with the USSR that came to the open in 1963.  China has developed closer relations with the USA as against the USSR.  Consequently, bipolar system remained but in a modified form.
The modification of the system of bipolarity was brought about by the rise of  nation-state system and the nuclear stalemate between the USA and the USSR.
(8) Growth of Multi centrism:
In terms of military and economic capabilities, U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. are the  only two super-powers which are entangled directly or indirectly in the affairs  of all other nations. They exceed all other States in the supply of the power to  reward.
Only they have the resources, only they can destroy one another completely  and almost instantly. Only they can thrust the world into nuclear warfare. No  important settlement can be arrived at without their consent.
So, in terms of capacity and aptitude to use fully the corrective power for  the general war, there is a latent bipolar system. It means theoretically that  the voice of the two powers is essential in all matters in which both are  involved, such as disarmament.
Practically, however, the meaning of the preponderance is reduced by their  competition. Moreover, due to nuclear deterrence, both the poles enjoy an  exceptionally high negative productivity.
In their mutual relations they are frustrated by their competition. They do  confront each- other but in fields that are non-military. It is only indirectly  that they involve themselves in military task.
As a result, a kind of multi centrism has come to occupy the world age. This  multi centrism has resulted from the devolution of coercive power. Certain  centres of power, not from the military but other factors of power, have  emerged. This is indeed the most novel element of the present international  system.
The super-powers of today are without power. They suffer from an acute case  of what Raymond Aron calls “the impot­ence of power.” They move away from the  points at which they confront each-other directly with a view to avoiding t he  dilemma of “humiliation or holocaust.”
In this way, a sort of polycentrism both within Communist and the  non-Communist blocs exists. Both the blocs have reached a detente bet­ween  each-other resulting in peaceful co-existence.
The doctrine of peace- full co-existence was indeed coined by Khrushchev. It  was the threat of thermo nuclear war which gave birth to this concept. The  concept of peaceful co-existence brought about transformation in the Soviet  political structure.
This demand for democratization in the political structure came to the  surface more actually in Czechoslovakia which is a highly industrialised  socialist country than the Soviet Union. China lacked this concept being very  backward in industry.

Changes in Post 2nd World War Regarding International Relations
Changes in Post 2nd World War Regarding International Relations
Article shared by :
ADVERTISEMENTS:
After the Second World War, the International System came to be a totally different system from the classical (19th century) international system. The classical international system was Euro-centric and it worked on the principles of balance of power, war as a means, secret diplomacy as an instrument, and narrow nationalism as its objective.
Under the impact of the two world wars, particularly as a result of the Second World War, the nature of international system underwent a big change. Under the impact of the changes that it produced in the international power structure as well as due to the emergence of several new factors, the nature and content of post-war international relations registered an almost total and revolutionary change. It became a new international system and replaced the classical international system.
Changes in Post War International Relations:
1. End of the Traditional Euro-Centric International Power Structure:
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The two wars, particularly the Second World War destroyed the old international power structure and gave rise to a new structure. Before the war, only European nations, particularly Britain, France, Germany and Italy, were the major actors in world politics. The USA used to follow isolationism and the USSR, after 1917, had remained fully occupied with the process of internal consolidation of the socialist system.
After the war:
(i) Germany and Italy became very weak as a result of their defeats in war;
(ii) Britain and France also became weak due to the heavy war losses suffered by them;
ADVERTISEMENTS:
(iii) The war destroyed the balance of power system in Europe;
(iv) There appeared a power vacuum in Europe;
(v) Europe lost its position as the epicenter of international politics;
(vi) A weak Europe set the stage for the liberation of Asian and African countries from the clutches of imperialism and colonialism;
ADVERTISEMENTS:
(vii) The power vacuum in Europe impelled the USA to abandon isolationism and to increase its influence in Europe.
(viii) It compelled the USSR to adopt a similar exercise for increasing its influence in international relations.
These post war changed produced a big change in the international system.
2. Emergence of Cold War:
In the Post-war period, the USA decided to use its superior economic and military position for filling the power vacuum in Europe and for this end decided to win over the democratic European nations through its Marshall Plan. It also adopted the policy of fighting the spread of communism. ‘Containment of Communism’ became the primary aim of US Foreign Policy.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Such an American attempt was thoroughly opposed by the USSR and it also decided to extend its influence in Europe. The success that it achieved in exporting communism to most of the East European countries emboldened it. The emergence of China as a communist power in 1949 gave further strength to Soviet-led communist movement. The USSR adopted the policy of challenging the US policies. In the process, there developed a cold-war—a war of nerves full of tensions and strains in world politics, which made international peace a risky and unstable peace.
3. Emergence of Bipolarity—Bipolar Power Structure:
The emergence of cold war led to the organisation of two competing and rival camps by both the USA and the USSR. The USA floated a large number of bilateral and multilateral alliances like NATO, SEATO, ANZUS and several others for consolidating the democratic anti-communist countries under its own leadership.
The USSR countered the move by organizing the communist countries into the Warsaw Pact. These developments led to the emergence of two rival camps—the US Bloc and the Soviet Bloc, This situation came to be characterised as bipolarity in world politics and it divided the world into two competing and even hostile blocs.
4. Rise of Several New Sovereign States:
After the World War II, the weakened position of the European imperial powers and the strengthened spirit of national self- determination and liberation among the colonies became instrumental in initiating a process of end of colonialism and imperialism in the World. The anti-imperial & anti-colonial movement began registering a stupendous success.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Several nations of the world, particularly Asian and African nations, were successful in overthrowing the yoke of colonialism and imperialism and in securing their independences. There came to be a big increase in the number of sovereign states in the world. Rise of new sovereign states in Asia, and Africa and a resurgent Latin America began giving a completely new look to the world map and international relations.
5. Birth of Non-alignment:
In the era of cold war and alliance politics, some states, particularly some new states, decided to remain away from cold war and the super power alliances. States like India, Yugoslavia, Egypt, and Sri Lanka. Burma (Now Myanmar) and some others decided to follow such a policy. This come to be known as the policy of Non-alignment.
In 1960 the countries following non-alignment in international relations launched the movement of the Non- aligned (NAM) for collectively withstanding the pressures of the era of cold war by taking mutually accepted decisions and policies. The main aim of Non-alignment and NAM was both to keep away from cold war and its alliances as well as to promote mutual understanding and cooperation among the non-aligned states.
6. Democratization of Foreign Policy and Changes in Diplomacy:
The end of the Second World War rejected the thesis of authoritarianism in favour of democracy and under its influence the formulation and implementation of foreign policy became democratic in nature and style. In the 19th century, the foreign policy of a nation was formulated by a class of professional experts—the diplomat and statesman.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
It used to be a close preserve of the Foreign Office and Diplomacy. The democratization of politics however made foreign policy an object of discussion and subjected it to the influence of the common man. National public opinion, press and world public opinion came to be important factors of foreign policy.
The changes in the nature, content and working of foreign policies of various nations resulted in a big change in the nature of post- war international relations. Diplomacy also came out of its old style and colour and it now came to be a new and open diplomacy.
7. Loss of Relevance of Balance of Power:
Between 1815-1914, Balance of Power acted as a regulator of International relations. It suffered a big blow in the First World War. It was revived in 1919, with a new mechanism like the League of Nations, but it again flopped in 1939 when the Second World War broke out.
After the end of the Second World War several big structural changes in the International system as well in the Balance of Power system reduced the operation ability of this device. This rise of two super powers, transformation of war into a total war, the emergence of nuclear weapons, the establishment of the United Nations, the emergence of the process of decline of imperialism- colonialism and several other such factors made Balance of Power system almost obsolete.
8. The Birth of Nuclear Age:
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The final end of the Second World War came with the use of atomic weapons by the USA against Japan. It symbolized the beginning of nuclear age in International Politics. For the first time some countries came to acquire means capable of destroying the entire world. The nuclear factor divided the nations into nuclear nations and non-nuclear nations, the former enjoying superiority in power relations over the latter.
The two super powers came to enjoy, as Max Lerner observed, the capacity of “over kill”. Both, the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. could destroy the entire world but no other nation individually or collectively could destroy or defeat the super powers. War became a total war and the world found itself dependent on the policies and activities of the two super powers.
9. Transformation of War into Total War:
Nuclear weapons changed the nature of war from a Simple war to total war. These made the war totally destructive. No nation whether nuclear or non- nuclear, could hope to survive a future war since it was bound to be a thermo-nuclear war.
10. Balance of Terror in place of Balance of Power:
The traditional concept of balance of power became obsolete in the face of the fact that it became impossible to create a preponderance of power against any aggressor backed by a nuclear power. The Balance of Power got replaced by a Balance of Terror which made the international system very dangerous and risky. The fear of mutually assured total destruction (MAD) through accidental war began haunting the policy-makers of all the nations.
11. A New Desire for Peace:
The two World Wars within a short span and the possibility of a much more destructive, rather totally destructive, Third World War made humankind highly conscious of the need for preserving and strengthening international peace and security. The urge for securing peace became stronger than ever before.
12. Increasing Interdependence among Nations:
After the end of the Second World War, International relations began developing a truly global character in which each nation began finding its national interests inseparably bound up with the interests of other nations as well as with international interests of peace, security and development. This realization and the growing interdependence of the world became instrumental in giving a vital and welcome strength to the cause of peaceful and cooperative international relations.
13. Birth of the UNO:
ADVERTISEMENTS:
The failure of the League of Nations to maintain peace after the First World War was mostly due to the shortcomings of the Covenant of the League as well as because of the not fully representative character of the League. Consequently, after the Second World War, the statesmen felt no hesitation in agreement to establish a new international organisation—the United Nations Organisation which came into existence on 24 October, 1945.
The UNO was designed to act as an effective platform for international diplomacy designed to secure international peace and security, and development through collective efforts of all the nations. The UN assumed the responsibility to maintain international peace and security by promoting friendly cooperation among the member states. Along with it, the UN Charter laid down a collective security system as the new device of power management in international relations.
14. Recognition of the Role of Power in International Relations:
In the post-war period the factor of power came to be accepted as an incontrovertible fact of international relations. It was realized that each nation is always prepared to use its national power to secure the goals of her national interest. It was further realized that the role of power in international relations was direct and the nature of interactions among nations reflected a continuous struggle for power. To analyze international politics as a struggle for power or as a set of interactions involving power, came to be a very popular approach in International Politics.
15. Emergence of the Age of Technology:
In the post-1945 years, man’s ability to use the knowledge of scientific inventions for the welfare of humankind got greatly enhanced. It was because of this fact that 20th century came to be known as the age of technology. Science and Technology began playing a big role in changing the environment of international relations.
As a result of technological revolution, there began appearing a revolutionary development in spheres of industry, transport, communications, agriculture and military. The resultant economic growth became instrumental in producing big changes in the nature of international relations.
The change in the concept of war from a simple war to a total war gave a new dimension to international relations. The revolutionary developments in the fields of transport and communication increased the scope and frequency of relations among nations. The rapid technological development in the developed countries made them economically and militarily stronger enough to maintain a neo-colonial control over the newly emerged developing countries.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Their monopoly over advanced technology and the disinclination to share its benefits with all other nations produced a sharp division nations—the developed and the under-developed or developing nations. The relations between the developed and under-developed later on became a focal issue of post-1945 international relations.
16. Emergence of a Peace Movement:
The two World Wars within a short duration and the possibility of a much more destructive, rather totally destructive Third World War made humankind highly conscious of the need for preserving and strengthening international peace and security. The urge for securing peace became stronger than ever before. There appeared a welcome peace movement in international relations. This encouraged nations to work for mutual welfare and development. They became highly conscious of the need for development through mutual cooperation and goodwill.
17. Rapidly Increasing Interdependence among Nations:
After the end of the Second World War, international relations began developing a truly global character in which each nation began finding its national interests inseparably bound up with the interests of all other nations as well as with international interests of peace, security and development.
This realization and the interdependent nature of international community became instrumental in giving a vital and welcome strength to the cause of peaceful and orderly international relations. Peace became a cherished value and it gave a purpose to international relations i.e. to find ways and means for securing and strengthening stable and durable peace in the world. These gave an encouraging and welcome direction to post-war international relations.
18. End of the Traditional International System:
The international system of post-war period became totally different from the classical international system in several ways:
(1) Power scarcity that characterised the classical international system got replaced by power surplus (Nuclear weapons, overkill capacity and two super powers) in the new system.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
(2) The Balance of power got replaced by a Balance of Terror.
(3) The formulation and implementation of foreign policy became a more complicated and democratic exercise.
(4) A big change in world political relations took place as a result of the rise of new states, and the liquidation of imperialism and colonialism.
(5) Peace, security, development and prosperity for all the nations got recognized as a value in international relations.
(6) There developed an arms race between the two super powers and the exercise became more dangerous because of the birth of nuclear arms race.
(7) Because of increase in the number of states, there came to be developed several new problems and international relations became highly complex.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
(8) The presence of the United Nations gave a new look to the post-war international system.
(9) New and Open Diplomacy came to replace the old and secret diplomacy.
(10) The presence of two competing, in fact rival super powers set the stage for the emergence of cold war and bi-polarity in international relations.
(11) The transformation of war into a total war made it much more dreaded and the nations became more and more interested in preserving international peace and security.
(12) All the nations became conscious of the need for preserving peace through a better and effective device of power management i.e. collective security.
Thus the Second World War had a big impact on the nature of international relations. Post-War International system came to be a system totally different from the pre-war international system.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
After the Second World War, the International System came to be a totally different system from the classical (19th century) international system. The classical international system was Euro-centric and it worked on the principles of balance of power, war as a means, secret diplomacy as an instrument, and narrow nationalism as its objective.
It came to be replaced by a new international system which was characterised by two super powers, cold war, bipolarity, non-alignment, anti-imperialism, the UNO, the presence of several new sovereign states in the world, N-weapons and the threat of Total War. This new international system continued to work, almost unchanged, till the last decade of the 20th century when it came to be a Post-Cold War, Unipolar International System experiencing a new liberalisation and globalisation.

The Relationships Between Countries after World War II
The atomic age, composed of complex and controversial issues, has forever changed our world and the way in which we live.  Although peace rang out throughout the world September 2, 1945, the relationships between countries after World War II will never be the same.  "In 1939 there were four great powers in Europe:  Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain; and three outside Europe, Russia, the United States, and Japan" (284 Gilbert).  By the end of World War II in 1945, only two great powers remained: the United States and the Soviet Union.

During this time the United States tried to get the productions of atomic weapons produced in other countries reduced.  This failed when the Soviet Union did not let the United States inspect their atomic plants.  This refusal by the Soviet Union caused the United States to continue developing and producing atomic weapons.
In the Soviet Union, Stalin established a system of government with effective state control by hiring secret police.  This enabled Stalin to establish communist dictatorships in other countries.   Stalin started the cold war in 1945 because the Soviet Union wanted to establish other communist countries. (If you want to know more about the cold war go to the following link.) http://ac.acusdedu/history/20th/coldwar.html  The United States issued NATO, a mutual defense pact,  to help the smaller countries from becoming victims of the Soviet Union.  Unfortunately, Stalin established a communist government in the smaller countries of Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia in the late 1940's.  The Soviet Union, after fighting for parts of Finland throughout the war, gained the Finnish territory after the war.  Finland also had to pay reparations to the Soviet Union for siding with German throughout the war.

The Cold War was a war that lasted about 45 years between the United States and the Soviet Union. Before, in World War II, the U.S. and USSR were allies, but never fully trusted each other. Hitler broke the Nazi-Soviet Pact and invaded the USSR. The U.S. saw this as the perfect opportunity to become allies with the USSR, so they could defeat the Nazis. The U.S. sent an aide to assess the Soviet military situation. During the war, there were several disagreements. The disagreements were over reparations
Cold War Causes
After the surrender of Germany and World War II came to an end, The United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) emerged as the two global superpowers in the world. The two countries put their differences aside during World War II to work together and defeat the axis countries.

International Relations in the Inter-War Years | Schoolshistory.org.uk
International Relations in the Inter-War Years
International Relations in the Interwar Years are dominated by the impact of the First World War, the Peace Settlements and the Great Depression. Attempts to maintain peace and improve living conditions on a global scale saw the introduction of the League of Nations. Peace Settlements saw new countries formed. Economies gradually recovered, until the Wall Street Crash. The rise of the Dictators created challenges. Appeasement was introduced, the League of Nations was tested.
Recovery from War
The First World War had a huge impact on the participating nations. Losses were huge. Millions had died; More had been displaced; Economies were on their knees. The Peace Treaties attempted to tackle the issue of losses, through the imposition of reparations payments. This was a contentious issue, leading to underpayments, occupation of the Rhineland by the French and hyperinflation being deliberately encouraged in Germany.
A more moderate approach was adopted to the defeated nations. The USA broke from it’s self imposed isolationism to finance the Dawes Plan. Europe began to recover. As economies began to recover, International relations improved. Agreements such as the Locarno Pact and the Kellogg-Briand Pact saw promises of a safer future. The Young Plan built on this, enabling longer term stability and, hopefully, continued peaceful relations between the major nations. Attempts such as these continued throughout the interwar period, the Munich Agreement being the last.

League of Nations
The League of Nations was created to fulfil several roles. First and foremost it was an international body that, through arbitration and a series of sanctions, could prevent the outbreak of war. It also looked at worldwide concerns such as disease and education. Numerous issues around the territorial changes caused by the war were successfully dealt with by the League of Nations. Many people, particularly in the third world, saw improvements due to the League’s humanitarian work.
Tensions were present in the 1920’s. Russia had seen the revolutionaries of 1917 go on to win the Russian Civil War. By the early 1920’s it was the Bolsheviks in power in Russia. From 1924, this was a formal Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That altered the political geography of Eastern and North Eastern Europe. The United States was, as far as possible, taking a position of non involvement in other affairs. It was as isolationist as practical.
Wall Street Crash
The relative peace and the growing confidence in the prospects of long term global peace and economic well being were founded on economic growth. That growth was tied to the way that the stock market worked. Investment in companies was done on the basis of medium term gains. Buying and Selling shares looked a good prospect; for ten years there had been sustained growth, it all looked good. However the growth in share prices was far faster than the growth in physical trade. There was a tipping point at which the actual value of the shares in companies around the world, in many sectors, had to be accurately reflected. That tipping point happened in 1929. The Wall Street stock exchange saw a collapse in share prices. The Wall Street Crash saw the value of companies plummet. Many banks and manufacturers had to close. The impact of this globally was huge.
Rise of the Dictators
America could no longer fund the Young Plan. The stock markets in other countries also saw falling values. Many countries went into a deep economic depression. With many people out of work, political parties on the extremes began to become more popular. German elections saw the more radical parties of the left and right take more seats. Successive Governments failed to tackle the economic issues and collapsed. In Germany, Hitler’s Nazi Party took control. Elsewhere dictatorships and absolute monarchies were seemingly more stable, they grew in confidence as other nations struggled.
This led to conflict as these nations began to assert themselves. The Abyssinian and Manchurian Crisis both showed the confidence of these powers. They also tested the League of Nations and highlighted the faults in it’s systems. As the 1930’s continued, challenges to peace and the post World War One treaties increased. The Spanish Civil War erupted and saw the involvement of combatants from most major powers. Nazi Germany pressed home it’s territorial claims, with Appeasement allowing the Remilitarisation of the Rhineland; Anschluss; Sudetenland being ceded to Germany; the Invasion of Czechoslovakia. In the Far east, Imperial Japan also continued to take advantage of turmoil in China.
Munich Agreement: Neville Chamberlain promises Peace in Our Time
The period became one of a struggle to maintain peace. That broke down in September, 1939, with the German invasion of Poland. The Interwar years were also a period in which the arts did flourish though. The Jazz Age had entertained many. Artists had prospered, particularly in the 1920’s. The depths of the Depression also led to some outstanding literary works.

What were the short and long term effects of World War II?
World War II led to the defeat of the Axis Powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—as well as the end of their occupying other countries, including those in Western Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. For the US, the war ended the Great Depression, as the efforts both abroad and domestic put people back to work and solidified the country's place as a world superpower. But WWII also led to the Cold War, which put the US and the Soviet Union against each other.

One long term effect of World War II was to reconfigure the world order. The core of the new world order was reconfigured around NATO in the west and the Soviet-led Warsaw pact countries in Eastern Europe. Britain, long in decline, finally lost its place for good as a world super power, a role taken over by the United States and the Soviet Union, who entered into a rivalry for influence and control over what we would today call Third World nations. Democracy and socialism definitively won over monarchy as governing institutions, and consumer societies in the west became firmly entrenched. Stable alliances between powerful nations such as the United States, France, Britain, and Germany insured peace in Europe over the long term. Israel was established as a state, and the age of imperialism definitively came to end, symbolized when Great Britain in 1947 handed back self governance to India, once the "jewel" in Britain's imperialist "crown."
Long term, too, the spread of nuclear capability forever changed the nature of warfare, with the "total war" of two superpower armies meeting on the battlefield of home countries replaced by a series of proxy wars in remote locales.
In the short term, the entire European continent, including Britain, had to deal with the devastation that war had wrought. Countries lay in ruins and had to be rebuilt. As the one remaining intact industrial power, the United States achieved an immense economic advantage over the rest of the world and broke away in standard of living to greatly surpass the rest of the world for a time.
Although international politics appear to be changing, we still live in the world order forged after World War II, one that has prevented the outbreak of a third world war or a devastating nuclear encounter.

World War II had short-term and long-term effects. One short-term effect was it put an end to the threat posed by the aggressive actions of the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan. These countries were invading other countries and taking over these lands. Much of Western Europe, parts of North Africa, and parts of Asia were occupied by the Axis Powers against the will of the people in these areas. As a result of the defeat of the Axis Powers, they were removed from the land they invaded.
Another short-term effect of World War II was that is got us out of the Great Depression. Putting people to war in the military and war industries helped to end the Great Depression. Then, after World War II ended, we went into a period of significant prosperity. Thus, World War II had economic benefits for us. This eventually turned into a long term effect, as the United States became an economic superpower.
One long-term effect of World War II was it led to the Cold War. For approximately 45 years, the United States and the Soviet Union fought over political and economic ideologies and the spread of these ideologies. We tried to stop the spread of the Soviet Union’s system of communism. This led to confrontations throughout the world in places like Cuba, Europe, and Asia. It wasn’t until 1990, when the communist system collapsed, that this threat subsided.
Another long-term impact of World War II was to reinforce the idea that appeasement doesn’t work as a policy. When the Allies gave in to Hitler’s demands to try to avoid war, it backfired terribly when Hitler took more land later on despite his promise not to do this.

The main short term effect of World War II was to destroy the power of many countries that had previously been relatively strong.  Before WWII, Japan was strong and had an empire.  Before WWII, Germany was a major power.  France was a major power with an overseas empire.  The UK was as well.  After WWII, all of those countries were significantly weakened.  Japan, Germany, and parts of France were devastated physically.  Japan lost its empire immediately.  France and the UK had their economies severely weakened by the war.  In the short term, these changes in the fortunes of nations were the most important effect of the war.
In the long term, there were at least two major effects.  One was that WWII led to the Cold War.  Because the US and the USSR were the only two major powers left in the world, and because their political and economic systems were antithetical to one another, they entered into a decades-long rivalry a few years after WWII ended.  The second major effect of WWII was to make the US the world’s dominant economic power.  All of the countries that had once been competitors to the US were devastated by the war.  The US homeland was not touched by the war and many things about the war (particularly the scientific and engineering advances that came with it) helped the US economy grow.

World War II, in the short term, reduced the number of effective empires in the world to two: the US and the Soviet Union.  The war bankrupted the British and occupied the French, with of course, Germany and Japan being completely defeated.  The American economy boomed both during and after the war, as the jobs and wealth it created took us out of the Great Depression and heavily industrialized the country.
In the long term, the economy remained healthy in the US and the middle class greatly expanded, but the Cold War struggle between the two remaining superpowers would dominate world affairs for half a century, divide countries in Europe and Asia, launch civil wars in dozens of places around the world and begin a very expensive nuclear and conventional arms race.  The atomic bomb invented during World War II could not be uninvented, and in the modern day nuclear proliferation is still a problematic leftover from World War II.

Alright, so I've got this task to figure out what lasting effects World War II has had on international relations. I've done some research and read through a few documents to get a better understanding. Let me try to organize my thoughts here.

First off, World War II was a massive global conflict that ended in 1945, and its impacts are still felt today in various ways. From what I've gathered, one of the most significant immediate effects was the establishment of the United Nations, which was created to maintain international peace and security. This was a direct response to the failures of the League of Nations to prevent the war.

Beyond that, the war led to the formation of new alliances and power structures. For instance, NATO was established in 1949 by the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Warsaw Pact was formed in response by the Soviet Union and its allies. These alliances were central to the Cold War, which was a period of political and military tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, lasting from the end of World War II until the early 1990s.

Decolonization is another crucial aspect. After World War II, many countries in Asia and Africa gained independence from European colonial powers. This was partly due to the weakening of these powers during the war and the shifting global dynamics. So, the end of colonial empires is another lasting effect on international relations.

Also, the establishment of new nation-states and the redrawing of borders had profound implications. For example, Israel was created in 1948, which has had a significant impact on Middle Eastern politics ever since.

Economically, the Marshall Plan was implemented to help rebuild European economies after the war, which not only aided in recovery but also strengthened ties between the U.S. and Europe.

Moreover, the development and use of nuclear weapons during World War II led to an arms race and the concept of mutually assured destruction, which has shaped international relations and diplomacy in the nuclear age.

Looking back at the documents I read, Doc 1 talked about how international relations have changed due to factors like the politico-geographic setting, the mad race for modernization and development, changes in the nation-state, democratization of international politics, the four revolutions (social, national, information, and technological), the emergence of bipolarity, and the growth of multicentrism.

Doc 2 emphasized the end of the traditional Euro-centric international power structure, the emergence of the Cold War and bipolarity, the rise of new sovereign states, the birth of non-alignment, democratization of foreign policy, loss of relevance of the balance of power, the birth of the nuclear age, transformation of war into total war, the balance of terror replacing the balance of power, an increased desire for peace, increasing interdependence among nations, the birth of the UNO, recognition of the role of power in international relations, the emergence of the age of technology, the emergence of a peace movement, and rapidly increasing interdependence among nations.

Doc 3 seems to focus more on the relationships between countries after World War II, particularly between the United States and the Soviet Union, leading up to the Cold War.

From these documents, it's clear that World War II had profound and lasting effects on international relations, shaping the world order for decades to come.

So, to summarize, some key lasting effects include:

1. **Establishment of the United Nations:** Created to prevent future large-scale conflicts and maintain international peace and security.

2. **Formation of Alliances:** NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which defined the geopolitical landscape during the Cold War.

3. **Decolonization:** Leading to the independence of many countries in Asia and Africa, reshaping global politics.

4. **Creation of New Nation-States:** Such as Israel, which has had持续的影响 on regional and international relations.

5. **Economic Reconstruction:** The Marshall Plan helped rebuild Europe and fostered closer economic ties between the U.S. and Europe.

6. **Nuclear Age and Arms Race:** The development and use of nuclear weapons introduced a new dimension to international relations, including the concept of mutually assured destruction.

7. **Shift in Global Power Dynamics:** From Europe to the U.S. and the Soviet Union, leading to bipolarity in the international system.

These are just some of the major effects, and each of these points could be expanded upon with more detail and analysis. But for the purpose of this question, I think this covers the key lasting impacts of World War II on international relations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The lasting effects of World War II on international relations include the establishment of the United Nations, formation of alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact, decolonization leading to new independent nations, creation of Israel, the Marshall Plan for European reconstruction, the onset of the nuclear age and arms race, and a shift in global power dynamics towards the U.S. and the Soviet Union.}} \]
