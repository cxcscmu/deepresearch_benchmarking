I'm trying to understand why adjustment to late-life divorce is usually more difficult for women. I haven't really thought about this before, so I need to gather some information and think it through step by step.

First, I should probably define what is meant by "late-life divorce." I'm assuming this refers to divorces that occur later in life, maybe in the later adult years, like in one's 50s, 60s, or even older. It's becoming more common, I've heard, as societal attitudes towards divorce change.

Now, why would adjustment be more difficult for women? Are there specific reasons that make it harder for them compared to men? Maybe there are physical, emotional, or financial factors at play.

Let me consider financial aspects first. Women, on average, earn less than men over their lifetimes due to various reasons like career choices, time out of the workforce for caregiving, and gender pay gaps. So, if they divorce later in life, they might have fewer assets and less income to support themselves independently. This could make adjusting to single life more challenging financially.

Also, women often take on more caregiving roles, both for children and aging parents. If they've been the primary caregiver in the marriage, divorce might leave them without the support system they've built around these responsibilities. This could be emotionally taxing.

Moreover, socially and culturally, there might be stigma attached to older women being divorced or starting over alone. Society might have different expectations and judgments for women compared to men, which could affect their self-esteem and social interactions.

Health could also be a factor. As people age, health issues become more common. If a woman divorces later in life, she might have to manage her health concerns on her own, which can be daunting.

Let me think about housing. If the couple owned a home together, divorce could mean that the woman has to sell the house and find new accommodation, which can be stressful and disruptive, especially if she's not financially prepared.

Social networks might also play a role. Women often have larger social networks, but in some cases, their social circles might be tied to their spouse's relationships. Divorce could lead to a loss of these social connections, making adjustment more difficult.

Additionally, there might be differences in how men and women approach retirement and aging. Women might place more value on family and relationships, so losing a long-term partner could have a greater emotional impact.

I should also consider that women might live longer than men, on average, which means they have to adjust to single life for a potentially longer period.

Maybe I should look up some statistics or research on this topic to get a better understanding. Perhaps there are studies that have explored the difficulties faced by older women going through divorce.

Let me try to search for some information.

Realities of Late Life Divorce
Issues Specific to Late Life Divorce
By WomansDivorce.com
While the divorce rate for younger couples has started to decline, the rate of late life divorce is on the rise. Whether known as “grey” divorce or “silver” divorce, more and more older couples are un-tying the knot they tied decades ago. Initially, the term “grey divorce” referred only to men and women who divorced after being married for 40 years or more, but today, grey divorce can describe anyone over the age of 50 who finds themselves suddenly single. The Pew Research Center reported in 2017 that the divorce rate for those over the age of 50 has doubled since the 1990’s. Further, for those 65 and older, the divorce rate tripled from 1990 to 2015.
While there are many reasons for a late life divorce, overall, those who go through such a divorce do so because they do not want to enter the last chapter of their life in an unhappy union. Divorce can be both easier—and harder—for those who are older, however there are many unique challenges to divorcing later in life. There are seldom custody or child support issues because the children are grown and gone, however money issues can be an even bigger consideration than among those who divorce in their 30’s or 40’s.
One thing is for sure—sixty or seventy is just not “old” anymore, so those who are considering a late life divorce have time left to do the things that make them happy. One woman who was blindsided by her husband’s request for a divorce when she was 62, says she ultimately found the divorce “liberating,” once she realized her life was finite. Others who divorce later in life say they regret not making the move sooner, when they were younger and had more time to “get their bearings.”
Divorce in your 60’s or 70’s can truly be a frightening experience, particularly in the financial realm, and while there may not be child custody issues, that does not mean the grown children do not get involved, even taking one side or the other.  There are many different considerations for seniors contemplating a divorce, namely financial stability, and the possibility of finding companionship at this late stage in life.
Top Reasons People over 50 Divorce
There are many reasons for divorce, and every divorce is unique, however the following are the most common factors in senior divorces:
You’ve grown apart. It is actually more common for younger couples to be able to pinpoint the exact cause of their divorce—perhaps there was infidelity, or a major blow-up which heralded the end of the relationship. But, for seniors, it is more likely that the realization of just how little you now have in common after years of marriage takes over, and you realize just how much you have grown apart over the years.
The last child left home. Many seniors realize just how much of their being a “couple” centered around their child or children. Once the last child leaves the nest, the spouses may suddenly appreciate just how much of their lives were tied up in being parents, and how little in being a couple.
Retirement. After decades of working, raising children, and staying busier than most of us would like, retirement leaves many with too much time on their hands, and no idea what to do with that time. In particular, you may hear wives complain that their newly-retired husband is driving them crazy, is underfoot constantly, or is disrupting their normal routine. Many couples do not realize they have grown apart until one or both retire, and there are many more hours in the day to fill.
Age/Age-related illnesses. As anyone over the age of 50 can probably attest to, age brings changes in health, like it or not. Parts of your body which just did their job all those decades now suddenly do not work as well, or at least in the same way. There are creaks and croaks and trouble getting up off the floor for some, the little print is almost impossible to see, and the thought of camping out in a tent requires some serious consideration. So, because aging may not be kind to everyone, some spouses go looking for a younger model, thinking this might just halt their own aging process.
Spending habits. When spouses are in their twenties, thirties or forties, both may be working, and money may not be a huge issue, even if one or both spouses typically overspend. When spouses are older, however, overspending can become a significant problem, due to a fixed income or saving for retirement. The differences in spending habits between the spouses may become glaringly obvious—and may lead to a divorce.
Longer lives. The average life expectancy for a man who reaches the age of 65 is 84.3, while the average age of a woman who reaches the age of 65 is 86.6. At least 25 percent of us will live to be 90 or more, and 10 percent will live past the age of 95. Many spouses contemplate these facts, then decide they are not going to spend the next two or three decades being unhappy.
Life regrets. Many of us married the person we thought would make the best spouse, best parent or the person our parents wanted us to marry. Once we get to the age of 50 or 60, we are suddenly filled with regrets for the life—or the person—we did not choose and decide there is no reason to continue to exist in an unhappy marriage.
Differences in lifestyle choices. When one spouse desires an “active” retirement, filled with tennis or golf games, frequent trips and dancing the night away while the other is perfectly content to sit at home and do crossword puzzles, this difference in lifestyle choices can lead to unhappiness, and, subsequently, divorce.
Aging parents. Those in their 50’s and 60’s are often known as the “sandwich” generation because they are taking care of their elderly parents, and may have either had children later in life, so still have teens at home, or have grown children who have moved back home. This makes for a very stressful situation and often, one of the spouses is not at all happy about the added responsibilities at a time he or she was expecting to be free to finally have some fun.
Issues to Consider if You are Contemplating a Late Life Divorce
While some of the issues between a late life divorce as opposed to a divorce in your 20’s, 30’s or 40’s are the same, others are very different, and warrant extra attention. These issues include:
Alimony - Alimony at this stage in life can make a huge difference on both sides. The spouse receiving the alimony may truly not be able to make it alone financially without alimony, while the paying spouse may have no money left over for his or her own life after alimony payments.
There may also be much more complex considerations when determining alimony such as restricted stock units, pension funds, bonuses, ownership stakes, travel perks, car allowances and executive compensation packages. In some cases, one spouse may have given up his or her career to help the other get through college and become a doctor, lawyer or other professional. In this situation, alimony may be crucial for that spouse because not only are they older, they also have few usable job skills.
Division of Assets - the division of assets in a long-term marriage can be much more complex, particularly when attempting to value retirement funds and separate marital assets from non-marital assets.
Social Security Issues - If you are contemplating a grey divorce, it is really beneficial for you to speak to a knowledgeable financial analyst and a tax person who understands the financial fallout from a divorce. Will one spouse draw off the other’s Social Security, or would he or she be better off drawing on their own Social Security benefits? These are answers you need before finalizing a financial settlement.
Life insurance - many people are unaware that when they are responsible for paying alimony, they should also carry a life insurance policy in an amount and term equal to the amount and duration of the agreed-upon alimony payments. Find out more about court ordered life insurance and when it's appropriate.
On the plus side, a late life divorce may significantly increase the happiness level for many. As our lifespans increase, we are more likely to choose to live fully for the remainder of our lives, finally doing all the things we may have wanted to do for many years. Unfortunately, grey divorcees do tend to be less financially secure—particularly women—and for older men, living alone can decrease the level of overall satisfaction with their lives.
Those who choose to remarry may also have to face the statistics which say remarriages are even less stable than first marriages. Perhaps the best statistic to remember if you are facing a grey divorce comes from an AARP survey which found that 76 percent of people divorcing later in life felt they made the right choice. So—even though getting divorced after years of marriage can be challenging, it can also be a golden opportunity for a fresh start.

Best Ways to Navigate a Late-in-Life Divorce
What people who divorce after 50 wish they had known beforehand

Living
Divorce is never easy, but couples over 50 who end their marriages face particular hurdles. Below, people who went through a late-in-life divorce share six things they would tell their younger selves, offering ways others can learn from their experiences:
Credit: Adobe Stock
“I wish I had known how the divorce would impact my oldest children even more than my youngest still at home.” Gail Konop, a 57-year-old yoga studio owner whose 2011 divorce ended a 25-year marriage, said her son who lived at home slowly got used to her new reality, which wasn’t as easy for her adult daughters. “He got to see us as individuals living in his life. He saw how there was less stress, and he got used to it. But my daughters are coming home periodically and they couldn’t keep up with the changes.” At one point, Konop says her daughter announced, “I don’t want to come home anymore — it’s so weird.” If you’re considering a divorce and kids are involved, don’t assume you are sparing your children by holding on, only to divorce once they’re out of the house.
“I wish I'd explored the job market before I separated; I think I would have worked harder to try to keep the marriage together if I'd realized just how bleak things are out here.” For older adults, especially women who have been out of the workforce, re-entering it can be more even more challenging than they expect. Look into getting advice from financial and career counselors to consider your options for long- and short-term planning post-divorce. Beth Hodges, a family law attorney at Horack Talley in Charlotte, N.C ., says the input of those experts can be helpful when negotiating the amount of alimony and property settlement. “Sometimes when we’re negotiating, I have a client who wants to get her degree to increase her earning capacity. We’ll find out what the cost would be to go back to school and get statistics on what type of income my client can expect to receive once she finishes,” which then gets figured into the settlement package, so the main breadwinner will pay for her education instead of alimony.
“I wish I had known how painful it would be." Kelly James, a ghostwriter who was 50 when she divorced after 19 years of marriage, was surprised by how long it took her to adjust to the loneliness of living alone. “Even if you don’t have the happiest of marriages, there’s something comforting about having someone in your home, your bed. I’m lonely sometimes and miss being part of a twosome," says James. "It’s also difficult to not have my kids with me all the time — their dad and I do a good job of co-parenting, but I miss them when they’re at his house.” In addition to suggesting the pursuit of new hobbies and volunteer opportunities, Hodges recommends therapists to her clients as a way of helping them adjust to their new life. “[Divorce] is a very traumatic, life-rattling experience, especially if you’ve been married for 25 to 35 years,” says Hodges. She reassures her clients that in time, they’ll not only recover, but emerge stronger. “[Divorce] can be transformative,” says Hodges. She tells her clients, “’You're going to survive and feel better about yourself and about your future.’ Almost to a person they’ll come back to me and say, ‘You were absolutely right.'”

“I didn’t think my friends would actually bail on me, but I was wrong.” Lynn Cohen, a Chicago-area divorce attorney who serves on the board of the women’s divorce support nonprofit The Lilac Tree, sees it all the time with her older female clients: “A lot of their friends cut them off — even their best friends. You might keep one or two close friends, but that whole crowd is not going to be there. They’ll help you while you’re going through [the divorce] but not after it’s done.” She advises her clients to get ahead of this social shift and be proactive about expanding their networks by joining groups that set up travel opportunities for single people, and by volunteering. “If you’re not active in your community and giving back, you’re kind of by yourself,” Cohen notes. She also cautions against relying too heavily on divorced friends. “Every divorce is a different set of facts and circumstances and must be viewed individually. They’ll say, ‘When I was divorced. I was able to get everything in the house.’ That’s unnerving and usually bad advice. I tell people that they’re going to have to make their own life,” says Cohen.
“I wish I had known how expensive it would be .” James was shocked that her uncontested, relatively conflict-free collaborative divorce still cost nearly $35,000. “In retrospect, a ‘traditional’ would have probably been a lot less expensive,” she says. Collaborative divorce eschews adversarial strategies and litigation. Cohen advises consulting a divorce attorney as soon as a client suspects she or he may need one to get a jump on figuring out how to pay for the divorce and life after. Alimony may be sparse if a couple already living on retirement savings splits, so would-be divorcees may need time for their exit strategy. Hodges has a simple tip when it comes to saving divorce attorney fees: stay off the phone. “Sometimes clients run up their bills because they’re constantly calling us and engaging us in half-hour consultations. We’re there to counsel and provide guidance to a client, but there is a cost,” says Hodges. The first thing you should do when hiring an attorney, she says, is “Ask questions about the attorney's billing practices, how the lawyer charges. If there are things you can do for the attorneys, like gathering financial information, you can save money by doing that yourself.”
“I wish I had known how liberating it would be — and how that can be a little scary .” Says Konop: "Being only responsible for myself (and my kids) has let me make decisions based on what I want. From little decisions like what to hang on the wall of my house to bigger ones like where to travel and what kinds of projects to do on the house, is all up to me. That feels good but can also be overwhelming. It was like I had a second adolescence. I had so much fun, I knew myself so much better. At first, it was really nerve-wracking and the dating world had changed. It was energizing (until it got exhausting.)”

Divorce in mid-life: Fresh starts, new financial challenges for women
Divorce in mid-life: Fresh starts, new financial challenges for women
When a marriage ends, women often see a larger drop in income than men. Consider these key points as you make decisions about splitting your finances as well as your lives.
AFTER 26 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, Sharron Ames, then 51, found herself at a crossroads. The CEO of a health-care consultancy outside Chicago, Ames had achieved professional and financial success. But her marriage wasn’t on the same sure footing: “I was numb to the relationship,” she says. “And it wasn’t just me. We had both given up.” Ames and her husband reluctantly came to the conclusion they would be better off apart.
When she didn’t know what to do after her divorce, Sharron Ames’ Merrill advisor helped her figure out the rest of her life.
The decision to divorce has become increasingly common for couples over 50. In fact, people in this age group are now twice as likely to part ways as they were in 1990, according to research from the Center for Family & Demographic Research at Bowling Green State University. 1 And according to a Stanford University study, women actually initiate 69% of all marital breakups. 2
The financial implications of divorce can be a sticking point—especially for women. According to one report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 3 women’s household income fell by 41% following a divorce or separation after age 50, while men’s household income dropped by only 23%. With women living an estimated five years longer than men, that dip in income can have serious consequences. “That’s why I tell my clients, ‘A man is not a plan,’” says Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Megan Stirrat, who has advised many female clients, including Ames, as they’ve dealt with the financial aspects of divorce.
You can’t figure out how much income you’ll need if you don’t know how much you can spend now, so look at your current budget and think about your future plans. Talk to an advisor about any adjustments you might need to make in how you spend, save and invest in your future.
Splitting your finances during a divorce is never easy. These steps can help smooth the process.
You don’t have to go it alone. A divorce attorney, an accountant, an advisor—cool heads who have seen it all before—can help you develop a plan, maintain perspective and move forward with confidence.
Open new checking, savings and credit accounts in your name only, and close any that are held jointly. You’ll also want to take your name off joint bills and utilities, which can take longer than you might expect. Get a copy of your credit report to make sure you and your ex are no longer on each other’s accounts.
You’ll want to split your assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, art collectibles, etc.) fairly, based on your needs and expectations, as well as the state law. If you’re in a community property state, the split is always 50/50. And don’t forget about your joint debt (mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and utility bills, etc.), all of which also have to be accounted for in the divorce agreement.
Talk to an attorney and tax professional about the best way to divide IRAs, 401(k)s and pensions. And get going right away on the qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), which is needed for many retirement assets. It can take months to complete, even if everyone is on the same page.
It doesn’t pay to be emotionally attached to any asset—especially your home. Ask yourself: Can I afford to keep it on my own, or would selling it be more likely to help me achieve financial stability and move on with my life?

Dismantling a Shared Financial Life?
The first thing Ames did as she concluded that her marriage was coming to an end was to talk with Stirrat, who had worked with the couple for years. According to Ames, after taking a hard look at the couple’s finances, “Megan said, ‘Here’s what I would do in this case, and here’s what I’ve done with other female clients getting divorced.’ And through it all, she never said anything negative about my then-husband.”
Ames was fortunate that she had a good income of her own, and that she and her then-husband, a marketing exec for technology startups, were fairly comfortable. Over their quarter-century together, they’d accumulated substantial assets, including a large suburban home, multiple individual and joint investments and Ames’ growing health-care company. With the help of Stirrat, working closely with an accountant, the couple reached an amicable and equitable split of their assets, including their home, businesses, retirement assets and considerable art collection.
Ames and her husband have now been divorced for seven years, and they remain friends. “When I didn’t know what my next steps were going to be, Megan helped me create a way to figure out the rest of my life,” she says.
4 Key Things to Consider When Divorcing
“A really critical initial step when facing the breakup of a marriage is to get down to financial brass tacks,” Stirrat says. “That means doing an assets and debt inventory.” From there, you can work out a plan for distributing them fairly. Below, Stirrat points out four financial areas that every divorcing woman (or couple) should consider carefully.
1. Your Investments and Other Property. The laws that govern how property will be divided in a divorce vary from state to state, so you’ll be guided to some extent by local laws and customary practices. “That’s why it makes a difference to have a lawyer who really knows local law,” Stirrat says. For instance, there are nine states that are so-called community property states, in which property acquired during the marriage is generally divided 50/50. Other states tend to call for “equitable” division of joint assets, which just means that they’re split in a way that stresses fairness, rather than equality. On top of that, some states are “no fault” states, in which the circumstances of the divorce play no role in the division of assets, while other states take such factors into consideration.
If your financial assets are primarily stocks, bonds and cash, divvying them up is often straightforward once you’ve agreed on what constitutes an “equitable” split, Stirrat says. The complications come with assets such as stock options, income-producing real estate, a vacation home, art or collectibles. There might be further complications if one of you owns a business: Agreeing on a value for the business as well as how much, if any, either party might be entitled to can be difficult.
“The typical advice for all of these kinds of assets is not to retain joint ownership,” Stirrat says. It’s important that you get independent, outside valuations, she adds. This not only reduces the likelihood of conflict, but ensures that you’ll receive fair value (or pay fair value) in the event of a buyout.
2. Your House. It may be the place where you raised your children and now call home, but it’s also an asset. Try to put your emotions aside if you can. As Stirrat observes, “One of the biggest mistakes my divorcing clients make is to try and keep the marital home when they can’t afford it.” If you do decide to put your home on the market, have it appraised right away so you can agree on a sales price. If the divorce is amicable, you’ll likely need to have it done once. If there’s contention, each partner might want to get a separate appraisal. The two could then be averaged.
“One of the biggest mistakes my divorcing clients make is to try and keep the marital home when they can’t afford it. Have it appraised right away so you can agree on a sales price.”
—Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor Megan Stirrat
3. Your Retirement Assets. It’s always a good idea to include your accountant when you speak with your divorce lawyer about handling these assets. Transferring one person’s IRA, or a portion of it, to another requires special care to make sure there aren’t tax implications. Also bear in mind that any private sector retirement plan that’s covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), such as a 401(k) or a pension, will require a court-approved division of those assets through something called a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO). Your plan sponsor will also have to approve any QDRO.
“Getting the required language and approvals on a QDRO takes time, and it can be costly,” Stirrat says. “So be sure to spell out how that cost will be divvied up ahead of time.”
Social Security is another consideration. If you’ve been married for 10 years or more, you’re entitled to 50% of your spouse’s benefits or 100% of your own, whichever is greater. Says Stirrat, “If the marriage has lasted for 9 1/2 years, it may be worth sticking things out for the additional 6 months.” Note that claiming Social Security on your spouse’s work record has no effect on your spouse’s benefits.
4. Your Monthly Income. As an entrepreneur, Ames had an income of her own at the time of her divorce. But many women are in a very different position. They may have left their careers to have children and either haven’t worked for a while or have a lower income than their spouse because of their years out of the workforce. Your advisor, working closely with your attorney and accountant, can help you calculate how much income you’ll require going forward, so you can receive the spousal support you need. As you do, advises Ames, “Make sure you adequately plan for health-care issues.” You’ll want to be sure that any settlement takes into account the potential for rising medical costs, especially as you age.
“Divorce can be an emotionally and financially difficult time,” Stirrat says. “But you can come out the other side feeling stronger and less worried, with greater hope, stability and freedom.

The Effects of Divorce on Women
AnaBGD/iStock/Getty Images
Most divorced couples expect to go through a tough adjustment period immediately after the marriage comes to an official end. It's important to be aware of the possible consequences of divorce, and to have a realistic view of the future. Only in movies does a rich, handsome, eligible man appear out of nowhere and give a divorced woman everything she has ever dreamed of and more. In real life, women normally suffer the most after a divorce, both in terms of quality of life and emotional well-being, says Michele Weiner Davis, creator of the Divorce Busting Centers.
Financial Distress
A woman may suffer financially after divorce, particularly if she is the primary caregiver to the children. Without her husband's salary, she will have less money to cover bills and household expenses. The average divorced woman has less money than the average married woman and women don't completely recover from the financial consequences of divorce until they remarry, note Pamela J. Smock, Wendy D. Manning and Sanjiv Gupta, in "The Effect of Marriage and Divorce on Women's Economic Well-Being," a 1999 article published in the "American Sociological Review."
Emotional Distress
Divorce may leave a woman feeling hurt, lonely and unhappy. Even if it was her choice to end the marriage, she may bear the scars of the broken relationship for a long time. According to The Short-Term and Decade-Long Effects of Divorce on Women's Midlife Health, an article published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior in 2006, divorced women reported significantly higher psychological distress levels than married women in the years following the divorce. The stresses of being in an unhappy marriage may simply be replaced by different worries, such as not being able to trust a man again, struggling to find her perfect partner or a fear of being rejected.
Freedom
Despite the potential negative effects of divorce on a woman, there are many cases in which divorce leads to a happier, healthier life. If a woman is getting out of a marriage fraught with conflict or violence she will be happier in the long term, say Alan Hawkins, Tamara Fackrell and Brian Higginbotham, developers of the Utah Divorce Orientation program. A woman may still require professional help to get over the unhealthy relationship and subsequent breakdown of the marriage, particularly if she was the victim of domestic violence.
Taking Control
For a divorce to have more positive effects on a woman than negative, she must make the most of the chance to change her life for the better. Some women say that the first few years after divorce are a time of significant personal growth, with greater independence and more personal choices. It is crucial to work to create a better life, say Hawkins, Fackrell and Higginbotham. Every single decision a woman makes after divorce, from where to live to how to increase her income, is an important part of this process.

Facing a Gray Divorce? Watch Out for These 7 Critical Issues
Facing a Gray Divorce? Watch Out for These 7 Critical Issues
By Joe Dillon, Divorce Mediator
If you're an older couple divorcing after a long-term marriage, it's referred to as a gray divorce or late life divorce.
In gray divorces, there are a number of critical issues you need to be aware of so your divorce doesn't go sideways.
If you don't want to waste money or time on your divorce, or add stress to your life, here's what to do to get the best result.
While the overall divorce rate has flattened for most age groups, there is one segment of the population where divorce rates are actually increasing - older Americans in long-term marriages.
A phenomenon known as gray divorce.
Certainly, divorce is difficult no matter how long you've been married or how old you are. But if you're older adults divorcing after a long term marriage, there's a whole lot you need to know - and watch out for!
In this post you'll learn:
What is a gray divorce;
How does your education level factor into whether or not you'll divorce;
The 8 most common gray divorce reasons;
3 reasons divorce mediation is your best option for divorce later in life;
And the 7 critical legal and financial gray divorce issues a divorcing couple needs to be aware of.
Let's get started.
What is a Gray Divorce?
When the term was first coined, it referred to men and women who divorced after 40 years or more of marriage. The assumption was that anyone married for that long must be an older adult "starting to gray," hence the name.
But these days, it's more commonly used to refer to the increased divorce rate among baby boomers, regardless of the length of their marriage or the color of their hair.
As a point of reference, most of our clients falling into this category have been married between 20 and 30 years.
Over the past 20 years, the divorce rate in the United States has declined. But for the over-50 age group, the gray divorce rate has actually doubled according to a paper, “ Gray Divorce: A Growing Risk Regardless of Class or Education ” written by two sociologists at Bowling Green State University – Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin.
Furthering the research into the gray divorce rate, according to an April 2021 report released by the U.S. Census Department, 34.9% of all Americans who got divorced in the previous calendar year, were aged 55 or older. That's more than twice the rate of any other age group surveyed.
So why the divorce increase in this segment of the population?
8 Grey Divorce Reasons:
In my experience, there are 8 reasons for the rising divorce rate in middle age or older spouses and none have anything to do with being a baby boomer. They do, however, have everything to do with the societal shift that began in the late 1960s and continued throughout the 1970s, and the quest for personal fulfillment.
It was during that time that attitudes towards marriage began to shift and divorce became more socially acceptable. TV shows like Maude (1972) and One Day at a Time (1975) featured main characters who were divorced, and Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) was a box-office smash. Divorce had hit the mainstream and became dare I say normal.
Individuals born in the late 1950s through early 1960s grew up with the messages that life is short, happiness matters, and divorce is nothing to be ashamed about. Which set the stage for the gray divorce revolution we're seeing today.
Here now are the 8 gray divorce reasons I commonly encounter with my clients.
Reason #1: "We've Simply Grown Apart."
Some couples can pinpoint the exact cause of the demise of the marriage. But in a grey divorce, there is often no infidelity and no major blowout that led to the decision to get divorced. Instead, the spouses have simply grown apart over time.
The couple chooses to begin divorce proceedings when one of two things happens:
They have an adult child or their youngest goes off to college (aka "empty nest syndrome.")
You've spent the better part of your marriage raising kids and now you've found yourself without the kiddos to focus on. Leaving only your husband or wife.
"Who is that stranger sitting across from me?" you wonder to yourself. And suddenly you find yourself uncomfortable being around this person you no longer know. Which leads to an empty nesters divorce.
Retirement.
When a couple is working and/or raising kids, they're busy. Perhaps so busy that they don't notice they are growing farther apart with each passing year. But now that one or both have retired, they have a lot more time on their hands and again, realize they no longer know (or like) their husband or wife.
If you are seeking a gray divorce because you've grown apart, consider using divorce mediation.
In my experience, most couples who fall into this category are low-conflict and can successfully work together and come to an agreement, in a fair, and cost-effective manner.
Reason #2: Age
We've all got one (or maybe more) of those friends who every time we ask them how they are, they launch into:
How bad their feet hurt; or
How they pulled their back out; or
How their eyesight isn't what it used to be.
I get it - aging stinks. But being around someone who acts old can make us feel old. So for some, when they see their husband or wife aging (or repeatedly hear them complaining and being negative), it can be an unwelcome reminder that they're getting older, too.
So perhaps they think if they got divorced for someone younger, it will reverse time for them as well.
In these cases, mediation can work, but it will depend in large part on the mindset of their husband/wife.
Mediation requires both parties to actively participate in gathering discovery, completing forms and worksheets (the "pre-work"), and working together to negotiate the terms of their agreement.
So if your partner has an "old-fashioned" mindset, he/she may not be open to the modern concept of mediation.
Reason #3: Self-Improvement
There's a great line from the Bruce Springsteen song "Dancing in the Dark" that goes:
"I check my look in the mirror, I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face..."
After so many years of looking, dressing, or feeling the same way, some people want to make changes to the way they are living their life (lose weight, exercise, improve their appearance). But to do that, they need a spark lit under them to get them motivated to make their desired changes.
And that's where interest in a new "special someone" comes into play. Sometimes people think meeting or pursuing someone new will make them try harder in life, lose weight, dress better, etc. and help them achieve the changes they seek.
Again, in this case, mediation can work but it depends on the emotional state of your current spouse. There may be a lot of hurt feelings and resentment because you're leaving the marriage for someone else.
And your spouse may not be in a "sit down together and work through the terms of the divorce or legal separation as adults" frame of mind.
Reason #4: Money and Spending Habits
When couples are in their prime earning years, a lot of financial missteps can be overlooked. Because the money keeps flowing in, the bills somehow get "taken care of" and the overspending spouse is ignorant of the couple's precarious financial situation.
But once the income stream stops and the couple is forced to live on a fixed income, pension plan, or other retirement benefits, it can be quite sobering. Differences in spending habits become abundantly clear. And may lead to one spouse wanting to get divorced.
Mediation is ideal in situations like this. Especially if you work with a divorce mediator who has a financial background.
For example, one of the things I have my gray divorcees do to prepare for mediation is to complete a series of budgeting exercises. This helps reveal their marital spending and current financial picture, as well as what their projected (separate) spending will look like post-divorce.
This approach is quite effective in helping the "spendthrift spouse" better understand the reality of their finances and how things need to change in order to make ends meet moving forward.
Reason #5: Sex
Just like differences in spending habits, differences in sex drives can also sink a marriage.
As spouses get older, their libidos may differ, sometimes dramatically. Regardless of what you see on those commercials touting the latest ED drugs.
This can lead to frustration and ultimately the desire to divorce.
Mediation can work in these situations, but only if your spouse is not so apathetic that they do not have the motivation to actively participate in the process.
Reason #6: Longer Life Expectancy
According to data compiled by the Social Security Administration as of 2021:
A man reaching age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 84.3.
A woman turning age 65 today can expect to live, on average, until age 86.6.
About one out of every four 65-year-olds today will live past age 90.
One out of 10 will live past age 95.
For couples seeking this type of divorce, it's quite possible each spouse could live another 30, 40 even 50 years. So one thinks, "Why spend the time I have left on this earth miserable in an unhappy marriage?"
Once again leading them to want to divorce their wife or husband. Mediation will be a viable option, but only if their spouse is willing to actively participate in the process.
Reason #7: Undo Past Regrets
"Try to marry a nice boy," your mother said.
"Find a woman who will be a good mother to your children," your father said.
Being the good son or daughter, you did the "right" thing and married the person you were "supposed to." And whom your mom and dad approved of. Thing is, they weren't necessarily the person you wanted to marry. And now here you are, stuck in a long-term marriage, filled with regret as you reflect on your life.
You've now decided after all these years that being unhappily married is no longer acceptable to you.
Many of our clients fall into this category and in these cases, it's usually not a surprise that a change in marital status is coming as both spouses have been unhappy for a very long time.
By the time they decide to divorce, the fighting has subsided and they're both in the camp of simply wanting to move forward separately with their lives. That's why mediation is ideal for situations like this.
8. Active vs. Passive Lifestyles
"He just wants to sit on the couch and watch TV, but I want to go on cruises, get dressed up, and dance!"
"She just wants to sit home all day doing crossword puzzles, but I want to go on vacation and see all those places we talked about going to but never did!"
Sound familiar?
When one of you wants an active retirement and one if you refer to it as "re-tired-ment," you've got a real problem. Because one of you wants to get out there and live it up, and the other has no interest.
If this is your situation, there's a 50-50 chance mediation will work for you.
Half of the time, the passive party simply wants nothing to do with the divorce. And places the burden of getting a divorce on the active spouse. And since mediation requires two parties to actively participate, if this is your situation, mediation won't likely be a viable option for you.
But, some passive spouses fall into the "whatever you want" camp and will go along and work with you. So if this is your situation, don't rule out mediation for your no-fault divorce just yet.

3 Reasons Why Mediation is Your Best Option for Gray Divorces
Now that I've shared the common gray divorce reasons, let's take a closer look at why I feel mediation is the best way to divorce later in life if you're an older person.
1. You Don't Want to Waste a Lot of Money on Your Divorce.
If you're like most men and women divorcing after a long-term marriage, you're in your late 50's to early 60's and may be retirement age and/or out of the workforce soon. So if you spend a ton of money on your divorce, you won't have a lot of time to recover financially and protect your retirement fund the way a younger couple might.
Yet that's exactly what can happen if you don't mediate and involve family law attorneys instead.
To give you an idea:
The average cost of a collaborative divorce is between $25,000 to $50,000; and that's if things "go well."
The average cost of a litigated divorce is between $75,000 and $150,000; provided you can settle things in your first trip to court.
If things aren't going well, and your divorce drags on for a long time, you can expect to spend $200,000 or more on your divorce.
On the other hand, the average total cost of a mediated divorce is between $7,000 and $10,000.
Given where you are in life, I'd imagine you'd rather fund your own retirement account instead of your family law attorneys!
2. You Don't Want to Waste a Lot of Time on Your Divorce.
Let me be clear. I am not encouraging you to rush through your divorce.
But the simple fact is when attorneys are involved, the divorce process is not only more expensive, but can take a very long time.
All that letter writing, e-mailing, phone calling, arguing, and back and forth.
The average length of the collaborative law process is 8 months to 1.5 years.
The average length of a litigated divorce is between 2 and 3 years.
The average length of a mediated divorce is only 4 to 5 months from start to finish.
Do you really want to spend your life in a courtroom or divorce attorney's conference room wasting years hashing out alimony (also known as spousal support, maintenance, or spousal maintenance, depending on where you live), property division, and other details of your divorce?
Or would you rather get through this painful chapter in your life and spend the time you have left living?
3. You Don't Want to Add Any More Stress to Your Already Stressful Life.
At this stage of your life, you've probably got a lot of challenges and worries.
Some might be:
A demanding job that requires 60 to 80 hours of your time per week;
College tuition bills that collectively cost more than your house;
Aging parents who require more and more of your care and attention;
Children who boomeranged back home, unable to find a decent paying job;
Skyrocketing health insurance premiums and medical issues that require more to address than just "taking it easy."
And now you're adding a divorce into that mix.
Even if you're the initiator, divorce is one of the most stressful events you will ever have to endure in your life. Second only to the death of a parent or loved one.
So why then would you choose to involve divorce attorneys and pile even more stress on to an already unpleasant situation?
With the potential for years of:
Arguing;
Letter writing;
Phone calling;
E-mailing;
Conferencing;
Motion filing;
Document subpoenaing;
And mounting legal bills that can escalate into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars;
A litigated divorce process using divorce lawyers is the epitome of stress vs. mediation which is a more peaceful process.

7 Critical Gray Divorce Issues to Watch Out for
No matter why you're seeking a divorce later in life, the fact is longer the couple's marriage lasted, the more complex the issues surrounding their divorce will be.
Here are 7 critical gray divorce issues and financial challenges that - if you're not careful - can really de-rail your divorce:
Issue #1: Determining an Amount and Duration of Alimony
Chances are the person paying alimony is late in their career. And their compensation is far more complex than when they first started out.
Things like:
Bonuses;
Restricted stock units;
Options;
Ownership stakes;
Executive compensation packages;
Car allowances;
Travel perks;
Etc.
So when determining an amount of alimony in a long-term marriage, the total compensation received needs to be taken into account.
Not just their base salary.
Issue #2: Determining the Value of Premarital Assets (and Liabilities) or Proving Separate Property vs. Marital Property
In New Jersey, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and 36 other states, dividing a couple's marital assets and liabilities falls under the concept of equitable distribution. While in California, Washington, and seven others, the concepts of community property are applied.
Say you live in an equitable distribution state, you're 63, got married at 36, and have this 401(k) retirement plan that you've been contributing to since you were 25. Do you really have the statements from the day you got married to know what its pre-marital value is?
Or you live in a community property state and have owned a baseball card collection from before you were married which has appreciated significantly over the years. Can you prove this is separate property and shouldn't be included in your property division?
Because you could be giving away pre-marital property or separate assets your soon-to-be ex-spouse is not entitled to.
Issue #3: Inheritances
Inheritances are considered "separate property" and are typically not subject to distribution in a divorce. But they can most certainly have a tremendous impact on your divorce settlement and finances.
One way is if they're co-mingled. That can be done in many ways far too numerous to get into here. A second way is how an inheritance impacts the division of your marital assets and liabilities.
For example, let's say the division of your assets and liabilities turns out to be 50-50. With each of you receiving half of the retirement assets. But your husband or wife inherited a $500,000 lump sum from their now-deceased parents. So was your distribution really 50-50?
On one hand, the assets subject to distribution were split equally. But the reality is your total asset pool is not 50-50. And does income earned from investing that inheritance count towards a person's ability to pay or receive alimony?
As you can see, gray divorce issues for an older couple can get quite complex.
Issue #4: Social Security
You may have heard that when spouses in long-term marriages divorce, one party can collect Social Security off of the other party's earnings.
So now you're in negotiations on alimony. And you're the one set to receive it. So you figure since you'll be getting $X amount per month in Social Security benefits, you agree to take a lower alimony amount. Only to find out after your divorce is final, you don't qualify to receive benefits from your ex-spouse's earnings.
And now you're out of luck and so are your finances.
Issue #5: Life Insurance
Most people don't know this, but anyone paying alimony is required to have life insurance in an amount and for a term equal to the amount and duration of alimony agreed to in their divorce decree.
So now you're 58 and your term life policy is about to expire.
Well, guess what?
You need to get a new policy with a death benefit and duration to cover your alimony obligation.
I just got my life insurance renewal today and it told me that if I decide to renew my policy when I'm 58, my annual premium will be $21, 358.
$21,358!
I can hear you saying, "So you mean to tell me I not only have to pay alimony, but I also have to fork over copious amounts of cash to an insurance company?"
Yup.
Issue #6: Difficulty Dividing Pension Plans or Other Retirement Accounts
While many companies are moving away from pension plans in favor of 401(k)'s, state and local governments still offer pension plans to their employees. So if your wife or husband is a teacher, firefighter, police officer, or government official, chances are they have a pension.
And it's probably quite substantial.
Now that you're divorcing, how do you divide such an asset? It's not like there's money sitting in an account as with an IRA or 401(k).
A pension is a promise made by an employer to provide an employee a monthly payment (typically) until they pass away.
Notice nowhere in there does it say "provide an employee's ex-husband or wife a monthly payment."
For corporate pension plans, it's a bit more straightforward. Do a PV calculation, determine the Coverture Fraction, get a QDRO, and a separate interest can be created and the pension benefit shared between the parties.
But when it comes to government pensions, it's not nearly as straightforward. So if your husband or wife was a civil servant or government employee, be aware that it may not be as easy to value and share a pension as it would be if they worked in a corporation.
Issue #7: College
In some states where we practice, divorcing parents are required to pay for their children's college education through child support. Yet, if you remain married, there is no such requirement of you.
It's true!
Maybe you're one of the fortunate few who've managed to put away enough to fund their children's college education(s). But if you're not, your ability to retire may be further away than you'd like it to be.
Bonus Issue: The Most Important of All Grey Divorce Issues!
As you just learned, gray divorce issues for older couples are far more complex than the ones a young or newly married couple will face. And if you're not careful, your divorce can become a disaster!
That's why the most important of all gray divorce issues is choosing the right divorce professional.
Choosing the right divorce professional (divorce mediator) is critical to getting a divorce outcome that's fair, cost-effective, and timely.
You can leave your future in the hands of divorce attorneys and drain your retirement savings as you waste up to $200,000 and 3 years of your life arguing as enemies, only to be forced to accept an agreement forced upon you by a judge and that neither of you is happy with.
Or you can choose to mediate your divorce, preserve your valuable time and money and work together as adults to craft an agreement you both have a say in and find fair and equitable.
When you really think about it, the choice is clear: mediation is the best way to get a gray divorce.
The choices you make before you start your gray divorce are critical.
But you can only make smart choices if you take the time to prepare and get educated first!

Alright, I've got some information from these articles. Let me try to synthesize this.

First, it seems that late-life divorce, also known as gray divorce, is becoming more common, especially among baby boomers. The reasons for this increase include people living longer, changes in societal attitudes towards divorce, and a greater emphasis on personal fulfillment.

Looking at the reasons for late-life divorce, several themes emerge. One is that couples have grown apart over time, especially after the children have left home, leading to a realization that they no longer share common interests or goals. Retirement can also trigger a divorce if spouses have different lifestyles or if being together more leads to increased conflicts.

Another reason is health issues; as people age, health problems can strain a marriage, and some may choose to divorce rather than face the challenges of caregiving alone. Additionally, some individuals may seek a divorce to pursue new relationships or to escape an unhappy marriage, perhaps driven by a sense that they have more time left to live and want to be happy.

Now, regarding why adjustment to late-life divorce is more difficult for women, several factors come into play.

Financially, women often face greater challenges after divorce. They may have spent time out of the workforce caring for children or aging parents, leading to lower earning potential and fewer retirement savings. Dividing assets, especially in long-term marriages, can be complex, and women might receive a smaller share of the marital assets, including pensions and Social Security benefits.

Moreover, women tend to live longer than men, which means they may need to support themselves for a longer period after divorce. This can be particularly challenging if they have fewer financial resources.

Emotionally, women may also struggle more with the social and familial aspects of divorce. They might have invested more in maintaining social networks and may lose connections if their ex-spouse had strong ties within those networks. Additionally, the stress of raising children and managing the household can leave women with less time for personal development, which might make it harder for them to adjust to single life.

Health-wise, women may face greater health challenges after divorce, possibly due to the stress of the divorce process and the loss of a partner's support.

Housing can also be an issue. If the couple owned a home together, selling it and finding new accommodation can be difficult, especially if the woman is not financially prepared.

Furthermore, there may be societal expectations and stigma attached to older women being divorced or starting over alone, which can affect their self-esteem and social interactions.

In contrast, men might experience some benefits from late-life divorce, such as increased freedom and the ability to pursue new relationships without the constraints of a long-term marriage. However, this is not universally true, and some men may also face difficulties adjusting to single life.

Considering all these factors, it's clear that late-life divorce can be particularly challenging for women due to a combination of financial, emotional, social, and health-related issues. It's important for women going through this process to seek support from friends, family, and professionals to help them navigate these challenges and build a fulfilling life after divorce.

So, to answer the question: Adjustment to late-life divorce is usually more difficult for women due to factors such as greater financial insecurity, larger emotional and social investments in the marriage, potential health challenges, and societal expectations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Adjustment to late-life divorce is usually more difficult for women due to greater financial insecurity, larger emotional and social investments in the marriage, potential health challenges, and societal expectations.}} \]
