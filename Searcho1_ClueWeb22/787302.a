Alright, I need to compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and discuss how viruses affect them. Let's start by understanding what these cell types are and then see how viruses interact with each of them.

First, prokaryotic cells are the simplest form of cells. They don't have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Examples include bacteria and archaea. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells are more complex; they have a nucleus and various organelles like mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Examples of eukaryotic organisms include plants, animals, fungi, and protists.

Now, viruses are interesting because they're not really cells; they're infectious agents that can only replicate inside living cells. They can infect both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but the way they do so differs based on the cell type.

Let me think about how viruses infect prokaryotic cells. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They attach to the bacterial cell wall, inject their genetic material into the cell, and then use the bacterial machinery to replicate themselves. Eventually, they cause the cell to burst open, releasing new virions.

In contrast, viruses that infect eukaryotic cells have to deal with more complex structures. For example, animal viruses often bind to specific receptors on the host cell membrane, enter the cell through endocytosis or membrane fusion, and then release their genetic material into the cytoplasm to hijack the host's cellular machinery for replication.

I should also consider the impact of viral infections on these cells. In prokaryotes, as I mentioned, bacteriophages can lead to lysis of the cell, which can have significant effects on microbial populations and even influence ecosystem dynamics.

In eukaryotes, viral infections can lead to a variety of outcomes, including cell death, transformation into cancerous cells, or integration of viral DNA into the host genome, which can have long-term effects.

Moreover, some viruses can integrate their genetic material into the host cell's genome in a process called lysogeny, which is more common in prokaryotes. This can lead to the expression of viral genes under certain conditions without immediately killing the cell.

In eukaryotes, retroviruses like HIV can integrate their DNA into the host genome, leading to a latent infection that can persist for years.

It's also important to note that viruses can influence the evolution of their hosts. For instance, viral infections can apply selective pressure on prokaryotes, leading to the development of defense mechanisms like CRISPR systems.

In eukaryotes, viral infections have contributed to genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer and have played roles in shaping immune systems.

Additionally, viruses can have beneficial effects in some cases. For example, in prokaryotes, phages can be used in phage therapy to target and kill pathogenic bacteria, which is particularly relevant given the rise of antibiotic resistance.

In eukaryotes, viruses can be harnessed for gene therapy, where viral vectors are used to deliver therapeutic genes into human cells.

I should also consider the differences in antiviral defenses between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes have innate immune systems like CRISPR-Cas, which can recognize and degrade foreign DNA, including viral genomes.

Eukaryotes have more sophisticated immune responses, including innate immunity with interferons and adaptive immunity with antibodies and T cells, which can specifically target and eliminate virus-infected cells.

It's fascinating how differently viruses interact with these two types of cells, reflecting the evolutionary history and complexity of their hosts.

In summary, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ fundamentally in their structure and complexity, which influences how viruses infect them and the consequences of those infections. Viruses have evolved diverse strategies to exploit both cell types, and in turn, hosts have developed various defense mechanisms against viral invasions.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells differ in structure and complexity, influencing viral infection strategies and host defenses.}} \]
