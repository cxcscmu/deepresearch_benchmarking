Alright, I need to figure out how terrorism has affected global trade. Hmm, this seems like a complex issue with many facets. First, I should probably understand what terrorism is and how it impacts different aspects of society, particularly economics and trade.

I know that terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. So, it's not just about random violence; there's usually a message or a goal behind it. Now, how does this affect global trade?

Well, global trade involves the exchange of goods and services between countries. It's influenced by various factors like politics, economics, security, and more. Terrorism could impact trade through several channels: it might affect the safety of transportation routes, influence government policies, or affect investor confidence.

Let me think about transportation first. A lot of global trade happens via ships, planes, trucks, and trains. If terrorists target these transportation methods or the infrastructure that supports them, like ports or airports, it could disrupt trade flows. For example, if a port is attacked, shipments might be delayed or rerouted, which could increase costs and reduce efficiency.

Also, terrorism can lead to increased security measures. While these are put in place to prevent future attacks, they can also slow down trade processes. For instance, stricter customs checks or additional screenings at borders could lengthen the time it takes for goods to cross international boundaries.

Moreover, terrorism can have psychological impacts. If people fear traveling or if investors are nervous about investing in certain regions due to perceived instability, that could reduce trade activities. Tourism is a big part of many economies, and if terrorism deters tourists, that could have ripple effects on related industries and overall economic health.

I should also consider the political dimension. Countries may impose sanctions or alter their foreign policies in response to terrorism, which could affect trade agreements and relationships. For example, if Country A is perceived as harboring terrorists, other countries might restrict trade with it or impose embargoes.

On the other hand, sometimes terrorism can lead to greater cooperation among nations in combating the threat, which might include enhancing trade for security equipment or technology. But I think the negative impacts outweigh the positive in this regard.

I need to find some concrete examples or studies that quantify these effects. Maybe there are specific instances where terrorism has led to significant disruptions in global trade.

Let me try to look up some information on this. Perhaps there are reports or research papers that analyze the relationship between terrorism and global trade.

How Does Terrorism Affect Trade?
December 06, 2016
By Subhayu Bandyopadhyay
A major current threat to the U.S. and the global economy is terrorism. In their 2012 book The Political Economy of Terrorism, economists Walter Enders and Todd Sandler define “terrorism” as premeditated use of or threat to use violence by individuals or subnational groups to obtain a political or social objective through the intimidation of a large audience beyond that of the immediate victims. 1
Among other effects, such threats reduce investments in affected nations and impact both capital formation and employment. To gain international attention to their activities, terrorists often disproportionately target tourism, transportation or foreign direct investment (FDI). In turn, this affects a targeted nation’s exports and imports.
How Does Terrorism Affect Trade?
There are a few central channels through which terrorism may affect trade:
Terrorism increases uncertainty, which raises the cost of traded goods, especially relative to similar goods produced in a terrorism-free country.
Terrorism increases the cost of doing business by raising both insurance premiums and security costs, which decreases the competitiveness of goods.
Terrorism slows the flow of goods and resources through ports due to greater inspections and safeguards.
Trade can be reduced as purchasing power drops from loss of income when production is disrupted.
Terrorism can divert government expenditures from more productive public investment to less productive security activities.
Types of Terrorism and Their Sectoral Effects
Terrorism is composed of two parts: domestic and transnational.
In domestic terrorism, the perpetrators and victims are all citizens from the venue country. An example is the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City by Timothy McVeigh.
Transnational terrorism occurs when the venue, perpetrators or victims involve two or more countries.
My recent paper, co-authored with Todd Sandler and Javed Younas, looked into the effects of total, domestic and transnational terrorism on international trade. 2 We found that the manufacturing sector experienced the greatest harm from terrorism. Within manufacturing, we found that effects of terrorism were more damaging to high-skilled production than low-skilled production.
Generally, the detrimental effect of transnational terrorism on various trade variables was almost double that of domestic terrorism, indicating that transaction cost and other considerations associated with transnational terrorism were more trade-inhibiting than those tied to domestic terrorism.
Furthermore, the contrasting effects of the two forms of terrorism were more pronounced for developing countries, which may be less able than their developed counterparts to alleviate transnational terrorism and its consequences due to weaker institutions.
Total terrorism had a significant negative impact on trade in all products, primary commodities and manufactured goods, with a stronger detrimental influence manifested on manufacturing.
When manufacturing sectors were decomposed by resource or skill intensities, transnational terrorism continued to have a more marked effect on trade than domestic terrorism. There was a noteworthy tendency for higher-skilled manufacturing to sustain a more adverse trade impact from alternative forms of terrorism, with some peaking at a skill level below the greatest.

The Effects of Terrorism on the Supply Chain - More Than Shipping
Featured Supply Chains
The Effects of Terrorism on the Supply Chain
By Mehtap Demirci
June 26, 2017

In today’s economy, businesses are subject to a number of external factors that are not within the direct control of a company, but can still have enormous effects on the company’s decision-making, planning, and overall success of the business. Among many of these outside factors is terrorism – defined as the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims. It is the indirect effects of terrorism that create the most significant potential threat to the activities of businesses and their supply chains.
The effects of terrorism can cause reduction in demand for goods and services, as a result of the psychological response of consumers. The acts are designed to reach beyond the immediate target to intimidate a larger audience, such as specific religious groups, political parties, or an entire country. Terrorism is aimed at gathering publicity to introduce political change by influence and power.
Executive orders, such as the “Homeland Security Act 2002”, which created the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System (NTAS), affect the supply chain through possible delays and proactive measures.
NTAS provides detailed information on terrorist threat levels, and recommends security measures to the public, government agencies, airports, ocean ports, and other hubs. Changes in government policies, laws and regulations may also take effect as a response to a terrorism threat or recent act of terrorism. Post-9/11, under President George W. Bush, the Global War on Terrorism was launched which enacted a series of laws and executive orders that have affected our everyday lives, as well as businesses.
Improved security can reduce the efficiency of a business’s daily operations, due to greater inspections and safeguards that slow the flow of goods.
A random customs inspection at an ocean port can take from a few days to a more than a week. For some containers that are traveling through intermodal rail, there may be random inspections at the final rail ramps, which are even more costly as most U.S railroads allow only two business days of free time. Changes in government policy can increase the cost of business, and prove to be more detrimental to the business than the original terrorist events that may have created them. Trade is also reduced, as purchasing power decreases from loss of income when production is disrupted. Within manufacturing, the effects of terrorism can be found more damaging to high-skilled production than low-skilled production.
A measure implemented post-9/11 is the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT.)
It is a voluntary supply chain security program, led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, focused solely on improving the security of private companies supply chains with respect to terrorism. C-TPAT was launched in November 2001, with only seven initial members, but as of December 1, 2014, the program had 10,854 members with 4,315 importers in the program, accounting for 54% of the value of all goods imported into the U.S. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification are required to have a documented process for accessing and alleviating risk throughout their international supply chain. This designates companies as low-risk, allowing them to benefit from expedited processing, including fewer customs inspections.

Impact  of Global Terrorism
Releases > Remarks >
Impact  of Global Terrorism
Ambassador Francis X. Taylor,
			    Coordinator for Counterterrorism
Remarks to Executivesu0012 Club of Chicago Leadership Symposium
Chicago, IL
March 14, 2002
Distinguished guests: We're here to talk about the impact of global terrorism, and how it has affected the way we will protect our businesses in the future.
On the morning of September 11, the world changed. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the United States launched a global campaign not only against the perpetrators of those attacks but also against terrorism itself, wherever it exists.
There can be no excuse, no justification, and no rationalization for these acts of mass murder of innocent people.
As President Bush told the UN General Assembly: The time for sympathy is passed; time for action has arrived. This war will be a long struggle with many dimensions.
Today I would like to spend some time discussing the impact of terrorism on the business world, in particular, on financing, kidnapping, and oil pipelines, what the U.S. Government is doing about that impact, and how you can help in the fight against terrorism.
The Costs of Terrorism
Terrorism raises the risk and cost of doing business, whether that business is diplomacy, manufacturing, or sales.
Examples:
The AP reported in October that nearly 200,000 people were laid off after 9/11, including close to 40,000 in the aerospace industry
An airline industry spokesman estimated in October that the world’s airlines may have lost as much as $15 billion due to passenger and freight cut backs
New York City’s comptroller estimated the attacks will cost the city’s economy $1.7 billion in lost sales and $1.75 billion in lost rent by the end of FY 2003
The world’s insurance industry took an estimated $50 billion hit. The cost to insurers will be passed on to all of us, but primarily to businesses.
These costs are huge and affect every aspect of the business world. We must take up the challenge – together – to defeat global terrorism.
Forging the Tools to Fight Terror
President Bush told Congress: "Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists." Most have already chosen, and they have chosen to stand with us against terrorism.
On the global scale, many nations have made pledges and contributions on all fronts. We are receiving diplomatic, political, financial, police, intelligence, and military support. It is this concerted international action that will ultimately bring success to our campaign.
Terrorist Funding
Funding is a critical element in large-scale terrorist operations and in the recruiting of supporters. It is the oxygen of terrorism. We – you and I – need to work together to choke it off.
We – together with our coalition partners - are working diligently to choke off terrorist funds:
The first shot in the war against "terrorism with a global reach" was fired on Sept. 24 when the President signed Executive Order 13224.
This E.O. freezes the assets of known terrorists and their supporters, and blocks U.S. transactions with them. The order covers 189 terrorists, including all 22 of the FBI's Most Wanted Terrorists, as well as terrorist organizations, and terrorist financiers associated with them. A previous E.O., in effect since 1995 and renewed each year since, includes al-Qaida as well as such groups as Hizballah and Hamas that represent a terrorist threat to the Middle East peace negotiations. You can find a current list of all named groups on the Department’s web site, WWW.State.Gov.
UNSCR 1373, unanimously adopted in September, extends the campaign to freeze terrorist assets to the international community. The resolution obliges all states to deny financing, support, and safe harbor for terrorists. It is binding on all member states under international law, and provides for a follow-up mechanism to monitor compliance
This effort has already yielded results, but more should be done.
150 nations--more than half the world --have acted to choke off the oxygen of money for terrorists.
The United States has frozen some $34 million
Millions of additional dollars are being frozen around the world -- over $70 million.
This effort is a continuing process, in which many other nations have joined. For example, just this week the Saudi Government joined the U.S. in blocking assets of two organizations (Bosnia-Herzegovina branches of Al-Haramain) engaged in supporting terrorist activities.
The Taking of U.S. Hostages – What the U.S. will and won’t do.
The business community has every reason to be concerned about their employees in overseas locations. US policy on what to do when an American is abducted was recently reviewed, but the basics are still the same:
The United States will make every appropriate effort to gain the safe release of an American who is taken hostage.
We will treat every abduction of a U.S. citizen, official or unofficial, with the same priority.
The U.S. Government may make contact with representatives of the captors, in order to obtain the release of hostages
We will facilitate contacts with local authorities. However, U.S. goals are to pursue hostage takers alone or in cooperation with other governments.
Above all, our memory long – we will pursue hostage takers, apprehend them, prosecute them.
What the US won’t do is to pay ransom, encourage the payment of ransom, or make political or other concessions to terrorists that would only encourage more kidnapping.
Pipeline Security
Another area of major concern to businesses is the safety of oil pipelines.
According to the American Petroleum Institute, U.S. consumers use 20 million barrels of crude oil a day (bpd).
Domestic refineries process only 6 million bpd. – Hence, the majority of petroleum is imported.
In 2001, Colombia’s Cano-Limon-Convenas pipeline was attacked 170 times and was shut down for six months. Total loss in revenue was $500 million (based on 115,000 bpd). It has been attacked 13 times so far this year.
Protecting the petroleum infrastructure is a big job. We are working with the petroleum industry to help them keep these pipelines safe from attack. For example, we are currently developing a series of pipeline security courses for Colombia that will assist in such areas as the electronic detection of line tampering, and the development of a Rapid Response Force to repair damage after attacks. This program also has important applications to the new pipelines being planned in Central Asia.
Other Measures
We have a number of other tools on our counterterrorism tool kit that may be of special interest to the business community. For example, the Overseas Security Assistance Council was established in 1985 by the U.S. Department of State to foster the exchange of security related information between the U.S. Government and American private sector operating abroad. Administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, OSAC has developed into an enormously successful joint venture for effective security cooperation. Through OSAC, the American private sector, including colleges and universities, is provided timely information on which to make informed corporate decisions on how best to protect their investment, facilities, personnel and intellectual property abroad.
The Bureau of Consular Affairs publishes regular advisories on security conditions in countries around the world. These advisories are also available on the Department web site.
There are certain restrictions placed by law on trade with the seven formallly designated state sponsors of terrorism – Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Licenses are available for trade with these countries through the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). You should consult the Treasury Department’s web site for more information.
Conclusion
As President Bush told the United Nations last fall, every member state has a responsibility to eliminate terrorism. As the business community, you have a vested interest in joining this fight.
The international coalition, our bilateral programs, and the assistance we receive from you are just some of the measures we are taking to meet this new challenge. Our response to the horrific events of September 11 are broad-based and will not be completed in a short time. We are committed to a long term strategic campaign, in concert with the nations of the world that abhor terrorism, to root out and bring to justice those that use terrorism. As President Bush has told the world: "Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done."
Businesses can help by being alert to your business relationships, by keeping in close contact with the U.S. Embassy in any foreign country in which you operate, so as to reduce to a minimum the risks your employees may face, by contributing to the rewards for justice program, which augments money available to the United States to pay for information that results in the apprehension or conviction in any country of a terrorist. For example, we will pay up to $5 million for such information, or up to $25 million if the information related to Usama Bin Ladin, al-Qaida, or senior Taliban leadership.
But more importantly, businesses can help by staying in business.
We must be more careful about not opening strange envelopes, watching unattended packages, and keeping our employees safe.
While business works, while you accomplish your mission, you deliver a very important message of confidence in our form of government, in our society, and in our economy.
We cannot let the September 11 terrorists hijack our way of life. We are Americans.
We must remain engaged. We must say, in the words of Secretary Powell, to the underdeveloped countries of the world, to the nations who count on our business to bring energy and wealth and jobs to their society: "Watch us. We're not going to draw back behind our oceans and behind our fences. We're America."

Top 5 Ways Terrorism Impacts the Economy
By
Sean Ross
Updated June 23, 2021
Reviewed by
Michael J Boyle
The high-profile terrorist attacks in the United States, Bangladesh, Iraq, France, and Istanbul are only some of the more than 7,000 known terror attacks between the Nov. 13, 2015, attack in Paris and July 2016. 1 ﻿ 2 ﻿ Investors and businesses in the United States have dealt with the realities and tragedies of global terrorism since at least 2001, and the threat has only increased. While the human cost is devastating, the economic impact may be larger than most realize. The following are five ways that terrorism has an impact on the economy .
Key Takeaways
Terrorist acts can cause ripple effects through the economy that have negative impacts.
The most obvious is the direct economic destruction of property and lives.
Terrorism indirectly affects the economy by creating market uncertainty, xenophobia, loss of tourism, and increased insurance claims.
1. Direct Economic Destruction
The most immediate and measurable impact of terrorism is physical destruction. Terrorists destroy existing plants, machines, transportation systems, workers, and other economic resources. On smaller scales, acts of terrorism may blow up cafes, churches, or roads. Large-scale attacks, most infamously the World Trade Center bombings on Sept. 11, 2001, can destroy billions of dollars worth of property and senselessly kill thousands of productive workers. 3 ﻿
The impact of terrorism and war is always negative for the economy, and physical destruction is a large reason why. Productive resources that might have generated valuable goods and services are destroyed, while other resources are almost invariably diverted from other productive uses to bolster the military and defense. None of this creates wealth or adds to the standard of living, even though military spending is often erroneously cited as a stimulant; this is the "broken window fallacy" sometimes mentioned by economists. 4 ﻿
2. Increased Uncertainty in the Markets
Even if you do not live anywhere near terrorist attacks, you might still be negatively impacted indirectly. This is because all kinds of markets hate uncertainty, and terrorism creates a lot of it. The financial markets literally shut down after Sept. 11 and did not really recover until months after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 5 ﻿
There is plenty of debate about the depth and pervasiveness of the actual impact on financial markets. As the threats and publicity of global terrorism continue to rise, markets appear to be more and more resilient. Stock market indexes did not decline much after the terrorist attacks in France killed at least 129 people in 2015. 6 ﻿﻿ 5 ﻿ However, the deadly attack in Nice, France, in 2016 only adds to the sentiment that France may be an increasingly unstable place to live and do business in. The real threat of global terrorism from an investor's perspective is about the broader picture, not individual incidents. International investment and cooperation are lower in a world full of terrorism.
3. Insurance, Trade, Tourism, and FDI
There are two obvious industries especially vulnerable to the effects of terrorism: insurance and tourism. Not all insurance companies payout in the event of international terrorism or foreign wars, so the impact is likely less than you might first expect. Nevertheless, terrorism is a risky business for everyone, and insurance companies hate risk as much as anyone else.
Tourism is even more concerning. In France, for example, tourism accounts for approximately 7% to 8% of total gross domestic product (GDP). 7 ﻿ Vanguelis Panayotis, a director of MKG tourism consultancy, told Reuters that he expected a 30% decline in visitors to France in the month after the Nice attacks. 8 ﻿
On a broader scale, terrorism hurts international trade. This may be due to imminent threats, such as compromised trade routes and distribution systems, or because of the psychological and physical reactions to terrorism. This also means less foreign direct investment (FDI), especially in unstable countries.
$100+ billion
The estimated direct economic cost of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Including indirect effects such as stock market volatility and lost tourism dollars, the total impact is estimated to be around $2 trillion. 9 ﻿
4. War Is the Health of the State
There is an old saying in the study of political economy that reads "war is the health of the state." It means that during times of conflict, reactive governments and nervous citizens are far more inclined to give up economic and political freedoms in exchange for security. 10 ﻿ ﻿This could result in higher taxes, higher government deficits, and higher inflation. During wartime, the government often implements price controls and sometimes even the nationalization of industries.
Governments are less effective at managing resources for productive economic activity than private individuals, especially when those resources are co-opted to achieve a strategic military objective. When governments militarize, the private economy suffers. As economist and historian Robert Higgs demonstrated in his book "Crisis and Leviathan," many government controls stay in place long after military campaigns end. 11 ﻿
5. Increased Nationalism and Foreign Skepticism
The final risk to the economy is a political risk. This is already on display in the United States and Europe in 2016, where there has been a rise in skepticism of foreign cultures, businesses, immigrant workers, and refugees. Populist movements already won a victory of sorts in the United Kingdom, where anti-globalist and anti-trade sentiments helped pass Brexit. These kinds of major political events have an uncertain economic fallout on everything from currency to trade and diplomacy.
Closing down borders to trade and immigrant workers reduces the size and diversity of economic transactions and limits productive resources. Economists as early as Adam Smith contended that the division of labor and gains from trade are limited to the size of available factors of production. 12 ﻿ Just as a single household or town is less productive if it only relies on internal resources, so too do national economies limit themselves to the extent that they wall off external producers and consumers.

Effects of Terrorism on International Business: A Detailed Analysis - Silicon Essays
Effects of Terrorism on International Business: A Detailed Analysis
International Business
This paper gives a detailed analysis of terrorism and its effects in the fast increasing globalization that the world is witnessing presently. The paper draws attention to the fact that the globalization of terror has brought forth immense difficulties for transnational companies and organizations that are engaged in importing and exporting commodities and services in terror effected regions of the world.
The paper gives a logical analysis of the present scenario in a lucid manner that would make the reader understand the gravity of the situation where a terror attack takes place. The author has argued the need for consensus among the developed and democratic world and so also others who value life and properties of human beings to take proper action to counter these attacks.
Only weakening the attacks can the world be assured of further increase in bilateral ties and enhanced standard of living through the process of international trade. IV. Introduction The opening up of economies in most part of the world or globalization as it is called signaled a boon to international trade. However, the same boon to international trade has facilitated the rapid growth of transnational terrorism having its root in domestic soils which spread out further into the far reaching corners of the globe.
Terrorism has taken an ominous form in the present times leaving only a miniscule few countries out of its vicious grip while incurring huge loss on life, properties and business between nations in the most part of our planet. The origins of terrorism lies in the past history of mankind yet its implications have been more aggressive and having attained devilish proportions only in the recent past that could destabilize the whole of the international trade and financial order if the democratic and free world do not take cognizance of this problem.
In other words, terrorism has gained momentum with the rapid and fast changing global business environment due to the very reason that some people or parts of a community or nation are intransigent to the liberal exchange of views, ideas and actions of others which they feel are a threat to their own possessively held beliefs and practices.
When such exchange of liberal views and active demonstration of different values happen in the socio economic life of the community, the hardliners form a bastion to thwart the spread of such views and the rapid transformation taking place in the society which they feel is a threat to their own culture with utmost angst and violence.
There is no denying the fact that most terror originates from closed societies or regions where the dogma or practice of religion and social values are such as has been followed since times immemorial that they form an inevitable expression of dissent and outrage at the slightest hint of an intrusion of thoughts and actions from another community or region. This is more so when the ideas, thoughts and behaviors pertains to a foreign country with a totally different culture.
The orthodox communities in such instance wage wars carry out stealth bombings, suicide attacks and make all possible efforts to stop trade between the two nations and communities. In modern days terrorism is used in a more systematic ways to communicate a political, religious and cultural message whereby intimidating and spreading the fear among the gullible public. It has also been seen that modern terrorist aim to damage businesses more than any other targets which they feel can effectively put an impasse on the other community’s financial stability.
There are different forms of terrorism taking place around the world and they all aim to inflict fear upon the general public. The most common forms of terrorist attacks are carried out by bombings, guerilla squads, suicide attackers, kidnapping and hijacking and information warfare. The information warfare is the latest way that a terror group tries to demonstrate their strength and displeasure by uprooting the very base of the communication over which most governments and business organizations of the free world depends to a very large extent for their continuity and growth.
Yet what is seen to be terrorism may not be quite true for those who perpetrate it as they feel that it is the other side who is actually at fault and who are the real terrorists with seemingly neat manners and nice talks. The real reason for terrorism therefore is the growing discontent among a particular community when they see a threat to their own ways and means of practices and behaviors.
However, from the point of argument there may be several reasons that could look sound enough for giving justification to terror groups, but what cannot be forgotten is the reckless ways the life and properties of the civilians are put to stake. And this also means the dangers posed to the smooth flow of international trade without which the very basis and existence of the new world is not possible. V. Significance of the Study
The study assumes significance in the light of the numerous and even frequent attacks on innocent civilians by groups who have become enormous along with the ballooning growth of the world economy. The dastardly acts without an iota of compassion and reasoning by people who want to change the whole world order to their very own narrow terms have brought to focus that this area requires more in-depth analysis and holds potentials for future studies for mankind to be more knowledgeable in order to explore grounds wherein such incidents could be minimized and brought before the rule of international law.
If there is need for justification from the angle of the warring group and those who are the free liberals and who advocate a free society then the need of the hour is to come to an understanding whereby both groups could willingly express themselves and adopt procedures which could minimize such sort of terrorism activities in the future. Needless to say terrorists attack and destroy business and financial institutions with the firm and quite obvious belief that the most parts of the world depend on the world trade for sustenance.
Hence, by stunting the growth of business and trade they feel that they are to a large extent able to coerce the rest of the world to come to terms. Thus, the study is important not only from the point of curtailing the terrorist activities worldwide, but to see reason for what terrorist are trying to state and then derive at a consensus such that the extreme elements among the terrorist who see nothing short of the unreasonableness and those who are the moderates and who would like to have some support from the world, are singled out and segregated.
By doing so the students and researchers and general readers would have the ability to distinguish between the ideologically different groups, the moderates and the extreme hardcore elements that are hell bent to disrupt the entire flow of life as if it is their business to do so. The extreme hardcore elements are the political ideological groups, drug mafia, the religious bigots, and some extreme cults whose practices are highly questionable and do not in any way go with the civilized existence of human beings.
When it comes to the area of business it is usually seen that the effects of terrorism on the global businesses have been minimal if one considers the extent of damages caused by large scale wars. However, this is no reason to relegate the study of terrorism to a lower level for it is seen that the catastrophes of war is extreme and as such people by and large have already submitted themselves to the forthcoming casualties whether in the form of human life or business.
The fear psychosis on the other hand is more ominous with terrorism gaining ground as the population and businesses undergoes a series of frequent uncertainties, a sudden assault and then a relative period of ease due to which the actual normal life that was prevailing previously is never fully restored. The tension that a business organization experiences is multi-fold and on a continuous basis too and this is likely to remain so with no proper study so far being undertaken to tackle the menace from the grassroots itself.
Therefore, for businesses carrying on trade, whether domestic or international, an alternate means of survival has to be formed such that the financial constraints brought forth by terrorism can be effectively checked. This again would help in preparing future contingency plans for businesses carrying out trade in high risk, low risk or no risk terrorism countries or regions.
Another factor that has emerged over time in different literatures and the media is the presence of terror money or the ill-gotten money made by terrorist organizations which are in turn invested in shares of multi-national companies and in other securities which are traded freely as there is no proper means to control these properly. Further, the terrorist by themselves keep a low profile and their leaders who have come to the light seldom ever record these transactions in their own name, but do so in the name of their underworld accomplice or by their faithful proxies.
Again, some legitimate businesses are one way or the other transacting their business across countries with organizations belonging to a terrorist group by design or by ignorance. Several countries perpetuate business tensions too if the government of that country has an ulterior motive to help organizations belonging to terrorists to trade with organizations of other countries which had earlier carried out terror attacks on that country.
This can cause extreme embarrassment and there are several instances of governments of countries ignoring ethics and international agreements while forging business partnership with organizations belonging to well known terror organizations with an inherent desire to get access to the raw materials or services without which a part of their industry might find it difficult to survive. The US is one such country where its newspapers are the largest importers of Gum Arabic manufactured by Gum Arabic Company Ltd, belonging to Osama Bin Laden who incidentally has 70% shares in it.
The above example and many others clearly show how terrorism is intricately related with the mainstream legitimate business worldwide and there is frequent overlapping of trade with these hardcore elements when an international transaction is carried out between countries. Since, the terror organizations are numerous and so also the number of people employed by them, that it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate the good from the bad.
This is more prominently seen in the share market where the terrorist are skilled speculators and have made fortunes and thus been able to divert funds for financing further attacks on innocent civilian targets. The obvious solution then is to disallow activities which involve terrorists by systematically segregating them from the main stream activities. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done for it is impossible to identify a terrorist from the ordinary human beings until and after a terror attack takes place.
The damage occurring to business establishments, logistics, communication networks and political misunderstandings and suspicions leading to further deterioration of bilateral and multilateral trade is too enormous due to terrorist activities one way or the other. Besides, the severe monitoring of procedures, scanning of websites and cautious and detailed checking of transactions, both finance and non-finance, has led to greater rigidity of controls and time consuming efforts proving detrimental to the smooth flow of international trade.
It has been seen in several studies that terrorism creates a fear which generally disrupts normal business activities and their effects are as hereunder. V. (A). Consumer’s Lower Propensity to Consume The consumers in general show lesser appetite for consuming products or services after a terror attack had taken place. It has been seen that overall there is a significant fall in demand for weeks in and around the spots where an attack had taken place.
The growing atmosphere of uncertainty that prevails everywhere is not quite easy for the common consumers to think that everything is under control even though the authorities say so. In case of an attack of gigantic proportion the trade between two countries are greatly affected as the authorities are not likely to deny a second successive attack and this leads to a number of rules and regulations imposed or tightened and thereby several commodities ready for shipment may have to be scrutinized for custom clearance even more rigidly.
This obviously leads to time lapse, increased handling and shipment charges, increase in bank interest on loans due to delay, cancellation of orders and reduction in price of finished products due to its nature of being perishable commodity and other additional contingent liabilities which the business may have to experience. The next in line and which have direct consequences in the event of a terror attack is the tourism industry. Under such circumstances tourists altogether cease to arrive for the whole year giving a jolt to the tourism business.
V. (B). Shortages of Raw Materials Uncertainty is one of the most important factors leading to disruption of trade between countries. It is seen that importers generally fail to place repeat orders when they feel that the exporter may not be able to get the required raw materials for the manufacture of the items when a terror takes place near the vicinity of the company. This is because the entire supply chain of the manufacturer is disrupted and the importing party hardly feels any justification that the manufacturers would keep their word.
Again, some important chemicals and highly hazardous substances essential for the manufacture of an item may come under severe scrutiny or ban leading to production loss. V. (C). New Policy Regulations The government of the region or country which had experienced severe terror attacks is likely to introduce new stricter laws and monitoring which in general would affect the trade and commerce in that region. Even otherwise there can be changes in International relations between the affected countries with those with whom it has grave suspicions of having given shelter to the alleged perpetrators in its home land.
The case of India and Pakistan is very noteworthy in this regard with Pakistan being base to almost all the terror attacks on Indian soil. Although there is trade between the two countries it remains at very low or volatile levels and at times both countries opting for stoppages of trade due to differences at the political level mainly arising out of Pakistan adopting an attitude of rouge state and perpetrating terror in the Indian soil. V. (D). Absence of TCP
The absence of Terrorism Contingency Plan (TCP) can to a great extent inhibit a country’s future trade potential as well as prove to be a stumbling block to whatever trade was in progress prior to the terror attack. In fact, it is seen that most companies rarely have a Terror Contingency Plan in place and which if implemented could act like a shock absorber in case any damage is caused in the event of a terror strike on the company’s value chain.
Insurance policies to some extent helps businesses in recovering part of the cost of materials and damaged properties, it however, never actually helps in recovering the loss occurred in terms of sales lost, future uncertainties and loss on the manufacturing and distribution front which includes logistics too. Under such circumstances there is considerable loss for businesses when terror strikes near its vicinity. V. (E). Rise in Cost of doing Business There will be significant rise in cost of doing business in areas where terror attacks takes place.
This means that a business for continuity purposes would have to procure raw materials and other services from other costly sources when shipments to import from the previous suppliers fail. Again, there will be more additional software required for information network in the event of a cyber attack. Further, business would have to look after its own security by designing and implementing a better system for business continuity which inevitably increases the cost.
The government in all likelihood would be able to thwart a broader range of external threats, but might fail to address the security system for a particular business and its peculiarities. Moreover, the government of the country might increase its defense budget to counter problems of terrorism and thereby have less money at its disposal to address the security concerns of the individual businesses. V. (F). Rise in Unemployment
There is invariably a rise in unemployment in places where terror has struck due to the direct effect it causes on businesses and international trade. This may be mild or severe and depends to a great extent the way the political machinery of the country or region works. In many developing countries this may have disastrous consequences. Even in US the 26/11 attacks has had a significant effect on trade leading to unemployment. It is perhaps the vastness and soundness of the US domestic and international markets that had greatly checked the severity of unemployment.
For other countries this would have lead to a total collapse of the economy as mass unemployment would lead to social unrest leading to political instability in the region. VI. Purpose of the Study The goal of this study is to establish the importance of an effective all round deterrence against terror aimed at business organizations world wide and how it would help in mitigating the negative impacts on business with respect to its future growth and profitability.
The study’s prime aim is to facilitate further researches in this field such that it can be an effective ground for enabling a consensus driven discussion from academicians, scholars, students, businessmen, social and political leaders who have the genuine need to address the problems posed by terrorist activities. The study would in all probability lead to certain mechanisms from the viewpoints and suggestions raised by different academicians and scholars and so also the business groups.
During all subsequent discussions it would help to bring about certain valid changes in the international trade through better cost effective monitoring techniques, better contingency plans for protection of small and large businesses including tourism as well a more fool proof way of identifying and tracking money laundering. This concerted action would give ample justice for which the study has been undertaken and instill a greater response from all stakeholders from world over who wishes to see a phenomenal rise in international trade in years to come.
The study is therefore important from at least three points and these are as elucidated below. • There has been a steady increase in terrorist activities worldwide which clearly shows that the area of study has not been seriously pursued so far in order to recommend a proper defense mechanism that would save the huge loss incurring to international trade • There is also an increased intensity in terror attacks on both civilian and business targets over the years which have proved beyond doubt the incapacity of many businesses to recover the lost opportunities completely.
This jeopardizes the long term goals and targets of organization and in turn effects the economic development of the region. • Terrorism is relatively a new field of study and hence highlighting the importance of study in this area would benefit business organizations, policy makers and civilians. This is mainly because the study would throw up important suggestions and points of view from intellectuals to check its growing menace. This study has also taken into consideration the wide ranging implications of terror attacks and how the various literature have been able to throw light into the new emerging area of thought.
For the purpose of the study the available literature are not extensive enough to provide justification to such an important area of study yet they have helped in assessing the different viewpoints expressed by authors and academicians and the nature of terror threats that the world faces today. The paper underlines the need for a concerted action from all those people who would like to enhance their standard of living and free exchange of commodities, services and communication through international trade.
Under such circumstances any hindrance to free flow of trade is quite detrimental to the uplift of ones community and hence there must be a broad understanding by all stakeholders to fight terrorism. VII. Literature Review The literature reviews of different academicians and authors have so far been seen as quite meager when one considers the importance of the problem. Yet almost all authenticated journals and articles by authors point to the fact that terror not only disrupts normal life at places where it has struck, but has negative implications on businesses and disrupts smooth flow of trade between countries.
Again, all authenticated writings by scholars have pointed out to the fact that terror knows no boundary whether domestic or foreign and can strike anywhere at anytime on civilian targets in order to generate fear among the people. The latest form of terror is however the most feared among the modern businessmen and cross border traders and this is cyber terrorism. Cyber terrorist groups target the internet itself using DOS or DDOS virtually shutting down critical infrastructure and other software used constantly by organizations (Gable, 2010).
Nowadays there are hardly any companies who do not interact over the net or carry on their operation by online communication network. Hence, a terror attack on the network can shut down operations and destroy useful files and information for the business. Many companies having branches in other countries are also connected by intranet network which is equally vulnerable to such attacks. Since, the terrorist are low profiled people moving about just as ordinary folks do they are difficult to identify and their illicit transactions are never known.
Such is the efficiency of a terrorist that money laundering which is seen as yet another method the terrorist receives and provides the much necessary funds for the next attack. According to the authors Delston and Walls this type of money laundering is quite common as it seeks to disguise the proceeds of crime and moving value through use of trade transactions in order to legitimize their illicit origins (2009). In other words, the terror groups conduct their day to day business by stealth operations disguising their terror money in several forms.
In such cases in international trade and commerce the custom personnel must not only be vigilant about hazardous products being smuggled into a country, but must have the requisite knowledge of billing and the approximate prices of commodities that are being traded. At times, the actual cost of a commodity might be only $100, but the exporter may invoice it for $1, 00,000 to the importer as previously agreed upon where the difference in the amount stands for terror money that the importer makes in order to fund a ruthless operation. Such money looks every bit legitimate and passes on easily through approved financial networks.
This has given rise to whole lot of problems whereupon governments of different nations have undertaken to monitor the commodities that are being passed for shipment as there is always the chance of hazardous or nuclear materials passing through by declaring it as any one of the common items. Illicit transshipment and theft of nuclear materials used to manufacture bombs is not just a hypothetical worry, but an ongoing reality (Bunn, 2009). One of the important factors which several authors have voiced concern is the way globalization has been thrust upon the people with extremely different views and culture.
These communities by their very nature of being stubborn and possessing orthodox beliefs tend to express themselves in a totally different behavioral attitudes, views and preferences which in turn prove to be a stumbling block for smooth conduct of trade. In fact, globalization contributes to the creation of socio-cultural and psychological conditions which breeds discontentment and terrorism (Stout, 2002). Therefore, the need for the hour on part of every international business is to promote goodwill and understanding about different social, cultural and linguistic communities other than ones own.
However, some of these extreme elements rather than follow the path of least resistance try to foment trouble by hijacking the very beliefs of the people by calling themselves the real religious people. In many Moslem countries the religious heads under the threat of such groups and also by receiving cash benefits succumb to the pressures and ideologies the terror group dictates. The Pakistan based launching pad was effectively used by the so called Mujahidin or warriors of God, which consisted of Arab and Asian Moslems for carrying on their anti-Soviet Afghan campaign in the year 1979-1989 (Buckley and Fawn, 2003).
Here, religion compounded by the fear of Western or American hegemony created excellent conditions for such terror groups to emerge in rapid succession. Later on many of these terror elements would form part of the larger group whereby there strength would increase and so also pooling of funds for large scale terror attacks. Modern terrorist organizations are loose knit global entities that have practically no geographical borders, but use loopholes of each domestic law to establish safe havens (Airey, 2009).
However, the worst scenario seen in recent times is the timid responses of developed nations who have been under such attacks. Many of these developed countries have either a connection with a terrorist organization in the past especially during the Cold War periods. For instance, both the US as well as the erstwhile Soviet Union had their own well funded terror groups to launch attacks on each other. Again, for political reasons alone a terror group which showed allegiance to one country previously may have fallen out during the period of globalization.
The case is more intriguing when the warring group in another country can influence the political base of another country. The US failed to include IRA (Irish Republican Army) as a terror organization basically because it didn’t want to alienate Irish-American voters (Lutz JM and Lutz BJ, 2009). This kind of lackluster attitude on part of nations could hamper any consensus built to root out terrorism from the society. To reiterate the fact once more it is to be understood by the readers that the 26/11 attacks cost US 3000 lives while in July 2005 in London’s public transport system killed more than 50 people.
Further, the Madrid train bombing on March 2004 claimed 191 people. Even in Far East like Japan the terrorism has struck by domestic terrorist groups themselves. In 1994-95 Japanese citizens in Tokyo were attacked with chemicals which were allegedly to be carried out by the Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult of Japan. There are, in fact, hundreds of terror attacks carried out in different parts of the world and the severest attacks happen in places where the region or country is under occupation of foreign armed forces.
The Israel and Hamas conflicts have left huge number of people dead and so also in Iraq. VIII. Recommendations The paper suggests a strong agreement between governments of the free democratic world with those of moderates who would like to see a civilized world order. There must be a consensus reached between the member countries to share valuable information and counter terror methods that are being effectively implemented by another country or countries.
The internet is here to stay and would be the next big picture where most or a significant part of the international trade would be conducted. Therefore, there must be development of software that would upgrade the communication and online network sites and which would effectively thwart any terrorists hackers from assessing the information. Above all the governments should provide a broad outline of a practical contingency plan for business to cover any liabilities whether tangible or intangible in case of a terror attack.
Lastly, but not the least there must be careful monitoring of business transactions world wide and a systematic elimination of terror groups by addressing some of the issues like giving importance to different cultural groups working for the organizations. Once, the basis of difference which is mainly cultural, religious and linguistic is properly addressed there would be lesser pressure from potential terror groups to inflict damage to business. This again would lead to the weakening of the hardcore extremist terror groups. Reference List Airey T. Joseph (2009).

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one and see what I can gather about how terrorism affects global trade.

First, there's a blog post from the St. Louis Fed. It seems pretty informative. It defines terrorism and explains how it can impact trade through increasing uncertainty, raising business costs, slowing down trade processes, reducing investor confidence, and potentially leading to government policy changes. It also mentions that terrorism can sometimes lead to increased cooperation among nations, but overall, the negative impacts seem to outweigh any positives.

The article talks about different types of terrorism—domestic and transnational—and how transnational terrorism tends to have a bigger impact on trade. It also cites a study that found manufacturing, especially high-skilled manufacturing, is particularly harmed by terrorism.

Next, there's an article from "More Than Shipping" that focuses on the effects of terrorism on supply chains. It mentions things like increased security measures that can slow down the flow of goods, random inspections at ports causing delays, and the potential for increased costs due to these security measures. It also talks about programs like C-TPAT, which is a voluntary supply chain security program aimed at improving security and allowing for expedited processing for participating companies.

Then, there's a speech from the U.S. Department of State from 2002, which is a bit older but still relevant in some ways. The speaker discusses the impact of terrorism on business, particularly in terms of financing, kidnapping, and oil pipelines. It talks about efforts to freeze terrorist assets and the importance of international cooperation in choking off terrorist funding. It also mentions the importance of protecting oil pipelines and the economic losses that can result from attacks on them.

Another article is from Investopedia, listing top five ways terrorism impacts the economy. It starts with direct economic destruction, like property damage and loss of life. Then it mentions increased uncertainty in markets, which can lead to market volatility. Third, it talks about effects on insurance, trade, tourism, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Fourth, it discusses how terrorism can lead to increased government intervention and higher taxes as governments respond to threats. Finally, it mentions the rise in nationalism and skepticism towards foreigners, which can impact trade and business.

Lastly, there's an essay from Silicon Essays that provides a detailed analysis of terrorism's effects on international business. It covers a wide range of topics, including how terrorism can disrupt consumer behavior, lead to shortages of raw materials, prompt new policy regulations, increase the cost of doing business, and cause unemployment. The essay also emphasizes the need for terrorism contingency plans and better monitoring to prevent money laundering and other illicit financial activities related to terrorism.

Okay, so synthesizing all this information, it seems that terrorism affects global trade in several significant ways:

1. **Direct Economic Destruction:** Terrorism can cause physical damage to infrastructure, factories, and other assets, leading to immediate economic losses.

2. **Increased Uncertainty:** The unpredictability of terrorist attacks can make businesses hesitant to invest and consumers cautious in their spending, leading to a general slowdown in economic activity.

3. **Higher Costs for Business:** Enhanced security measures, insurance premiums, and the time spent on additional checks and screenings can all increase the cost of doing business, making trade less efficient and more expensive.

4. **Disruption of Supply Chains:** Attacks on transportation routes or infrastructure can disrupt the flow of goods, leading to delays and increased costs for shipping and logistics.

5. **Policy Changes:** Governments may implement new regulations and policies in response to terrorism, which can affect trade, sometimes in restrictive ways.

6. **Impact on Tourism:** Terrorism can deter tourists from visiting certain areas, hurting the tourism industry and related sectors.

7. **Financial Market Volatility:** Terrorist attacks can cause fluctuations in stock markets and other financial instruments, affecting investment and economic stability.

8. **Nationalism and Protectionism:** There can be a rise in nationalist sentiments and protectionist policies in response to terrorism, which can hinder free trade.

9. **Money Laundering and Illicit Financing:** Terrorism often involves complex financial networks, and efforts to combat this can require additional oversight and regulation in financial transactions.

It's clear that terrorism has broad and deep impacts on global trade, affecting not just specific industries but the overall economic climate and business environment. The key seems to be in managing these risks through better security measures, international cooperation, and contingency planning.

I think with this information, I can provide a comprehensive answer to the question of how terrorism affects global trade.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Terrorism affects global trade through direct economic destruction, increased market uncertainty, higher business costs, supply chain disruptions, policy changes, tourism decline, financial volatility, and rising nationalism.}} \]
