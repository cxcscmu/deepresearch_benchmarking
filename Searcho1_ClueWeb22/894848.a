Alright, I need to figure out how East Francia and England responded to Viking attacks. I don't remember much about this off the top of my head, so I'll need to do some research. Let's start by understanding who these entities are and when the Viking attacks occurred.

First, East Francia. I think Francia was a region in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, and it was divided into different parts, one of which was East Francia. So, East Francia would be roughly the area that is now Germany, right? And England is, well, England, obviously. Now, the Viking Age lasted from around the late 8th century to the early 11th century, so we're talking about the 700s to the 1000s AD.

I recall that Vikings were Norse seafarers who raided and traded from their Scandinavian homelands. They traveled extensively, settling in many areas, including parts of Britain, Ireland, France, and even as far as Iceland and Greenland. So, both England and East Francia would have been targets for Viking raids.

Let me think about England first. I know that England faced numerous Viking invasions, starting with the famous raid on Lindisfarne in 793. That must have been a shock to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Over time, the Vikings not only raided but also settled in parts of England, leading to the Danelaw in the north and east.

I think the English response involved several strategies. One was the establishment of burhs, or fortified towns, which provided defense against Viking raids. Kings like Alfred the Great played a crucial role in organizing defenses. Alfred even signed treaties with some Viking leaders, paying them Danegeld to stop raids. But I need to confirm these details.

Now, moving on to East Francia. I'm less sure about how they responded to Viking attacks. I know that Francia, after the division of Charlemagne's empire, was split into various regions, and East Francia was one of them. The Franks also faced Viking raids along their rivers, especially the Seine and the Rhine.

I suspect that the Frankish response involved strengthening fortifications, perhaps similar to the English approach. They might have also used Danegeld or similar payments to Vikings to buy peace. Maybe they had local lords take responsibility for defending their territories.

But all this is just based on what I vaguely remember. I need to look up specific details for both England and East Francia to give an accurate answer.

Let me start by searching for how England responded to Viking attacks.

Hi. Good day!
These are the several responses that England and East Francia done during the attacks of the Vikings:
Alfred the Great spent several years combating Viking assaults after rising to the throne. In 878, he gained a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington and forged a treaty with the Vikings, establishing the Danelaw in northern England. Alfred also watched Guthrum, a Viking chieftain, being converted to Christianity. He defended his country from Viking attack and rose to become England's most powerful ruler.
The Vikings were allowed to settle in northern France by then-King of France, Charles the Simple, in 911 AD. Rollo was the name of the Viking leader. According to legend, Charles granted Rollo and the Vikings access to the territory as long as they acknowledged Charles as their ruler.
The further explanation was provided below.
Step-by-step explanation
Early on, the Vikings attacked the abbey of Lindisfarne on a little island off England's east coast. Monks were either slaughtered or enslaved as the monastery was pillaged and burnt. Within five years, the Vikings were attacking France's north shore.
To fend off these Viking attacks, Charlemagne, the Frankish monarch, built a network of fortresses along the shore. The Vikings conquered the British Isles in the late 700s, encompassing parts of Ireland and Scotland. They created Dublin as a settlement in Ireland.
A strong force of Danish Vikings attacked England in 865 AD. In 878, King Alfred the Great of England destroyed this Danish army and confined the Danish Vikings to the Danelaw region of England. People in this area were governed by Danish law rather than English law.
The Vikings were allowed to settle in northern France by then-King of France, Charles the Simple, in 911 AD. Rollo was the name of the Viking leader. According to legend, Charles granted Rollo and the Vikings access to the territory as long as they acknowledged Charles as their ruler. To seal the bargain, Charles insisted on Rollo kissing his boot as a sign of respect.

Viking Answer Lady Webpage - Origin of the phrase, 'A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine'
Origin of the phrase, "A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine"
Dear Viking Answer Lady:
My question concerns a saying or prayer that was supposedly commonly known among those fearful of Viking raiders. It was rather brief and said something about "preserve us from..."   I really pored over Kenneth Clark's book Civilisation because I seemed to remember it being there, but no luck. Does such a thing sound at all familiar to you?  Would it be possible for you to pass it along to me or perhaps suggest where I might find it? I think I have made a good effort looking for it in the on-line materials relating to raids, warfare, etc.
Signed, Seeking.
Gentle Reader:
The phrase you are looking for is, A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine, "From the fury of the Northmen deliver us, O Lord."
This phrase is alleged to have been the litany of despair raised up in every medieval church and monastic institution, starting after the first Viking raid upon Britain and continuing during the years of Scandinavian attacks upon Western Christendom.  It has been shown, however, that the phrase is apocryphal 1.
No 9th century text has ever been discovered containing these words, although numerous medieval litanies and prayers contain general formulas for deliverance against unnamed enemies.  The closest documentable phrase is a single sentence, taken from an antiphony for churches dedicated to St. Vaast or St. Medard: Summa pia gratia nostra conservando corpora et cutodita, de gente fera Normannica nos libera, quae nostra vastat, Deus, regna, "Our supreme and holy Grace, protecting us and ours, deliver us, God, from the savage race of Northmen which lays waste our realms" 2.

Page from the Lindisfarne Gospels
The first Viking raid upon the British Isles occurred in 793 C.E., during the reign of King Beorhtric of Wessex.  Simeon of Durham recorded the grim events:
"And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars and seized all the treasures of the holy church.  They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea" 3.
Swiftly the news travelled across the Channel, coming to the ears of the Anglo-Saxon monk Alcuin, who served in the court of Charlemagne at Aachen, prompting him to write:
"It is some 350 years that we and our forefathers have inhabited this lovely land, and never before in Britain has such a terror appeared as this we have now suffered at the hands of the heathen.  Nor was it thought possible that such an inroad from the sea could be made" 4.
Alcuin went on to quote Jeremiah 1:14, "Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the North an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land," seeing the raiding Vikings as God's instrument of divine retribution upon a sinful people 5.
The ruins of the late medieval church at Lindisfarne
The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 793 records:
"In this year terrible portents appeared over Northumbria and sadly affrightened the inhabitants: there were exceptional flashes of lightning, and firey dragons were seen flying in the air.  A great famine followed soon upon these signs, and a little after that in the same year on the ides of June the harrying of the heathen miserably destoyed God's church in Lindisfarne by rapine and slaughter" 6.
Within the next five years, Viking raiders would strike at Lindisfarne and Jarrow in Northumbria, at Wales, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Isle of Iona in Scotland, and even the islands off Aquitaine in France.  Over the next 250 years, the Vikings became justly feared throughout Europe as the Hammer of the North.  While no known text actually documents the famous phrase, A furore Normannorum libera nos, Domine, certainly the sentiment would have been appropriate and understood in a heartfelt way by people from Orkney to Paris, from Byzantium to the New World, from Britain to Rome.

Viking invasion of Britain
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Battles of the Great Heathen Army 865–878
The Viking invasion of Britain in 865 AD is sometimes called 
the Great Heathen Army, or Great Danish Army or the Great Viking Army. Previous invasions were for loot, but this one led to semi-permanent settlement .
A large force of Danish Vikings attacked Anglo-Saxon England. This army appeared in East Anglia in 865. Unlike earlier Vikings who made brief raids on England, the Great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of England.

Early Viking raids[change | change source]
The first recorded Viking attack in England was in 793 at Lindisfarne.[1] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported " the havoc of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne." [2] There were many reasons that Vikings began attacking England. The populations of Norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries.[3] The Vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons. These young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship's crews to go on adventures. [4] The beginning of trade between Europe and England had opened up great trading centers. [3] Vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them. This was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected. [5]
The first raiders from the north who set foot in England were from Norway. [6] They sacked and killed monks at Lindisfarne and at Jarrow the following year. The Norwegian Vikings then established colonies in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They also settled in Ireland. The Vikings from Norway only came back to England in the 10th century and from their settlements in Ireland. [6] The Swedes, called the Rus, were to later expand eastwards into Russia. In 835 there was a raid at the mouth of the River Thames by Danish Vikings. [7] For the next thirty years these attacks on England continued. In 850 Canterbury and London were attacked by a Danish band led by Rorik. [7] He was defeated and killed the next year by Athelwulf of Wessex. Only twice had a Danish army spent the winter in England: in 850 and 854. [8]
The Great Army[change | change source]
In 865 the Danish Vikings changed their tactics. A large army made up of many smaller bands landed in East Anglia. For over a decade they remained in England destroying entire kingdoms as they went. [9] The Danes spent the winter in East Anglia. The local people bought peace with the Vikings by supplying them with horses. [10] After a year they moved northwards to Northumbria now a mounted army. [11] They captured York and defeated two Northumbrian kings, Aella and Osbert, who joined forces to attack the Danes. Both kings were killed. [10] In 867 they appointed a client-king [a] named Ecgberht over the Northumbrians.  In the fall of that year they moved south into Mercia. [13] The Danes made their winter camp at Nottingham.[13] In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred for their help against the Danes. [14] The Danes did not fight but allowed the Mercians to pay them for peace. [13]
The Vikings later withdrew to York. [15] The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. After twelve months in York, the great army moved south again into East Anglia. [13] Setting up winter quarters at Thetford they defeated King Edmund of East Anglia. Next, in the fall of 870 they moved to Reading.[b] [13] Athelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat.[17] In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. [17] Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. [17] Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. [17] Two months passed without any fighting between them. [18] The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. [18] Just after mid-April in 871, Athelred died. [18] At this point Wessex was the last remaining kingdom that hadn't been destroyed by the Vikings. [19] Within a month, Alfred, who replaced his brother as king, was defeated at Wilton. There were nine more battles between the West Saxons and the Danes in the next year. [20] Wessex finally paid the Vikings for peace which ended the fighting. Alfred remained on the throne. Of the two known leaders of the Danes, Ivar the Boneless disappeared from the records after 871. [20] His brother Halfdan Ragnarsson was still the leader when the Danes withdrew from Wessex to winter in London the same year. [20]
In 872 the Northumbrians rebelled against the Danes and ejected King Ecgberht. [12] They placed King Ricsige on the throne. Ecgberht took refuge in Mercia. The Danes came north to put down the rebellion, but succeeded only in subduing Deira.[12] Within a few weeks the Danes set up their winter camp at Torksey in Mercia. [c] The Danes had operated as a single army for nine years. But in 874 it divided into two armies. They never reunited.
The Danelaw[change | change source]
The Danelaw made up one-third of England at the time.
In 874 Halfdan took his followers north to camp at the mouth of the River Tyne. They raided the Picts and Britons in Strathclyde for the next year. [21] But there was little gain in raiding these poorer areas. The Danes had plundered the wealth of most of England and little was left. Halfdan began settling his men in the area of York. [21] The other army led by Gutheram, Oscytel and Arnuld was still fighting against Wessex at the time. By 876 they had concluded a peace with Wessex. In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester in Mercia. In 879 they moved to East Anglia. The leader Guthrum, known by his Christian name Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 'they occupied the land and shared it out.' [22] In 878 a new Danish army was camped at Fulham. But by 879 they had left England for the Low Countries .
The settling of a large part of conquered England by the Danes became known as the Danelaw.[23] It became the part of England where the laws and customs were Danish not English. At this point England became divided into three parts. These were Wessex, English Mercia and the Danelaw. [23] The Danelaw was a mixture of the native populations and the members of the great army who settled there. Many placenames were Danish. Many of the words in the English vocabulary have Danish origins. As late as the 11th century when a Scandinavian [d] came to England he did not feel out of place. The languages was the same and the customs were the same. This was true until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 when French was introduced into England. [24]

For 250 years, the Vikings were protagonists of the history of England: first as looters of cities, later as warlords who litigated with the Saxon royal house for the dominion of the island and finally as kings of the English. In the year 793, the Vikings landed at Lindisfarne, sacked the monastery and killed all the monks.  To avoid the constant Viking attacks on their lands, the kings of the English had to pay large sums of money. During the ninth century, the Vikings imposed on the Saxon kings a heavy tribute, the danegeld, with which they bought peace to the Vikings.

Alright, so I've got these search results about how England and East Francia responded to Viking attacks. Let's see what I can make of this.

First, there's a question similar to mine on Brainly.com, but the answer isn't very detailed. It mentions that Christian Europe was shocked by the Viking invasions after settling down from previous barbarian attacks and Islamic incursions. But that doesn't really tell me how England and East Francia specifically responded.

The second document is from CourseHero and provides a bit more information. It talks about King Alfred the Great of England defending against Viking attacks and eventually making a treaty that led to the establishment of the Danelaw in northern England. It also mentions that the Vikings were allowed to settle in northern France by King Charles the Simple in 911 AD, leading to the founding of Normandy by Rollo, a Viking leader.

The third source is from VikingAnswerLady.com, and it discusses the origin of the phrase "From the fury of the Northmen deliver us, O Lord," which was thought to be a prayer against Viking raids. However, the author notes that this exact phrase isn't found in any 9th-century texts, but a similar sentiment exists in a medieval antiphony.

The fourth document is from Simple English Wikipedia, detailing the Viking invasion of Britain, particularly the Great Heathen Army that arrived in 865 AD. It explains that this army aimed for conquest rather than just raiding, and it outlines the series of battles and treaties that followed between the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, leading to the establishment of the Danelaw.

The fifth source is another Brainly question, but it's about why the English were unsuccessful in attacking the Vikings. The answer there suggests that the English couldn't agree on the best way to defend their region against the Vikings.

From these sources, I can gather that both England and East Francia responded to Viking attacks with a mix of defense, warfare, and eventually accommodation through treaties and allowing settlements. For England, King Alfred the Great played a crucial role in defending his kingdom and negotiating with the Vikings to establish the Danelaw. In East Francia, King Charles the Simple granted land to the Vikings in northern France, which became Normandy.

It seems that neither England nor East Francia could completely eradicate the Viking threat through military means alone, so they resorted to treaties and allowing Viking settlements in certain areas. This approach had mixed results, as the Vikings sometimes respected the treaties, but there were also instances of continued raids and conflicts.

I should maybe look for more specific information on the strategies employed by England and East Francia in responding to Viking attacks. For example, did they build fortifications? Did they reform their military structures? Were there any significant battles that shaped their responses?

Also, I need to consider the long-term impacts of these responses. Did allowing Viking settlements lead to assimilation and cultural exchange, or did it create ongoing tensions?

Maybe I should search for more detailed accounts of the Viking invasions in England and East Francia and see how each region specifically tackled the Viking menace.

Let me try formulating a new search query to get more specific information.

Hi. Good day!
These are the several responses that England and East Francia done during the attacks of the Vikings:
Alfred the Great spent several years combating Viking assaults after rising to the throne. In 878, he gained a decisive victory at the Battle of Edington and forged a treaty with the Vikings, establishing the Danelaw in northern England. Alfred also watched Guthrum, a Viking chieftain, being converted to Christianity. He defended his country from Viking attack and rose to become England's most powerful ruler.
The Vikings were allowed to settle in northern France by then-King of France, Charles the Simple, in 911 AD. Rollo was the name of the Viking leader. According to legend, Charles granted Rollo and the Vikings access to the territory as long as they acknowledged Charles as their ruler.

Viking attack on the monastery at Lindisfarne in AD 793
Just as Christian Europe had settled down after the barbarian invasions, followed by the onslaught of Islamic armies, a new wave of barbarian invaders came from the north in the form of the Vikings. These raiders came from the countries we now call Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. The Norsemen (North Men) were skilled craftsmen, navigators and sailors. Viking longships were capable of sailing seas and oceans, as well as maneuvering in very shallow rivers and streams. No place seemed safe from these raiders. The Norsemen believed in many gods and goddesses. Odin was their chief of the gods. Since the Vikings were not Christian, monasteries were favorite targets of these raiders for the loot that could be found within their walls.
The Vikings launched an early attack on the monastery of Lindisfarne on a small island off the East coast of England. The monastery was plundered and burned, while monks were either killed or enslaved. Within ten years, the Vikings began attacks along the North coast of France. Charlemagne, king of the Franks, set up a series of defenses along the coast to ward off these Viking raids. In the late 700s, the Vikings invaded the British Isles, including areas of Ireland and Scotland. They established a settlement in Ireland, known as Dublin.
In 865 AD, a large army of Danish Vikings invaded England. Alfred the Great, King of England, defeated this Danish army in 878 and restricted the Danish Vikings to the eastern part of England, known as the Danelaw. Here people were subject to Danish law, rather than English law.
In 911 AD, then King of France, Charles the Simple, allowed the Vikings to settle in an area of northern France. The Viking leader was named Rollo. As the story went, Charles allowed Rollo and the Vikings this land as long as they recognized Charles as their overlord. To seal the deal, Charles demanded that Rollo kiss his boot as an act of homage. As Rollo knelt down, he grabbed underneath the king's boot with both hands and flipped him to the ground. The Vikings apparently bowed to no one, including the king of France.
The Vikings successfully sailed into the land we now call Russia. Vikings took slaves from this land. People in Eastern Europe are called Slavs --where we get the word slaves -- to this day. Sailing through Eastern European rivers, the Vikings made their way to the Mediterranean Sea. In 988 AD, Byzantine Emperor, Basil II, formed the Varangian Guard, an army of Vikings to serve as his personal bodyguards. Being emperor of the Byzantine Roman Empire was not easy, assassinations were common, many times by the very soldiers whose job it was to protect the emperor. There were no clear lines of succession from one emperor to the next. This problem in Byzantium was known as the "Malady of the Purple," since emperors wore purple clothing. These common assassinations were the reason Basil preferred mercenary Viking guards over Byzantine guards.
The Viking settlers in Northern France, who came with Rollo, eventually converted to Christianity and spoke French. These Vikings were called the Normans (derived from the word Norsemen). These Normans lived in an area of France called Normandy. The Normans, along with their leader William, the Duke of Normandy, would change history forever in the year 1066.

Viking Conquest in England

Early Attacks
The attacks of the Scandinavian Vikings on the coast of Britain began at the end of the VIII century. Initially, these were the Norwegians, who in 793 pillaged Lindisfarne, and soon founded colonies in Ireland, on the Orkney and Shetland Islands. In the first half of the 9th century, Danish raids began. The disintegration of the English state in the middle of the 9th century allowed the Vikings to proceed to the systematic conquest of England. The first large Danish army landed on the coast of East Anglia in 865, led by Ivar and Halfdan, the sons of the Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok. Having made East Anglia its ground base, in 866 the Vikings captured York, and the following year defeated the army of Northumbria and put their protege Egbert I on the throne of this kingdom. Subjugating all of East Anglia, in 870 they moved to Wessex and set up camp in the Reading area. Although the Anglo-Saxons managed to win the battle of Ashdown, this did not stop the advance of the Vikings, and King Alfred the Great was forced to buy a truce. In 873, the Danes seized the eastern part of Mercia and put the rest of their appointee Kelvulf on the throne. Danish military forces were constantly reinforced by the arrival of new Scandinavian troops in England.
The first territorial division of the conquered lands between the Danish armies, indicating the transition of the Vikings to sedentary life, dates to 876. In 877, several Danes’ armies settled in eastern Mercia, which marked the beginning of the “Five Burgs area”. The advance of the Vikings was stopped only in 878 as a result of the victory of Alfred the Great’s Anglo-Saxon army under Eddington, which ensured the preservation of Wessex’s independence and led to the unification of the remnants of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms into a single state. In 886, Alfred the Great got  London from the Danes and concluded a peace treaty with Guthrum, the Viking leader of East Anglia, who recognized the independence of both states and established the western border of the Danish possessions. This document laid the foundation for the existence of Danelaw as a special state entity governed by its own laws. The treaty of 886 also fixed the civil equality of the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings in the territory of Danelaw. In 892 – 896, a new Viking army landed on the coast of Wessex, and the Danes of East Anglia and Yorkshire came to the rescue. However, King Alfred managed to create a national defense system and his own fleet, which allowed the Vikings to fight back.
Later Period
By the beginning of the X century, the Scandinavians occupied the territory from the Thames to the Tis, moved to a sedentary economy and created their own social organization. There was no political unity between the various Danelaw territories, but in the event of war they united against the Anglo-Saxons. By the systematic offensive on the Danish lands, the Anglo-Saxon state passed during the reign of Edward the Elder. By the year 919, after several years of uninterrupted campaigns in Danelaw, the power of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs was recognized by all of England south of the Humber. The entry into England, however, did not entail changes in the ethnic composition, social structure or the introduction of Anglo-Saxon law. Danelaw remained a virtually autonomous region. However, while the English kings regained their power in Central England, Norwegian Vikings from Ireland invaded Northumbria and established their own independent kingdom in York. In 937, the Anglo-Saxons managed to inflict a crushing defeat on the combined forces of the Scandinavian kings of York and Dublin under Brunanburg, however, already in 939, the Dublin king Olaf I Guthfrisson again occupied York and the next year invaded England. According to the agreement of 940, the region of the former Union of the Five Cities was ceded to him, although two years later this territory returned under the authority of the Anglo-Saxons. In 944, the new king of York, Olaf II Quaran, led the invasion of the Norwegians into England, but the attack was repulsed, and the residents of Danelaw supported the Anglo-Saxon king, which allowed King Edmund I to regain the power of the kings of England over York. In 947, the Vikings re-captured the city. The struggle for York continued with varying success over several decades, until, in 954, when the Kingdom of York finally become part of England.
New Danish raids began in the 990s. In 991, Danish troops looted West Wessex, forcing the English kings to begin collecting “Danish money” – the first historically known universal tax in Britain. Then the raids became frequent. In response to the invasion, the Anglo-Saxon king Etelred II in 1002 organized mass pogroms of the Danes who lived in England. But this did not stop the Vikings, and over the years 1009-1012 the army under the command of Torkel Long destroyed the southern regions of the country. The defense of the country and its morale were undermined. When the king of Denmark, Sven, became head of the Viking army in 1013, the Anglo-Saxon state could not resist the invaders. Residents of Danelaw and part of the Anglo-Saxon residents went over to the side of the Danes. King Ethelred II and his family fled to Normandy. Although after the death of Sven in 1014, Ethelred briefly regained his power in England, in 1016 the military service of the nobility and the clergy of Wessex and Danelaw recognized the son of Sven Cnut as king. Despite the heroic resistance of Edmund Ironbok, the Anglo-Saxon troops were defeated and the country was united under the authority of the Danish dynasty of Cnut the Great. During Cnut’s reign, the Scandinavian element in the English state sharply increased, and the Danish aristocracy occupied leading roles in the country. At the National Assembly in Oxford in 1018, in which both the Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon kingdom of nobility took part, conditions for the coexistence of two nations within a single state were agreed. Danelaw finally became part of England.

3 Key Battles in the Viking Invasions of England

793 saw the arrival of the Scandinavian Vikings to English shores. A relatively small contingent was seen disembarking on the south west coast and the local shire reeve went to greet them, thinking they were merchants. They slaughtered him and his retinue – a symbol of things to come.
The Viking Sagas tell how their full invasion of England was because Aella, King of Northumbria had killed the famous Danish king, Ragnar Lodbrok. His sons, Ivar, Ubba and Halfdan were those who lead the ‘Great Heathen Army’ (as it was known in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles) across the sea to take revenge upon Northumbria and, in time, the whole of England.
Here are three key battles of the time.
1. The Battle of York
Ivar’s army landed first in East Anglia in 865 and the local East Anglians quickly sued for peace. They provided the Vikings with treasure, shelter, food and horses – on the provision that they did not lay waste the kingdom. The Vikings acquiesced: they were awaiting reinforcements. Once they arrived in the late autumn of 866, Ivar marched his forces north.
On 1 November, the Vikings routed Anglo-Saxon forces in York, which was the capital of Northumbria at that point. They had taken the defenders by surprise as it was customary for no battles to be fought in the winter, and Northumbria was in the midst of a civil war at that time. Ivar’s unconventional tactic worked and York’s defence was washed away with relative ease.

It wasn’t until the following spring that the feuding Saxon claimants to the throne of Northumbria, Osberht and Ælla (the man who had killed Ragnar), joined forces to evict the Vikings from their country.
The assault began well. Those Vikings arrayed before the city were routed and sent fleeing back behind York’s Roman walls. The Northumbrian army quickly followed, finding the ancient wall crumbling and the defences in disrepair. Tearing down the flimsy palisade, they charged into the narrow streets after Ivar’s retreating army.
The Vikings are often portrayed as fearsome and brutal in war, but rarely as intelligent tacticians. The battle of York, however, is evidence to the contrary. Any advantage that the Northumbrians had in numbers (helped by their levying of the country’s peasant labourers) was entirely negated in the narrow streets of York.
Farmers found themselves facing skilled mercenaries in single combat. The result was a bloodbath: a large percentage of the Northumbrian army was killed. Ivar’s first campaign was a success; Northumbria belonged to him. He quickly installed a puppet king, Ecgberht, to rule on his behalf.
2. The Battle of Englefield
By the end of 870 the Great Heathen Army had control of Northumbria and East Anglia. Ivar’s brother Halfdan struck out from their base in East Anglia at Wessex, seizing the town of Reading in late December 870 with relative ease and transforming it into a Viking base. From there they began to raid and plunder the rich countryside of Wessex.

Before the year’s end Halfdan and another powerful chieftain, Bagsecg, were out foraging in the countryside along the banks of the river Kennet. An advance force of Wessex’s army, lead by the Ealdorman Aethelwulf, met them in battle, taking them completely by surprise.
The battle was short and the Vikings were routed. They made two mistakes in the battle: splitting their forces and underestimating their opponent. One half of the army had assaulted the Saxons up a hill while the other had moved to strike at the advancing force.
Through a combination of surprise and fearsome resolve in the defence of their own country, the forces of Wessex destroyed the Viking forces and sent the survivors back to Reading with stories of the first decisive victory for the Saxons. It was short-lived however, and several other battles occurred in quick succession, leaving the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings in something of a stalemate.
3. Alfred the Great and the Battle of Edington
In 878 Anglo-Saxon England was on the verge of annihilation. At the start of the year, the Vikings, led by Guthrum (one of many self-proclaimed Danish kings) broke previous terms of peace between him and Alfred and launched a surprise attack on Chippenham, where Alfred was staying over the winter.
Chippenham was ill equipped to deal with the surprise attack: Alfred was forced to flee from Guthrum’s forces and his army was scattered and leaderless. Alfred took refuge in the marshlands of Somerset, where he fortified his position and launched guerrilla raids against the Danish occupiers.
Hearing news of their king’s survival and courage in fighting on against the invaders, many from Wessex, lords and ordinary men alike made for the hidden islands of the Somerset marshes to join Alfred.

By the spring of 878, King Alfred had gathered a large enough force to meet Guthrum in the open field. It was a roll of the dice. Instead of earning small sections of his country back piece by piece, Alfred chose to confront the Viking leader directly. If he won, he would regain his kingdom with one victory. If he lost, it could be catastrophic.
This seminal battle was fought upon the hills by the village of Edington, namely the old iron age fort of Bratton. Guthrum chose the ground, placing himself between Alfred and Chippenham and forcing a pitched battle on his terms.
Guthrum’s main fort was arrayed within the old ramparts of the iron age fort – by then just mounds of grass covered earth, but with a ditch in front of it, it still provided a decent obstacle. Little detailed description survives of the battle, despite its fame and importance, but the monk Asser, Alfred’s biographer and adviser, wrote that:
‘[Alfred] moved his forces and came to a place called Edington, and fighting fiercely with a compact shield wall against the entire Viking army, he persevered resolutely for a long time; at length he gained victory through God’s will.’
The way open battles were fought at this time was two walls of shields pressed against each other – the sheer weight of the opposing forces crushing those at the centre together. It would have been bloody and brutal, with huge numbers of both sides injured or dead.
This is the fort that Guthrum (Blue) chose to set his battle lines. Alfred (Red) assaulted through the ditch and over the ramparts to achieve victory.
In the end Guthrum chose to flee and fight another day. As he left the battle the Viking shield wall crumbled and,
‘Alfred destroyed the Vikings with great slaughter, and pursued those who fled as far as the stronghold, hacking them down.’
With one battle Alfred had won back his kingdom; more importantly however, he had shown that the Vikings were not unbeatable. The reclamation of Wessex began a series of events that would end in Alfred’s descendants becoming rulers of a united England. But there were still many battles to come.
For 600 years the Anglo-Saxons came to dominate England. This period of English history has sometimes been perceived as one of little cultural development and the Anglo-Saxons as an unsophisticated people. However, there is plenty of evidence to negate this view, as Dr Janina Ramirez explains.

Okay, so from these additional search results, I'm getting a clearer picture of how England and East Francia responded to Viking attacks.

Starting with England, the Viking invasions began in the late 8th century with raids like the one on Lindisfarne in 793. These early raids were hit-and-run attacks aimed at plundering monasteries and coastal towns. Over time, the Vikings started to settle in England, leading to more sustained conflicts.

In 865, the Great Heathen Army, led by Ivar the Boneless and his brother Halfdan, landed in East Anglia with the intention of conquest rather than just raiding. They quickly moved north and captured York in 866, defeating the Northumbrian kings Aella and Osbert. This marks a significant shift from raiding to a bid for territorial control.

The Vikings then turned their attention to Mercia and Wessex, the two remaining major Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In 870, there was a series of battles between the Vikings and the West Saxons, including the Battle of Reading and the Battle of Ashdown. Initially, the West Saxons under King Ethelred and his brother Alfred had some successes, but ultimately, they had to pay the Vikings to withdraw.

After Ethelred's death in 871, Alfred became king and continued to face Viking threats. In 878, Guthrum, a Viking leader, launched a surprise attack on Chippenham, forcing Alfred to flee to the Somerset marshes. However, Alfred regrouped and in May 878, he defeated Guthrum at the Battle of Edington. This victory was pivotal as it halted the Viking advance and led to the Treaty of Wedmore, which established the Danelaw—a region in eastern and northern England under Viking control.

So, England's response involved a mix of military resistance, diplomatic negotiations, and eventually, accommodation through treaties that allowed Viking settlement in certain areas. King Alfred is particularly noted for his strategic approach, including the building of fortifications and the reorganization of the army and navy.

Now, turning to East Francia, which was part of the Carolingian Empire. The Vikings also raided the coasts of Francia, targeting monasteries and towns along rivers like the Seine and the Loire.

Charlemagne, the Frankish king, had established a series of defenses along the coast to counter Viking raids. However, these measures were not entirely effective, and Viking attacks continued.

In 911, the Frankish king Charles the Simple granted a substantial territory in northern France to the Viking leader Rollo, in exchange for Rollo's recognition of Charles as his overlord. This territory became known as Normandy, and the Vikings who settled there eventually adopted Christianity and the French language, integrating into Frankish society.

So, East Francia's response to Viking attacks included defensive measures like building fortifications and, in the case of Charles the Simple, granting land to Vikings in exchange for peace and their allegiance.

Comparing the two responses:

- **England:** Engaged in prolonged military conflict, with periods of payment (Danegeld) to Vikings, and eventual establishment of the Danelaw.

- **East Francia:** Built coastal defenses and, in the case of Normandy, granted land to Vikings in exchange for peace and fealty.

Both approaches had their challenges and successes. The English approach led to a divided England with the Danelaw, while in East Francia, the integration of Vikings in Normandy eventually contributed to the region's strength and later played a role in the Norman conquest of England.

I think this covers the main points of how England and East Francia responded to Viking attacks. If I need more details, I can look for specific battles or leaders, but for now, this should suffice.
