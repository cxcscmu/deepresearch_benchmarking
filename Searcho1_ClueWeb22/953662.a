As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information on how some Christians choose to support LGBT individuals based on various theological interpretations and perspectives.

First, it's important to note that there is a wide range of beliefs within Christianity regarding homosexuality and gender identity. Some Christian denominations and individuals hold more conservative views, while others take a more inclusive approach. Here are some ways that Christians who support LGBT individuals might do so:

1. **Affirming Love and Acceptance:** Many Christians believe in extending unconditional love and acceptance to all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. They see this as fulfilling Jesus' commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself.

2. **Interpreting Scripture Contextually:** Some Christians interpret biblical passages related to homosexuality in their historical and cultural contexts, arguing that these passages may not directly apply to modern understandings of sexual orientation and gender identity.

3. **Emphasizing Grace and Forgiveness:** Those who support LGBT individuals often emphasize the themes of grace, forgiveness, and redemption in Christianity. They believe that everyone deserves God's grace, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

4. **Advocating for Equality:** Some Christians actively advocate for equal rights and protections for LGBT individuals, including support for anti-discrimination laws and marriage equality.

5. **Providing Safe Spaces:** Churches and religious communities that are affirming of LGBT individuals offer safe spaces where people can express their faith without fear of judgment or rejection.

6. **Engaging in Dialogue:** Many Christians engage in respectful dialogue with LGBT individuals and allies to better understand their experiences and perspectives, fostering greater empathy and understanding within their communities.

7. **Supporting Conversion Therapy Bans:** Some Christians support legislation that bans conversion therapy, viewing such practices as harmful and unethical.

8. **Promoting Education and Awareness:** They may also promote education and awareness about LGBT issues within their congregations and communities to combat misinformation and prejudice.

It's crucial to recognize that these approaches reflect diverse theological interpretations and ethical considerations within Christianity. The relationship between Christianity and LGBT issues remains a complex and evolving area of discourse.
