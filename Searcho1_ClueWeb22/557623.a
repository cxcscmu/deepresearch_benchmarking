Alright, so I've got this question: "Is social media helping or hurting us?" Hmm, that's a pretty broad topic, and I guess it can be approached from different angles. I'm not entirely sure where to start, but maybe I can break it down into smaller parts.

First off, what exactly is social media? It's platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and so on, right? They're online spaces where people can connect, share thoughts, photos, videos, and stuff like that. So, the question is whether these tools are beneficial or harmful to us as individuals and as a society.

I think it would be helpful to look at both the positive and negative aspects of social media. That way, I can get a balanced view and make a more informed judgment.

Let me start with the positives. One of the main benefits of social media is connectivity. It allows people to stay connected with friends and family, especially those who are far away. You can share moments in real-time, which wasn't possible or was much harder before the advent of these platforms.

Also, social media has been a powerful tool for raising awareness about various issues. For example, movements like #BlackLivesMatter or #MeToo gained momentum through social media. It gives a voice to people who might not have had one otherwise and can lead to significant social changes.

Moreover, businesses and entrepreneurs use social media to reach a wider audience, market their products, and build communities around their brands. It's a cost-effective way for small businesses to compete with larger corporations.

On the educational front, social media can be a great resource for learning. There are countless groups, pages, and accounts dedicated to sharing knowledge on various subjects. People can engage in discussions, ask questions, and learn from each other.

Now, moving on to the negatives. One of the biggest concerns with social media is privacy. These platforms collect a massive amount of data about their users, which can be misused or sold to third parties. There have been several scandals where user data was mishandled, leading to breaches and misuse.

Another issue is the spread of misinformation or "fake news." Since anyone can share anything on social media, it's easy for false information to go viral. This can have serious consequences, such as influencing election results or causing public panic over health issues.

Social media is also linked to mental health problems, particularly among young people. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to increased rates of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. The constant comparison with others' highlight reels can make people feel inadequate or unhappy with their own lives.

Additionally, there's the problem of cyberbullying. Anonymous or distant interactions can embolden some people to say hurtful things they might not say in person. This can have devastating effects on the victims, leading to stress, trauma, and in extreme cases, suicide.

Lastly, social media can be incredibly addictive. The algorithms are designed to keep users engaged for as long as possible, showing them content that triggers emotions like joy, anger, or curiosity. This can lead to wasted time, decreased productivity, and even addiction-like symptoms.

So, weighing these pros and cons, it seems like social media has both helpful and harmful effects. It's a double-edged sword. Maybe the key is in how we use it and regulate it.

I think it would be useful to look at some statistics or studies on this topic to get a better understanding. Perhaps seeing some data on the impact of social media on mental health or its role in spreading misinformation could provide more insight.

Let me try to find some relevant information. Maybe I can search for studies or reports on the effects of social media.

NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON MENTAL HEALTH
  
Health Tips
There’s almost 3.8 billion social media user globally. It allows us to stay connected with friends and family than at other times in history.
Social media can have both a negative and positive effect on the state of mental health. Most people want to find out the impact of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube on people’s mental health.
Recently, Facebook, which currently has 2.07 billion active users, understands that social media can have a negative impact on a user’s mental health.
According to research, 90% of young people between the ages of 14 and 25 are using social media networks. Besides, rates of insomnia and mental health disorders for the same age group have increased by 70% in the past 25 years. Therefore, social media seems to have a very detrimental effect on the new generation’s mental health. Let’s explore them.
Negative effects of social media on mental health
Social media can cause anxiety and depression.
A recent systematic study by a medical psychologist at Lancaster University in the UK looked at social media’s effects on consumers’ mental health. He revealed that social media use could lead to depression, especially when study participants compare themselves to other users.
Another new study found that the use of social media platforms was associated with anxiety and depression. In particular, the study found that those who used social media platforms the most had a higher risk of depression than those who used social media platforms less.
Interestingly, research has shown that using multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with stress and anxiety than spending time online.
Social media can lead to FOMO.
When you look at pictures of friends laughing at you on social media, it is a form of social anxiety. The form (fear of missing out) becomes more common.
The results of a study by Przybylski and colleagues show that FOMO is associated with a decrease in mood, unsatisfied life, and the need to search social networks and retrieve messages. According to a recent #StatusOfMind survey of around 1,500 adolescents and young adults published by the UK’s Royal Society for Public Health, a photo-based social media platform, Instagram, is sturdily affiliated with FOMO.
Social media can lead to sleep disruption.
According to new research conducted by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and supported by the National Institute of Health, spending more time on social media with teens increases their risk of developing sleep problems and symptoms of depression. Although the study suggests a link between social media use and sleep problems. However, researchers are concerned about the cause and effects of social media use on sleep quality.
Besides, artificial light sources such as telephone screens have been shown to interfere with the body’s circadian rhythm and interfere with sleep. Blue light naturally promotes sleep and blocks melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep/wake cycle.
Social media can lead to negative body image.
Earlier, magazines and television were accused of presenting false and invincible “ideas,” but now social media is not far behind. However, many social media platforms make it easier for us to gain approval for our appearance or compare ourselves with others. Not much is known about the harmful effects of heavy social media use.
Social Media can be addictive.
Scientists have found that the use of social media, such as liking and commenting on posts, and social interactions with social media platforms, releases dopamine into the brain (this explains we love to receive new notifications new ideas).
Researchers have also found that social media platforms such as Facebook can allow rewards and action on specific brain areas. It allows us to be more active on social media. Our social media does not share all the features of drugs or gambling. Studies show that quitting social media can also lead to a return of people who frequently use social networking sites.
Hopefully, you’re well aware now of the negative impact of social media on our health. Let’s discuss a few tips to overcome the negative aspects of social media on mental health.
Tips to avoid the negative effects of social media on our mental health.
Here are tips you can do on your own, with the help of loved ones, or alongside a counselor to help manage a social media addiction.
Set the timer to use
Facebook and Instagram have timers to monitor usage. They can alert you when you reach certain limits. When connecting to the Internet, it may be helpful to set a timer on your phone or other devices. Try using it for 15 minutes at a time.
Schedule a specific time (or pair) to verify your account
As mentioned earlier, this is very helpful. Plan your day. For example, use social media platforms for 15 minutes after breakfast, 15 minutes in the afternoon, and 15 minutes before 3 hours of sleep.
Install website blockers
These are web-browsing apps and add-ons. It allows you to choose sites and/or apps you can use. You will also find blockers that restrict access to certain times of the day and/or days of the week.
Other Tips and Ideas for Reducing Social Media Addiction and Creating Healthy Habits:
Stop following negative, scary, trolling, or click-byte pages.
Allow them to go online as a reward for completing a particular task.
Remove the application from your mobile phone and access your computer only when someone else is watching it.
Find a responsible partner. This is great for people who have no problems.
Think of social media that fills your life and other ways to fill it.
A journal to express and discover your feelings.
Contact with your friends and families from other sources, such as:
Write a real letter – everyone loves to receive emails
Call someone
Arrange to meet someone for coffee or lunch
Take regular walks with friends
Join a social group
Send a text message
Create a photo album or photo album to post online
Take a walk or exercise.
Conclusion
The correlation between the almost universal use of social media among adolescents and young people and the dramatic increase in mental health disorders in recent years is undeniable. Therefore, it seems appropriate to dedicate efforts to create rules that can further regulate the behavior of social media giants such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat. Equally important, however, is to strive to create educational resources and tools to teach the ever-connected new generation how to use social media healthily and effectively to maximize losses.

Social Media’s Positive and Negative Impact on Mental Health
There’s no denying that social media has its advantages. Keeping us connected to our loved ones around the world, keeping us entertained, and giving us an outlet to express ourselves. Especially during the pandemic, different platforms like TikTok and Clubhouse kept us entertained. I mean, can you imagine being stuck at home in 2003, playing snake on your Nokia? Well, yes, we’re pretty lucky. Sadly, there’s not always the case. Social media has many disadvantages; from bullying to self-hate, social media significantly affects mental health.
How social media affects mental health?
We spend a lot of time on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter to stay connected with people. Little do we know spending so much time on these platforms negatively affects our mental health, making us feel lonely, isolated, and comparing ourselves to unrealistic beauty standards set by influencers.
Studies concluded a link between excessive social media use and negative effects on mental health, including a higher chance of depression, anxiety, self-harm, loneliness, and could even result in suicidal thoughts.
The disadvantages of social media in details
Feeling insecure about your life or appearance. We’ve all compared ourselves to a model, influencers, or even our friends before. Although we know it’s not realistic, it can still make you feel insecure about how you look or how your life is going. These insecurities lead to feeling envy and dissatisfaction when comparing yourself to others.
Feeling excluded and isolated. Everyone shares most of what they do on social media. Have you ever been the excluded friend? Generally, the more you use social media, the more you feel isolated, excluded, and lonely. As a result, the phrase ‘fear of missing out (FOMO)’ became popular among people. FOMO has a negative effect that can lead you to become compulsive and obsessive by constantly checking your phone for updates, leading it to affect your self-esteem and increases anxiety.
Depression and anxiety. Many teenagers prefer spending time behind a screen over face-to-face interactions. For that reason, depression and anxiety rates have increased among teenagers. Studies show 20% of teenagers suffer from depression when reaching adulthood. It’s essential to spend some quality time with friends and family to be mentally healthy and boost your mood.
Cyberbullying. Did you ever read the comments on TikTok? Some are very offensive.  Most people are constantly cyberbullying each other on most social media platforms, including Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram. These platforms spread rumours and abuse people verbally.
How to decrease the impact of social media?
The question remains, how can we decrease the impact of social media on mental health? Well, if you’re constantly using social media, it’s important to remember, you can’t judge a book by its cover. You might see pictures of people and compare yourself to them, but nothing is as true as it seems. However, here are some things you can do to improve your mental health.
Decrease screen time
Studies have shown that spending less time on social media and electronic gadgets will positively affect your mental health. That’s why try limiting your screen time. How? By following these steps:
Set a time limit for each application
Don’t take electronics to bed
Delete social media apps if necessary
Limit checking social media
Change your focus
Instead of focusing on what others are doing or how many likes you’re getting, you should use social media apps to check on friends.
Spend more times with friends and family. Having a social life outside your online presence is essential to improve your mental health. That’s why when bored, grab a drink with your friends or check up on your family. It’ll help to limit you from using social media, and it’ll improve your mental health.
Practise mindfulness. Reflect on your life and try to see the positive things. Practising mindfulness helps you focus on the present moment instead of thinking about ‘what is’ and ‘what could’ve been.’ Living in the present moment enables you to express gratitude, love and improves your mental health.
The Upsides of Social Media
Social media gave us a laugh during the 2020/2021 lockdown. With memes all over the internet and humorous TikTok videos, I don’t think we could’ve made it through the lockdown without them.
When we’re too busy to catch up with our friends, Snapchat streaks gave us a chance to connect with our friends and family and keep up with what they’re doing.
In addition, no matter how far a person is, you can talk to them through different social media apps at any time. Not to mention having space where you can feel connected, empowered, and feel included in a community that shares the same experiences. Social media has made it possible for people to start revolutionary campaigns and share their stories. For instance, the #metoo movement and the #blacklivesmatters broke the silence of many people and provided them with a space to share their stories and feelings.
Of course, that’s a small part of the role of social media. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram have opened job opportunities for people by becoming influencers and making money from the platform itself.

The effects of social media on mental health - Medical News Bulletin
The effects of social media on mental health
By
Maor Bernshtein
Social media can have significant effects on various mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, addictions, and insomnia.
Social media has become tremendously common over the past decade. A majority of people report using some type of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, at least once per day. 1
According to recent data, as many as 90% of young adults currently spend time on social media sites. 2 This figure has increased nearly nine-fold since 2005, where only 12.5% reported frequent time spent on social media platforms. 2
With such a rise in the use of social media, many researchers have begun investigating its effects on mental health.
Disorders such as depression and anxiety have been very common in the past several decades. Amongst adults in the United States, approximately 7% of adults are affected by depression each year, while 18% are reported to be affected by anxiety. 3
Among the younger population, reports of mental health problems are particularly disturbing. Some data suggest, for instance, that 30% of college students are affected by depression, while 58% of counselling centers in the United States witnessed an increase in students seeking help for depression. 2
Such mental health disorders have been linked to severely diminished functioning and serious mental anguish, but several studies have shown an increased risk of developing other illnesses and even increased rates of mortality. 4
Anxiety, depression, insomnia, stress and social media use
One study examined the effects of social media on mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress. 1 The study included over 450 adult participants who completed surveys related to social media use and mental health.
The study found that participants who reported problematic social media use (characterized by excessive use of social media platforms) were significantly more likely to have higher anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels. 1 However, the study reported that stress levels did not increase in these participants. In fact, stress was found to mediate the relationship between depression, anxiety, insomnia, and problematic social media use.
The researchers explain that while social media sites allow for more easy and frequent interactions with other people, such interactions are not of the same quality as those found in the real world. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, social media use can increase social support and life satisfaction, as well as enhancing self-expression and identity development. 1 In this way, the researchers suggest that social media may actually become a protective factor against depression. 1
While problematic social media use was found not to be related to increased levels of stress, the study determined that stress fully mediated the relationship between such social media use, depression, and insomnia, while partially mediating its relation with anxiety. The researchers suggested that time spent on social media platforms could be a coping strategy used when experiencing stress. 1
Patterns of social media use and mental health
Another study sought to understand particular patterns of social media use, and how these may be associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. 3 The researchers administered online surveys to over 1,700 young adults in the United States. The study reported that the participants could be classified into one of five different clusters. These clusters were named Unplugged, Concentrated Dabblers, Diffuse Dabblers, Connected, and Wired. 3
Those categorized as Unplugged showed no high levels of any categorized variables and included 18% of the sample. Similarly, 19% were categorized as concentrated dabblers, which reported spending large amounts of time on these sites and a strong emotional connection to a social media platform. Diffuse Dabblers represented 31% of the sample and reported using many different social media platforms without it being considered problematic use. The Connected cluster included 15% of the sample, with participants reporting a combination of using multiple platforms characterized by high intensity and frequency of such social media use. The last cluster, Wired, which contained 13% of the sample, was considered to be demonstrating problematic social media use, which can be thought of as an addiction-like relation to social media. 3
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Wired cluster was found to have the highest association with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. The Connected cluster was also found to be associated with an increased risk of such symptoms, though to a lesser extent. A similar pattern of increased symptoms was found with anxiety, whereby Wired cluster participants were highest followed Connected cluster participants, with no significant relationship determined between any other cluster. 3
Interestingly, the researchers determined that while participants categorized into the Connected cluster were very similar in terms of high frequency, time, and intensity, the same was not the case in the Wired cluster. The researchers determined that the observed negative effects on mental health were more dependent on a particular pattern exhibited by the Wired cluster than simply on increased volume of use. 3
Particular behaviors related to social media and mental health
Another study examined the particular social media use behaviors and their association with symptoms of depression. The researchers administered an online survey to over 500 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 38, exploring their use of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. 4
Upon examining the results, the researchers discovered three types of behaviors that were particularly related to major depressive disorder: social comparisons, social media addiction, and social interactions. 4
Specifically, people who were more likely to compare themselves to others who are better off, who indicated being more bothered if tagged in an unflattering picture, and those less likely to post pictures of themselves with others, were more likely to meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder. 4 Additionally, higher levels of social interactions, such as following over 300 people on Twitter, were related to lower levels of depression symptoms.
Participants who scored higher on a social media addiction scale were significantly more likely to show symptoms of depression.
Although these results seem to indicate a clear link between some types of social media use and depression, it is not possible to make firm conclusions. It is just as likely that many of these behaviors are an outward display of depressive symptoms. For instance, rumination is a very common symptom in people who experience depression and may explain such behaviors as being bothered when tagged in an unflattering picture. Similarly, social isolation is often very common in people suffering from depression and can explain the finding that following fewer people on Twitter is related to such symptoms. It is also possible, as the researchers point out, that social media use acts as a shield from anxiety-provoking real-life interactions. Social media use can also be an adaptive response by people experiencing emotional difficulties, with such individuals seeking to receive social support. 4
Treatment of problematic social media use
Although not much has been written on this topic, several researchers have examined potential treatment strategies for problematic social media use. For instance, one strategy may be to write down the amount of time a person spends on social media, and how valuable they find the particular social media site. 2 Another possible strategy is for a clinician to work with a patient on setting a specific time of day they can engage in social media use. 2 Some people can even benefit from taking a ‘digital sabbatical’, or a period of time where they discontinue the use of social media or other networking sites, while still maintaining important connections with others. 2
It is important, as is often the case, that if you feel that your use of social media sites is negatively impacting your life, you seek out the help of mental health professional. A healthcare worker can assist with finding the best course of treatment when someone is experiencing distress from problematic social media use. Although the majority of people do not appear to report severe mental health issues related to social media use, some may find that such sites are causing them particularly severe pain and distress.
While problematic social media use is still a newer area of research, it is becoming clearer that this issue is similar in nature to other types of addiction. Therefore, interventions by professional mental health practitioners may be necessary in some cases, and some individuals may benefit greatly from working with a therapist.

How is Social Media Affecting Mental Health?
How is Social Media Affecting Mental Health?

By Dr. Nicola Williams, Ph.D. Reviewed by Emily Henderson, B.Sc.
Social media use can feel akin to riding a rollercoaster. We may go from receiving likes to negative criticism in a short space of time and this can affect our mood accordingly. Social media can rob us of precious time, kill our attention span. In a worst-case scenario, it may impact our ability to follow through with our day-to-day responsibilities.
On the other hand, humans are social creatures and connection is implicit to our mental health and well-being. Social media helps us to feel connected and to find our niche through building a community of like-minded friends, people who are like us and with whom we have things in common. The positives and the negatives of social media use in connection with our mental health has been a source of debate. This article looks at both sides of the debate.

The dangers of social media for mental health
Mindlessly sitting and scrolling through social media is something many of us do when we have some spare minutes or even hours. The average American for example spends around 10 hours a day in front of a screen ––so plenty of opportunities then for mindless scrolling. But there are some insidious consequences associated with doing so. For example, America is facing a mental health crisis and mental health professionals are working to see how the use of social media fits into this epidemic. The problem is a global one.
Research has shown that social media can be damaging to our mental health for the following reasons:
It’s addictive; Whether or not we can get addicted to social media is a matter of debate, but a growing body of research suggests this is something to be aware of. Not only that but its use could be linked to substance use disorders and other kinds of addictive behaviors
It leads to more negative feelings than it does positive ones; Social media use has been linked to greater feelings of social isolation, in addition to the range of negative feelings discussed in this article
It can lead to difficulties with sleeping; For some people scrolling through social media at bedtime disrupts sleeping patterns
Comparing ourselves to others is detrimental to our well-being; Social media can lead to a feeling of envy (for more on this see below)
It leads to jealousy and can set up a vicious cycle of one-upmanship; People post images of a perfect life, a version of their best selves but its hard to keep this in mind when scrolling and comparing to others
More friends does not mean more social; More friends on Facebook does not mean a better social life in real life. Rather counterintuitively, social media use can be a lonely experience.
The delusion of thinking social media will help when it won’t; We keep coming back for more even after we’ve identified it is making us feel worse and not better
Feeling overwhelmed; Supporting others online can be very rewarding but could also become stressful and overwhelming and affect your mental health
Logging on to our socials even when feeling good about ourselves can lead to negative feelings and emotions ––to feeling more sad, anxious, annoyed, grumpy, and irritable than we did beforehand. Social scientists and psychologists have learned that social media can trigger what they’ve called ‘compare and despair’ feelings of envy, guilt, shame, and low self-worth. The alarming upshot of their findings is that social media can worsen many health disorders.
Children, adolescents, and social media
The problems of social media users are not just confined to adults. They apply to teenagers who at times may spend large amounts of time glued to their screens and children, including those of primary school age, and this despite the fact social media platforms require users to be age 13 to create an account. The rule can be bypassed by a simple change of date of birth when setting up a new account.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned of the potentially deleterious effects of social media for young people, pointing to the dangers of cyberbullying and “Facebook depression.”
The positives of social media for mental health
Human beings are social creatures and lack of social connection can be detrimental to well-being. Through being socially connected to others we can relieve feelings of stress, anxiety, and sadness. A lack of social connection can present serious risks to mental health and well-being.
One of the best things about social media is the prospect it offers us to be able to find our tribe or network of peer support. It could be our family, friends, a gardening club, or a book club. Rather ironically given the problems highlighted here one of the more beneficial aspects of online communities has been that of connecting, opening up, and sharing our stories about mental health issues. Social media can go a long way toward promoting belongingness.
What can be done to combat the challenges?
It is not necessarily social media itself that is the problem but rather how it’s used. It’s possible to educate oneself about the importance of developing what Durlofsky (2021) has called social-media literacy ––defined as an ability to deploy critical thinking as we process the knowledge and beliefs that arise from our use of social media. This allows us to be realistic about the information we absorb from social media and to be realistic about it.
These skills are like those used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). The development and deployment of such skills may help people to use social media in life-enhancing ways, in this way we can better curb the potentially less palatable emotions and feelings that can also, unfortunately, be a consequence of its consumption.

Alright, so I've got these articles that discuss both the positive and negative impacts of social media on mental health. Let's see what they have to say.

The first article from healthcaremarketingagency.net talks about the negative effects of social media on mental health. It mentions things like anxiety, depression, fear of missing out (FOMO), sleep disruption, negative body image, and addiction. It also provides some statistics, like 90% of young people between 14 and 25 using social media, and how rates of insomnia and mental health disorders have increased by 70% in the past 25 years. That sounds pretty concerning.

But then, the second article from psychreg.org balances things out by mentioning both the positive and negative aspects. It acknowledges that social media can be addictive and lead to feelings of insecurity and loneliness, but also points out that it can be a source of entertainment, connection, and even a platform for social movements and career opportunities. It suggests that it's about how we use social media and that there are ways to use it healthily.

The third and fourth articles, both from medicalnewsbulletin.com and medicaladvise.org, seem to be the same content, discussing studies that link problematic social media use to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. They mention that social media can be a coping mechanism for stress but also that certain patterns of use, like being part of a "wired" cluster, are associated with higher depressive symptoms. They also suggest that some behaviors, like social comparisons and addiction to social media, are related to major depressive disorder.

The fifth article from news-medical.net summarizes both the dangers and the positives of social media for mental health. It highlights issues like addiction, negative feelings, sleep problems, and the impact on children and adolescents. But it also notes that social media can foster connections and a sense of belonging, which is crucial for mental well-being.

So, overall, it seems that social media can have both helpful and harmful effects on mental health. The harm seems to come more from excessive or problematic use, while moderate and mindful use can have benefits.

Maybe I should look into some more general information about social media's impact beyond just mental health. Perhaps looking at its effects on society as a whole would give me a broader perspective.

1 Introduction of Social Media: Social Networking (Molly Sutherland & Sierra Moon)
Today, a large percentage of the population is connected in a new way, social networking. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram allow users to share pictures and other information with more people conveniently. Social networking reaches up to 82% of the internet’s population and accounts for 1 in every 5 minutes spent online (It’s a Social World, 2011). From “hashtags” to counting “shares” and “likes,” for many, social networking is a central part of building relationships with others.
Social networking and our social media play such a large role in current societal issues that we see today like the Ferguson, Missouri shooting, the popular fundraiser for the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, and the high topic media coverage about ISIS. With all of the societal issues that we face in today’s society, social networking and the social media help to bring all the current topics to our knowledge. Current research defines social networking sites (SNS’s) “as a means to where individuals are able to communicate in any manner they deem fit with the on-line community” (Saini and Moon, 2013, p. 3). To further supplement our definition, we state that SNS’s allow individuals to communicate in creative ways and are based on the perception of both sender and receiver in the on-line realm (Saini and Moon, 2013).
SNS’s provides all of us with our overall awareness about our current societal issues and the three most popular SNS’s in today’s society are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Facebook has secured its foreseeable future by developing itself with the times (Saini and Moon, 2013).  On Facebook on an average day, 15% of Facebook users update their own status (Hampton, Goulet, Rainie, & Purcell, 2011). Twitter has also taken our current SNS users by storm by allowing many individuals to express their concerns and thoughts about societal issues with only 140 characters permitted. Instagram has allowed its users to share photos quickly, instantly allowing all of its users to share photos that, often times, can contribute to the awareness of our societal issues more quickly in today’s society rather than waiting for pictures from a popular news story. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are all largely responsible for the social awareness and change for all of our business, personal, and public societal issues that we face every day.
2 Facebook and Social Connections (Hannah Sowers & Shelia Talbott)
Created as a social networking tool for the Harvard community in 2004 by Mark Zuckerbug, Facebook has evolved to become one of the largest social networking sites with visits by over 400 million people each month. (Carlson, 2010)^ ^  With the growth in visitation, Facebook has become a powerful tool for organization and coordination of groups desiring social change.  One example can be seen in Tunisia during the Arab Spring uprisings.  In 2008, less than 30,000 Tunisians were on Facebook.  By the time of the uprising in December 2010, there was almost 2 million or 1/5^th^ of Tunisia’s population.  During the uprising, video, pictures, and location of the protests were posted online.  One Tunisian citizen has called Facebook the “GPS for this revolution” indicating that it provided the direction for the uprising. (Rosen, 2011)
Facebook has also been used as an instrument for communication within US politics.  In 2012, President Barak Obama demonstrated the power of organization with Facebook during his reelection campaign.  By linking his campaign website to Facebook and requiring users to login using their Facebook credentials, the Obama campaign was able to construct a database that they then used to target potential voters with information and to solicit donations. (Pilkington, 2012)
In 2009, in response to President Barak Obama’s mortgage relief plan, a CNBC commentator referenced the Boston Tea Party of 1773.  From that sprung a political activist group that became known as the Tea Party.  Within weeks, Tea Party chapters sprung up across the United States with protests and meetings being organized through Facebook.  By use of Facebook, the Tea Party was able to have a strong influence during the 2010 mid-term election with the Republican candidates winning 60 seats in the House of representative. (Ray, 2014)
3 Twitter: The Power of the @ (Genesis Webb)
There are so many ways to communicate what is going on in our world. Another popular social media website that has changed the way many people communicate is Twitter. This website allows for a quick and constant communication with a small limitation on how much you can say. 140 characters to be exact is the limit individuals have to post in each separate tweet and with the ability to do this repeatedly, information can be spread rapidly to millions of users in a short period of time.
Twitter was founded in March of 2006 by Evan Williams, Noah Glass, Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone, all with similar ideas to provide a free and quick way to send messages to individuals all over the world. (Johnson, 2013)  Twitter is much more than just your friends telling you about their day. It has changed the media, politics and business. Twitter, which primarily serves as a social purpose has continued to evolve.
One example of the impact Twitter had on society can be seen by the riots in Ferguson. On August 19, 2014, an unarmed 18 year old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson. On the day of the shooting, approximately 146,000 posts related to the shooting were published to Twitter.  It was not until August 21, 2014 that traditional media outlets began publishing stories on the shooting. (Miners, 2014). Protests were literally formed across the world from a trending topic initiated on twitter. The first protests were held the evening of August 20, organized predominately by a trending topic on Twitter.  This would begin 12 days and nights of unrest, riots and protests mostly fueled by social media including Twitter.  Five days after the event, there were over 3.7 million tweets related to the event.  (Miners, 2014)
Unlike while listening to the radio, watching television, or seeing it in the newspaper, breaking news on Twitter is able to be discussed the moment it happens. “Social media is breaking the news first, and it’s just as often part of the story, touching our lives and shaping our memories.” (Mason, 2012)
4  A Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words: Instagram (Margaret Ramos)
On October 6^th^, 2010 Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger launched Instagram as a simple photo-sharing application. Within the first week, Instagram reached 100,000 users and continues to be one of the 10 most downloaded applications. In 2012, Instagram had less than 22 million users, when it was bought for close to $1 billion, by Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg. Now there are close to around 200 million users, who share 60 million photos a day.  Instagram has led to a new social experience, a visual type of communication (Hempel, 2014).
Instagram users can use their smart phones and upload pictures and even 15 second video clips.  Instagram users, who have set their privacy settings to public, can add hash tags to photos and videos, so that the photos or video clips will be visible on the public search engine (Instagram Help Center, 2014). Often times Instagram users are present at major events or during a catastrophe and can share what they saw with the public. In 2013, *The Chicago Sun-Times *fired all of the paper’s photographers. The newspaper decided that journalists could be trained to use Instagram editing tools on the iPhone to take pictures when on assignments (Hempel, 2014). The pictures could be uploaded to different social feeds immediately instead of the public having to wait on televised news reports.
A negative aspect of sharing news on Instagram is that terrorist and militias are also learning how to use this visual communication to recruit supporters. For example, in 2014 the radical Islamic militia ISIS had many Instagram accounts to broadcast propaganda, mock Iraq’s President Nuri al-Malaki and to showcase the masked ISIS fighters brandishing Kalashnikovs. Instagram worked quickly to remove these accounts (Finn, 2014).
5 Social Media’s Negative Impact (William Penley & Suzanne Weber)
There are several negative impacts that social media has created in society. These negative impacts include, cyber-bullying, relaying false information, and the coordination of terrorist groups.
Adolescents in the United States culture are moving from using the Internet as an “extra” in everyday communication, to using it as a primary and necessary mode of communication (Nixon, 2014). An issue that can arise from the use of social media is cyber-bullying. In general, cyber-bullying involves hurting someone else using information and communication technologies, in fact, 95% of adolescents are connected to the Internet (Nixon, 2014).
Another negative impact of social media is the relaying of false information.   “The World Economic Forum, in its 2013 report, has listed the massive digital misinformation as one of the main risks for the modern society” (Mocanu, 2014).  The result of misinformation can be seen in the way some people reject the link between HIV and AIDS because of the false belief spread by social media that the virus was created as a way for the US government to control the African American population.  Because of the rapidity of the spread of information, it is sometime difficult to discern fact from fiction.
Sharing news on social media websites such as Instagram has led to negative impacts in society. Terrorist and militia groups are also learning how to use visual communication on Instagram to recruit supporters. For an example, in 2014 the radical Islamic militia ISIS had many Instagram accounts to broadcast propaganda, mock Iraq’s President Nuri al-Malaki and to showcase the masked ISIS fighters brandishing Kalashnikovs. Instagram worked quickly to remove these accounts (Finn, 2014).
6 Social Media’s Positive Impact (Christina Clark)
Although social media has its downfalls, there are several positive impacts that social media has created in the past decade. These positive impacts includes allowing individuals to keep in touch with loved ones all around the world, keeping individuals up to date with the latest news, helping law enforcement catch criminals, and even helping teenagers adjust and increase their self-esteem.
Before social media, the typical ways of communicating with loved ones who were not nearby were by telephone or through handwritten letters. With social media bringing individuals closer together, we are able to communicate within an instant to individuals all across the world. This has significantly impacted our military and their families in a positive way when they are deployed overseas. With the use of social media they are able to keep in contact with their families on a daily basis. (Chalmers, 2012)
Since September 11^th^ 2001, keeping up to date with the latest news has become increasingly important. Since the introduction of social media into our society “over 50% of people learn about breaking news on social media.” (Social Networking ProCon.org, 2014) In 2012, individuals on social media were notified of the shootings at the local movie theatre in Aurora, CO before local news outlets could report it themselves. (Social Networking ProCon.org, 2014)
Not only has social media had a positive impact in regards to keeping connected with distant family and friends but it has also encouraged teenagers to connect and has also impacted their self-esteem.  In 2012, the Washington Post reported that “One in five said using social-networking sites make them feel more confident, popular and sympathetic to others.” (Kang, 2012) By using social media, teenagers are able to establish relationships and maintain relationships that help increase their self-esteem.

The growing popularity of social media networks and applications has had many positive and negative implications for society.
Social media has revolutionized the way we view ourselves, the way we see others and the way we interact with the world around us. While social media has many positive implications, including promoting awareness of specific causes, advertising businesses and helping foster friendships between individuals who may have never met without social networking, the over-usage of social media networks can also lead to negative implications.
While there are countless exciting improvements in technology and social media have greatly increased communication across cultures and positively brought attention to events around the world, it is imperative that we examine the negative implications that social media usage has had on the human experience.
The overuse of social media is a global problem impacting all generations, and research has shown that substantial internet usage can have a highly negative impact on our mental and emotional health.
As the popularity of social media sites continuously grows, networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram continue to evolve. Three positive implications of social media include advertising, networking, and self-expression.
From an advertising perspective, social media offers a great outlet for charities, businesses, and individuals to promote themselves. Social media can be used as an outlet for global organizations to bring awareness to the causes they support and spread positive news that traditional media often doesn't cover. In addition to making advertisements more accessible through social media, these networks have helped foster relationships and connect people around the world.
Social media also allows for self-expression and can serve as a creative outlet for individuals to express themselves, share their artwork and share their voice on specific topics. Being able to express yourself in a healthy way is a very important part of the human experience, and social media can be a great outlet for young adults.
An additional benefit to social media includes following inspirational social media accounts, such as fitness or health inspired Instagram accounts, which can be motivational to followers.
While social media has greatly benefited society, too much of a good thing can always lead to negative effects.
Heavy technology usage often leads to addiction, especially in teens and young adults. However, this addiction is not limited to the millennial generation, as more and more adults from older generations are starting to utilize social networks to stay connected with their friends and families. Spending countless hours on the social sites can distract the focus and attention from a particular chore or assignment.
Along with the struggle to remain attentive, many people who overuse social media or use social media networks as their main form of communication report feeling anxious and depressed after overuse of social media.
Symptoms of anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder can be triggered by the overuse of social media, as individuals are constantly concerned about their posts and communicating with others.
Social media also causes many young adults to compare themselves to others and envy a life that may not be attainable since many brands and individuals only share a small percentage of their lives online. It is important to remember that an Instagram or Twitter may just be a reflection of the "best" parts of a person's life and isn't an accurate representation of them as a whole.
It is imperative that teens and young adults remember that social media does not always portray the whole story and that having genuine communication skills is more important than social media.
Allowing social media to prevent you from experiencing genuine human experiences, such as spending time with your family or spending time outdoors, can be very unhealthy.
In an article entitled "Tweets, Texts, Email and Posts," author Tony Dokoupil explores the story regarding a man named Jason Russell. Russell forwarded a link to an internet documentary called “Kony 2012," which shared his deeply personal web experiences regarding African Warlord Joseph Kony. The film received more than 70 million views in less than a week.
While the film brought awareness to the issues facing African children and child soldiers, the sudden fame had a significant impact on Russell. Russell began obsessing over the number of views received and eventually underwent what doctors now call a temporary psychotic break.
After posting a quote by Martin Luther King, "If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward," Russell took off his clothes, went to the corner of a busy intersection and repeatedly slapped the concrete with both palms ranting about the devil.
This is just one example of how social media can have both positive and negative implications on an individual, as the fame has caused severe mental health implications for Russell, but also brought awareness to a growing epidemic of child soldiers.
While I personally have not experienced mental health implications over the number of likes I’ve gotten or have not gotten on a post, I do tend to “obsess” over it. If I don’t receive the desired amount of likes on a picture I have posted on Instagram, I’ll just delete it.
The more likes I get, the better I feel about myself.
This is something I have been trying to work on since the number of likes I get shouldn’t affect how I feel. Many young adults equate a part of their identity or self-worth with the number of likes they receive on a post and forget that a post does not define who you are as a person and should not change the way you view yourself.
My social media usage has decreased significantly, but I still worry about the number of likes I receive because I want to use social media as a way to express myself and share my ideas with others. Remembering the purpose behind what I am posting and trying to identify the purpose of what I share on social networks helps me identify if the number of likes matter.
Since I started college, I have extensively examined the effects that social media has on a person. Specifically, I have explored how social media usage affects my own generation. It may seem obvious, but I’ve noticed that I do best in classes when I am on my phone less.
Even though this may seem obvious to you, sometimes it’s the most simple thing that we overlook when it comes to social media usage. I have strongly considered joining the “unplugging” movement, but I can’t bring myself to do it. If that doesn’t say something about the effects that social networking sites have on a person, I’m not sure what will.
Unplugging is taking yourself off of social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Even though my social media usage has become less of a problem, I still struggle with remaining off my phone and being involved in the “real world."
Social media has impacted our society for better and for worse.
It is up to us to decide how we view social media and how we allow social networking to either benefit or harm our lives. It is imperative to remember that the genuine human experience of being able to communicate in person, network in person and form relationships with others outweighs social media. It is also important to remember that the number of likes or shares you receive does not define who you are or your self-worth.
The more educated I become and the less time I spend on social media, the more I realize that there is a lot more to life than sitting behind a screen all day long.

What is the impact of social media on society?
Judith Merritt
Social media may have a significant impact on society, both positively and negatively. It allows individuals to communicate with those who live far away. It enables individuals to exchange entertaining, fascinating, and educational information. It allows businesses to interact with their customers. However it can also be used to distribute harmful content such as abusive messages, or illegal material.
In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on society, either positively or negatively depending on how it is used.

What is the reason for social media?
There are various reasons why individuals utilize social media and how it might help them. It assists by making users feel involved. They believe they can engage in events taking on around the world. It enables people to speak out against an unjust act or situation. Social media also allows individuals to find support from others who are going through the same thing.
The main purpose of social media is communication. It is used by individuals to communicate with each other and share information. Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are examples of social media. These websites allow individuals to communicate online by posting comments, photos, videos, and links.
Social media helps people stay connected with friends and family who live far away. They can keep in touch via email and phone calls but this can be expensive with long-distance calls and if you want to send large files such as video messages or music albums. Social media allows you to save money and time because there is no need to make long trips to see relatives. You can simply log onto your computer or mobile device and visit their page to see what's new with them.
Individuals use social media to get information and news about different topics such as current affairs, sports, and entertainment. Social media plays a role in the voting process because it gives people a chance to voice their opinions on political issues.
Is social media a boon or bane for society?
Is it a benefit or a hindrance to society and individuals? Social media has had a significant role in altering the communication sector and reinventing how we communicate and express ourselves. Social media continually engages individuals and gathers everyone in some or other trendy activity. It also causes misunderstandings between people who have different cultural backgrounds.
In today's world, where instant gratification is the norm, social media provides an opportunity for people all over the world to meet up and interact with one another face to face. However, this same feature allows for misinformation to spread quickly, which can lead to online bullying and harassment. Individuals need to be aware of these pitfalls and learn how to distinguish fact from fiction on social media.
Social media has been praised for its role in creating a more open dialogue about important issues such as feminism, racism, and homophobia. It has also been criticized for its negative impact on young people's emotional stability because of their constant exposure to violent images and videos. In addition, social media can be used as a tool for self-expression, but this feature can also be harmful by allowing people to go through with behaviors that would otherwise get them rejected by others (e.g., harassing others, uploading inappropriate content).
Overall, social media is a beneficial tool for communicating and interacting with others online, but it can also be a hindrance if not used properly.

The Negative Impacts Social Media Has On Society
Social Media is everywhere. Maybe that's not a good thing.

Social media has had a huge impact on today's society. We walk down the streets of the city and see people looking down at their phones, talking on the phone, or listening to today’s podcast. As more people start to use social media platforms; Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. there has been an increase in the amount of communication used through these platforms.
Although there has been an increase in communication, it is not necessarily the healthiest way. Many users today have become addicted to social media, resulting in more people isolating themselves from society. It is important to know the negative impacts social media has in today’s society.
In today’s society, it is all about staying connected with others. With staying connected through social media it is beginning to affect our social and communication skills. When it comes to being given the option to meet up with an individual and talk face to face or text the individual, most individuals prefer to text them. A reason could be it is easier for them to text and get it done in one text message, whereas if you meet face to face you have to plan where, and when. People have become lazy due to social media usage.
With social media playing a huge role in today's society, we have lost our ability to understand emotion. We have learned growing up to read others body language through face to face interactions. With the increase in social media usage, we have not been able to tell how others may be feeling, therefore, we “read” the persons words wrong. Opponents argue, there can be positivity when using social media and communication. In young adults, we can see an increase in positive relationships with other peers. However, with building these strong relationships over social media it can possibly help others cope with certain issues, but could possibly lead to cyberbullying.
With posting about certain issues on social media individuals run the risk of hurtful comments or messages. Receiving these messages can affect the individual's confidences. There is no escape goat when it comes to receiving the messages through a screen. Cyberbullying has become easier for individuals because they can disguise who they are online. They can send these messages anonymously, post personal information about others, and even tag them in other posts that are considered negative. They have the ability to beat down individuals confidences and self-esteem through one simple message. Once it is on the web it will always be there.
With cyberbullying, it can later lead to those who are being bullied to commit suicide. Opponents might argue that standard face to face bullying is an issue, so they can never get away from it. However, this is the coward's way of bullying. If we were to limit and be more aware of the power social media as well as our words can impact individuals, it can change the way individuals think before they post something that could cause harm. On the contrary, the need to post information has become more addicting to some of its users.
A bigger problem with social media today, is the users are becoming addicted. We could say we are going on our phones to check on something but end up staying on the phone for hours. Take a look at those who are in school. Procrastination. When it comes to doing homework we often spend more time on our phones worrying about what people may be posting rather than studying to get a good grade on the next exam. This later results in the student's grades dropping. When it also comes to homework assignments some teachers require their students to look up assignments online. When doing research online students may find an article on the sidebar that is interesting to them.
This, then, results in them spending more time in front of the screen and not able to remove themselves. If we were to have individuals give up their phones and all social media usage most of those participating may not be able to last. The more screen time one has the harder it is to give it up. Our brains have learned and grown accustomed to having a device near us so that we cannot go 10 minutes without checking a status or text message. However, others would say being on our phones can help us stay in the loop on certain issues going on in the word, it is not always the healthiest way.
With knowing the negative impacts of social media in today's society as individuals we can spread awareness through our children and hope to see a change in the way we interact with others. We can start to see an increase in our communication and social skills with others, as well as limit the amount of cyber bullying that takes place. Most importantly we can limit the usage of social media that can later become addicting to its users. Overall, we have the power to change the way social media works and effects ourselves as well as those around us. It is ultimately up to us.

In this article, we have explained about the Impact of Social media on Society with its positive and negative effect.
The Impact of Social
media on Society
Contents[show]
Social
networking relates to the way for interaction between people developing,
posting, distributing and commenting information amongst themselves in digital
networks and channels. Social networking called “social networking”
has almost been part of our every day and have been flung around for the last
few decades.
It’s just like any newspapers, such as paper, radio, and tv, but it was far worse than just exchanging ideas and information. Social networking resources such as Instagram, Youtube,
The
strength to define or control a product is shifting from companies and
organizations to people and communities. It is no longer on the 5c (e.g.
condominium, credit card statements or cars) that individuals once talked.
Today,
we are grappling with the shiny new Cs: innovation, connectivity, interaction,
development (of new ideas and projects), society (with shared interests),
partnership and (change of game) competitiveness.
It made you wonder that anything so strong, but with such a massive reaches, hopefully, won’t be all well. Just as there are still two sides to a coin, and the same goes for social networks. Consequently, different cultures have different viewpoints on this controversial topic. Therefore, in this article on social networks, we’ll see the pros and cons impact of social media on society.

The Positive impact of social media on society culture
As we aim at the positive aspects of social media on society, we find several benefits. The most important thing is a great educational system. All the details you need are just a google search away. Users can use social media to teach themselves on different topics.
However,
live seminars are now available based on social networks. You will attend a
workshop in America while you’re stuck in India.
Moreover,
because more and more people were distancing not only themselves but both from
the newspapers and magazines, they depend entirely on social media sites for
news. You’re always up-to-date with the latest developments in the world. An
individual becomes more socially and economically conscious of the problems of
the planet.
It
also improves relations with your family and loved ones. Space is no longer an
obstacle to social media. For example, you can communicate easily with your
friends and relatives working overseas.
Perhaps
notably, it also offers a perfect forum for talented aspiring musicians to show
off their talents for free. You can also get fantastic employment opportunities
via social media.
It
has been two years after CNN officially launched iReport as more of a segment
of its site where people can share video material and contact information. CNN
released a variety of social media content during most of the Haiti earthquake
if not all of the details were checked. The editorial team should evaluate
stories from independent journalists and mark them poorly compared to unsourced
material.
A
group called “Earthquake Haiti” is created on Facebook with show
support and post alerts and information. It has more than 14,000 supporters,
and some participants had even begged for help to the injured Haitians
throughout the party.
A
most impressive part of the effect of social media in Haiti is the voluntary
text-message fundraising, which has risen to more than $10 million for refugees
in Haiti. Individuals are willing to help victims are urged to email, post and
publicize their support via different social networks.
A Global Philanthropy Alliance has started a campaign to call for wealthy people and actors, such as Ben Stiller & John Legend, to utilize Facebook and Twitter to inspire others to donate to UNICEF.
That aid worker, Saundra Schimmelpfennig, has allowed suggestions from other relief workers and supporters to share on her website on selecting the charity organizations to fund. Meanwhile, supporters have been answering questions on Instagram, Linkedin, and forums about their contributions and support to their favorite charities. After every disaster, social media has become a much more powerful tool to spread the message.
The adverse impact of social media on society culture
Adverse events raised by respondents involved hours spent online taking resources from valuable head-to-face relationships; that internet often fosters superficial relationships; the act of using the internet and participate in social interaction reveals personal information; the internet provides people of silo themselves, restricting their exposure to different fresh ideas; as well as the internet will be used to generate new ideas;
Spite
of having some unique benefits, social media are perceived to be one of the
most dangerous aspects of culture. When the use of social networks is not
regulated, this can lead to severe repercussions.
It’s dangerous because it decides to invade your anonymity as never before. Under-sharing on social media to make kids a magnet for bullies and hackers. It also contributes to cyberbullying which has a significant impact on any individual.
Such a problem hinders a pupil’s academic achievement by spending their time on the internet instead of learning. Social media is also causing social rifts. Fake news travels through the use of it that destroys the minds of peace-loving people.
That general, social media has both pros and cons. And at the end, it all varies depending on the user. Throughout fact, young people need to strike a balance among academic achievement, physical activity, and social networks. Excessive usage of anything is dangerous, and the same relates to social media. We should, therefore, try to live a fulfilled life with either the proper balance.
An
individual’s online identity may be utterly different from his or her
appearance, causing chaos whenever the two identities intersect. It’s evident
in dating online whenever the pair meet up face-to-face. Their fictional
proletarians do not represent their actual-life roles. It is more enticing for people
to write something that someone else has to learn than to tell the truth.
About
“friendship,” social media site developers and consumers are also
concerned about “privacy” on the Web. The data protection issue is to
share information while preserving personally identifiable information. Almost
all information published on social media sites is irreversible.
Whenever
anyone shares photos or videos on the internet, they become famous. When a
person deletes a clip from his / even her social network, that someone might
have held it and then just posted it on other places including youtube.
Throughout
the corporate world, information technology managers should reach Facebook and
MySpace to learn about either the true colours of an applicant, particularly
when work-seekers do not turn their pros into secrets. Studies have found that
half of the employees have dismissed a prospective worker as a result of
exculpatory content on the Fb pages.
Several
companies have also reviewed the applicants ‘ profile information on Social
media pages and see if they are misleading regarding their credentials. Today,
new generations are entirely unaware of their safety, opening doors to unwanted
criminals or stalkers.
Social media terminology
Social
media is also becoming the driving force behind all the new characters that
appear in the English language. Most of the phrases that are recommended for
use in translations either are concepts that identify a various aspect of
social media nor words that have been widely recognized by the widespread need
for social media by popular culture influencers.
“Cyberstalking,”
“Twitlit” “Tweeps,” 
even “YOLO” were just the lot of older facebook-inspired ideas
that have been suggested for vocabulary inclusion. Although not directly linked
to social networks, suggestions such as “Tebowing,” “cray”
even “mantyhose” have also been emulated via culture through
Facebook, Facebook and certain social media websites.
The
social media are here to live. Going ahead, it seems probable that social
networking will have a much more significant presence in daily lives–and it will
have a substantial effect on the development of English.
Anyone
who deals in social media with online marketing understands the pain of so many
words and acronyms.
What
is the practical difference between experiences or reach? What are the precise
definitions of Dark Post and Dark Web? And do not get me going on an
abbreviation: CPC, CPA, CTR, PPC… these times, life as just a marketer seems
to include a degree in applied networking jargon.
The final thought on Social Networking Impact
Social
media is a rather easy and effective contact network to all people today. We
could use it to get to know peers and also to keep in touch with friends in
different nations. We would express our thoughts too quickly, too, that all
stuff will evolve more rapidly, as people will tell us their suggestions, and
we could strengthen them instantly.
We
can also discover new things on social media from reading or watching things
people shared on Facebook. Individuals can also easily offer stuff on social
media that could growing marketing expenditure.
Even
though many people all over the world are using social networks, it can also be
used as a device. Social media helps long haul contact a great deal, but there
should be a meeting point cannot be our primary means of communication for
contact. There have been positive aspects of this modern technology, but none
of these positive aspects exceeds the negative ones.
There’s
nothing that can be a replacement for interaction. All in all, the conventional
definition of “buddy” has been devalued by social networking sites
where it implies trust, support, corresponding values, etc.
Although
we’re getting to know further people, we’re not in a position to create a
healthy relationship because of all the people we’ve met because our time
needed is limited. As a consequence, there is a growing social rise in people
with broader social networks, however with more shortened links (people we
wouldn’t meet well but yet provide some of the valuable ideas and information).

Okay, so these articles discuss the impact of social media on society in general, not just mental health. It's interesting to see how social media affects different aspects of our lives.

From the first article, it seems like social media has both positive and negative impacts. It can help in organizing social movements, like the Arab Spring, and can be a tool for political activism, as seen with the Tea Party in the US. However, it can also be used for spreading misinformation and propaganda, as evidenced by its use by extremist groups like ISIS.

The second article emphasizes the power of Twitter in real-time communication and how it can shape public opinion and mobilize people quickly, as seen in the Ferguson protests. Instagram is highlighted for its visual communication capabilities, which can be both a positive tool for journalism and a negative one for extremist groups.

The third article delves into the negative impacts of social media, such as cyberbullying, spreading false information, and its use by terrorist groups. It's clear that social media can amplify harmful behaviors and ideologies.

On the positive side, the fourth article discusses how social media can help people stay connected, especially during times like deployments or natural disasters. It also mentions that social media can be a source of support and can help improve self-esteem in teenagers.

The fifth article provides a broader perspective on the impact of social media on society, touching on both positive and negative aspects. It highlights how social media has changed communication, information dissemination, and even commerce.

So, overall, social media is a double-edged sword. It has the potential to bring people together, promote awareness, and facilitate communication, but it also has downsides like cyberbullying, the spread of misinformation, and addiction.

Maybe I should consider how social media affects different age groups. Perhaps it impacts younger people differently than older generations.

Age Has a Big Influence on Social Media Behavior
By: Anna Noel Taylor
Tuesday, Jun 19, 2018
Related Topics: Kids & Family, Research Articles, Teens/Young Adults, Adults, Social for Everyone, Global
How do social media habits vary by age?
We asked this question in our new global study, Social for Everyone, in which we spoke to over 40,000 people aged 6 to 54 across 35 markets. And we found that different age groups do indeed have distinct social media behaviors. Here’s a summary of how they differ, from oldest to youngest:
Ages 35 to 54: Self-Assured
Adults aged 35 to 54 take a balanced approach to social media. They know who they are and what they like. Most (90%) believe that their social media accounts reflect their true self. Compared with younger users, they care less about validation and how others perceive them.
This group is less likely to say they share everything on social media (26% vs. an average of 37% among respondents aged 12 to 54), to think that having lots of connections makes them look good (27% vs. 38%), and to feel embarrassed if they post something and don’t receive a lot of “likes” (22% vs. 33%).
Parents in this age range have even more reason to be on social media – to connect with their children. They’re more likely than those without children to have a social media account (86% of parents, 82% of non-parents).
Ages 25 to 34: Navigating Adulthood
Adults 25 to 34 came of age during social media’s rise and lived through its testing phase. As they navigate adulthood, they’ve become more cautious social media users. They are accustomed to sharing, rely on acknowledgement from others, and want to know what their peers are up to.
At the same time, they’re wary of oversharing. Many worry that pictures or stories on social media could cause problems in the future (51% vs. an average of 48% among respondents aged 12 to 54).
Parents in this age range are careful about their children’s online usage as well, with 63% saying that social media posts about their kids concern them (compared with 60% of parents 35 to 54).
Ages 18 to 24: Choosing a Path in Life
As they enter young adulthood, people aged 18 to 24 are focused on the future and conscious of how others perceive them. They feel more pressure to be “the best” (72% vs. an average of 66% among respondents aged 12 to 54), are more concerned about what others think of them (71% vs. 65%), and are more worried about making their parents proud (71% vs. 63%).
Since moving on from their protected teen world, their networks have expanded. Most (91%) have a social media account – and they’re the age group with the most social media connections (812 vs. an average of 561).
These young adults are starting to question social media’s impact on their lives, however. Most (60%) think they spend too much time on social media (vs. an average of 49%), 57% wish they could take a break from the internet and social media (vs. 49%), and 29% feel that social media has a negative effect on their relationships (vs. 21%).
Ages 12 to 17: Finding Themselves
Teens are seeking independence and trying to figure out who they really are. They describe themselves as “sharing and connecting” (86% vs. an average of 82% among respondents aged 12 to 54) and to enjoy sharing their opinions (86% vs. 84%).
Social media is a vital tool for teens – their whole lives are there! They’re more likely to share all their experiences on social media (45% vs. an average of 37%), to feel they cannot live without their phone (85% vs. 81%), and to worry about not having access to the internet (65% vs. 55%).
Their desire to always be “on” comes with a lot of pressure. Many believe it looks good to have a lot of social media connections (47% vs. an average of 38%). They’re also more likely to find it embarrassing to post something and not receive a lot of “likes” (40% vs. 33%) and to worry about online bullying (45% vs. 38%).
Ages 6 to 11: The Curious Years
Kids in this age range are just starting to try out social media, usually with parents and close family members. Nearly half (44%) have a social media account – and their top platforms are Facebook (71%) and WhatsApp (42%), followed by Instagram (25%), Skype (21%), Twitter (19%) and Snapchat (14%). Most of those who use social media have a parent as a connection (80%).
Social media participation among kids varies significantly by country, however. The top five countries are far above the global average of 44%: China (76%), the Philippines (75%), Saudi Arabia (74%), Indonesia (70%) and Brazil (65%). The bottom five countries are significantly below average: Australia (22%), Germany (20%), France (19%), Japan (19%) and New Zealand (19%).

How age and gender can impact social media usage
Business News | 29 Nov, 2019 | Angelica Olivas
Social media has become a part of almost everyone’s daily routine, but how it’s used can differ based on age, race and ethnicity, household income and especially gender.
Common Sense Media, a San Francisco based nonprofit that focuses on promoting digital well-being for children, has researched social media use extensively. In a study titled “Social Media, Social Life: Teens Reveal Their Experiences” done in September of 2018, they looked at the overview of social media use in 13- to 17-year-olds. This is the second wave of this study, as the first was done in 2012, and statistics have changed since then—in 2012, 34 percent of teens used social media more than once a day, but in 2018 that number rose to 70 percent.
Michael Robb, director of research for Common Sense, said they expected these numbers to rise because of how many more children and teens now have smartphones and devices. He said although everyone kind of assumes how many more children use their devices today, it is still noteworthy to see how rapidly things have changed.
The researchers also found significant demographic differences in the way teens use social media, as older teenagers are more likely to spend more time on social media. The data shows that 82 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds use social media daily, while 59 percent of 13- to 14-year-olds do so. Those who have a higher household income also tend to use social media more: 76 percent of higher-income youth use it daily, as opposed to the 68 percent middle-income youth that do.
Additionally, women tend to use social media more than men. The report found that 81 percent of female teenagers use social media daily, compared to 66 percent of teenage males.
Robb said the key difference between boys’ and girls’ media use is girls, on average, tend to use social media more than boys, where boys play video games more often. “The research about how it affects them is a little all over the map. I think it has less to do with time and more to do with what kind of experiences that they’re having on social media,” he said.
In addition, social media has grown so much in recent years that is has become a career path. When social media becomes a job it’s much easier for it to be overwhelming, creating a need to set healthy boundaries.
Becca Booker is the owner and CEO of Homemade Social, a boutique social media marketing agency in Scottsdale that specializes in lifestyle brands. The company advocates for a healthier relationship with social media by educating users. Booker encourages them to unfollow accounts that don’t serve them a good purpose, and following other accounts intentionally, which can be anything they find valuable.
Booker sets boundaries for herself on social media so that it doesn’t become too much. She limits herself to using four hours of social media per day. “That sounds like it’s a lot, but when it’s your job that can add up pretty quickly,” Booker said.
Instagram recently announced they are rolling out a new feature that hides likes on posts, meaning that the user can see the number of likes their own posts receive, but not on the posts of others.
“It’s so easy to get caught up in the comparison game. Everyone is posting about their biggest win or something great that just happened, and it makes sense because those are usually the posts that get the most likes,” she said. Booker thinks that this new Instagram feature is going to be a gamechanger in users’ mental health to try to break that comparison game — especially in teenage girls who tend to be most affected, ot those who seeks approval and buy real Instagram likes.
Aaron Krasnow, associate vice president and director of ASU Counseling Services, echoes the implications of this comparison game. He said that ASU Counseling works hard to stay up to date on trends in college students, and one trend shows that digital and social media has an effect on students that can be positive or negative.
“People can get stuck in a comparison cycle, or they have difficulty putting away the device to focus on other things,” Krasnow said. “What we’re looking for is not to take a position about whether it’s good or bad, but we always look at whether somebody’s use of social media or any digital media is interfering in their life. If it’s not interfering it’s not a problem.”

Social media is the reason for many of the world’s problems and solutions. It can be used to raise awareness for an important cause, but it is also used for the purposes that destroying the new generation. Nowadays, a lot of people are using social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumbler and so on. Since the Internet has propagated rapidly, social media have progressed a lot. The generalization of the internet makes us to live conveniently and fast. People are almost using smart phones and other devices which can access to internet and hence make people to do social network easily. It helps contact friends, family, and other people even though they live far away. It could be, however, abused, if you don’t use properly. It is important that we understand the use of social media by young children. Nowadays teenagers spends most of their time on social media every day. Social media is becoming more than a part of their life, it’s becoming their world.
The time teenagers spend playing physical games has decreased significantly causing more depression and obesity. Not only does it affect health, social media deprives parents from having a thorough conversation with their children without them checking their phone. Even though the positive effect of having a social media profile is to communicate with friends/family, but it is also effecting friendly environment of families because children do not even bother what is going around when they are too busy tweeting about it. The contradicting effects of it goes to show that social media is not all it is talked up to be. Teenagers have no choice but to constantly follow. Social media also encourages the false images of how everything should be in a perfect world. This impact causes the insecurities and questionings to girls and boys. These misleading pictures, videos and articles of how to be rich, relationships, houses, cars, crimes etc. tends to lowers self-esteem and leads to depression and suicides.
Aside from connecting, social media revolves around who “retweeted” who’s “selfie” and “how many favourites did that pic get”. It’s almost sickening knowing that teenagers base their insecurities around how many likes they get. The false perception of life portrayed all over social media is misleading towards teens and not worth the effort to filter. Not only is social media misleading, it is also very unimportant. Aside from the news part of the sites, a majority of the posts are extremely insignificant and unimportant to our world. Every news is represented with spices to attain attention of people. Nicholas Wapshott states about social media, “We may take pity on the idiot schoolboy who uses expletives on Twitter or posts a picture of himself holding a joint at a party only to discover when he looks for a job that a trawl by an HR department has made him unemployable.” Taking a step back can open your eyes to the realization that nothing your friends are going to post will affect your life in the long run. Instead of going through the drama and irrelevant parts of social media, connect with your friends and family by calling them up and avoid the complications and uselessness of the web sites.
Avoiding social media can be very difficult. Especially in a situation where one used it daily and transitioned over within a week. It’s a very challenging task, but in the long run, one will not have to worry about wasting time on false perceptions and unnecessary information! Encouraging teens and friends to spend less time on social media and more time actually socializing can really change your life for the better.

Impact of Social Media on the youth
Social media refers to all applications and websites or blogs that enable people around the globe to interconnect via the internet, chat, and share content, video call among many other functionalities it offers to its users. For a person to be a member of any social media, he or she has to first signup and then sign in to access content and be able to share and chat with other users of that social media platform. Some of the common and widely used social media platforms include Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Snapchat many among others.
Over the past two decades, social media have gained so much growth and fame worldwide to an extent that many researchers are now interested in learning more about these social platforms and their effects on the community. Despite the fact that almost everyone in the community is connected to at least one social media platform, the youth and teenagers are the leading and most fanatic of these social platforms to the point that they even social network while in class or even church. It is to this light that researchers have found that these social sites impact the lives of our youth in a society a great deal in terms of morals, behavior and even education-wise.
The use of social media has both negative and positive impacts on our youths today. In this paper, I aim to bring to light the impacts of social media specifically to the youth of this generation. These impacts are both positive and negative.
The positive impacts of social media on the youth today include making them up date on the events happening around the globe and also enables them network and stay connected with their fellow youths and friends without physical meetings. It bridges the gap between friends since a person say in Africa can network and interact with his or her friend in the United States. This in turn helps in strengthening relationships say amongst classmates in high school or college, who after finishing school, moved to different locations around the world. Additionally, youths can create pages and groups in the social media platforms based on their professions, faith among other dimensions of their lives and this leads to more connections being built and more opportunities being opened for their respective disciplines. This can even lead to more employment opportunities being created for the unemployed youths. From the many interviews carried daily, youths say that social media platforms make their lives enjoyable, efficient and easier and has also become their lifestyle.
Even though social media sites seem to connect more people and make them stay up to date, it leads to isolation socially according to a BBC News report. It reduces the number of face-to-face interactions amongst the youths because they normally spend most of their time on these online social platforms. An evaluation from a number of studies done by various scientists show that social isolation can cause a number of effects such as physical, emotional, mental and psychological issues in these youths. This can in turn lead to depression, anxiety and many other problems. It also leads to misspelling of words and misuse of words and tenses through the use of short forms and abbreviations. This has a high negative impact more so on students because it affects their language capabilities directly and this lead to poor grades in languages.
Also, it exposes young teens say below eighteen years to online predators who get to woo them into sexual acts such as lesbianism and other general sexual misconducts. It also exposes these teens to pornographic content being spread in some the social groups online. This in turn leads to early pregnancies amongst young girls causing them to drop out of school. It also can lead to contraction of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and this can lead to early deaths of our young generation. The morals of these teens is also tampered with as they now get access to immoral literature and videos.
Spending long hours chatting in social media sites also decreases productivity amongst the youths. This in turn causes the youths not to be self-dependent and instead depend on their parents and families for upkeep. The long hours wasted online on social media can be channeled to productive activities that can enable one earn a living or even acquire an education for instance through online tutorials and make good use of online research materials.
Social media also provides a good platform where cyber theft and bullying is done and this increases the chances and incidences of identity theft. This has a number of risks to the youths as their personal information can get stolen since it is stored in some locations they do not know about or whose security is in not known or is questionable.
Social platforms also encourage the spread of wrong information and news majorly aimed at tainting other peoples’ names or other groups of interest such as political or religious groups. This in turn leads to fights and enmity between the concerned parties and this can lead to divisions amongst tribes or people from different ethnicities and tribes.
It can also lead one to join groups of cults and illuminati people, which in turn can also lead to frequent killings of people in society especially loved ones as a sacrifice to these cults.
In conclusion, social networking has been proved to have both positive and negative effects on our youths. Individuals should make a conclusion whether to go on using the sites or stop or even moderate on their usage. Parents should guide and advise their children on current matters like the usage of social media and warn them of its negative impacts to them when misused or overused. The education curriculum also should be revised so that it can include social media studies in its disciplines so as to alert students that they need to be careful in their social media usage.

From these articles, it's clear that different age groups use social media in different ways and are affected by it differently.

For adults aged 35 to 54, social media is more of a balanced tool for communication and staying connected, with less emphasis on validation and self-presentation. They are more likely to see their social media profiles as reflections of their true selves.

Younger adults, aged 25 to 34, are more cautious and aware of the potential downsides of social media, such as oversharing and future repercussions. They are also more concerned about their children's online activities.

Teens and young adults aged 18 to 24 are navigating their identities and are more influenced by peer perceptions. They spend a lot of time on social media but are also starting to recognize its potential negative effects on their well-being and relationships.

Children and pre-teens, aged 6 to 17, are just beginning to engage with social media, often under parental supervision. They are more likely to share everything and are more sensitive to peer validation, such as likes and comments.

It's interesting to note that social media usage increases with age, peaking in the late teens and early twenties, and then slightly decreases in older age groups. Also, there are gender differences, with females tending to use social media more than males.

I think it's crucial to consider these age and gender differences when discussing the impact of social media on society. It's not a one-size-fits-all issue; different demographics experience social media in unique ways, with varying degrees of benefit and harm.

Given all this information, I think the initial question—whether social media is helping or hurting us—is too simplistic. The reality is that social media has both positive and negative effects, and these vary greatly depending on how it's used and by whom.

Perhaps a better way to frame it is: How can we maximize the benefits of social media while minimizing its harms? This would involve promoting healthy social media habits, educating users about potential risks, and encouraging platforms to implement features that protect users' well-being.

In conclusion, social media is a complex phenomenon with multifaceted impacts on society. It's essential to approach this topic with nuance and consideration for diverse experiences and perspectives.
