I'm trying to figure out how individuals are used effectively in an organization. Hmm, this seems pretty broad, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, I need to understand what makes an organization effective. I think it's about achieving its goals efficiently, right? So, if an organization wants to be effective, it needs to make sure that its members are contributing towards those goals in the best possible way.

Maybe I should look into some management theories or organizational behavior concepts. I recall something about specialization and division of labor from economics. Adam Smith's pin factory example comes to mind, where workers specialize in specific tasks to increase overall productivity. So, perhaps assigning individuals to roles that match their skills and interests is key.

But that's just one piece of the puzzle. There must be more to it. Maybe I should consider motivation and engagement. If employees are motivated, they're probably more productive and committed to the organization's success.

I've heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory in motivational psychology. Maybe those could be applicable here. Also, maybe leadership styles play a role in how individuals are utilized. Transformational leadership, for instance, inspires employees to perform beyond their own interests for the sake of the organization.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about team dynamics as well. Even if individuals are effective on their own, how they interact with each other can impact the organization's performance. Concepts like teamwork, collaboration, and communication are probably important.

Maybe I should also consider the organizational structure. Is it hierarchical, flat, matrix-based? Different structures might require different approaches to utilizing individuals effectively.

And what about training and development? Providing employees with opportunities to grow and improve their skills can make them more effective in their roles.

Also, performance appraisal and feedback mechanisms are likely important. If individuals receive regular feedback on their performance, they can adjust their actions to better align with the organization's goals.

I feel like I'm touching on a lot of different areas here, but I need to find a way to tie them all together.

Maybe I should try to find some real-world examples or case studies where organizations have effectively utilized their individuals. Google, for example, is known for its innovative workplace culture and focus on employee well-being. They have things like "20% time," where employees can work on side projects, which has led to the creation of successful products like Gmail and AdSense.

On the other hand, there's Toyota and their production system, which emphasizes continuous improvement and empowering front-line workers to identify and solve problems.

These examples suggest that giving employees autonomy and responsibility can lead to better utilization of their abilities.

Perhaps I should also consider the concept of emotional intelligence in leaders. If leaders are emotionally intelligent, they can better understand and manage the emotions of their team members, which can lead to better performance.

Wait, maybe I'm getting too deep into leadership now. Maybe I need to focus more on the individual level.

Let me try to summarize what I've thought about so far:

1. Specialization and matching skills to roles

2. Motivation and engagement

3. Leadership styles

4. Team dynamics and collaboration

5. Organizational structure

6. Training and development

7. Performance appraisal and feedback

8. Autonomy and responsibility

9. Emotional intelligence

That seems like a lot, but maybe these are all interconnected aspects.

Perhaps I can think of it this way: An organization needs to identify the strengths and weaknesses of its individuals and assign them to roles where they can maximize their contributions. Then, through proper motivation, leadership, and support, the organization can enhance their performance and overall effectiveness.

But how does all this actually play out in practice? Maybe I need to look up some research or articles on this topic.

Let me try searching for "how to utilize individuals effectively in an organization."

Human Resources can be used most efficiently by;
- Allotting them work in which they have an aptitude.
-Getting them involved in the whole process.
-Motivating them to do their best
-Appreciating their every good activity or accomplishment and not them.
-Giving incentives, for good work.
-Mentioning their good work in public.
-Having faith in them.

To start with, a management with a mentality of (strategic planning) is required. This management will define the basic objectives of the organization it is heading and then moves to allocate the material & human resources correctly to achieve these unambiguous objectives.
The human resources are the key part for the success of the strategy. An efficient management will know exactly the abilities of those under its command so as to utilize them in rational manner towards the path direction which ultimately fulfills its mission.
An unbigoted management is aware of its shortcomings,so it will ask  for help to draw a road map for carrying out a certain strategy (and I do not mean a long-term plan). When the most capable honest persons are involved in designing the strategy & putting it  into effect, then there will be the support to implement it since they will feel that they are part of it and that the strategy has not come by orders or decrees from above. It came after consultations in a team-work spirit, then each one will share the burden or the responsibility to move ahead until the organization becomes more deep-rooted & stronger.

Vaccine vs Natural Immunity for COVID
Discussion

Umut Cakir
Dear RG community,
As far as I know, antibodies are different in vaccination and natural infection. While natural infection produces antibodies against different parts of the virus, vaccination produces antibodies against only parts of the virus that are present in the vaccine. For instance, nucleocapsid proteins are not present in the vaccine, so antibodies are not produced against nucleocapsid proteins by vaccination. Is there any authorized COVID antibody test to differentiate a person’s immunity as either natural infection or vaccination? (For instance, a person gains immunity from vaccination not a natural infection, or a person gains immunity from vaccination 70% and natural infection 30%, etc.)
On the other hand, both vaccination and natural infection can produce the same type of antibody. For example, both vaccination and natural infection trigger to produce antibodies against spike proteins. Is there any difference between these two proteins? Can we differentiate antibodies against spike proteins that are triggered by either vaccination or natural infection?
Thank you.

I am currently working on a thesis on "analysis of public perception and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccination process using the Structural Equation Modeling method". There are 6 variable used in the research : Behavioral Beliefs, Attitudes towards Vaccination, Perceived Norms, Motivation to Comply, Perceived Behavioral Control, and Intentions to Receive Vaccination
However, these results seem to make no sense to me:
attitudes towards vaccination have a significantly negative relationship with motivation to comply
attitudes towards vaccination have a significantly negative relationship with perceived norms";
behavioral beliefs have a significantly negative relationship with attitudes towards vaccination .

We have isolated several strains of an organism from cultures of canine and human blood and subcutaneous nodules (using sterile techniques of course).  These isolates have been subcultured on PDA and/or PD nutrient broth and found to be similar in appearance, both the macroscopic colonies, and the microscopic swabs viewed in wet-mount preparations.  The organism stains positive with calcoflur white (contains chitin or cellulose) and seems capable of forming a variety of tertiary structures, depending on environmental conditions (ie, hyphae/pseudohyphae, sporocyst-like structures etc..). One universal property is that the small cells/spores etc... become motile within about 15 minutes after addition of sterile water or sterile saline to the smear.  The “swimming” pattern appears eukaryotic rather than prokaryotic.  I’ve attached a video showing time-lapse of about 25 minutes, during which a drop of stained liquid containing these possible “zoospores” undergoes several morphological changes.  We think this represents the process of “zoospore induction” and eventual zoospore settling (maybe with release of stored mucilage etc... causing the white “fluid” appearance that develops upon the termination of “zoospore” motility?).  We are awaiting WGS results on the cultured samples, and hopefully those sequencing studies will clarify the identity of these organisms, but in the meantime, we are trying to better understand the “behavior” we are seeing here, and figure out how it might relate to the apparent ability of this organism to infect and cause illness in, mammalian hosts.  As far as we know, pythium and lagendium are the only zoospore-forming pathogens currently recognized as mammalian oomycete pathogens.   We do not think this organism to be either of those, but we would appreciate help from anyone familiar with the movement patterns of zoospores from those (or other) pathogens to let us know if the movement seems similar to what would be seen in standardly done zoospore induction protocols and/or if there is an explanation for the “bleaching” effect that occurs after the motility ceases.   Thank you!

A manager should have the ability to direct, supervise, encourage, inspire, and co-ordinate, and in doing so facilitate action and guide change.  Managers develop their own leadership qualities and those of others. Management utilizes planning, organisational and communications skills.  These skills are important in leadership also, but even more so are qualities such as integrity, honesty, courage, commitment, sincerity, passion, determination, compassion and sensitivity.
An effective manager of an organization should have the following skills.
Creative Problem Solving Skills:
Describing and analyzing a problem.

Developing creative options and choosing the best course of action.

There are certain other qualities required for a good manager to manage his staff.
Planner
A Manager has to take a long-term view; while a team member will be working towards known and established goals, the manager must look further ahead so that these goals are selected wisely. By thinking about the eventual consequences of different plans, the manager selects the optimal plan for the team and implements it. The manager ensures that work is not repeated nor problems tackled too late, and that the necessary resources are allocated and arranged.
Provider
The Manager has access to information, which the team needs. The role of a manager is important because authority, which the manager holds uniquely within the team and the manager, must exercise the power for the benefit of the team for the effective productivity.
Protector
In any company, there are problems, which can deflect the work force. The manager should be there to guard against these and to protect the team. If a new project emerges which not given an impossible deadline. If someone in your team brings forward a good plan, you must ensure that it receives a fair hearing and that your team knows and understands the outcome. If someone is in your team has a problem at work, you have to deal with it.
Inspires a Shared Vision
An effective manager is often described as having a vision of where to go and the ability to articulate it.
Qualities of a Manager
A manager has to direct, inspire and motivate his men at work. He has to clearly set forth the objectives for them and inject in them enthusiasm to achieve the objectives. He has to be a competent person in the area of his specialization. He must be a man of open mind, moral and emotional integrity and capable to understand and solve problems.
It is difficult to give an exhaustive list of all traits and qualities which go to make a successful manager. However, some of the important traits contributing to the success of managers are as follows:
Ability to think
It is difficult to think and think clearly and purposefully. Ability to think in clear terms and with definite purpose in view is a must for a manager to succeed. He must be able to think rationally.
Broad vision
A manager must be able to take into consideration the overall effect of his functioning on the company as a whole. Sectarian view, thinking in terms of ‘my department’, is not conductive to the smooth working of the company. Therefore, a manager must take a comprehensive view of each of hia action.
Clear Expression
One of the functions of a manager is to direct his subordinates. It means he must communicate with them. Effective communication depends upon clarity of expression. Even the best conceived idea or instruction is worthless unless it can be communicated effectively. Therefore,
Technical Ability
Though a manager need not be a technician, it is necessary that he possesses the necessary degree of technical competence relating to his field. This would help him to handle his subordinates effectively. Technical skills are more important at the supervisory level.
Human Relations skills
Human relation skills refer to ones ability to work well with others on a person to person basis and to build up cooperative group relations to accomplish organizational goals. A manager must keep in mind that he has to lead his subordinates and not to drive them. He should possess adequate knowledge of the factors and forces which go to ensure good relations, motivate people for best of their performance and generate cooperative and competent human behavior.
Good Communicator
The ability to communicate with people is the most important skill by managers and team members. The Manager is also the team’s link to the larger organisation. He must have the ability to effectively negotiate and use persuasion when necessary to ensure the success of the team and project. Through effective communication, manager support individual and team achievements by creating guidelines for accomplishing tasks and for the career advancement of team members.
Enthusiasm
If Managers are negative – they bring staffs down. Manager with enthusiasm, with a bounce in their step, with a can-do attitude. Many people tend to follow people with a can-do attitude. Enthusiastic Managers are committed to their goals and express this commitment through optimism.
Competence
Managers will be chosen based on their ability to successfully lead others rather than on technical expertise, as in the past. Having a winning track record is the surest way to be considered competent. Expertise in management skills is another dimension in competence. The ability to challenge, inspire, enable, model and encourage must be demonstrated if managers are to be seen as capable and competent.
Ability to Delegate Tasks
Trust is an essential element in the relationship of manager and his or her team. You demonstrate your trust in others through your actions – how much you check and control their work, how much you delegate and how much you allow people to participate.
Cool Under Pressure
In a perfect world, projects would be delivered on time, under budget and with no major problems or obstacles to overcome. A leader with a hardy attitude will take these problems in stride. When leaders encounter a stressful event, they consider it interesting, they feel they can influence the outcome and they see it as an opportunity.
Team-Building Skills
A team builder can best be defined as a strong person who provides the substance that holds the team together in common purpose toward the right objective. In order for a team to progress from a group of strangers to a single cohesive unit, the leader must understand the process and dynamics required for this transformation. He or she must also know the appropriate leadership style to use during each stage of team development. The leader must also have an understanding of the different team players styles and how to capitalise on each at the proper time, for the problem at hand.
Communicate the big picture
If you want your employees to work hard and be committed to your business, you have to keep them in the loop. Open communication helps foster loyalty and gives employees a sense of pride. It helps them understand how their work contributes to the company’s success.
Delegate work and responsibilities
Some employees, share their workload with them and assign the work according to people’s strengths and weaknesses, and let employees develop their own good work habits and abilities.
Help employees set goals
Setting deadlines and goals helps keep employees focused, busy and motivates them to do their work. Talk to each of your employees about the company’s goals, and work with them to set individual goals directly linked to your business’s mission. Make sure employees understand their professional growth path in the company.
Recognize problems
It is impossible to know about personality conflicts, lagging productivity or other problems in the office if you have your head in the sand. If you notice a change in an employee’s work habits or attitude, try to get to the root of the problem before it starts affecting the rest of your staff.
Organizational Ability
A manager must be a good organizer. Ability to organise well is a quality of a vital importance to make a successful manager.
Dynamic Personality
A manager must possess the desire to move ahead, to introduce change for better, to do something new. He must always look for doing something bigger and better.
Emotional Stability
A manager must be able to keep his personal likes and dislikes away from his organizational responsibility. It means that in solving the business problems of his company, he must not allow his personal feeling to influence his decisions. This requires stable emotional feelings.
Integrity
A manager must enjoy the unshakable confidence of both his superiors and subordinates. Botha as a person and in his actions, he must be known as a person of high moral integrity. He must remember the saying that it is not enough to be good, one must also appear to be good.
Roles of a Manager
Management is the effective utilization of human and material resources to achieve the enterprise objectives. The human resources or people use material resources such as machines, materials and money. It is for the management to ensure that people use material resources in the most efficient manner. Only then the objectives of the enterprise could be achieved. For the effective utilization of resources, the workers may be given adequate instructions and training. They must
also be properly motivated so that they work with devotion and loyalty for the achievement of organisational objectives.
For this, every manager guides and direct the efforts of a group of persons in the organisation. He defines the objectives of his group keeping in view the overall objectives of the enterprise. Each member of the group is assigned a specific task so that the targets of the group as a whole may be achieved. This is necessary for achieving the objectives of enterprise.
Some of the characteristic that are common to most of the managers are as follows:
Managers spend a major portion of their time in achieving coordination between human and non-human resources.
Managers do much work at an unrelenting pace.
Managerial tasks are characterized by brevity, variety, and fragmentation.
Managers prefer live action- brief, specific, well-defined activities that are current, non-routine, and non-reflective.
Managers prefer oral to written communication.
Managers maintain a vast number of contacts, spending most time with subordinates, linking them with superiors and others in a complex network.
It has observed that managing involves certain functions. While performing these functions, a manager has to play multiple roles. A role consist of the behavior patterns displayed by a manager within an organisation or a functional unit. Henry Mintzberg identified ten basic roles performed by managers at all levels from foreman to chief executives and classified them under three heads: interpersonal, informational and decisional. These roles describe what managers actually do.
Interpersonal Roles:
The first set of behaviour concerns interpersonal roles, which include the following:
Figurehead: Executive managers perform a number of ceremonial duties such as representing their firm at public affairs and overseeing official functions. Lower level managers have ceremonial duties as well, perhaps on a lesser scale, including attending employees’ customers.
Leader: This encompasses a range of duties suggested earlier including motivating workers, guiding work-related behavior, and encouraging activities that help achieve organisational objectives.
Liaison: Managers find themselves acting as liaison between groups and individuals which are part of, or come in contact with, an organisation. This liaison role is important for establishing contacts with suppliers, coordinating activities among work groups, and encouraging harmony needed to assure effective performance.
Informational Roles
Informational roles are concerned with communication among individuals and groups, but, managers must also be skilled in gathering and using information to help make effective decisions. They should be able communicators who can transmit information and articulate decisions. Mintzberg’s three informational roles are as follows:
Monitor: Managers monitor activity, solicit information, gather data, and observe behaviour. Well-informed managers are prepared for decision-making and can redirect behavior to improve organizational performance.
Disseminator: Here communications are reversed. Rather than receive information, managers transmit information. Obviously, this is a crucial aspect of management. Subordinates, superiors and managers of similar work groups rely on timely of information disseminated with clarity.
Spokesperson: Top executives find themselves more involved as spokespersons than lower-level managers. A firm’s policy on competition, its philosophy customer care and its commitment to safety are topics common in executive speeches. However, managers at all levels are spokespersons who may be called upon to represent their groups. For example, when department heads meet to discuss operating budgets, they must be prepared to present information and support budget requests of their respective departments.
Decisional Roles
Mintzberg identified four roles within the list of his behaviour set. These are as follows:
Entrepreneur: In recent years, entrepreneurs have been identified with the commitment to innovation. Managers in complex organisation act in entrepreneurial way, by constantly trying to improve their operations. They seek new ways of using resources, new technologies for enhanced performance, and new systems of organizing human resources.
Disturbance Handler: This may be the best understood role of managers because they have always had the primary responsibility for resolving problems. It may also be the most stressful role as managers seem to find themselves constantly faced with disturbances that threaten the harmony and effectiveness of the organisations.
Resource Allocator: The third role links planning and organizing functions and organizing functions. Managers must plan to meet their objectives and distribute resources accordingly. There will never be sufficient time, money, materials, or manpower to accomplish all that is expected, so resource allocation offers involve carefully assigning scarce resources.
Negotiator: The allocation process bears on the role of negotiator. When scarce resources must be shared among many operating units, managers with superior negotiating skills will have advantages over others. However, negotiating extends to many managerial activities both inside and outside the firm. Purchase manager. For example, negotiates material prices and terms. Personnel manager negotiates union contracts. Negotiating, of course, doesn’t mean conflict but it does imply face to face bargaining between managers and employees to resolve problems or formulate performance expectations.

The ability to recognize the appropriate role to be played and to change roles readily is a mark of an effective manager. However, it may be concluded that at lower level, some of the decisional roles and informational roles are more important whereas at the top level interpersonal roles and decisional roles are of greater significance. At the middle level of management, informational roles are found to be more common.
Effective dealing of Problems
The first step in dealing with a problem employee is to identify the trouble. Many times, a simple, honest talk with an employee will dissolve issues such as occasional tardiness or minor attitude problems. Coaching requires a manager to work one-on-one with problem employees or to assign another employee to work with the employee to overcome their shortcomings. The mentor should provide the employee with feedback and solutions for improving their performance. Coaching requires patience and a substantial time investment, but it can help modify an employee’s behavior.
Poor performance
Poor performance is not always due to a lack of skills; the employee may simply be disorganized or sloppy. These habits can usually be corrected with proper guidance. If performance difficulties relate to a lack of skills, consider coaching or additional training.
Job incompatibility
In some cases an employee becomes a problem because their skills aren’t compatible with their assigned tasks or regular duties. In this case, offering the employee additional training or assigning them a different set of tasks is usually the most appropriate course of action.
Sloppy work
When you notice that, an employee has made some errors, point out the mistakes to the employee and monitors their work more closely. If the problem persists, speak with the employee and detail the most serious examples of problems with their work. Remember to remain positive and focus on how important the employee’s contribution is to the company.
Create an effective message
Consider the specific informational needs of executives, middle managers, supervisors and employees, and tailor your message to fit each audience. An effective message should also explain how your employees´ day-to-day duties directly affect the company’s performance and should touch on the values and pride of the employees. A direct, face-to-face interaction can help reinforce positive attitudes inspire employees and help them adapt to the change.
Listen to your employees
Employee feedback is critical in managing change. Holding focus groups with employees is a great way to gauge reaction and monitor the progress of change. You also can encourage employees to provide feedback through email or the company intranet. Communication is the cornerstone to successful change management. Talking to your employees is not a one-time event, and you need to reinforce your message by communicating early and often.
To be an effective manager you must know yourself, your strengths and your weaknesses, and those of the people around you.  You must know your objectives and have a plan of how to achieve them.  You must build a team of people that share your commitment to achieve those objectives, and you must help each team member to achieve their best which will be able to attain a common goal.

Human Resources Management function is a group of activities, the main function is to deciding what staffing needs and manager have to decide whether to use contractors or hire employees to fill these needs, recruiting and training the best employees, ensuring they are high performers, dealing with performance issues, and ensuring your personnel and management practices conform to various regulations. Activities also contain managing your approach to employee benefits and compensation, employee records and personnel policies. Mostly small businesses have to carry out these activities themselves because they can not yet manage to pay for part or fulltime help. But, they should always ensure that employees have and are aware of personnel policies which obey the rules to current regulations. These policies are over and over again in the form of employee manuals, which all workforces have.
The phrase “talent management” is being used to refer the activities to attract, develop and retain employees. Some people and organizations use the phrase to refer
especially to talented and or high-potential employees. The phrase often is used interchangeably with the field of Human Resource Management — although as the field of talent management matures, it’s very likely there will be an increasing number of people who will strongly disagree about the interchange of these fields. For now, this Library uses the phrases interchangeably.
Human resource management (HRM) is the strategic and coherent approach to the management of an organization’s most valued assets – the people working there who individually and collectively contributes to the achievement of the objectives of the business. The terms “human resource management” and “human resources” (HR) have largely replaced the term “personnel management” as a description of the processes involved in managing people in organizations. In simple sense, HRM means employing people, developing their capacities, utilizing, maintaining and compensating their services in tune with the job and organizational requirement.

Managerial roles
Managers must wear many different hats in formulating and implementing task activities related to their positions. In an attempt to understand the diversity of hats managers must wear, Henry Mintzberg examined managerial activities on a daily basis. His study enabled him to identify ten different but, coordinated sets of behavior, or roles, that manager assume. These ten roles can be separated into three general groupings: interpersonal roles, informational roles, and decisional roles.
INTERPERSONAL ROLES
Three of the manager’s roles come into play when the manager must engage in interpersonal relationships. The three roles of figurehead, leader, and liaison are each necessary under differing circumstances. Adopting one or another of the three interpersonal roles is made easier by the formal authority the manager obtains from the organization.
The figurehead role is enacted when activity of a ceremonial nature is required within the organization. A baseball manager attending a minor league all-star game, the head chef of a prominent restaurant greeting customers at the door, and the president of a bank congratulating a new group of trainees are all examples of the figurehead role. While the figurehead role is routine, with little serious communication and no important decision making, its importance should not be overlooked. At the interpersonal level, it provides members and non-members alike with a sense of what the organization is about and the type of people the organization recruits.

The second interpersonal role, the leader role, involves the coordination and control of the work of the manager’s subordinates. The leader role may be exercised in a direct or an indirect manner. Hiring, training, and motivating may all require direct contact with subordinates. However, establishing expectations regarding work quality, decision-making responsibility, or time commitments to the job are all outcomes of the leader role that are indirectly related to subordinates.
Quite often, managers are required to obtain information or resources outside their authority. The liaison role is enacted when managers make contact with other individuals, who may or may not reside in the organization, in order to complete the work performed by their departments or work units. An auto assembly plant supervisor may telephone a tire supplier to determine the amount of inventory available for next week; a prosecuting attorney may meet with the presiding judge and defense attorney to discuss the use of motions and evidence in a libel trial; or a college professor may meet with professors in a separate department on campus to obtain information on a prospective doctoral student. Ultimately, the liaison role enables a manager to develop a network for obtaining external information which can be useful for completing current and future work activities.
INFORMATIONAL ROLES
Monitor, disseminator, and spokesperson are the three informational roles that a manager may assume. These informational roles are created as a result of enacting the set of interpersonal roles already described. A network of interpersonal contacts with both subordinates and individuals outside the work unit serves to establish the manager as an informational nerve center of the unit, responsible for gathering, receiving, and transmitting information that concerns members of the work unit.
A manager assumes the monitor role by continually scanning the environment for information or activities and events that may identify opportunities or threats to the functioning of the work unit. Much of the manager’s gathering of information is achieved through the network of contacts that has been established through the interpersonal roles. Hearing small talk at a banquet about a competitor’s planned marketing program, learning through casual conversation at a ball game about the negative medical evaluation of an unsigned ball player, or daily reading of a business periodical are all examples of the kinds of information gathering involved in the monitor role.
The information a manager gathers as a monitor must be evaluated and transmitted as appropriate to members of the organization. The transmittal of information by a manager activates the disseminator role. Privileged information may be disseminated to subordinates, peers, or superiors in the organization. The manager may inform the marketing vice-president about the specific marketing strategy a competitor is planning to implement. A baseball manager may inform the team owner that an impending trade should be canceled because of the unfavorable medical report on one of the players. Or reading The Wall Street Journal may inform the manager that a shipping strike is looming and thus enable her to inform subordinates that temporary layoffs may occur next month.
Occasionally, a manager must assume the spokesperson role by speaking on behalf of the work unit to people inside or outside the organization. This might involve lobbying for critical resources or appealing to individuals who have influence on activities that affect the work unit. A top manager asking the board of directors to keep the work unit together during a reorganization period or a corporate president speaking to a college audience on the role the company plays in education would both constitute engaging in the spokesperson role.
DECISIONAL ROLES
Both interpersonal and informational roles are really preludes to what are often considered to be a manager’s most important set of roles: the decisional roles of entrepreneur, disturbance handler, resource allocator, and negotiator.
The entrepreneur role comes into action when the manager seeks to improve the work unit. This can be accomplished by adapting new techniques to fit a particular situation or modifying old techniques to improve individual or group activity. Managers usually learn of new or innovative methods through information gathered in the monitor role. As a result, a supervisor purchases a new kiln which will shorten the drying process for ceramic tiles; a director of a youth club trains staff in the use of personal computers to increase file access; or a president establishes a new pension plan to improve employee morale.
Whereas the entrepreneur role establishes the manager as the initiator of change, the disturbance handler role establishes the manager as a responder to change. Organizations, unfortunately, do not run so smoothly that managers are never called upon to respond to unwelcome pressures. In these cases, the manager is required to act quickly to bring stability back to the organization. A law partner must settle a disagreement among associates in the firm on who will present a case before a judge; a personnel director must negotiate with striking employees dissatisfied with the procedures for laying off employees; or a cannery first-line manager must respond to a sudden shortage of cans used to package perishable fruit because the supplier has reneged on a contract.
When a manager is placed in the position of having to decide to whom and in what quantity resources will be dispensed, the resource allocator role is assumed. Resources may include money, time, power, equipment, or people. During periods of resource abundance, this role can be easily performed by a manager. In most cases, however, organizations operate under conditions of resource scarcity; thus, decisions on the allocation of resources can be critical for the success of the work unit, division, or organization. As a decision maker, the manager must strive not only to appropriately match resources with subordinates but also to ensure that the distribution of resources is coordinated to effectively complete the task to be performed. An office manager must provide secretaries with appropriate equipment to generate and duplicate documents. A manager of a fast-food restaurant must coordinate work shifts to have the maximum number of employees working during the lunch hour. Corporate presidents may provide their administrative assistants with decision-making responsibility for day-to-day matters.
In addition to decisions concerning organizational changes, disturbances, and resources, the manager must enact a negotiator role. The process of negotiation is possible only when an individual has the authority to commit organizational resources. Hence, as managers move up the managerial hierarchy and obtain control over more resources, they become more involved in the negotiator role. For example, the president of a record company may be called in to discuss terms of a possible contract with a major rock group; a production manager must negotiate with the personnel department to obtain employees with specialized skills; or a college dean must negotiate with department heads over course offerings and the number of faculty to be hired.
The relative emphasis a manager places on these ten roles is highly dependent on the manager’s authority and status in the organization. Length of time on the job, position in the management hierarchy, goals of the subunit to be achieved, and skills the manager possesses all play a part in determining which roles are more prominent than others at any given time. For instance, a marketing manager is more likely to emphasize the interpersonal roles because of the importance of personal contact in the marketing process. A financial manager, charged with responsibility for the economic efficiency of the organization, will probably focus on the decisional roles. A staff manager, or a manager who performs in an advisory capacity, is likely to be more heavily involved in the informational roles. Regardless of the differences that may occur, however, all managers enact interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles while performing their tasks.
Effectively managing an organization is a demanding task. Managers not only must develop skills related to the functional areas of management but also must learn how to integrate these activities. What makes this process demanding is that events and activities external and internal to an organization can radically change the techniques and methods managers must use in order to arrive at successful outcomes. Managers cannot afford to be limited in their view of management, nor can they simply rely on how things were done in the past.
Even the most seasoned and successful managers are prone to mistakes. However, a more complete knowledge of the managerial process can reduce the chances of mistakes that will have dire consequences for an organization. Such knowledge may help managers to better plan, organize and staff, direct, and control organization activities within the context of their organization.

1.3 Interpretation of human resource management activities
Human Resource Management (HRM) is the function within an organization that focuses on recruitment of, management of, and providing direction for the people who work in the organization. Human Resource Management can also be performed by line managers.
Human Resource Management is the organizational function that deals with issues related to people such as compensation, hiring, performance management, organization development, safety, wellness, benefits, employee motivation,
Efficient and effective Human Resource management is a challenge to all HR professionals. Staffing, training and helping to manage people so that the organization is likely to increase the performance level is imperative to work in a productive communication, administration, and training. manner. Normally, human resource functions are tracking data points on each employee. These might include experiences, capabilities, skills, data, personal histories and payroll records. In the most general sense businesses carry out different activities dealing with managing their approaches to employee benefits and compensation, as well as employee records and personnel policies.
Among the core HR activities there are payroll, time and labor management, benefit administration and HR management. These activities correlate with the HR objectives which are largely the responsibility of Human Resources.
The foremost objectives of Personnel services are an efficient and effective personnel and payroll system responsive to staff needs together with the flexible remuneration system. These objectives can be attained by implementation of different modules, such as budgets and commencements module, applicant tracking module, occupational health and safety module, etc.
None the less important HR objective is the industrial relations services implying establishing effective relationships between the employer and the staff. Complete and comprehensive policy framework should be established for risk management, safety and health issues. Staff should be well informed about safety and health issues in the workplace. What is required to gain this objective is the staff’s participation in a wide range of training and awareness programs in the area of safety and health. Staff development objective can be realized through different skills development courses designed to encourage further skills development necessary to carry out their responsibilities.

5 People Management Strategies for Organizational Success
5 People Management Strategies for Organizational Success

There are many components that can be included in your overall business strategy. Along with departments like IT, Sales & Marketing, Development, Operations and Finance, your people management strategy must also be a key player.
So what do you expect from your employees? How will they help you reach your organizations goals? Is everyone meeting expectations? Do you have the right people in the right positions to keep your business moving forward? How do your employees make the greatest impact in your organization?
Here are 5 people management strategies to incorporate in your organizations business strategy:
Recruitment & Selection :  It all starts with hiring the right person for the job. It is critical to understand what positions you will need in your organization in the year to come. While you cannot predict all of your needs, a staffing forecast can help you in proper planning for organizational growth.
Once you have outlined the positions you will need to fill then you will need a targeted recruiting plan which includes identifying responsibilities, knowledge, skills, core competencies and cultural fit for your ideal employee. Use creative recruiting sources to target that individual including social media as an outlet to find top talent. An interview process that allows you the company and the candidate to learn as much about each other is important to making sure it is a good fit.
Training & Development: Your employees are your greatest asset.  Continual development of your team is important, whether succession planning or planning for growth. Use your people management strategy to identify high potential leaders and employees identifying training opportunities to enhance their performance. You should also incorporate annual compliance training, tuition reimbursement options, and a company reading list.
This is a great time to determine if these programs will be internal by using consultants & internal subject matter experts or external through seminars or continuing education. A great training and development plan does not have to break the bank. A carefully thought out and well executed plan can contribute to the overall success of the company without breaking the bank.
Performance Management: The measurement of each person’s performance is necessary to ensure that your team is meeting expectations. It also allows for feedback, gives your employees opportunities to improve and also addressing performance issues when an employee is not meeting expectations. Some people prefer to leave performance management to the annual evaluation. I recommend a yearlong performance management process that not only rewards high performers and manage problem performers but also ties compensation increases and bonuses to individual and company performance.
As you map out the coming year, include not only the annual performance evaluation but also a more frequent check in with employees.  If you have problem performers then put them on an Individual Development Plan and monitor them more frequently. It is an unfortunate part of performance management, but it you have a problem performer who has been given the opportunity and tools to improve and has not then this person probably is not a good fit.  Don’t let problem performers linger too long; it could drain the rest of your team and create problems among your employees.
Employee Engagement: The best way to have your finger on the pulse of your team is to measure their satisfaction. Now this is a tricky endeavor to take on. When conducting an employee satisfaction survey you want to first make sure the questions are carefully crafted to get insights on the topics that you find critical to your organization. Once you have created the survey then you should give your employees an anonymous way to provide their feedback so they feel comfortable being honest about their feelings. This may open them up to providing candidate feedback so it is important to properly handle the feedback.
Once you have the feedback it should be put into a deliverable form so the leadership team can begin synthesizing the data, conducting feedback session with their employees and finally putting together an action plan to address top dissatisfiers.  Share the results along with the action plan with your team and most importantly execute the plan.  Incorporate year round activities to keep morale high and continue to address dissastifiers and celebrate the things that employees love about their jobs.
Rewards & Recognition: Demonstrating your employees value and showing your appreciation for the contributions that they make to the company can go a long way in boosting morale and having a happy workplace. This is important for many reasons. One thing to note is that studies have shown that happy employees are more productive, they are more engaged and they provide a higher level of service to your customers. A study from the University of Missouri has found that companies that attend to employee satisfaction can improve internal moral, prevent turnover, and enhance customer satisfaction — including repurchase intentions. (Source)
Your reward and recognition program similar to training and development does not have to cost you a lot of money. Plan out the things that you want to celebrate or reward and frequency. A manager may get an allotment small dollar amount gift cards for on the spot recognition. Acknowledging anniversaries and birthdays can also be incorporated. Fun Fridays, refreshments in the break room, end of year bonuses are just a few examples. This is a great place to be creative, have fun and most importantly say thank you!
This is the time of year that I begin to discuss these topics within our organization and challenge you to do the same in yours. The aforementioned are all suggestions but each company is going to have plan elements unique to their organization and budget. Regardless of what components make up a successful people management strategy for your company it is going to be critical to your organization's success that you incorporate a people management strategy into your overall business strategy.

As rightly concluded by the author, I concur that ultimately people strategy of an organisation will have to be aligned continually with its business goals, market, critical people issues  and on its current vs future state of human capital  competencies required as properly diagnosed for the business. Strategies will be different from business to business as priorities will be different and could change. Strategies must facilitate agile people management policies to be successful in today's scenario.

Discussion
In all the corporations different roles are performed by different individuals or group of peoples to achieve the goals of the organizations. No single group or individual can achieve the end goals of the organization to achieve those specific goals and effective coordination is required among the different individuals or groups of the organization. And this coordination is known as the coordination function of an organization. This coordination function enables the unity and coordination among the different individual and groups working with in an organization to achieve specific goal. The coordination is always required among the different groups working in the organization because if single individual is working or performing then there is no need of coordination. Ordination among the groups is required to maintain the unity and to have efficiency. The importance of the coordination function is more realized when the size and volume of the task or operation is large or when different larger groups are working together. When people at larger scale are working together then there are more chances of conflicts because every individual have different working style from every other individual. And every individual have different goal from those of other individual working. Hence we can say that the coordination function of the management is an Essence of the management.
Mooney and relay says about coordination that:
“Coordination is the decided arrangement of group exertions to deliver unity of action in search of common goals.”
Effective leaders are always in connection, they always stay in contact with their employees and are always available to every single individual in his team and an effective leader always motivates its employees in the organization. Leaders have established the skills of boosting logic, information, and examination with emotion, conceit and the spirit to win. Their desire and interest for team or company’s vision and purpose is extremely communicable. They ardor the thoughts, grow the abilities, and form the assurance of people to “go for it”. Leaders support individual’s trust that impossible is possible, which makes it extremely credible.

Alright, I've got these search results. Let me see what I can make of them.

First, there's a discussion on ResearchGate about how to use human resources more efficiently. It seems like a forum where people are sharing their thoughts. One person suggests matching people to work that suits their aptitude, involving them in processes, motivating them, appreciating their work, giving incentives, mentioning their good work in public, and having faith in them. Another person adds that hiring the right people, training them, and motivating them are key. A third person talks about strategic planning and allocating resources correctly. They emphasize the importance of a management team that's aware of their shortcomings and involves others in designing and implementing strategies.

This gives me a general idea that efficient use of human resources involves matching skills to roles, motivation, involvement, and strategic planning.

The second search result is from ukessays.com, titled "Effective Utilization Of Human And Other All Resources Management Essay." It seems like a student's essay on management skills needed for effective resource utilization, focusing on ICT usage in educational institutions.

The essay mentions that effective management skills are crucial in today's global and technologically advancing world. It lists several skills that an effective manager should have, such as creative problem-solving, communication, conflict management, negotiation, and self-awareness.

It also outlines specific qualities of a good manager, like being a planner, provider, protector, inspirer, thinker, visionary, clear communicator, technically competent, skilled in human relations, enthusiastic, competent, a good delegator, cool under pressure, a team-builder, and a good communicator.

The essay further discusses the roles of a manager, categorizing them into interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles, based on Henry Mintzberg's framework. It also touches on how to deal with problem employees and the importance of effective communication in managing change.

This seems quite comprehensive, but I need to see how it relates specifically to the use of individuals in an organization.

The third search result is another essay from ukessays.com, titled "Human Resource Management Utilization In The Organization Management Essay." This one delves into human resource management (HRM) functions, defining HRM as the process of acquiring, developing, and retaining employees to achieve organizational goals.

It discusses the evolution of HRM from personnel management and outlines its key activities, such as staffing, training, performance management, compensation, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

The essay also mentions "talent management" as a focus on attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees, sometimes used interchangeably with HRM.

Furthermore, it describes the traditional management functions: planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling, and maps them to specific activities within HRM.

The essay also touches on managerial skills, distinguishing between technical, human, and conceptual skills, and how their importance varies across different management levels.

Additionally, it references Henry Mintzberg's managerial roles, categorizing them into interpersonal, informational, and decisional roles, which seems consistent with the previous essay.

Lastly, the fourth search result is from LinkedIn, titled "5 People Management Strategies for Organizational Success" by Melonie Boone. It outlines five key strategies for managing people in an organization: recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, employee engagement, and rewards and recognition.

Each strategy is briefly explained, emphasizing their importance in achieving organizational success. For example, recruitment and selection are about hiring the right people, training and development are about nurturing talent, performance management is about measuring and improving performance, employee engagement is about keeping employees satisfied and motivated, and rewards and recognition are about appreciating and incentivizing employees.

The author also mentions the role of ICT in these processes, suggesting that information and communication technologies are integral to modern people management.

The fifth search result is from notesformba.com, discussing the same five strategies as the LinkedIn article and touching on the role of ICT in organizations.

From these search results, it seems that effective use of individuals in an organization involves several key aspects:

1. **Matching Skills to Roles:** Ensuring that employees are placed in positions that align with their abilities and interests.

2. **Motivation and Engagement:** Keeping employees motivated and engaged through various means like appreciation, incentives, and involvement in decision-making.

3. **Strategic Planning:** Aligning human resource strategies with organizational goals and planning for future needs.

4. **Training and Development:** Providing opportunities for employees to grow and improve their skills.

5. **Performance Management:** Regularly assessing and providing feedback on employee performance.

6. **Communication:** Maintaining open and effective communication channels within the organization.

7. **Leadership:** Exhibiting effective leadership qualities to guide and inspire employees.

8. **Technology Utilization:** Leveraging ICT to support HR functions and enhance communication and coordination.

It's clear that a multi-faceted approach is needed to utilize individuals effectively in an organization. Each of the strategies mentioned—recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, employee engagement, and rewards and recognition—plays a crucial role in this process.

Moreover, the role of ICT in facilitating these strategies is significant. Technologies can aid in recruitment, training, performance tracking, communication, and employee engagement, making processes more efficient and effective.

In conclusion, the effective use of individuals in an organization requires a combination of strategic planning, skillful management, continuous development, and leveraging technology to support these efforts. By implementing the five people management strategies—recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, employee engagement, and rewards and recognition—organizations can maximize the potential of their workforce and achieve success.

\boxed{\text{Implementing strategic recruitment, comprehensive training, effective performance management, strong employee engagement, and meaningful rewards and recognition, while leveraging ICT, is crucial for the effective utilization of individuals in an organization.}}
