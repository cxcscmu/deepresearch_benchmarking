Alright, so I've got this question: "Does inequality help growth or hurt it?" It's a pretty big topic, and I know that inequality can refer to different kinds, like income inequality or wealth inequality, but I think in this context, it's mostly about economic inequality. So, I need to figure out if having unequal distribution of income or wealth helps or hinders economic growth.

First off, I should probably define what economic growth means. Typically, economic growth refers to an increase in a country's production possibilities, often measured by GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth. So, if inequality affects GDP growth, that's what I need to look into.

Now, intuitively, I might think that inequality could hinder growth because if a large portion of the population isn't doing well financially, they might not have the purchasing power to buy goods and services, which could slow down the economy. On the other hand, maybe inequality motivates people to work harder to move up the ladder, which could stimulate growth.

But I need more than just intuition here. I should look into some economic theories and empirical evidence to see what experts have to say about this.

Let me start by considering the arguments that inequality helps growth. One perspective is that inequality can provide incentives for people to work harder and invest more, because those at the top earn higher rewards. This could lead to more innovation and productivity growth. Additionally, some argue that inequality allows for a better allocation of resources, as those who are more productive receive greater rewards and can therefore invest more in human capital or businesses.

On the other side, there are arguments that inequality hurts growth. For example, if a significant portion of the population lacks access to education and healthcare due to poverty, the overall human capital of the country may suffer, leading to lower growth. Also, high inequality can lead to social unrest and political instability, which are certainly not conducive to economic growth.

So, both sides have valid points, but I need to see which one holds more weight based on actual data and research.

I recall that there have been studies by organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on this topic. Maybe I should look into their reports to see what they found.

Let me try to find some relevant studies or articles on this subject.

The relationship between economic growth and inequality has been studied by economists for more than a century. Nonetheless, this issue is still far from resolved and, as explained in this article, the answer to the question of how unequal household income affects a country’s growth is still not clear, both from a theoretical and also empirical perspective.
In general terms, a negative relationship can be observed between the level of inequalit y 1 and economic growth (see the first graph). But, as readers are only too well aware, the fact that a correlation exists does not necessarily mean there is a cause/effect relationship.
At a theoretical level, the prevailing view in the 1950s and
60s was that greater inequality could benefit growth, essentially through two mechanisms. The first is based on the fundamental idea that inequality benefits economic growth insofar as it generates an incentive to work and invest more. In other words, if those people with a higher level of education have higher productivity, differences in the rate of return will encourage more people to attain a higher level of education. The second mechanism through which greater inequality can lead to higher growth is through more investment, given that high-income groups tend to save and invest more.
However, several voices have subsequently warned of the negative effects of inequality on growth.
One of the main arguments states that greater inequality can reduce the professional opportunities available to the most disadvantaged groups in society and therefore decrease social mobility, limiting the economy’s growth potential. In particular, a higher level of inequality can result in less investment in human capital by lower-income individuals if, for example, there is no suitable state system of education or grants. For this reason, countries with a higher degree of inequality tend to have lower levels of social mobility between generations (see the second graph).
Greater inequality can also negatively affect growth if, for example, it encourages populist policies (see the article «Inequality and populism: myths and truths» in this Dossier). Along the same lines, another source of discussion is whether an increase in inequality can lead to an excessive rise in credit, which ends up acting as a brake on growth (see the article «Can inequality cause a financial crisis?» in this Dossier).
Beyond the theoretical sphere, many authors have attempted to provide empirical evidence of inequality’s effects on economic growth. The findings are not always conclusive, however. This is due to the fact that it is difficult to isolate the impact of inequality on economic growth from the impact of other factors which may also be influential. In fact, this is the main criticism directed at empirical studies based on cross-country growth regressions and such studies are discussed below, so the findings need to be interpreted with due caution.2
Broadly speaking, there is no single, universal mechanism behind the relationship between inequality and growth; in fact, this relationship may not always be the same. Nevertheless, a relatively generalised pattern can be observed depending on a country’s degree of development. When an economy is at an early stage of its development, the return from physical capital tends to be higher than the return provided by human capital and greater inequality can therefore trigger higher growth. However, as an economy achieves a more advanced stage of development, the return from physical capital tends to decrease while that from human capital tends to rise, so increases in inequality can negatively affect growth.3
A recent study by the IM F 4 suggests that an increase in inequality is harmful to economic growth. By way of example, the historical relationship (1980-2012) observed between inequality and growth in the 159 countries analysed shows that, if the income share of the richest 20% of the population increases by 1 pp (a rise in inequality), GDP growth slows down by 0.08 pps during the next five years. On the other hand, if the income share of the poorest 20% of the population increases by 1 pp (a reduction in inequality), GDP growth is 0.38 pps higher during the next five years on average.
Along the same lines, a study by the OEC D 5 estimates that an increase in the Gini coefficient of three points (which coincides with the average increase recorded in OECD countries in the last two decades) would have a negative impact on economic growth of 0.35 pps per year over 25 years, representing a cumulative loss of 8.5% of GDP. Moreover, the study shows that the most negative effect on growth is caused by the inequality affecting the lowest income individuals (those at the bottom of income distribution). For example, if the bottom inequality in the UK were changed to be like that in France, or that of the US to become like that of Japan or Australia, the average annual growth in GDP would improve by almost 0.3 pps over the next 25 years, representing a cumulative rise in GDP of more than 7%.6 Once again, it should be noted that these estimates are for illustrative purposes only and must not be interpreted as the actual effect a change in equality can have on growth in each country.
Lastly, the report concludes that one of the key channels through which inequality acts as a brake on economic performance is by reducing the investment opportunities, primarily in education, of the poorest segments of the population. In fact, social mobility has deteriorated significantly in countries such as the US, where the percentage of children who receive a higher income than their parents has fallen from 90% for the cohort of 1940 to 50% for people born in the 1980s.7
In fact, less social mobility can act as an indicator of a rise in inequality. Several empirical studies have revealed a negative relationship between inequality and social mobility (see the second graph) precisely because inequality, particularly when this occurs within the lowest income groups, reduces the chances of the more disadvantaged segment of the population to invest in education, which is the main way to increase social status.8 Spain is no exception: university graduates from a lower social background record rates of access to professional and managerial jobs that are 14 times higher than those who do not finish secondary education (see the third graph).9
By way of conclusion, it should be noted that, although inequality is, to some extent, an inevitable phenomenon in modern economies, the latest empirical evidence suggests that, if inequality is reduced, particularly among the lowest income groups, this has a positive effect not only in terms of social justice but also in terms of economic growth.

Column: Does inequality help growth - or hurt it?
By Chrystia Freeland
7 Min Read
SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - One of the most urgent questions in economics today is the connection between inequality and growth. That is because one of the big economic facts of our time is the surge in income disparity, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. The other big fact is the recession set off by the financial crisis and the consequent imperative to jump-start economic growth. Figuring out the relationship between these two tent-pole issues is therefore a good way for economists to spend their time.
There are two main and contradictory ideas about how that relationship might work. One is that inequality is the price of robust economic growth. If the private sector is thriving, the most successful capitalists will be getting very rich. Creating a system that allows - indeed, encourages - the best and the brightest to pull away from everyone else is how you shift your economy into its highest gear.
There is, however, another theory, and it has been winning adherents in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In this view, rising inequality is not a symptom of a fast-growing economy or an incentive that will help create one. Instead, too much income inequality crushes economic growth.
There are different arguments for why that might happen. One is that high income inequality creates an unstable system that is vulnerable to costly booms and busts. Another is that when too much of the income goes to the very top and not enough goes to the middle, spending slumps - how many yachts does a plutocrat need? - putting a brake on growth.
David Howell, a professor of economics at The New School in New York, has written a draft paper for the Center for American Progress, a progressive research group, that investigates the first argument. Howell argues that the United States and Britain have acted over the past three decades on what he calls the laissez-faire theory, that the equation of rising inequality and increasing gross domestic product is correct.
As Howell puts it, “the laissez-faire case for high inequality is grounded in the belief that growth in output and employment depends mainly on strong incentives to work and invest.”
Howell tested that view by comparing the United States and Britain to their peers. He asked whether “compared to other rich countries, U.S. income inequality has paid off in relatively high growth.” His answer: not particularly. He finds that “there is no simple correlation between our measures of growth and income inequality.”
That may come as a surprise to many Americans, who are accustomed to hearing, as Howell explained, “that the U.S. middle class is doing relatively well, at least compared to Europe, because of productivity growth and because we allow higher inequality.”
But the reality is that at least some of those allegedly sclerotic European economies, dragged down by their highly redistributive welfare states, have outperformed the United States.
“What we see is Sweden having really good productivity growth by all measures, despite much more modest increases in inequality and starting at a much lower level,” he said.
“The U.S. is anywhere from an O.K. to middling performer in the Age of Inequality,” Howell said, using his term for our era. But while his work suggests inequality is not needed to get growth, he does not show that inequality actually hurts growth either: “I don’t show a strong measurable inverse effect.”
Lars Osberg, an economist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, takes on this second argument - the case that inequality, at least beyond a certain point, can stifle growth.
He, too, adopts a comparative lens, looking at Canada, the United States and Mexico.
Osberg argues that a growing chasm between those at the very top and everyone else imperils the overall economy. His worry is financial instability.
“The added savings of the increasingly affluent must be loaned to balance total current expenditure,” he writes, “but increasing indebtedness implies financial fragility, periodic financial crises, greater volatility of aggregate income and, as governments respond to mass unemployment with countercyclical fiscal policies, a compounding instability of public finances.”
This is a variation of an argument by Raghuram Rajan, a politically center-right professor at the University of Chicago, who has suggested that rising income inequality was one of the drivers of the financial crisis. As income inequality increased, and the incomes of the middle class stagnated, the U.S. government responded by increasing the consumer credit available to the middle class.
In the short term, that was a win-win solution: consumption, and therefore the economy, grew, and the middle class was quiescent because stagnating incomes were masked by increasing consumer debt. But in the medium term that Goldilocks scenario broke down - the middle class consumption bubble, and the Wall Street bubble it helped finance, popped with devastating consequences.
Both Howell and Osberg are skeptical, at best, of the value of rising income inequality as a driver of economic growth. When you put that conclusion together with the arithmetic of democracy - rising income inequality means a majority of voters are on the losing end of the deal - a political backlash seems inevitable.
“Go back to the 1920s or the 1870s and economists were worried about the stability of the capitalist system,” Osberg said. “One of the things the 1930s experience teaches us is there are some catastrophic outcomes which can happen.”
The investing class and the academic world are focused on those dangers. “Can capitalism survive?” is one of the trendiest conference topics among red-blooded capitalists and left-leaning professors alike. So far, at the ballot box and on the street, this question has not been as salient. That does not mean it will not be in the future - and in ways we cannot predict.

How are economic inequality and growth connected? - Equitable Growth
How are economic inequality and growth connected?
In the mid-20th century, economists began witnessing inequality’s decline in the developed world. Prior to the two World Wars and Great Depression, rising inequality was characteristic of most of the developed world, but in the aftermath of the upheavals, the trend reversed. At the time, many reasoned that declining inequality was a natural outgrowth of the development process: As countries become more economically mature, inequality would fall. This trend led Nobel Laureate economist Simon Kuznets to write:
“One might thus assume a long swing in the inequality characterizing the secular income structure: widening in the early phases of economic growth when the transition from the pre-industrial to the industrial civilization was most rapid; becoming stabilized for a while; and then narrowing in the later phases.”
Given the narrowing of inequality in the more economically developed nations, Kuznets’ analysis suggested that the inequality in poorer countries was a transitional phase that would reverse itself once these nations became more economically developed. Thus, similar to how the level of inequality was decreasing in wealthy nations, inequality would eventually decline in poorer countries as they became richer. In fact, some economists theorized that inequality in the less developed world was actually good for growth because it meant that the economy was generating select individuals wealthy enough to provide the savings necessary for investment-led growth.

Today, the world looks very different than it did in 1955 when Kuznets made his famous assertion. In the past several decades, economic inequality in the United States and other wealthy nations has risen sharply, spurring renewed interest in the question of whether and how changes in income distributions affect economic wellbeing. Over the same time period, economic inequality has persisted and even grown in many poorer economies.
These trends have sparked economists to conduct empirical studies, analyzing data across states and countries, to see if there is a direct relationship between economic inequality, and economic growth and stability. Early empirical work on this question generally found inequality is harmful for economic growth. Improved data and techniques added to this body of research, but the newer literature was generally inconclusive, with some finding a negative relationship between economic growth and inequality while others finding the opposite.
The latest research, however, provides nuance that can explain many of the conflicting trends within the earlier body of research. There is growing evidence that inequality is bad for growth in the long run. Specifically, a number of studies show that higher inequality is associated with slower income gains among those not at the top of the income and wealth spectrum.
Economists and policymakers today should not be surprised that empirical studies were inconclusive given the broad theoretical (and sometimes contradictory) reasons that hypothesized inequality would both promote growth and inhibit growth. On the one hand, hundreds of years of economic theory has been built on the hypothesis that inequality in outcomes creates incentives for individuals to work hard or be more productive than others in order to receive greater incomes—activity that spurs growth. In addition, many theorized that inequality would help individuals become rich enough to save some of their earnings and fund investments necessary to produce economic growth.
On the other hand, economic theory also suggests the opposite—that inequality may inhibit the ability of some talented but less fortunate individuals to access opportunities or credit, dampen demand, create instabilities, and undermine incentives to work hard, all of which may reduce economic growth. Growing inequality could also generate a relatively larger group of low-income individuals who are less able to invest in their health, education, and training, thereby retarding economic growth.
In this paper, we review the recent empirical economic literature that specifically examines the effect inequality has on economic growth, wellbeing, or stability. This newly available research looks across developing and advanced countries and within the United States. Most research shows that, in the long term, inequality is negatively related to economic growth and that countries with less disparity and a larger middle class boast stronger and more stable growth. Some studies do suggest that in the short run, inequality may spur growth before hindering it over the longer term, but overall there is growing evidence that, in the long run, more equitable societies are associated with higher rates of growth.
In looking at studies that directly estimate the effect of inequality on growth, there are concerns about data quality and statistical methodology. The purpose of these studies is to establish whether economic inequality has some effect on economic growth or stability. For researchers, there are important two questions: is there a causal relationship between inequality and growth? If so, can researchers actually identify this factor, or are they actually measuring the effect of some other factor. Establishing causality is exceptionally difficult in the social sciences and the standard approach employed for studying relationships between inequality and growth has been to look at the level of inequality preceding the growth period being measured. This does not firmly establish causality but can be indicative of it. On the other hand, the approaches for detecting the relationship vary widely by the statistical design, the data, controls included. Given enough time and flexibility in their specifications, economists have demonstrated an ability to draw a variety of conclusions. The best practices in this area are evolving and so it is important to look at the breadth of the literature, rather than focus on a single paper or approach.
Important as well for the purposes of this paper is this—the latest economic research we reviewed only examines the outcome of whether there are results for regressions that demonstrate positive or negative relationships between inequality and economic growth and stability. This means the paper cannot provide clear guidance for policymakers on exactly how to address inequality or mitigate its effects on growth. In other words, the research examined in this paper generally does not identify the channels or mechanisms by which inequality affects growth.
An additional issue (above and beyond the challenges of how to specify a model) is the paucity of data to evaluate questions about inequality and growth. Ideally, economists would want a variety of measures for inequality, including earnings, income, and wealth, that can be compared across a large number of countries over a long period of time. Sadly, such a perfect data set does not exist. Therefore, econ- omists are left to do the best estimates with the data at hand. Over time, though, the data sets that have been used to perform these analyses have been improving.
Other scholars who have examined this literature have also come to the conclu- sion that to inform policymaking, we need to do more than search for a mechanis- tic relationship between inequality and growth. Dani Rodrik, the former Harvard University professor now at the Institute of Advanced Studies, underscores the limitations of this kind of research, arguing that methods for analyzing data that span across places and time are ill-suited to address the fundamental questions about the relationship of government policy and inequality with growth outcomes. This conclusion is echoed by University of Melbourne economist Sarah Voitchovsky in her recent review of the literature in the “Oxford Handbook on Economic Inequality,” where she says:
“While data constraints continue to limit the type of empirical analyses that can be undertaken, investigations that focus on specific channels generally provide more robust conclusions than evidence from reduced form analyses.”
This paper does not contain policy advice. Instead, it contains analysis that largely demonstrates there are direct, and possibly causal, relationships between economic inequality and growth—places that begin with a lower level of inequality subsequently tend to grow faster and have longer periods of growth than those with a higher level of inequality. In future research, we will focus on the channels through which inequality could or does affect economic growth.

How Much Inequality Is Necessary for Growth?
by

From the Magazine (January–February 2012)
As the Occupy Wall Street protesters have pointed out, the strong global economic growth of the past few decades (not counting the Great Recession) left a lot of people behind. For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office recently reported that from 1979 to 2007 the top 1% of earners more than doubled their share of the nation’s after-tax income.
For decades economists have wondered whether inequality is bad or good for long-term growth. On one hand, entrenched inequality threatens to create an underclass whose members’ inadequate education and low skills leave them with poor prospects for full participation in the economy as earners or consumers. It can cause political instability and thus poses risks to investment and growth. On the other hand, some argue that because inequality puts more resources into the hands of capitalists (as opposed to workers), it promotes savings and investment and catalyzes growth.
To try to answer this question, we examined economic data from 48 U.S. states for the census years from 1960 to 2000. We discovered new evidence that inequality and growth are entwined in complex ways and found that overall, both high and low levels of inequality diminish growth.
Inequality Country by Country
The Gini coefficient measures income or consumption inequality on a scale from zero to 100, with zero representing a ...
We looked at the data through a number of lenses, each based on a different statistical model. Using one lens, we found a hump-shaped relationship between inequality and growth. Raise inequality above the average level in 2000, and growth declines; lower it, and the same thing happens. According to this analysis, inequality at that time was at a sort of optimum level, for lack of a better word.
Using another lens, we found a similarly hump-shaped relationship, but with the hump in a different place. From this perspective, the 2000 level of inequality is good for growth, but a higher level would, to a certain degree, be even better: A moderate rise in inequality—by one standard deviation—would increase annual growth by about 0.6 percentage points.
What are the long-term implications? The gains from rises in inequality are murky: Although our findings suggest that modest increases can generate growth, other data indicate that heightened inequality shortens growth spells and may halt growth. Reducing inequality, though, has clear benefits over time: It strengthens people’s sense that society is fair, improves social cohesion and mobility, and broadens support for growth initiatives. Policies that aim for growth but ignore inequality may ultimately be self-defeating, then, whereas policies that decrease inequality by, say, boosting employment and education have beneficial effects on the human capital that modern economies increasingly need.

Linkages – growth, poverty and inequality
There is a wealth of academic, donor and practitioner literature on the relationships between growth, poverty and inequality, some of which – particularly the two-way relationship between growth and inequality – are highly contested. Knowledge of these relationships is important for practitioners seeking to develop informed policies to foster inclusive growth.
Many studies have demonstrated that economic growth is a prerequisite for poverty reduction if income distribution is held constant (Deininger and Squire, 1997; Dollar and Kraay, 2001; Ravallion, 2005; Bourguignon, 2004). Similarly, there is consensus that the two factors that determine why there are different rates of poverty reduction at a given rate of growth are the initial level of inequality in a country, and how inequality changes over time. The higher the level of initial inequality within a country, the less poor people will gain from economic growth (Bourguignon, 2004; Ravallion, 2004; Balakrishnan, Steinberg, and Syed, 2013).
In light of this, Bourguignon (2004) notes that the relationships between growth and poverty, and inequality and poverty, are ‘essentially arithmetic’. He therefore emphasises that understanding the two-way relationship between growth and inequality is the real challenge for producing a development strategy focused on fostering pro-poor or inclusive growth.
The impact of growth on inequality
Numerous mechanisms which cause economic growth to alter the distribution of income within an economy have been proposed. A key strand in this literature is the theory that economic growth alters the distribution of resources and labour in an economy, which in turn affects the distribution of income. The Kuznets Curve hypothesis (see below) is grounded in this viewpoint.
Institutional change is another key mechanism which may cause economic growth to change the distribution of income in an economy. As average incomes grow there is a greater demand for adequate public services and accountable institutions (Birdsall, 2007), and the transaction costs that constrain institutional change may become more affordable as a consequence of economic growth.
The empirical evidence for the impact of economic growth on inequality is mixed. Many authors have found clear evidence for the presence of the Kuznets Curve, implying that economic growth leads to an initial increase in inequality followed by a subsequent decrease. However, once detailed panels of household data enabled studies to assess changes of distribution of incomes over time within countries, cross-country regressions have revealed a strong one-to-one relationship between the growth of average incomes of the poor, and overall average incomes (Deininger and Squire, 1997; Dollar and Kraay, 2001; Dollar, Kleineberg and Kraay, 2013).
Some of the literature cautions, however, that cross-country regressions should not be relied upon to make meaningful generalisations as the way in which economic growth affects income distribution is country specific (Kakwani and Pernia, 2000; Bourguignon, 2004). Instead, Bourguignon (2004) argues that country-specific case studies demonstrate a strong and complex relationship between growth and inequality which varies on a country by country basis, and that these types of studies will be important in enabling policy makers to develop successful country specific policies targeting both growth and income distribution.
The Kuznets Curve
The hypothesis that inequality first rises and then falls (in an inverted U-curve) as economic growth increases and an economy becomes more developed was first put forward by Kuznets (1955). The proposed cause of the initial increase in inequality is the shift of workers and resources from agriculture to industry during the early period of development, creating a significant urban-rural gap. According to this hypothesis, inequality will only begin to fall later in the development process, once ‘trickle-down development’ leads to workers earning higher wages and a welfare system being established.
Empirically, the presence of a Kuznets Curve is heavily contested. Many studies (Ahluwalia, 1976; Papanek and Kyn, 1986; Barro, 1999) find evidence that supports the Kuznets Curve hypothesis as an empirical regularity, but often find that the curve fails to explain the variations in inequality between countries or over time. Others criticise the hypothesis on the grounds that the inverted U-shape is a consequence of historical differences in inequality between countries, rather than the development of individual countries themselves. Deininger and Squire (1996) control for this historical difference in inequality in their analysis, and find no empirical evidence for the Kuznets curve.
The impact of inequality on growth
The literature on the impact of inequality on economic growth is likewise vast. Credit market imperfections, or an inability of the poor to borrow due to lack of collateral or underdeveloped capital markets, have been put forward by numerous authors as a hindrance to economic growth (Barro, 1999; Bourguignon, 2004; Birdsall, 2007).
Others cite redistributive pressures, either in a democratic context or through socio-political unrest, as channels through which inequality can constrain subsequent growth (Rodrik, 1998; Barro, 1999; Bourguignon; 2004). From an institutional perspective, Birdsall (2007) argues that high levels of inequality can discourage the development of institutions which make a market environment conducive to economic growth (e.g. an accountable government).
Empirically, the many authors find no clear relationship between overall inequality and subsequent economic growth. However, there is some consensus that inequality can negatively impact the growth of poor people’s incomes and positively impact the income growth of the rich (Barro, 1999; Birdsall, 2007; van der Weide and Milanovic, 2014).
Most of the literature regarding the impact on inequality of economic growth focuses on income inequality and long-run average growth. However, some studies have found that it is inequality of wealth rather than income that is an impediment to rapid growth (Deininger and Squire, 1997). Other authors have argued that it is the impact of inequality on sustained periods of growth, rather than on the initiation of rapid growth, that should be assessed. By assessing breaks in growth, they find a robust association between lower inequality and sustained growth (Berg and Ostry, 2011; Berg, Ostry and Tsangarides, 2014).

Should development policy focus on growth, poverty, or inequality? This paper argues that the quick elimination of all forms of absolute poverty is a meaningful goal for development. To achieve this, strong, country-specific combinations of growth and distribution policies will be required. As the relationships between growth and poverty, and inequality and poverty, are essentially arithmetic, the fundamental challenge for designing these policies lies in understanding whether growth rates and changes in income distribution are independent of each other or interrelated. Despite finding that country specificity undermines generalisations, the author states that redistributionary policies undertaken alongside the development process can help to mitigate the potential for growth to initially increase inequality (as per the Kuznets hypothesis). The paper then proposes several hypotheses (e.g. credit market imperfections and social conflict) for why lower inequality can lead to higher growth rates, but finds that cross-country regressions have been unable to prove these relationships.

Balakrishnan, R. Steinberg, C. and Syed, M. (2013). The Elusive Quest for Inclusive Growth: Growth, Poverty, and Inequality in Asia? Washington DC: IMF
What impact has economic growth in Asia over the past two decades had on poverty reduction? This paper finds that while poverty has fallen across the region over the last two decades, increased inequality has reduced the impact of growth on poverty reduction. Asia’s recent period of growth has been both less inclusive and less pro-poor in relation to other developing regions and compared to Asia’s own past. Furthermore, past increases in inequality in Asia are likely to reduce the future impact of income growth on poverty, even if the level of inequality remains constant in the future. The paper then challenges the assertion made by Dollar and Kraay (and others) that incomes of the bottom quintile rise in line with average income during growth, and finds that once instruments are used for the income variable then the regression results point to the income of the bottom quintile rising less fast than average income. The paper also finds that increased spending on education, labour market reform, and financial inclusiveness are key factors in determining how inclusive or pro-poor growth has been in Asia.

Barro, R. (1999). Inequality and Growth in a Panel of Countries. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University
This paper begins with a theoretical explanation of four mechanisms by which inequality can affect growth and investment: credit market imperfections, redistribution under a democratic system, socio-political unrest, and savings rates. After conducting a regression analysis using a broad panel of countries, little overall relationship between income inequality and rates of growth and investment is found. The analysis shows, however, that higher inequality tends to slow down growth in poor countries, and increase growth in rich countries (the threshold used $2000 US in 1985 dollars). This finding may justify the use of redistributionary policies in poor countries as a means of stimulating economic growth.

Dollar, D. and Kraay, A. (2001). Growth is Good for the Poor. Washington DC: World Bank
This paper tests the relationship between the growth of incomes of the poor (defined as the bottom 20 percent) and average income growth. After performing a cross-country regression analysis of 92 countries over four decades, Dollar and Kraay find a one-to-one relationship between growth of income of the poor and growth of mean income. The paper also finds that determinants of growth such as trade openness, financial development, strong property rights and rule of law have benefitted the poor as much as the average household, contrary to the arguments of many critics of globalisation. Similarly a number of ‘pro-poor’ policies, such as public expenditure on health and education and formal democratic institutions, are found to benefit the poor as much as the average household. Dollar and Kraay do not conclude from these findings that growth is all that is needed to improve the lives of the poor, but rather that growth enhancing policies such as trade openness and rule of law should be at the heart of any poverty reduction strategy.

Dollar, D., Kleineberg, T. and Kraay, A. (2013). Growth Still is Good for the Poor. Washington DC: World Bank
This paper finds a very strong equiproportionate relationship between the average incomes of the bottom 40 percent and overall average incomes, leading the authors to conclude that ‘growth still is good for the poor’. It is also established that there is no global trend towards greater inequality, as the income shares of the bottom 20 and 40 percent show no systematic tendency to decline over time. Finally none of the factors thought to matter for growth (e.g. financial openness and macro-stability) and inequality (e.g. primary school enrolments) are found to robustly correlate with an increased income share for the bottom 40 percent. The authors highlight the difficulty in using cross-national data to identify specific macro policy reforms to boost shared prosperity, as well as the fact that despite zero change in inequality on average there have been significant changes in inequality in certain countries during specific periods. Nonetheless, they conclude that economic growth will lead to shared prosperity on average, and that institutions and policies that promote economic growth in general will promote shared prosperity.

Deininger, K. and Squire, L. (1997, March). Economic Growth and Income Inequality: Reexamining the Links. Finance and Development
This article finds that the relationship between initial inequality and subsequent growth differs depending on whether initial inequality is measured in terms of income or land, with an uneven distribution of assets found to be more of an impediment to growth than income inequality. The authors argue that lack of access to credit is the key mechanism by which asset inequality results in poor growth. The authors also highlight that the aggregate measures of distribution often used can hide considerable changes in the incomes of different groups. They recommend that welfare analyses of the bottom quintiles should accompany any assessments of aggregate shifts in income. New data is then used to test existing hypotheses regarding growth and inequality. No evidence is found to back up the Kuznets hypothesis, while initial inequality of assets rather than income is found to have a strong negative impact on subsequent economic growth. Despite the strong relationship found between asset inequality and future economic growth, the impact of investment on growth and poverty reduction is found to be even stronger. The authors conclude that policymakers should not pursue a redistributive strategy at the expense of investment, as this could result in lower incomes for the poor.

Birdsall, N. (2007). Income Distribution: Effects on Growth and Development. Washington DC: Centre for Global Development
How does inequality impact subsequent economic growth? This paper finds that inequality is more likely to constrain economic growth in countries at low levels of income, defined as below about $3200 per capita in 2000 dollars. It is at high levels of inequality (at or above a Gini coefficient of .45) that a negative association emerges between growth and inequality. Birdsall then defines three potential mechanisms through which inequality can negatively impact economic growth. Firstly, inequality can exacerbate the effect of incomplete and underdeveloped markets for capital and information, as creditworthy borrowers with no collateral are denied loans and their lack of wealth or income then stops them from making any investments at all. Secondly, high inequality can discourage the evolution of the economic and political institutions associated with accountable government, as the rich resist tax to fund public services which they can purchase privately. Thirdly, inequality may undermine the civic and social life that sustains effective collective decision-making, leading to impaired economic growth. For example, high inequality has been found to have a significant and positive effect on homicide rates in a cross section of 39 countries.

Ravallion, M. (2005). Inequality is Bad for the Poor. Washington DC: World Bank
This paper identifies two factors as the main proximate causes of the differing impact of growth on poverty: the initial level of inequality and how inequality changes over time. The author then notes that despite the fact that numerous studies have found no aggregate trade-off between mean income and inequality, this does not mean that there are no trade-offs at the level of specific policies. Reducing inequality by adding further distortions to an economy may well have ambiguous effects on growth and poverty reduction. However, there is potential for ‘win-win’ policies as some of the factors that impede growth also stop the poor from accessing the opportunities unleashed by growth. Successful policies can focus on either correcting the underlying market and governmental failure or on directly intervening to redress the asset inequalities, by fostering poor people’s accumulation of physical and human assets.

Berg, A. and Ostry, J. (2011). Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin? Washington DC: IMF
This paper highlights that while the evidence on the impact of initial inequality on growth has been mixed, the majority of empirical literature to date overlooks the fact that periods of rapid growth are interrupted by collapses and periods of stagnation. The authors argue that it is more relevant to assess the relationship between income distribution and these breaks in growth. The paper finds that while many developing countries have successfully initiated high levels of growth for a few years, the ability to sustain growth is much rarer. Longer periods of growth are found to be robustly associated with a more equal distribution of income, even when other determinants of growth duration (external shocks, initial income, institutional quality, macroeconomic stability, openness to trade) are taken into account. A key implication is that in the long term, policies to reduce inequality could result in sustained growth, or that reduced inequality and sustained growth may be viewed as ‘two sides of the same coin’.

Berg, A., Ostry, J. and Tsangarides, C. (2014). Redistribution, Inequality and Growth. Washington DC: IMF
This paper builds on the tentative consensus in the literature that inequality reduces the pace and durability of growth, through mechanisms such as political instability and undermining progress in health and education. It uses a cross-country dataset that distinguishes market (before taxes and transfers) inequality from net (after taxes and transfers) inequality in order to test the effects of redistribution on growth. Firstly, the authors find that more unequal societies tend to distribute more. Secondly, the paper confirms that lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, for a given level of redistribution. Thirdly, redistribution is found to have little impact on growth, and it is only in the most extreme cases of redistribution that there is some evidence for a negative impact on growth.

van der Weide, R. and Milanovic, B. (2014). Inequality Is Bad for Growth of the Poor (But Not for That of the Rich)? Washington DC: World Bank
Using US micro-census data from 1960-2010, this paper aims to ‘unpack’ inequality and growth to predict how different types of inequality can impact the subsequent income growth of different segments of the population. The authors find that high levels of overall inequality reduce the income growth of the poor and increase the income growth of the rich – i.e. the kind of growth that inequality stimulates creates further inequality. Total inequality is then split into ‘top inequality’ (inequality amongst the top 40 percent) and ‘bottom inequality’. The study finds that both top and bottom inequality are negatively associated with income growth for the poor, and that bottom inequality is also positively associated with income growth for the rich. This may be because high levels of inequality, particularly among the rich, result in societal fragmentation. The authors argue that societal fragmentation could result in the rich opting out of publicly provided services such as education and healthcare and lobbying for policies that benefit themselves but limit growth opportunities for the poor (e.g. cuts to public health spending).

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can gather from them.

First, there's an article from CaixaBankResearch about how inequality affects economic growth. It seems like there are two main views on this. One is that inequality can be good for growth because it provides incentives for people to work harder and invest more. The other is that inequality can harm growth by limiting opportunities for poorer people and potentially leading to social unrest.

The article mentions that in the past, economists thought that inequality might help growth because it encouraged people to be more productive. But more recent studies suggest that actually, inequality might hurt growth, especially in the long run. It cites a study by the IMF that says if inequality increases, GDP growth might slow down, and if inequality decreases, GDP growth might speed up.

Another article is from Reuters, written by Chrystia Freeland. She talks about two main ideas: one is that inequality is necessary for growth because it motivates people to work harder, and the other is that too much inequality can destabilize the economy and lead to crises like the financial crisis of 2008.

Freeland mentions that some economists believe that inequality can lead to financial instability because when the rich have a lot of money, they might invest it in risky ways, which can cause bubbles and crashes. She also references a professor from the University of Chicago who suggests that increasing consumer debt was a way to keep the economy growing despite stagnant incomes for the middle class, but that this was unsustainable and led to the financial crisis.

There's also a piece from Equitable Growth that discusses how economic inequality and growth are connected. It talks about the Kuznets Curve, which is a theory that suggests that as economies develop, inequality first increases and then decreases. But the article says that recent research suggests that inequality might actually be bad for long-term growth, especially for the incomes of poorer people.

An article from Harvard Business Review by Fuad Hasanov and Oded Izraeli suggests that there's a sweet spot for inequality—neither too high nor too low is best for growth. They found that both high and low levels of inequality can hinder growth, implying that there's an optimal level.

Lastly, there's a guide from GSDRC that delves into the relationships between growth, poverty, and inequality. It emphasizes that while growth is necessary for poverty reduction, the initial level of inequality and changes in inequality over time significantly affect how much poverty decreases with growth.

From all these sources, it seems like there's no straightforward answer. Some studies suggest that inequality can help growth by providing incentives, while others argue that it hinders growth by limiting opportunities for the poor and potentially causing social and economic instability.

I think the key takeaway is that moderate levels of inequality might be acceptable or even beneficial for growth, but extremely high levels of inequality can be detrimental. It's all about balance.

So, to answer the question "Does inequality help growth or hurt it?"—it depends. In some cases, it might help, but in many others, especially when inequality is high, it likely hurts growth.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{It depends on the level of inequality; moderate inequality may help growth, but high inequality likely hurts it.}} \]
