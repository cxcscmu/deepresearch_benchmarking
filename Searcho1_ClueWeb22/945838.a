As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience or the ability to perform web searches, but I can certainly help you think through this problem step by step based on general knowledge and best practices in project management and organizational development.

So, the question is about how a company can maintain informal project management during periods of corporate growth. Hmm, that's interesting because typically as companies grow, they tend to formalize their processes to handle increased complexity and scale. However, there might be advantages to maintaining some level of informality, such as flexibility and agility. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what is meant by "informal project management." Informal project management likely refers to a more flexible, less structured approach to managing projects, possibly involving fewer formal procedures, less bureaucracy, and more reliance on communication and trust among team members. This can be contrasted with formal project management, which often involves standardized methodologies, defined processes, and strict adherence to protocols and documentation.

Now, during periods of corporate growth, companies often face several challenges that might necessitate more structure:

1. **Increased Complexity:** More projects, larger teams, and broader objectives can make things complicated quickly.

2. **Scalability Issues:** What works for a small team may not work as the team grows.

3. **Communication Breakdowns:** As the organization expands, communication can become less efficient without proper channels and protocols.

4. **Resource Allocation:** Managing resources effectively becomes more challenging with growth.

5. **Consistency and Quality Control:** Ensuring that projects meet certain standards across the board.

Given these challenges, how can a company maintain the benefits of informal project management while addressing these issues? Let's consider some strategies.

**1. Hybrid Approach:**

Perhaps the company can adopt a hybrid model that combines elements of formal and informal project management. For example, they could keep the overall framework flexible but introduce some standard practices where necessary. This way, they can retain the agility of informal methods while gaining the benefits of structure in key areas.

**2. Empowerment and Trust:**

Continue to empower team members and foster a culture of trust. In informal settings, trust is crucial because there are fewer checks and balances. As the company grows, it's important to scale this trust by hiring the right people and providing them with the autonomy to make decisions.

**3. Clear Goals and Objectives:**

Ensure that there are clear, well-communicated goals and objectives for each project. Even in an informal setting, having a北向明确的方向是非常重要的。这可以帮助团队成员理解他们的工作如何与公司的整体目标相契合，从而自发地朝着共同的目标努力。

**4. Regular Check-ins:**

Implement regular check-ins or stand-up meetings to keep track of progress and address any issues promptly. This can help maintain transparency and ensure that everyone is on the same page without resorting to heavy bureaucracy.

**5. Agile Methodologies:**

Consider adopting agile methodologies, which are designed to be flexible and responsive to change. Agile approaches emphasize iterative development, continuous feedback, and adaptability—qualities that align well with informal project management.

**6. Cross-Functional Teams:**

Form cross-functional teams that bring together individuals from different departments to work on projects. This can foster collaboration and reduce silos, which is beneficial in both formal and informal settings.

**7. Simple Tools and Processes:**

Use simple tools and processes that don't add unnecessary overhead. The goal is to support project management without complicating it. For example, using project management software that is user-friendly and integrates well with existing workflows.

**8. Training and Development:**

Invest in training and development for project managers and team members. As the company grows, people need to acquire new skills to handle more complex projects and larger teams.

**9. Flexibility in Roles:**

Maintain flexibility in roles and responsibilities. In informal settings, team members often wear multiple hats and adapt to changing needs. Encouraging this flexibility can help the organization remain agile even as it grows.

**10. Continuous Improvement:**

Foster a culture of continuous improvement, where the project management approach is regularly reviewed and adjusted based on what's working and what's not. This ensures that the company doesn't become complacent and continues to optimize its processes.

Now, let's think about potential pitfalls to avoid.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**

- **Overcomplicating Processes:** Adding too much structure can stifle creativity and slow down decision-making.

- **Lack of Standardization:** Without some level of standardization, it can be difficult to measure performance and ensure consistency across projects.

- **Poor Communication:** As the company grows, communication can break down if not managed properly. This can lead to misalignments and mistakes.

- **Inadequate Resource Management:** Without proper planning, resources may be allocated inefficiently, leading to bottlenecks and delays.

- **Loss of Company Culture:** Rapid growth can dilute the company's culture, which may have been a strength in its informal project management approach.

To mitigate these risks, the company needs to strike a balance between maintaining the benefits of informality and introducing necessary structures to support growth.

Let me try to summarize this.

**Summary:**

Maintaining informal project management during corporate growth requires a thoughtful approach that balances flexibility with structure. By adopting a hybrid model, empowering teams, setting clear goals, implementing regular check-ins, using agile methodologies, forming cross-functional teams, employing simple tools, investing in training, maintaining flexible roles, and fostering continuous improvement, companies can retain the advantages of informal project management while addressing the challenges that come with growth.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Implement a hybrid project management approach that combines elements of formal and informal methods, focusing on empowerment, clear goals, regular communication, agile practices, cross-functional teamwork, simple tools, training, flexible roles, and continuous improvement to maintain agility and efficiency during corporate growth.}} \]
