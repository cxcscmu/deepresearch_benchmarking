Alright, I've got this question: "What did the resistances to imperialism in Africa and India have in common?" Okay, so I need to compare the ways that people in Africa and India pushed back against imperialist powers, mostly European countries that were colonizing these regions. I don't remember a lot about this off the top of my head, so I think I need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I should probably understand what imperialism is. Imperialism refers to the policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of proxy states, or indirect control over other areas. So, in the context of Africa and India, we're talking about European powers like Britain, France, Belgium, and others establishing control over these regions.

Now, resistances to imperialism would be the efforts by the local populations to oppose this control, whether through political means, violence, or other forms of protest. I know that both Africa and India had various movements against colonial rule, but I need to find out what they share in common.

Maybe I should start by looking at some key resistance movements in India and Africa. For India, the Indian National Congress comes to mind, which played a significant role in the independence movement against British rule. In Africa, there were numerous resistances across different countries, like the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya against British colonialism, or the Algerian War of Independence against France.

So, one commonality might be that both India and various African countries were under British or French rule, and thus their resistances were against similar imperial powers. But I think there's more to it than that.

Perhaps I should consider the methods of resistance. Did both India and Africa use non-violent protests, violent uprisings, or a combination of both? I recall that India's movement, led by Gandhi, was largely non-violent, but there were also more militant factions. In Africa, there seemed to be a mix of strategies as well, with some movements opting for violence and others trying peaceful protests.

Another possible commonality could be the role of nationalism. In both cases, resistance movements were fighting for national sovereignty and self-rule. The idea of nationalism—of people identifying with a shared culture, history, and territory—was central to these movements.

Religion might also have played a role in both resistances. In India, Hinduism was a unifying factor for many Indians against British rule, although there were also Muslim leaders involved. In Africa, particularly in places like Sudan, religious leaders led resistances against colonial powers.

Economic factors could be another link. Imperialism often involved exploiting the colonies' resources and imposing economic systems that benefited the colonizers. Resistance movements in both India and Africa likely protested against these exploitative practices and sought economic autonomy.

International support or lack thereof could also be a common element. Both India and many African countries may have looked for support from other nations or international organizations to aid their causes, especially as the concept of decolonization gained momentum after World War II.

Let me try to organize my thoughts. So far, I've considered:

1. Common adversaries (British, French, etc.).

2. Methods of resistance (non-violent vs. violent).

3. Nationalism as a unifying force.

4. Role of religion in mobilizing resistance.

5. Economic exploitation as a catalyst for resistance.

6. Seeking international support.

I need to see which of these hold true for both India and Africa and to what extent.

Maybe I should look up specific examples to see how these factors played out.

Let me start with India.

India was under British rule for nearly two centuries, and the resistance movement gained momentum in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Key figures like Mahatma Gandhi promoted non-violent civil disobedience, which had a massive impact. However, there were also revolutionary movements that advocated for armed struggle.

In Africa, the situation was a bit different. Africa was colonized mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in what's known as the Scramble for Africa. Resistances varied greatly across the continent, from the Mahdist Revolution in Sudan against the British and Egyptians, to the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya against British rule, to the Algerian War of Independence against France.

So, one difference is the timing and the specific colonial powers involved. But despite these differences, there might be underlying similarities in the nature of the resistances.

Let me consider the role of nationalism again. In India, nationalism was a powerful force, with Indians from different regions and backgrounds uniting under the banner of independence. Similarly, in Africa, despite the continent's diversity, there were pan-African movements that promoted unity against colonial rule. For example, the Pan-African Congresses in the early 20th century brought together activists from across Africa and the diaspora to fight for African freedom and dignity.

So, nationalism, or a sense of collective identity against the colonial power, seems to be a common thread.

Religion also played a role in both contexts. In India, Hindu nationalism was a significant aspect of the resistance, especially with organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In Africa, religious leaders often played key roles in mobilizing resistance. For instance, in Sudan, Muhammad Ahmad, the Mahdi, led a successful uprising against Anglo-Egyptian rule. In Nigeria, Islamic reformer Usman dan Fodio led a jihad that established the Sokoto Caliphate, which resisted British incursions.

So, religion as a mobilizing force seems to be another commonality.

Economically, both India and Africa suffered under colonial exploitation. In India, the British drained wealth and resources, leading to famines and economic stagnation. In Africa, colonial powers exploited natural resources and imposed cash crop economies that disrupted traditional livelihoods. Resistance movements in both places criticized these economic policies and sought control over their own resources.

Furthermore, both India and African countries looked to international forums and other nations for support in their struggles. India, for example, participated in the Non-Aligned Movement, which aimed to stay out of the Cold War politics between the US and the USSR while pursuing independence from colonial powers. Many African countries also joined this movement.

Additionally, both India and Africa faced the challenge of dividing colonial-era boundaries that didn't always correspond to ethnic or national identities. This led to internal conflicts in addition to external resistances.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should consider the nature of colonial rule itself. In both India and Africa, colonial powers implemented divide-and-rule strategies, pitting different groups against each other to maintain control. Resistance movements often had to overcome these divisions to present a united front.

For example, in India, the British used the policy of divide and rule between Hindus and Muslims, which eventually led to the partition of India and Pakistan. In Africa, colonial administrators often exploited ethnic and tribal differences to maintain control.

So, overcoming divisions imposed by colonial powers was a challenge shared by resistances in both India and Africa.

Moreover, both India and Africa saw the emergence of influential leaders who became symbols of resistance and independence. Gandhi in India, Nkrumah in Ghana, Kenyatta in Kenya, Mandela in South Africa, and many others.

These leaders often employed similar tactics, such as advocating for civil rights, organizing mass protests, and seeking international attention to their causes.

Education also played a role in both resistances. The spread of education among the local elites in India and Africa exposed them to ideas of liberty, democracy, and self-rule, which fueled their resistance against colonial authorities.

Media and propaganda were other tools used by resistance movements in both India and Africa to mobilize public opinion and counter the narratives put forth by colonial powers.

Legal challenges and petitions were also employed in some cases to push for greater rights and autonomy.

However, it's important to note that the resistances in India and Africa weren't uniform. India had a more centralized nationalist movement, whereas in Africa, resistances were often localized or regional, reflecting the diverse nature of the continent.

But despite these differences, there are overarching similarities in the strategies and motivations behind the resistances.

Let me try to summarize what I've gathered.

Commonalities between resistances to imperialism in Africa and India:

1. Nationalism: Both saw the rise of nationalist sentiments and movements aimed at achieving independence and self-governance.

2. Methods of resistance: A mix of non-violent protests and violent uprisings, depending on the context and leadership.

3. Role of religion: Religion served as a mobilizing force in many resistance movements in both regions.

4. Economic exploitation: Resistance was fueled by opposition to colonial economic policies that benefited the imperial powers at the expense of local populations.

5. Overcoming divisions: Both had to deal with divisions imposed by colonial powers and work towards unity in their resistance efforts.

6. Influence of education and ideas: Exposure to Western education and ideas about liberty and self-determination inspired resistance leaders and activists.

7. International support: Both sought support from international communities and other nations in their struggles for independence.

Given these points, I can conclude that the resistances to imperialism in Africa and India shared several fundamental aspects, primarily driven by a desire for self-rule, resistance against economic exploitation, and the utilization of both peaceful and militant strategies to achieve their goals.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Nationalism, a mix of resistance methods, religious influence, opposition to economic exploitation, overcoming divisions, educational influence, and seeking international support were common in resistances to imperialism in Africa and India.}}\]
