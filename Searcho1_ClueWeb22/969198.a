As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience or emotions, but I can provide information based on research and existing knowledge about how new police officers enter the police subculture.

First, I need to understand what is meant by "police subculture." A subculture is a group of people within a larger culture who share specific norms, values, and behaviors that distinguish them from the broader society. In the context of policing, the police subculture refers to the unique set of beliefs, attitudes, and practices that develop among police officers as a result of their shared experiences and the nature of their work.

So, when new police officers join this profession, they have to adapt to this distinct subculture. I imagine this process involves several stages and influences.

Let me consider the training phase. Most police officers undergo formal training at a police academy or similar institution. This training not only provides them with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties but also introduces them to the police culture. During this time, they learn about the history of policing, the code of conduct, and the importance of teamwork and loyalty within the force. This foundational period likely plays a crucial role in socializing new officers into the subculture.

After completing their training, officers are assigned to field training where they work under the guidance of experienced officers. This period is often critical for acculturation, as new officers observe and emulate the behaviors and attitudes of their mentors. The relationships formed during this time can significantly influence their understanding and adoption of the police subculture.

Additionally, the day-to-day interactions with colleagues, the challenges faced on the job, and the support systems within the department all contribute to the integration of new officers into the subculture. Peer influence is probably a significant factor, as officers spend a lot of time together and rely on each other for support and advice.

It's also important to consider the organizational structure and policies of the police department. The formal rules and informal norms set by the department can shape the behavior and attitudes of its members. For example, if the department emphasizes community policing and transparency, new officers are likely to adopt these values.

Moreover, external factors such as public perception, media portrayal of police, and legal regulations can impact the police subculture and how new officers perceive and adapt to it.

I should also think about the psychological aspects. Joining any profession that involves high stress and potential danger can lead to the development of certain coping mechanisms and bonding experiences that strengthen the subculture. New officers may go through initiation rites or experiences that test their commitment and resilience, further integrating them into the group.

It might be useful to look at some research or literature on this topic to get a more accurate understanding. Maybe there are studies or books that explore the socialization process of new police officers.

Let me consider conducting a search to find more information on this subject.

Part three of The New Leader series The Arc of Justice: Examining the Failures of the Criminal Justice System and the Hope of Progressive Reforms
The occupational culture of policing has been a popular topic of debate, public scrutiny, and scholarly research for the past fifty years. It is not significant that policing has a unique culture — all professions and workplaces do — but the impact and consequences of police subculture are incredibly significant, not only for those who work in or come into contact with the criminal legal system, but for all of us. Broadly defined, culture refers to the shared norms, values, and beliefs of a group of people. Culture is how police officers, and any other group, make sense of their world and their role in it. Attitudes and beliefs about police work and the role of the police officer, whether held by individual officers or shared among an entire department, directly influence police officer discretion, decisions, and behavior. Police culture impacts how they interact with the citizens they encounter, whether or not they issue a warning or make an arrest, how they respond to a fleeing suspect, how they write an arrest report to justify certain actions, and whether or not they will lie under oath.
Culture is expressed and can be viewed externally through symbols, images, clothing, behaviors, rituals, and tools. For example, the “occupying soldier” narrative shared among officers is a key component of police culture that is readily on display through the increased militarization of police tactics, tools, and uniforms. The traditional police culture has been, and continues to be, defined by several key beliefs and assumptions about police work: danger and risk, authority and the use of force, solidarity and isolation, power and masculinity. The emphasis on crime fighting, guns, and violence is reflected in recruitment posters, on t-shirts, and by the media. This focus on hypermasculinity is problematic because the majority of police work is fairly routine: order maintenance, traffic control, and community problem-solving. Approximately 70% of officers will resign or retire from the force without ever shooting their firearm s, but police academies across the country continue to place considerably more time and emphasis on firearms training than on de-escalation tactics or problem-solving skills.
Policing holds a unique position in society as the only occupation legally allowed, and even expected, to use lethal force. They are street-level bureaucrats, and for many people, the most visible arm of the government, and one that represents authority, control, and power. The role law enforcement plays in maintaining order and enforcing laws sets them apart from many other occupations (though there is much that police could learn from other regulatory agencies) and bolsters a culture in which an “us v them” mentality often develops. The majority of officers enter the profession wishing to help people and have a positive impact in their communities, but through experience and cultural indoctrination, they begin to view the public they serve not as community partners and fellow citizens, but as enemies. This is expressed in many ways, including the thin blue line or blue wall of silence, behind which officers rally and protect each other, maintain secrecy and solidarity, and distance themselves from the public. There are positive elements of police culture, of course, such as the emphasis on doing good, meaningful, and purposeful police work. The occupational culture of policing also gives officers a sense of camaraderie and support, and provides coping mechanisms for dealing with a job full of stress, conflict, and contradictions.
The visibility of police work has increased through the use of body cameras, cell phone videos, and social media, yet the public largely feels that police accountability has not changed accordingly. Incidents of police misconduct and uses of excessive or unnecessary force dominate news headlines, and for good reason, but the public and the police think very differently about them, exemplifying a disconnect and increasing lack of understanding between police and communities. Surveys by Pew Research Center show that while ⅔ of police officers view fatal police shootings of black citizens as isolated incidents, 60% of the American public considers them to be evidence of deeper, widespread problems and biases in policing. Similarly, police officers are critical of the protests and demonstrations that often follow publicized shootings, viewing them as simply “anti-police” and not as legitimate calls for necessary police and community reforms.
Despite increasingly diverse police forces, the advent of problem-oriented policing, and efforts to implement community policing and build police-community relations, aspects of the traditional police culture remain entrenched. For example, female officers continue to buy-in to expectations of masculinity and power that dominate the organizational culture of most agencies. Yet, it is imperative to understand that traditional police culture is changing, albeit slowly, and that at no point in time has it been monolithic. Adherence to sexist attitudes about police work, the code of silence, or the use of force, for instance, differs greatly among individual officers, units, and agencies.
Though scholars and critics have been lamenting police culture for decades, long-lasting change is possible, and essential. UK criminologist Sarah Charman described the results of some her research in a recent article for The Conversation, noting how there is a “new breed” of officers entering the ranks that still value solidarity, but also integrity and compassion. The generation of young adults entering policing today are not as willing to lie or cover-up for others’ mistakes, and are concerned with a healthy work-life balance, i.e. maintaining a social life outside of the police force that prevents them from being too far ingrained into a potentially toxic occupational culture. Charman anticipates that “cultural sedimentation” will slowly occur as values such as compassion and integrity begin to outweigh cynicism and the code of silence. But it is not necessary to wait for generational turnover. Drastic agency changes, as were made in Camden, NJ, can quickly begin to transform police-community relations. In 2012, the police department in Camden was completely disbanded, and a new county-level agency formed, with more officers, better technology, and an emphasis on community policing. What was once the most dangerous city in the country has since increased the public trust and safety and decreased crime rates by putting officers on foot patrol and engaging with community members.
Policing, like many of our social institutions today, is at a boiling point. Cultural evolution is inevitable, and no matter how broken police-community relations may appear to be, social pressures and community expectations will lead to change, though the pace and consistency will vary from one jurisdiction to the next and from one officer to another, just as current policies and practices do.

Answer:
Check explanation
Explanation:
Before delving into the solution to the question let us take some important definitions.
What is subculture?
Subculture is a culture practice within some group of individuals that have their having beliefs or at variance with those of the larger culture.
What is Police subculture?
Police subculture is the beliefs and behaviours associated with law enforcing agencies, police in this aspect.
Ok, all that being said, is it so difficult for police officers to avoid getting caught up in the subculture because of their view on public. Since the police deal/fight with Crime almost everyday, they tend to view the public as ''untrustworthy'' and ignorant, so they have to look up to their mates for support. Also, because of the purpose of acceptance. After recruits are done with their training, in order to be accepted into the ''real police work', many that are not strong willed will have to join the subculture.
Police subculture can be divided into patrol subculture and adminstrative subculture.

Review
“Charman has produced an impressive book on the early years of new police officers - motivated to make a difference - which is well researched, interesting and opportune. She traces their development encountering a demanding profession and an institution in flux. They enjoy the work and camaraderie but face the dilemmas of front-line policing in a dangerously under resourced institution: they are constantly stretched and miss back up while around them is frustration, stress and demoralization. This book deserves a wide reading from students, academics and serving officers but especially - before the wheel seriously comes off - by policy makers and politicians.” (Maurice Punch, Senior Visiting Fellow, London School of Economics, UK)
“What is known as police culture has long been seen as immutable, unchanging and reactionary. This notion, hung on ideas from some fifty years ago and often repeated, is challenged here with new and imaginative research. Change is emergent in data drawn from a four year panel study of English constables. Worried about their job security, troubled by dealing with missing persons and the mentally ill, they remain committed to communication as their tool; compassion and empathy as their guiding stars, and somewhat dubious about “law enforcement” as their primary mandate. The work suggests that “police culture” is more a loose configuration of ideas than a thing. This is an important, well-written and argued book.” (Peter K. Manning, Elmer V.H, and Eileen M. Brooks Professor of Criminal justice and Criminology, Northeastern University Boston, Massachusetts, USA)
“Analysing data from a four year longitudinal study in which quantitative and qualitative data were gathered, Sarah Charman has charted the socialisation of police officers in an English constabulary.  New insights into their understandings of policing and key questions about the resistance of the occupational culture to change are explained clearly.  This is a mu
ch needed book that will be acknowledged by criminology’s research community and take a prominent place on student reading lists.” (Simon Holdaway, Professor of Criminology, Nottingham Trent University and Professor Emeritus of Criminology and Sociology, The University of Sheffield, UK)

Alright, I've got some information from the search results. Let's see what I can gather about how new police officers enter the police subculture.

From Doc 1, which seems to be a set of multiple-choice questions about police subculture, I can see that the process involves socialization. Question 1 asks, "How do police officers enter the police subculture?" and the correct answer is C) They are socialized into the subculture. So, socialization is key here.

Doc 2 is an article from Medium titled "Police Culture Now, But not Forever" by Jace Valcore. It discusses the concept of police culture and how it's been a subject of debate and research for decades. It mentions that police culture is defined by beliefs about danger, authority, solidarity, and power. The article also notes that while there are positive aspects like camaraderie and support, there are negative elements like an "us vs. them" mentality and a blue wall of silence.

The author points out that despite the visibility of police work increasing, there's still a disconnect between police and the public, especially regarding incidents of police misconduct and use of force. However, the article also suggests that police culture is changing, with a "new breed" of officers valuing integrity and compassion more than previous generations.

Doc 3 appears to be flashcards for Chapter 6 of a textbook, likely on criminal justice or policing. It includes terms like socialization into police subculture starting with recruit training and that police subculture in the US is unlikely to change from within the department. There's also mention of types of police corruption, use of force, and recruiting educated officers.

Doc 4 is a question from Brainly asking why it's difficult for police officers to avoid getting caught up in the subculture, with the answer mentioning the view of the public and the need for acceptance among peers.

Lastly, Doc 5 is a book on Amazon about police socialization, identity, and culture, which seems to present research on how new police officers develop within the culture, referring to themselves as a "new breed."

So, synthesizing this information, it seems that new police officers enter the police subculture through a process of socialization that begins with recruit training. This socialization involves adopting the shared norms, values, and beliefs of the police profession, which can include both positive aspects like teamwork and support, and negative aspects like a us-versus-them mentality and a code of silence.

The socialization process continues beyond initial training, during field assignments where new officers learn from experienced ones. Peer influence plays a significant role, as does the organizational structure and the department's culture.

However, there's also indication that police culture is evolving, particularly with newer generations of officers bringing different values and perspectives. This suggests that while socialization into the traditional subculture is influential, there's potential for change and development towards a more progressive police culture.

In conclusion, new police officers enter the police subculture through a socialization process that starts with training and continues through their career, influenced by peers, organizational culture, and evolving societal expectations.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{New police officers enter the police subculture through a socialization process that begins with training and continues through their career, influenced by peers, organizational culture, and evolving societal expectations.}} \]
