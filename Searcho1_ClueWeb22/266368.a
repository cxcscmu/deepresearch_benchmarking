As an AI assistant, I'm here to help answer your question about whether vaccines are safe based on research. This is an important topic, and it's crucial to approach it with careful consideration and evidence-based information. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what vaccines are and how they work. Vaccines are biological preparations that improve immunity to a particular disease. They typically contain agents resembling disease-causing microorganisms, which stimulate the body's immune system to recognize them and develop adaptive immunity, memory T cells, and B cells, or heightened immune sensitivity to these foreign invaders. This way, if the actual pathogen enters the body in the future, the immune system is already prepared to fight it off, preventing the disease from developing or lessening its severity.

Now, regarding safety, it's essential to look at the scientific research and studies that have been conducted on vaccines. I recall that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and trials before they are approved for public use. There are several stages of clinical trials where the vaccine's safety and efficacy are evaluated in a controlled environment. These trials involve thousands of participants and are monitored by regulatory agencies such as the FDA in the United States or the EMA in Europe.

But I should verify this information. Maybe I can look up how vaccines are approved and what the process entails. That would give me a better understanding of the safety measures in place.

Tracking Side Effects Once a Vaccine is Adminstered
This page leads to other pages that describe vaccine development and testing such as basic research, clinical studies, side effects and adverse reactions, vaccines of the future, and the vaccine product approval process.
Development of New Vaccines
The general stages of the development cycle of a vaccine are:
Exploratory stage
Pre-clinical stage
Clinical development
Regulatory review and approval
Manufacturing
Quality control
Clinical development is a three-phase process. During Phase I, small groups of people receive the trial vaccine. In Phase II, the clinical study is expanded and vaccine is given to people who have characteristics (such as age and physical health) similar to those for whom the new vaccine is intended. In Phase III, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety.
Many vaccines undergo Phase IV formal, ongoing studies after the vaccine is approved and licensed.
For more information and to find out about new vaccines on the horizon, see the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Development of New Vaccines web page.
Vaccine Product Approval Process
Journey of a New Vaccine: From Development to Licensed for Use
See how a new vaccine is developed, approved, manufactured, added to recommended schedule, and is continually monitored.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is responsible for regulating vaccines in the United States.
The sponsor of a new vaccine product follows a multi-step approval process, which typically includes
An Investigational New Drug application
Pre-licensure vaccine clinical trials
A Biologics License Application (BLA)
Inspection of the manufacturing facility
Presentation of findings to FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee

(VRBPAC)
Usability testing of product labeling
After approving a vaccine, FDA continues to oversee its production to ensure continuing safety. Monitoring of the vaccine and of production activities, including periodic facility inspections, must continue as long as the manufacturer holds a license for the vaccine product.
FDA can require a manufacturer submit the results of their own tests for potency, safety, and purity for each vaccine lot. FDA can require each manufacturer submit samples of each vaccine lot for testing.
To learn about FDA’s role in the vaccine approval process, consult FDA’s Vaccine Product Approval Process web page.
Tracking Side Effects Once a Vaccine is Administered
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC.
VAERS collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events (side effects) that occur after the administration of US licensed vaccines. Reports are welcome from all concerned individuals: patients, parents, healthcare providers, pharmacists, and vaccine manufacturers. To submit a report, use VAERS’ reporting page.
For more information on VAERS, consult VAERS website.

Further information
Medsafe evaluates applications for all new medicines, including vaccines, to ensure that they 
			comply with international standards and local requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. Only 
			if the medicine meets these standards will Medsafe recommend approval for use in New Zealand. More information about 
			the medicines approval process.
Due to the ongoing pandemic, there is an urgent clinical need for safe and effective vaccines 
			to protect New Zealanders against COVID-19. To meet this need, Medsafe will be streamlining 
			assessment processes and prioritising the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines over other medicines to 
			obtain a vaccine more quickly – as described below. However, we will not compromise on the 
			integrity of the process or on the safety of the vaccine.
Communicating with pharmaceutical companies
Medsafe is in regular communication with pharmaceutical companies to gather information on the 
			COVID-19 vaccines under development and to discuss their plans for submitting vaccine applications. 
			This regular communication means that we can prepare for incoming vaccine applications and ensures 
			that companies submit applications in a consistent way.
Rolling applications
Medsafe is allowing pharmaceutical companies to make rolling applications for COVID-19 vaccines.
Normally a standard New Medicine Application contains all the required information in a single 
			package (dossier). Medsafe’s evaluation starts once the full dossier has been submitted (see Figure 1). More information about New 
			Medicine Application evaluation timeframes.
A rolling application allows companies to submit different sections of the dossier to Medsafe as 
			soon as the data becomes available (Figure 1). For example, companies may provide data about the 
			manufacture of their vaccine to Medsafe before the initial clinical trial results are available. We 
			will evaluate each section as it is received, meaning that we may be able to make a final 
			recommendation much sooner than with the standard application process.
Figure 1: The standard new medicine application and evaluation process and the COVID-19 
			vaccine rolling application and evaluation process
* Evaluation includes the time spent by Medsafe reviewing data and the time taken by companies 
			responding to Medsafe’s requests for further information. For COVID-19 vaccines, evaluation may also 
			include requests for advice from the COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group and referral to the Medicines 
			Assessment Advisory Committee (see below).
Abbreviated evaluation pathway
Medsafe has an abbreviated evaluation pathway in which review of overseas regulatory evaluation 
			reports forms the basis of the evaluation. Companies may choose to use the abbreviated evaluation pathway 
			for their COVID-19 vaccines.
The abbreviated evaluation pathway shortens evaluation times but depends on the availability of 
			overseas evaluation reports. If a comparable rolling application process is followed in both New Zealand 
			and another country, companies may be able to use a rolling abbreviated pathway.
Medsafe is also working closely with other medicines regulators and is involved in international 
			collaborative initiatives to ensure a consistent approach to COVID-19 vaccine evaluation.
Priority review
Medicine applications that have been accepted for priority review are processed earlier than normal 
			applications.
So long as an urgent clinical need for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines remains, these applications 
			will be granted priority review status. This means that we can make recommendations about COVID-19 
			vaccines sooner than if they were evaluated under the normal process.
Seeking expert advice
Medsafe staff have the knowledge and experience needed to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of 
			a broad range of medicine types. However, COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly developed and many use novel 
			technologies not used in any other approved vaccines. To ensure that we make scientifically sound decisions, 
			we will seek advice from the COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group and may also refer vaccines to the Medicines 
			Assessment Advisory Committee.
COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group
This advisory group is composed of experts in a range of relevant fields who will advise Medsafe on 
			specific questions raised during the COVID-19 vaccine application evaluations. This advice will be provided 
			in parallel with Medsafe’s evaluation and will not delay the application process.
Medicines Assessment Advisory Committee (MAAC)
Medsafe can also refer COVID-19 vaccines to the MAAC for a final recommendation about approval. The MAAC 
			will consider any COVID-19 vaccines referred to them under urgency. More 
			information on the MAAC.
Decision on approval
Once we have completed the vaccine evaluation process, and following possible consideration by the MAAC, 
			we will make a recommendation about vaccine approval. Only if the vaccine meets internationally agreed 
			criteria for safety and efficacy will we recommend approval for use (consent).
If consent can be granted, this will either be full consent under section 20 of the Medicines Act 1981 or provisional consent under 
			section 23. We expect that most vaccines will be granted provisional consent because data to support the 
			longer-term safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines is not yet available.
Provisional consent allows conditions to be imposed on the vaccine, restricting its use by healthcare 
			professionals according to the data available at the time of approval. Provisional consent was included in the 
			Medicines Act to allow New Zealand patients to have early access to medicines with a significant unmet 
			clinical need.
Post-approval safety monitoring
Medsafe uses a variety of methods to collect information on the safety and quality of medicines and vaccines 
			after they have been approved.

How Does FDA Approve Vaccines?

How Does FDA Approve Vaccines?

Three vaccines developed to prevent COVID-19 infections received emergency use authorization earlier this year, allowing nearly half the U.S. population to be fully vaccinated against the virus.
But while much of the population remains skeptical of vaccination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working to fully approve, or license, the three vaccines.
Some experts say that this approval, which is a much longer and more complicated process, may encourage some skeptics to get vaccinated.
"We recognize that for some, the FDA approval of COVID-19 vaccines may bring additional confidence and encourage them to get vaccinated," Dr. Peter Marks, the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, told VOA via email.
But experts have said repeatedly that the three vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — had been declared safe and effective before they were authorized for emergency use.
"The full approval process has less to do with getting additional scientific evidence and more to do with some of the logistics," said Dr. David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. He told VOA the process included steps such as specifying the labeling of the vaccine and the specific wording on packaging.
Currently, Pfizer and Moderna have each filed a biologics license application (BLA) — the last step to full approval — with the FDA. Johnson & Johnson said in a statement released earlier this year that it would apply "later in 2021."

What is the normal FDA licensing process for vaccines?
After a vaccine is developed, drugmakers usually test them on animals and tissue samples in preclinical trials.
Once a vaccine passes these pretrials, it undergoes three phases of clinical trials in humans, each trial with an increased number of participants. During this monthslong period, FDA officials will monitor the progress of the trials, observe the vaccine's long-term efficacy and look for rare side effects.
Only after these trials are completed can a drug company submit a biologics license application, the formal and final approval process for a vaccine.
Once this application is submitted, the FDA will review all information from the clinical trials and inspect every facility where the vaccine is made to ensure everything is in order.
FILE - Signage sits outside the Food and Drug Administration headquarters in White Oak, Md., Aug. 29, 2020.
How will the process for the COVID-19 vaccines be different?
Three COVID-19 vaccines have already been widely used throughout the U.S. and the world because they were given emergency use authorization.
Still, all vaccines must go through the process of full licensing, which can take years. The FDA has not specified how long this process will take but has said that the COVID-19 vaccines are being given "priority review."
"Acknowledging the urgency related to the current state of the pandemic, we have taken an all-hands-on-deck approach, including identifying additional resources, such as personnel and technological resources from across the agency, and opportunities to reprioritize other activities, in order to complete our review to help combat this pandemic surge," Marks said.
The FDA clarified that a "priority review designation" means it aims to fully license vaccines within six months of an application being filed, as opposed to the standard 10 months.
According to Dowdy, the only differences between licensing a COVID-19 vaccine versus previous vaccines will involve speed and manpower. Dowdy likened the process to getting a passport, saying that while passport processing can take months because of the volume of applications, people can apply to expedite the process. This does not make the process less rigorous; it just means that a certain application is moved to the front of the line.
"We're not giving these vaccines a free pass just because they're being manufactured in the midst of a pandemic. The goal is to try and expedite these processes as much as possible," he said.
How is emergency use authorization different?
Three COVID-19 vaccines were granted emergency use authorization earlier this year. Such approval requires the same scientific evidence and number of clinical trials proving the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, but it skips some steps and technicalities concerning labeling and distribution.
"Although an authorization is not an FDA approval, the FDA conducted a thorough scientific evaluation of each of the authorized vaccines and can assure the public and medical community that the vaccines meet FDA's rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality," an FDA official told VOA via email.
Experts stress that millions of people have received the vaccines and that data continue to support their safety and effectiveness against the coronavirus.

Review Tracks FDA Vaccine-Approval Process Over Last Decade
Published December 10, 2020

Review Tracks FDA Vaccine-Approval Process Over Last Decade
By staff
With the race to create a safe and effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19, concerns have been raised about the process with which the FDA approves new vaccines for use in the United States.
That’s why researchers recently evaluated all new vaccines approved by FDA over the last decade. The research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine focused on premarket development and regulatory review times, the clinical evidence on which approval was based, and the size and follow-up duration of the prelicensure safety database.
The authors from the Yale University School of Medicine point to recent surveys showing that more than one-half of Americans are hesitant about receiving a potential COVID-19 vaccine because of concerns about adverse effects or lack of effectiveness. “There is also concern that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) might authorize a vaccine prematurely,” they add.
For the study, investigators identified all original biologics licensing applications (BLAs) for vaccines approved by the FDA between January 2010 and June 2020, excluding supplemental approvals of existing vaccines. Then, using publicly available FDA documents, the study team identified three regulatory dates for each vaccine: investigational new drug submission (when human testing can begin), BLA submission, and FDA approval.
In addition, researchers identified all trials that provided safety and efficacy evidence for approval, characterizing them by study purpose and number of patients. After that, they identified all pivotal efficacy trials and determined the use of randomization, masking, comparator group, and primary endpoint using methods described previously.
Focusing on pivotal efficacy trials using a clinical primary endpoint, the team collected vaccine efficacy, estimated the total number of patients in the prelicensure safety database, and determined the longest duration of follow-up for serious adverse events among all trials included in the safety database.
The report advises that the FDA approved 21 vaccines between January 2010 and June 2020. Most were for influenza (five [23.8%]) and meningococcus (five [23.8%]). Of these, four (19.0%) received Accelerated Approval.
The authors point out that “the median premarket clinical development period (investigational new drug submission to FDA approval) was 8.1 (interquartile range [IQR], 6.1-10.5) years, including a median FDA review period (BLA submission to FDA approval) of 12.0 (10.8-21.0) months.”
The review further documents that each vaccine approval was supported by a median total of seven (IQR, 5-13) clinical trials, including two (IQR, 1-3) pivotal efficacy trials and one (IQR, 1-1) trial considered essential to establishing lot-to-lot consistency. The trials had a median number of participants in the prelicensure safety database of 6,710 (IQR, 4576-15?997), with a median follow-up for serious adverse events of 6 months (IQR, 6-12).
“The median aggregated number of patients enrolled among all pivotal efficacy trials supporting a given vaccine approval was 4961 (IQR, 3537-7775),” the researchers further recount. “All 21 vaccines were approved based on at least 1 randomized pivotal efficacy trial and 14 (66.7%) based on at least 2 pivotal efficacy trials. Among the 21 vaccines, 17 (81.0%) had at least 1 pivotal efficacy trial that used masking, 20 (95.2%) that used an active or placebo comparator group, and 8 (38.1%) approved based on a clinical primary end point; of these, the median vaccine efficacy was 91.9% (IQR, 79.6%-98.0%).”
They add that, among the five vaccines for diseases for which no FDA-approved vaccine existed at time of approval, four (80%) used a clinical primary endpoint.
“Since 2010, most novel vaccines approved by the FDA required about 8 years of clinical development and were based on evidence from a median of 7 clinical trials, including at least 2 pivotal efficacy trials that were randomized, masked, and used a comparator group,” the authors conclude. “These pivotal efficacy trials enrolled a median of 5,000 patients, who were followed up for serious adverse events for at least 6 months. Given the urgency of developing a COVID-19 vaccine, trials will need to be larger than those supporting prior vaccine approvals and include sufficient follow-up time for emergence of adverse effects.”

How does the FDA approve vaccines?
How does the FDA approve a new vaccine?
The process of getting a vaccine approved for use in the general public is no picnic and can take several years. In the United States, vaccines are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. The FDA works to ensure that all new vaccines on the market are safe, effective, and have minimal side effects by carefully monitoring each stage of testing.
Vaccines must be FDA approved for clinical testing in humans
Vaccines that appear promising in pre-clinical trials, where the vaccine is tested on tissue samples and in animal models, have to be approved for a clinical trial before they can be tested on humans. A sponsor for such a clinical trial must submit an Investigational New Drug application to the FDA, which describes the vaccine, how it’s made, how it’s been tested for quality control, and the protocol the researchers propose for testing the vaccine in humans.
Three phases of clinical trials
If the application is approved, vaccine clinical trials usually happen in three phases. Phase 1 is usually a small trial — 20 to 80 subjects — that’s mostly focused on testing the safety of a vaccine and seeing how strong of an immune response it provokes in humans. During a Phase 2 trial, the vaccine is tested on a larger group of participants, usually several hundred, and different doses of the vaccine are tested to find out which is the most effective. Finally, Phase 3 trials test the vaccine on thousands of people, and include testing the vaccine against a placebo, studying the long-term efficacy of the vaccine, and watching for very rare side effects.
Experts weigh in on efficacy and safety
The FDA monitors the progress of these trials, and will halt trials or request additional information or research if there are any concerns about the vaccine’s safety or effectiveness. If the vaccine completes all three phases of clinical development, the manufacturer must submit a Biologics License Application. This provides the FDA reviewer team, which includes medical, biology and chemistry experts, with all of the safety and efficacy information they need to assess the risks and benefits of the vaccine and to decide whether or not they recommend it be approved. The manufacturing facility also has to be inspected so the FDA can examine the production of the vaccine in detail.
Next, the FDA and the vaccine’s sponsor present their data to the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which is a non-FDA expert committee of scientists and physicians who provide feedback to the FDA on the vaccine.
After approval
Once a vaccine is approved, the FDA continues to oversee its production, with periodic facility inspections and tracking of the quality control performed by the manufacturer. The FDA also maintains the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to report extremely rare health events that may be a result of receiving the vaccine.
This controlled, step-by-step process allows researchers, manufacturers, the FDA, and healthcare providers to work together to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective before they are distributed to the public.

Alright, so from these documents, it seems like vaccines go through a pretty rigorous approval process before they're allowed to be used in the general public. The FDA plays a big role in this, ensuring that vaccines are safe, effective, and have minimal side effects.

Let me try to summarize what I've gathered. First, there's preclinical testing, where vaccines are tested on tissue samples and animals to see if they're safe and effective. If that goes well, the vaccine moves on to clinical trials in humans. These trials are divided into three phases.

Phase 1 is small-scale, with just 20 to 80 participants, mainly to check for safety and see how the immune system responds. Phase 2 is bigger, with several hundred people, and different doses are tested to find the most effective one. Phase 3 is the largest, involving thousands of people, and it compares the vaccine to a placebo to see how well it works in the real world and to catch any rare side effects.

Throughout these phases, the FDA is keeping a close eye on things. They review the data, can stop trials if there are safety concerns, and inspect the manufacturing facilities to make sure everything is up to snuff.

Once all that's done, the vaccine's maker submits a Biologics License Application to the FDA. This is like a big dossier containing all the data from the trials and information about how the vaccine is made. The FDA reviews this with a team of experts, including doctors and scientists.

After that, there's a meeting with an advisory committee of external experts who review the data and give their opinions. Finally, if everything checks out, the FDA approves the vaccine.

But even after approval, the FDA keeps watching. They inspect manufacturing facilities periodically and monitor reports of any adverse events through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system.

That sounds pretty thorough. So, in answer to the question of whether vaccines are safe based on research, it seems like yes, they are. The approval process is designed to weed out any unsafe or ineffective vaccines.

But I should consider that this process can take years, and with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an urgent need for vaccines quickly. So, I wonder how that affected things.

Looking back at the documents, I see that during the pandemic, the FDA has been using something called an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, to make vaccines available faster than the usual approval process allows.

From Document 3, it says that three COVID-19 vaccines received emergency use authorization earlier in the year, allowing nearly half the U.S. population to be fully vaccinated.

But the FDA is also working on fully approving these vaccines through the regular BLA process, which is longer and more thorough.

Dr. Peter Marks from the FDA says that full approval may encourage some skeptics to get vaccinated, but he also notes that the vaccines were already deemed safe and effective before emergency use authorization.

So, even though the emergency process is faster, the vaccines still had to meet safety and efficacy standards.

Document 1 from the CDC also mentions that vaccines undergo rigorous testing and trials before approval, and that regulatory agencies like the FDA oversee this process.

Document 4 is a research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine that looked at all new vaccines approved by the FDA over the last decade. It found that the median premarket clinical development period was about 8 years, with a median FDA review period of 12 months.

Each approval was based on a median of seven clinical trials, including at least two pivotal efficacy trials that were randomized, masked, and used comparator groups.

So, generally, vaccines are well-tested before approval.

But with COVID-19, the process was accelerated. So, how was that done without compromising safety?

I remember reading about Operation Warp Speed, which was an initiative to speed up the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

From what I recall, one way the process was sped up was by overlapping some of the phases. For example, instead of waiting for Phase 1 to completely finish before starting Phase 2, some phases were run concurrently.

Also, because of the urgent need, resources were poured into the development and testing, which helped accelerate the process.

Additionally, since the virus was new, there was a lot of global collaboration and sharing of data, which might have helped speed things up.

But despite the acceleration, the vaccines still had to go through the same levels of testing and meet the same standards for safety and efficacy.

In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines that received emergency use authorization have been shown to be highly effective and have undergone large-scale Phase 3 trials with tens of thousands of participants.

So, in conclusion, based on the research and the approval process, it seems that vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines, are safe.

Of course, no medical intervention is 100% risk-free, but the benefits of vaccination in preventing serious illnesses far outweigh the potential risks for the majority of people.

It's also important to note that ongoing monitoring continues even after approval, as seen with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting system.

So, overall, the evidence suggests that vaccines are safe and effective.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, vaccines are safe based on extensive research and rigorous approval processes.}} \]
