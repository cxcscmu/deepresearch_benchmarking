So I have this question: "Do people like things of memorial significance?" Hmm, that's kind of broad, but I guess it's about whether people have a preference or appreciation for items or places that hold some kind of memory or historical importance.

First off, I need to understand what "memorial significance" means. I think it refers to things that are important because they remind us of something in the past, maybe events, people, or periods in history. So, monuments, artifacts, old letters, that sort of thing.

I guess the question is asking if people generally value these kinds of things. Well, from what I've observed, a lot of people do seem to appreciate history and memorials. For example, museums are popular, and historical sites often attract tourists. People also collect antiques and family heirlooms because they have sentimental value.

But then again, not everyone might feel the same way. Some people might prefer modern things or find old stuff boring. So, maybe it's not universal.

Let me try to think of some specific examples. Like, the Statue of Liberty in New York is a symbol of freedom and a memorial to the friendship between the U.S. and France. Millions of people visit it every year, so that suggests that yes, people do like things with memorial significance.

Another example could be war memorials. Places like the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. attract visitors who come to pay respects and remember those who served. Again, this points to people valuing memorial significance.

On a smaller scale, think about how people keep mementos from their personal lives, like wedding rings, graduation diplomas, or old photographs. These items hold personal memorial significance and are usually treasured.

But maybe I'm biasing myself towards the positive side. Are there instances where people don't like things with memorial significance? For example, some people might find certain memorials controversial or uncomfortable to engage with. Like, a monument dedicated to a historical figure who held problematic views might be contentious in today's society. In such cases, people might not want to associate with that memorial.

Also, in terms of urban development, sometimes there are conflicts between preserving historical buildings and making way for new construction. Some people might prioritize progress over preserving memorial significance.

So, it seems that while many people do appreciate things with memorial significance, there are also instances where this isn't the case.

Maybe it depends on the context and the individual's connection to the memorial. If someone has a personal connection or finds historical value in something, they're more likely to appreciate its memorial significance. Conversely, if it doesn't resonate with them or if it represents something they disagree with, they might not value it as much.

Perhaps it's also cultural. Different cultures have different attitudes towards history and tradition. Some places place a high value on preserving the past, while others are more focused on the future.

Let me see if I can find some data or studies on this. Maybe there are surveys or research that can provide more insight.

Historians on the Confederate Monument Debate
"History is what the present chooses to remember about the past." ~ Carl Becker (AHA President, 1931)
In the wake of the Charlottesville tragedy, historians across the country provided important historical context and insight to the public. The AHA compiled statements that our members, fellow historical societies, AHA Council members, and staff have made in op-eds, interviews, and other media conversations about the importance of historical thinking and knowledge within the current debate. The AHA has also released a statement on how these issues relate to the discipline of history.
This is by no means a full and comprehensive list. Please email Alexandra Levy, Web and Social Media Coordinator, at alevy@historians.org if you have an article, op-ed, interview, etc. that you think should be included in this list.

Monuments to controversial historical figures should remain – Debating Matters
DEBATING MATTERS TOPIC GUIDE
Monuments to controversial historical figures should remain
Updated: March 2021
INTRODUCTION
In June 2020, in a response to the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling by protestors of a statue of Edward Colston [Ref: BBC ], the Mayor of London set up the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm [ref: Wikipedia ]. The aim of this commission is to ensure London’s monuments, plaques and street names reflect the diversity of the city today [ref: London.gov.uk ]. Reviews of statues are being planned in other cities too, including Cardiff, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle [Ref: Sky News ]. Edinburgh City Council has convened a review group to look at public monuments, street or building names which have links to slavery and colonialism [Ref: Edinburgh Evening News ].
The appointment of these commissions is the latest chapter in a long-running debate about historical monuments, with campaigns such as Rhodes Must Fall having argued for some time that such statues and public landmarks are more than just a symbol of past oppression – they represent the institutional racism which continues to exist today [Ref: BBC News ].  ‘Protesters’, says one columnist, are ‘compelling entire nations to confront their present through a new understanding of their past’ [Ref: Guardian ]. Some, however, worry that there is a tendency to ‘cleanse’ history of unsavoury – even appalling – elements. In the words of historian Mary Beard, ‘statues offer different challenges to our view of history … and remind us of our own fragility in the judgement of the future’ [Ref: TLS ]. Others argue that history has now become ‘the most active front in a new culture war’ and that ‘actions are being taken widely and quickly in a way that does not reflect public opinion or growing concern over our treatment of the past’ [ref: Policy Exchange ].
At its heart, the debate is about our relationship with history, and whether removing statues and monuments has a role to play in reappraising historic wrongs, or whether they encourage us to airbrush out difficult and contentious parts of our history, rather than engage with and understand them. But it also a public policy question about who gets to decide whether monuments to controversial figures remain and on what basis such judgement are taken. Do government commissions have the authority to remove controversial monuments?
This section provides a summary of the key issues in the debate, set in the context of recent discussions and the competing positions that have been adopted.
DO HISTORICAL MONUMENTS MATTER?
‘Public statues are intensely political’, [Ref: Spectator] notes writer Martin Gayford. He outlines the nature of public memorials and statues, and observes that over time, our appraisal of individuals changes, for instance as with the thousands of statues of Lenin and Marx brought down after the fall of the former Soviet Union [Ref: Spectator ]. From this perspective, historical monuments do matter as they can be seen as symbols of norms and values we agree to commemorate, as historian Professor Christopher Phelps argues. He says: ‘History is one thing, memorials another. As tributes, memorials are selective, affirmative representations… [they] bestow honour and legitimacy.’ [Ref: Chronicle Review ]. But what changes when a monument is removed? As someone who participated in the removal of Soviet statues reflects: ‘Waging war on bronze men doesn’t make your life any more moral or just.’ [Ref: New York Times]
Thus, the moral value of historical monuments is fiercely contested. For critics, in removing these statues we are in danger of symbolically removing distasteful aspects of history which allow us to understand the present. As one South African student notes in reference to Cecil Rhodes: ‘Removing him omits an essential part of the institution’s history that has contributed to everything good, bad and ugly about it.’ [Ref: Guardian] In the case of the Rhodes statue at Oxford, some argue that statues serve as a repository of history, good and bad: ‘A salient fact about the Oriel statue of Rhodes is its date: 1911. It is an echo in stone of a different time.’ [Ref: New York Times]
WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO REMOVE THEM?
Advocates of removing statutes of controversial figures suggest that these monuments represent individuals whose actions and legacies should not be celebrated or memorialised. Since the Black Lives Matter protests of June 2020, almost 70 memorials have been renamed or taken down in what some historians have called an ‘unprecedented’ public reckoning with Britain’s slavery and colonial past [Ref: Guardian ]. But others have argued that the connection between the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism is often wrongly attributed. According to historian, Dr Zareer Masini, it ignores the fact that ‘slavery was almost universally practised across the globe until the British empire and navy stamped it out in the mid-19 th century’. [Ref: Spectator] These commentators believe that the campaigns to remove monuments to controversial historical figures have been ‘rushed through without democratic consultation or due process’ and welcome new government legislation to ‘protect monuments and statues from mob iconoclasm’ [Ref: Spectator ].
But for some, this ‘reckoning with history’ is more about ensuring the public realm represents the diversity of life in the UK now. For Aindrea Emelife, a 27-year-old art historian and a member of the Mayor of London’s Commission for Diversity, the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol marked a turning point, particularly when a sculpture of a young black woman was put in its place. Emelife says, ‘that reinvigorated the idea that public art should mean something. I saw little black girls looking at that statue and it made me wonder if I saw that when I was younger, how it would have inspired me.’ [Ref: Guardian ]. Other commentators, such as Trevor Phillips, former chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, consider the idea of diverse representation in the public realm as a distraction. ‘My worry too is that this new culture war risks distracting us from the practical steps that need to be taken to make a real and lasting practical difference to the lives of BAME people in this country.’ [Ref: Express]
Of course, many dispute that removing statues really represents a historical reckoning at all. One cultural critic insists it is a ‘moral crusade to cleanse history’, and that ‘preserving material (be it inspiring or appalling) allows us better to understand our history and society today; it helps us make judicious decisions about what is right for our future.’ [Ref: Spiked] Yet, as some counter, is removing statues not as much a part of the historical process as keeping them? Commentator Matthew Parris insists: ‘Far from [toppling a statue] being a “writing out of history” it was a writing in of history. History is what happened.’ [Ref: Spectator] Indeed, our understanding and interpretation of historical norms and values changes over time: ‘To reconsider, to recast, is the essence of historical practice. Altering how we present the past is not ahistorical… it represents a more thorough coming to terms with the past and legacies, a refusal to forget.’ [Ref: Chronicle Review]
But how is this process of reconsideration to take place? In the case of the Bristol statue of Colston, Prime Minister Boris Johnson lamented that democratic decisions were replaced by criminal acts [Ref: BBC ]. Indeed, a survey conducted in early 2021 showed that only 16% of black Britons believed toppling statues was a permissible form of protest [Ref: The Sunday Times ].
However, the Mayor of London’s commission, as well as those being created across the UK, are seen by many as a way to ‘work with their local communities to look at the “appropriateness” of certain monuments and statues on public land and council property’ [Ref: Dorset Echo ]. But does this imply that removing statues is right whenever a democratic majority says so? [Ref: The Atlantic] Are democratic decisions made in the present, about our past, susceptible to contemporary political trends? And do government commissions run the risk of taking action for the sake of being seen to ‘do something’?  Would a more pragmatic approach be to ‘retain and explain’ the complex history of more controversial figures, as the government has suggested? [Ref: The Times]
A BATTLE OVER HISTORY?
Of course, such debates are never just about the statues themselves but are a tussle over history, too. As the Oxford-based philosopher Amia Srinivasan argues, the ultimate goal of campaigns such as Rhodes Must Fall is ‘to “decolonise” the university, a broad campaign – of which changing public symbols is only one part’ [Ref: London Review of Books ]. But the historian David Olusoga, despite being broadly in favour of removing such statues, argues the discussion about statues can be a distraction: ‘If forced to choose between a proper national debate on racism or the statue wars, which is it to be? … [S]tatues are a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself.’ [Ref: Guardian] Similarly, writer Kenan Malik suggests that such debates are part and parcel of distracting ‘culture war’ issues: ‘Rather than ask “What are the policy reasons for the lack of housing and stagnating wages?” or “What are the social roots of racism and what structural changes are required to combat it?”, we look to blame the Other, demand recognition for our particular identity and tussle over symbols.’ [Ref: Observer]
Aside from arguments about subjecting historical figures to modern standards of moral judgement [Ref: Guardian ], and questioning what good removing a statue of Rhodes will do in a practical sense [Ref: The Conversation ], opponents of toppling statues worry that our relation to the past is becoming fraught or superficial. For these critics, the act of understanding history relies on recognising how the past informs the present, and not editing out parts we don’t like. Allowing monuments to stand isn’t to legitimate the views of nineteenth-century slave holders or imperialists or Confederate generals, but rather, it is part of the ‘challenge of history’ to debate the moral questions the monuments may present, and confront them head-on [Ref: New York Times ]. For some, the destruction of monuments is emblematic of a wider contemporary fixation with pathologising the past, ‘treating history as a source of psychological trauma’. [Ref: Spiked] But if ‘anti-racism is a battle for memory’, then history very naturally becomes a battleground [Ref: Jacobin ].
In light of the arguments on both sides, should monuments of controversial historical figures be removed, or does this do a disservice to history, and make us victims of history rather than subjects who can understand and engage with it? And who should take these decisions? Are government commissions truly representative of the population as a whole and do they have the authority to take these decisions on behalf of the population today, and populations of the future?

Historical statues and monuments are in the news, but sadly not because Americans have taken a new interest in understanding their history. Statues of men who supported the Confederacy, prominent generals like Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, for example, have been appropriated by White supremacists (this is nothing new, actually). Such statues have been defended as “ beautiful ” by a man, Donald Trump, with little sense of history, even as other Americans have called for these and similar statues to be removed.
Statues, of course, are just that. Inanimate objects. Places for pigeons to poop. It’s we who invest them with meaning. Most people, I think, take little notice of statues and monuments until they become controversial, after which everyone has an opinion.
For me, statues and monuments are a stimulus for reflection as well as education. Who was that guy on a horse? Why is he being honored? And what does that decision tell us about who we were and are as a people?
As a people, we choose certain historical figures as worthy of being sculpted in stone or cast in bronze. We choose our heroes, so to speak, our paragons, our worthies. And our choices are just that ― choices. They reflect certain values, priorities, motives, feelings. And since our values, our motives, our sense of what is good and bad, right and wrong, change over time, so too can our statues and memorials change, if that is the will of the people in a democracy that enshrines freedom of choice.
If the peoples of various states choose to remove certain statues, so be it. Other statues might take their place; other worthies might be selected as more in keeping with the times and our values as we conceive them today as a people.
What we choose to memorialize as a people says much about ourselves. Many statues and memorials fall under the category of “man on horseback.” Certainly, military figures like Lee and Jackson were considered great men of their times, at least in a Confederate context. They also, sadly, became potent symbols of racism in the Jim Crow South, physical symbols of the myth of the Lost Cause, intimidating and demoralizing figures to Black communities struggling against violence and prejudice.
Americans are an intemperate lot, driven by extremes, constantly fighting to reconfigure ourselves through our interpretation and re-interpretation of history. All this is proof to William Faulkner’s famous saying that, “The past is not dead. It’s not even past.”
As a historian, I find it deeply sad as well as ironic that, at a time when education in history is withering in the United States, the importance of history has arguably never been greater. We should use statues as a stimulus for learning, but instead they’re more often appropriated as a driver for divisiveness.
If nothing else, today’s debates about statues should remind us yet again of the importance of history and a proper understanding of it. History is inherently disputatious. Controversial. Challenging. Exciting. If we can tap the heat generated by the latest controversies and warm students to a study of history in all its richness, perhaps some good can come from the ongoing controversy.
What kind of statues and memorials are the “right” ones for America? It’s a vexing question, is it not? It’s also a question with powerful implications. I come back to George Orwell’s comment (slightly paraphrased): He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.
Our understanding of the past ― our selective celebration of it ― helps to define what is possible in the future. If you celebrate generals on horseback ― military men of the Confederacy ― you make a choice that helps to shape what is seen as right and proper in the present moment, and what will be right and proper in the future.
For a better future, I’d like to see fewer statues to military men and sports heroes and the like, and more to visionaries who sought a better way for us as a people. I recall a small monument I saw to Elihu Burritt in Massachusetts. No one is talking about him or his legacy today. He’s an obscure figure compared to his contemporaries, Lee and Jackson. Known as the “Learned Blacksmith,” he was a committed pacifist and abolitionist who worked to educate the less fortunate in society.
If we are to build prominent statues and monuments, would it not be better to build them to people like Elihu Burritt, people who worked for justice and equality, people who fought against war and slavery and for peace and freedom?

Statues, Politics and The Past
Public monuments have become sites of historical conflict, revealing bitter divisions over interpretations of the past.
Simon John | Published in History Today Volume 69 Issue 9 September 2019
Ben Jones
What purpose do statues serve? This question came to the fore when former prime minister Theresa May announced plans in June 2019 for a memorial in London’s Waterloo station commemorating the arrival to Britain in 1948 of the first of the Windrush generation. The Windrush Foundation criticised the plans, pointing out that the government had not consulted members of the Caribbean community in the UK before publicising them.
This was merely the latest in a succession of recent episodes that have fuelled global debates over the purpose of public monuments in society. The ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ movement, which began at the University of Cape Town in 2015 and then spread to Oxford University the following year, protested against statues of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes on both universities’ campuses. Moreover, the past few years have seen ongoing campaigns in the US to have Civil War statues commemorating Confederate figures removed from public spaces. Counter-campaigners have sought to maintain those statues as they are. What these episodes all have in common is that, within each, monuments have become lightning rods for wider conflicts between competing visions of history.
Controversial monuments
Nations and communities have various options for dealing with controversial monuments. One is to remove them entirely. In some contexts, authorities have done precisely this. With the fall of Hitler’s Germany, for example, Nazi monuments throughout the former Reich were hastily pulled down, part of a wider effort to exorcise the spectre of National Socialism.
Some who oppose particular monuments do not wish to take them down entirely, however, asserting that simply removing a statue is tantamount to pretending a traumatic event in the past never happened. Rather, they advocate removing controversial statues while retaining their pedestals as a reminder of the events that they invoke. Accordingly, empty plinths throughout the US show that some communities have confronted their difficult pasts in this way.
Proponents of retaining controversial monuments have suggested that to remove them would be to efface a part of history. They argue that statues should be preserved because they teach people about the past. But is viewing a statue actually an effective way of learning about history?
Statuomania
An insightful way of answering this question is to examine the attitudes of past societies to their public monuments. Developments in 19th-century Europe, in particular, have the potential to unlock a fresh vantage point onto this contemporary issue. In that era, many political communities pursued state-building programmes that involved appropriating history to serve interests in the present. Nations devoted substantial energy and resources to commemorating heroes from the past in monumental form. Helke Rausch’s important work on the political uses of statues in European capitals between 1848 and 1914 shows that major cities received dozens of new monuments: Paris gained 78 new statues, Berlin 59 and London 61. With good reason, historians often characterise the 19th century as an age of ‘statuomania’.
These monuments continue to shape the fabric of European cities. The gilded bronze statue of Joan of Arc installed in Paris’ Place des Pyramides in 1874, for example, remains a familiar sight in the French capital. Every summer, Joan greets the Tour de France as its riders circle the city’s historic heart during the final stage of the race. The statue of Richard I erected outside London’s Palace of Westminster in 1860 still stands proudly outside the home of Parliament. Richard’s unyielding bronze gaze has watched over defining events in the past 150 years. The fate of the grand statue of Frederick the Great erected on Berlin’s Unter den Linden in 1839 has been intertwined with the history of the city. During the Second World War, the monument was encased in protective cement. Beginning in 1950, the DDR authorities relocated it several times. It was only after the reunification of Germany in 1990 that Frederick was returned to his original 1839 location.
Belgian nationhood
The ways in which monuments were used in 19th-century Belgium aptly illustrate wider European trends and attitudes in that era. Belgium was founded through revolution in 1830-1 and its political elite spent the next few decades consolidating its newly won independence. As part of a multifaceted programme intended to forge a new national identity, political authorities drew extensively from the past with the aim of legitimating Belgian nationhood in the present. In contrast to more venerable nations such as England and France, Belgian state-builders could not point to continuity through long-standing institutions and structures that had existed for centuries. Instead, they had to harness the legitimating power of history in a different way. As a result, the ideas and aspirations which shaped their efforts came into focus more clearly than in other states.
Elite project
Seeking to use the past to stimulate feelings of communal solidarity, Belgian political elites commissioned – and provided substantial levels of funding for – scores of new monuments for Brussels, the capital, and other cities and towns throughout the nation. Many of these new monuments honoured figures who lived long before the Belgian Revolution. Some evoked the Middle Ages, while others – such as the statue of the Gallic chief Ambiorix unveiled in Tongeren in 1866 – channelled the even more distant past. In a decree issued on 7 January 1835, the Belgian government signalled its intention to carry out ‘a national task’ by sponsoring the creation of new statues ‘to honour the memory of the Belgians who had contributed to the glory of their country’. In the years that followed, a diverse array of figures including Charlemagne, Peter Paul Rubens and Andreas Vesalius were immortalised in bronze and stone in public spaces throughout the nation, presented as exemplary Belgians from earlier ages.
This wave of Belgian statuomania was not just about conveying an interpretation of the past. It was one element of a programme intended to mediate the relationship between the past and the present. In 1859, Brussels witnessed the inauguration of a monumental column honouring the members of the National Congress, the legislative assembly set up during the Belgian Revolution in 1830. An account written the following year in praise of Brussels’ Congress Column had this to say about Belgium’s statuary:
The history of every people is written in its monuments. They reveal, without diminishment or partiality, their mores, their beliefs, their institutions. This observation is true for all eras and applicable to all countries, and is particularly confirmed in Belgium.
This rather self-conscious effort to assert that Belgian monuments were impartial serves to confirm that precisely the opposite was the case. The statues created in 19th-century Belgium do not simply convey neutral, incontrovertible information about the past. Rather, they present a particular view of history, one which had it that while Belgian nationhood had only become a political reality in 1830-1, it had been an impulse that had shaped the hearts and minds of the inhabitants of the region for centuries. Those who visited the capital in the middle years of the 19th century were able to see a tangible version of this history, cast in bronze and carved in stone. Together, Brussels’ 19th-century monuments constitute a kind of open-air pantheon, aligning statues to heroes from the past, such as Vesalius, with memorials of the Belgian Revolution, including the Congress Column.
Negotiating the past
The statues created in Belgium advance the interpretation of history that prevailed in the mid-19th century. Later developments, including the rise of Flemish nationalism and a backlash against colonial activities in the Congo, prompted the emergence of new and sometimes conflicting concepts of the nation’s past. In turn, attitudes towards the nation’s statuary and the values they embody have evolved. Yet practically all the statues erected in the nation in the decades following 1830-1 still stand. They continue to embody the contingent political circumstances in which they were created: the defining years in which Belgium worked to secure its independence.
So, how can the statuomania of the 19th century inform debates today? Statues can teach us about history, but they do not convey some immutable truth from the past. Instead, they are symbolic of the fixed ideas of a specific community regarding its past, as captured at a particular point in time. As our case study of 19th-century Belgium demonstrates, history is complex and susceptible to refashioning in line with changing political aspirations. In a way, statues do tell us about the past, but that is not to say that we should accept what they tell us uncritically.
Conflicts over particular statues are the result of specific disagreements over an aspect of history. The sharp divides between those who would see Rhodes or a Confederate general as a villain and those who would see each as a hero are cases in point.
Disputes have also been caused by people interpreting monuments in different ways. On the one hand are those who regard them as embodying some essential and imperishable historical certainty. On the other are observers who are able – and willing – to look beyond a particular statue to a more complex and contestable past reality. The latter are better poised to recognise that outmoded and divisive political values embodied in any monument belong in one place and one place alone: the past.

Abstract
Whether it is a monument, statue, plaque, or mural, the values and ideologies that are memorialized on public land reflect what reality the people of a country are choosing to remember. The United States’ political and racial history has led to the creation of controversial memorials, including memorials that honor the Confederacy and its leaders, influencing moral concepts based in racism, violence, and oppression. The continued veneration of these symbols on public land sends the message to the Black community that their oppressors are honored as heroes and that the society they live in still allows for their abuse. Annette-Gordon Reed, a Harvard historian, claims that public memorials could be used to celebrate the Black Americans who built the United States, and Confederate monuments could be better placed in locations of remembrance.

Alright, so I have this question: "Do people like things of memorial significance?" It seems pretty straightforward, but I need to think carefully about what it's asking. Memorial significance— that probably means things that are important because they remind us of something in the past, like historical events or people. So, are people generally fond of such things?

First off, I should probably define what I mean by "things of memorial significance." Are we talking about physical objects like statues and monuments, or does it include intangible things like traditions or stories? For now, I'll focus on physical memorials since they're more concrete and easier to discuss.

I think most people do appreciate memorials. For example, visiting historical sites or museums is quite popular. People travel from all over the world to see places like the Pyramids or the Statue of Liberty. These are not just tourist attractions; they hold significant meaning and tell stories about our past.

Moreover, memorials often serve as places for reflection and remembrance. War memorials, for instance, are visited by families of fallen soldiers and by citizens who want to honor their sacrifices. So, in that sense, people do value these memorials.

But, it's not always positive. There are cases where memorials are controversial. For example, statues of Confederate leaders in the southern United States have been a subject of debate and protest. Some people see them as offensive and oppressive symbols of slavery and white supremacy, while others view them as part of their heritage and history.

This brings up an important point: memorials can have different meanings for different people. What one group sees as a honorable tribute, another might see as a painful reminder of injustice. So, it's not accurate to generalize that people universally like things of memorial significance.

Additionally, there's been a trend in recent years of removing or contextualizing certain memorials that are deemed problematic. This suggests that societal values are shifting, and what was once acceptable may no longer be so. Therefore, people's attitudes towards memorials can change over time.

Maybe I should look into some specific examples to get a better understanding. Let's consider the case of Cecil Rhodes. There was a movement called "Rhodes Must Fall" that started at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, calling for the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, a British imperialist and mining magnate who played a significant role in colonizing southern Africa.

Supporters of the movement argued that the statue was a symbol of racism and oppression, and having it on campus was offensive and exclusionary to black students. On the other hand, some opposed its removal, arguing that it was part of history and should be preserved for educational purposes.

This debate highlights the tension between honoring the past and confronting its darker aspects. It also shows that memorials can be sites of political and social struggle, reflecting current values and ideologies.

Another example is the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, UK, during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. Colston was a 17th-century slave trader, and his statue was seen by many as a glorification of his role in the slave trade. When protesters pulled it down and threw it into the harbor, it sparked a nationwide conversation about Britain's colonial past and the memorials that celebrate it.

This event demonstrated the power of public action in challenging established narratives and symbols. It also raised questions about who decides what memorials are appropriate and how history is remembered.

Perhaps I should consider the purpose of memorials. Why do we create them in the first place? Memorials serve various functions: they commemorate important events or people, they educate the public about history, they provide a space for mourning and reflection, and they can also reinforce certain ideological viewpoints.

Given that, it's understandable that different groups might have differing opinions about specific memorials. If a memorial promotes values that are no longer accepted or that are actively harmful to certain communities, it's reasonable for there to be calls for its removal or alteration.

But, there's also an argument to be made for preserving such memorials as a way to learn from the past and ensure that we don't repeat its mistakes. By keeping them up and adding context, we can turn them into teachable moments.

I recall reading about the Berlin Wall, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Parts of it have been preserved as a memorial to the division of East and West Germany and as a symbol of the Cold War. It serves as a powerful reminder of the past and the importance of freedom and unity.

Similarly, in the United States, there are plantations that have been turned into museums, providing a sobering look at the reality of slavery. These sites can be painful to visit, but they offer valuable insights into a dark chapter of American history.

So, it seems that memorials can serve as important educational tools, even if they depict difficult or uncomfortable aspects of our past.

However, not all memorials are created equal. Some are more celebratory in nature, while others are more reflective and critical. It's essential to have a balanced approach to memorialization, acknowledging both the positive and negative aspects of history.

I think it's also worth considering the role of memorials in shaping collective memory. They can influence how we perceive our past and, by extension, our present and future. If memorials predominantly celebrate certain groups or events while ignoring or marginalizing others, that can lead to a skewed understanding of history.

For example, in the United States, there are far more memorials honoring white male politicians and military leaders than there are recognizing the contributions of women, people of color, or marginalized communities. This imbalance reflects historical power dynamics and can perpetuate systemic inequalities.

Therefore, efforts to diversify memorials and include a broader range of perspectives are crucial for fostering a more inclusive and accurate representation of history.

Looking back at my initial question, "Do people like things of memorial significance?" It's clear that the answer is nuanced. Many people do appreciate memorials for their historical and cultural value, but others may find them offensive or problematic, especially if they perpetuate harmful narratives or exclude certain groups.

Furthermore, people's attitudes towards memorials can evolve over time as societal values change. What was once considered acceptable may no longer be so, leading to calls for reevaluation and possible removal of certain memorials.

In conclusion, while there is a general appreciation for memorials, it's essential to approach them critically and ensure that they reflect a diverse and accurate portrayal of history. By doing so, we can create memorials that truly serve the needs and values of all members of society.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People's attitudes towards things of memorial significance vary; while many appreciate them for their historical and cultural value, others may find them offensive or problematic, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and inclusivity in memorialization.}} \]
