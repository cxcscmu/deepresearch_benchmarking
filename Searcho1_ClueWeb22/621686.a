Alright, so I need to figure out why the cost of gas is rising. I don't know much about economics or oil markets, but I've noticed that gas prices seem to go up and down pretty frequently. I think starting with some basic research would be a good idea. Maybe I can look into what factors affect the price of gasoline.

First, I should probably understand how gasoline is produced and sold. I know that gasoline comes from crude oil, which is extracted from the ground and then refined into usable fuel. There are probably many steps involved in getting it from the oil field to the gas station pump.

I think one of the main factors affecting gas prices is the cost of crude oil. If the price of crude oil goes up, it makes sense that the price of gasoline would increase as well, since refiners have to pay more for their raw material.

But there are probably other factors too. For example, refining costs, taxes, distribution costs, and retail markup all add to the final price that consumers pay. Also, demand and supply play a big role. If more people want gas and supplies are tight, prices will rise.

Maybe I should look into recent events that could be affecting the global oil market. I've heard about conflicts in the Middle East affecting oil production, and that could lead to supply disruptions, driving up prices.

Also, natural disasters like hurricanes can disrupt oil production and refining in places like the Gulf of Mexico, which is a major oil-producing region in the US.

Additionally, changes in global economies can affect demand. For instance, if economies are growing, more people are driving, and industries are using more oil, which increases demand and can drive up prices.

I should also consider the role of oil companies and OPEC in controlling supply. OPEC is a organization of major oil-producing countries that sometimes coordinate to set production levels, which can influence global oil prices.

Perhaps I should look up some recent news articles or reliable sources to get more specific information on why gas prices are rising now.

Let me try searching for "why is the cost of gas rising" to see what comes up.

7 Reasons Why Gas Prices Go Up - Now from Nationwide
August 27, 2021
7 Reasons Why Gas Prices Go Up
Driving can be expensive. Between buying or leasing the car itself, maintenance, and insurance, it can be enough to make some consider the bus. Choosing your insurance wisely can help that a lot, and you can always practice safe driving and precautionary measures that minimize maintenance costs, but some expenses, such as gas, are harder to control. Gas prices fluctuate regularly, and where and when they dip and rise is completely out of your hands. You can elect to buy a more fuel-efficient model to save yourself some trips to the gas station, or even take steps to save money on gas, however, the prices themselves are beyond your control.
But what causes gas prices to go up? And why are gas prices rising in 2021? There are several factors that can cause prices to fluctuate, from market conditions to governmental factors like taxes, and most of the time they’re all in play simultaneously, tugging the price up and down. But let’s get into the specifics of what each is and how they affect prices.
1. Supply and demand for crude oil
Every entry-level economics class teaches supply and demand for a reason – it impacts everything that is bought and sold anywhere. We might not commonly think of a necessity like fuel as being controlled by demand in the same way a consumer good like cashmere is, but the basic principles are the same. Supply and demand is a large part of why gas prices are higher in 2021. During the pandemic, lockdowns caused people to stop going places, meaning that the demand for crude oil went down. In response, less was produced. When demand rose again after lockdown restrictions eased, there wasn’t sufficient supply to meet it, resulting in higher gas prices. 1
2. Refining costs
Not all crude oil is created equal, and some costs more to refine than others. Some regions are also more expensive to transport that oil through, resulting in disparities in refining costs. Ultimately, these costs vary between types of oil being refined, the region they’re transported from, and the season it’s being transported during. 2
3. Retail costs
The pricing at a particular gas station is dependent on numerous factors, and one of them is simply that: the particular gas station! Like any product, pricing for gas can be affected by the location it’s being sold in. There’s a reason a sandwich costs more on average in Manhattan than it does in rural Pennsylvania, there’s simply more demand for that sandwich in one place than the other. The same can be true of gasoline. Some gas station brands are also owned directly by refiners who can produce their own product, while others have to purchase their stock and resell it. 3
4. Taxes and state fees
Different states have different taxes, so gas prices will frequently vary depending on the state you’re filling up in. Some states may institute taxes on gas that are intended to encourage eco-friendly practices and discourage heavy gasoline usage, while others take more of a hands-off approach. The federal tax rate on gasoline will, naturally, be consistent no matter what state you’re in. As of January 2021, there was an 18. 4 cent federal excise tax per gallon of gasoline. 4 As you might expect, higher taxes lead to higher gas prices, and vice versa.
5. Interruptions in oil distribution
Interruptions in oil distribution create disparities in supply since the expected amount of gasoline is not delivered. These can be anything that gets in the way of the expected flow of drilling, refining and distributing. Wars, natural disasters, and other accidents can all create these gaps. These interruptions typically cause gas prices to go up. 5
6. Commodity traders
Commodity traders purchase futures contracts on various commodities (anything from wheat to gas) and then sell those contracts for profit. It’s like buying a company’s stock on the stock market, except instead of stock, it’s an actual product that will be taken to market and sold. Traders make their money by projecting what prices will be, buying lower, and selling higher. So if a commodity trader were to purchase a futures contract on gasoline, they’d want that gasoline to be worth more money in the future. Bidding between traders on that gasoline can cause its actual price to rise. 6
7. Value of the U.S. dollar declines
When the value of the dollar declines, so does the profit made by anyone selling products for dollars. To compensate, producers will respond to declining dollar values by raising prices. This is true of any industry, and the fuel sector is no exception. If inflation rises, expect gas prices to follow suit. 7
So, why do gas prices go up? Simply put all of the above. Many of the factors mentioned earlier play off of one another, such as distribution interruption and supply, and they are all always at play in influencing the price of gas, whether negatively or positively. Since the average person has effectively no influence on any of these factors, your best bet is to position yourself so that you are affected by rising gas prices as little as possible. Buying a hybrid car or some other efficient model is a good place to start.
However you prepare for the fluctuations of the gasoline market, you should always be prepared in case you find yourself out of gas one day. Learn more about what to do if you run out of gas.

Why Are Natural Gas Costs Rising?

Natural gas customers across the country will likely experience increased heating costs this winter, due to a rise in natural gas market prices. While there is no single answer to why market prices are up, there are a few key factors.
Natural Gas Supply
Low supplies of a commodity tend to drive market prices higher. Current supplies of natural gas are lower than normal because of long and short-term factors. Low market prices for crude oil over the past decade have limited investment in new oil drilling sites, cutting down on the amount of gas produced. Further COVID-related economic signals also limited investment in natural gas production.
Meanwhile, supplies of gas in the U.S. have also been depleted by 2021 weather events such as the February extreme winter storm across the Midwest and South. The summer was very hot in the West, which meant more gas than normal was needed to produce electricity. And fall hurricanes forced the Gulf of Mexico’s gas output offline. In addition, European countries are experiencing a gas shortage, so exports from the United States are up.
Tracking Historic Trends
U.S. natural gas prices have been at historic lows since hydraulic fracturing (fracking) unlocked new supplies over a decade ago. Natural gas heating customers have benefited from the low natural gas market prices during that time.
Last winter, normal gas prices were around $3 per unit. Average prices were much higher in the early 2000s. Experts aren’t sure if we are experiencing a short-term price increase in 2021 or a return of higher prices closer to historic norms.
CFU will continue to control the costs we can, protect customers as much as possible from market volatility and keep customers informed about the impact of energy markets on utility bills.

A s Americans have begun traveling again, they’ve run into high prices at the pump. Gas prices are currently the highest they have been in seven years, sitting at a national average of $3.14 per gallon for regular gasoline on Friday. In California, the cost of regular gasoline is more than a dollar higher than the national average, at $4.31 per gallon. The national average price is up nearly 40 percent since January. After the very low prices of 2020, these costs are a major burden, especially as many people have tighter budgets in the wake of the pandemic.
The high price of crude oil is the main driver of rising gas costs. Some of the main influences on prices are the quick rebound in demand as COVID restrictions wind down, the stalling of production increase talks between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, and anti-production policies here at home.
Prices have increased dramatically partly because demand has rebounded faster than supply as COVID restrictions end. According to Price Futures Group senior marketing analyst Phil Flynn, the reason that oil futures are currently booming is this imbalance of supply and demand. This is likely to continue for some time: “U.S. oil production is sputtering and OPEC seems reluctant to add too many barrels even if it is clear that the global oil market is begging for more.”
OPEC has been slow to reach agreement on production increases. On July 5, the organization and its ally countries known collectively as OPEC+ left the market in a state of uncertainty when they postponed production talks with no established resumption date. The United Arab Emirates is seeking a production increase that other member states oppose. The outcome of OPEC talks will determine how much of the nearly six million barrels of capacity that it’s holding in reserve will be made available. If OPEC members suddenly broke rank and started producing at their actual capabilities, the supply crisis would quickly turn to a supply glut with its own set of concerns.
Although OPEC is an important factor in the price of oil, gone are the days where the U.S. was powerless over the supply, and therefore the price, of oil. The U.S. has been responsible for the majority of the global increase in oil supply in the last decade. The U.S. accounted for an increase of 9.77 million barrels per day during the period from 2010 to 2019, which amounts to 80 percent of the global increase. So our national policy holds more sway over global oil supply than it did in previous decades.
Policies like carbon taxes raise the price of gas by design, so we should be wary of Democrats who bemoan the impact of higher prices on American consumers and especially the poor on one hand and make policy decisions to raise those prices on the other.
President Biden’s policy decisions have only slowed supply recovery. His administration has suspended oil and gas leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWAR) pending review to “determine whether the leases should be reaffirmed, voiced, or subject to additional mitigation measure.” The suspension of these leases and the push to limit drilling on federal lands in general mean that new supply from that quarter is unlikely in the near future.
And Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline means natural gas from Canada has to compete for rail space with oil and gas, which is increasing both the demand and cost for transporting it by rail.
While high gas prices have many causes, they are ultimately a case of out-of-sync supply and demand and of policy choices that go against the best interests of American consumers.

”Policies like carbon taxes raise the price of gas by design, so… be wary of Democrats who bemoan the impact of higher prices on American consumers and especially the poor on one hand and make policy decisions to raise those prices on the other.”
Democrats will always be the taxpayer’s enemy. And they are consumer antagonists as well. It is never their way to recognize the contribution of successful companies — such as Pfizer and Moderna — by granting them tax relief. So the only way such companies can prosper is by raising their prices to cover the tax burden. Hence, any tax increase is inherently inflationary. And it was ever thus.
Suppose Las Vegas hotels and casinos were managed using the left-wing Democrat paradigm. Each arriving vacationer would be greeted by a brightly lit sign, warning:
— “Comrades! If you win, your winnings will be confiscated for the greater good of thugs, criminals and terrorists.”
— “If any other gamblers lose, you will be taxed to recompense them for the injustice. They mustn’t be allowed to suffer.”
Somehow I doubt that anyone would sing “Viva Las Vegas!” like Elvis.

SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) – While the national average price for a gallon of regular gas remains higher than we’ve seen in the last three years, prices are starting to dip slightly, according to a new report. But who – or what – is to blame for the current prices?
As AAA explains, the price we pay at the pump is largely dependent on driving habits and the supply of crude oil. The current dip in the national average price may be due to seasonal driving habit changes, according to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports the total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 1.6 million bbl to 212.7 million bbl last week. The demand for gasoline dropped from 9.5 million b/d to 9.26 million b/d. This dip, paired with an increase in the domestic crude oil supply, caused downward pressure on prices, AAA explains.

So what else impacts the price of gasoline?
According to EIA, there are four factors impacting the price tag:
The cost of crude oil
Refining costs and profits
Distribution and marketing costs and profits
Taxes
As EIA explains, the cost of crude oil is the largest component of the price of gasoline. Crude oil prices are, in turn, impacted by seven other factors, including supply, demand, and financial markets. Taxes are also impacted by multiple components, including taxes imposed by federal, state, and local governments. Refining costs and profits will vary by season and region within the U.S., EIA says, and are impacted by demand as well.

Who owns a gas station can also impact the price at the pump. According to EIA, some stations are owned and operated by refiners while others purchase gasoline from refiners and marketers for resale. The price set by individual retailers can vary greatly depending on numerous factors like where the station is, what the local hiring market is like, state and local fees, and sources for supply.

While legislation can impact the price of gasoline, politicians – like the president – have limited control over what happens. The National Association of Convenience Stores reiterates the EIA, saying gas prices are largely dependent on oil prices, which are dependent on supply and demand. Presidential candidates may campaign on lowering gas prices but trends show that has yet to truly happen.

According to the NACS, as the last four presidents left office, gas prices were higher than when they entered office. Using EIA numbers, NACS shows:
Bill Clinton left office with gas prices 39 cents higher ($1.06 on Jan. 25, 1993; $1.47 on Jan. 22, 2001)
George W. Bush left office with gas prices 39 cents higher ($1.47 on Jan. 22, 2001; $1.84 on Jan. 26, 2009)
Barack Obama left office with gas prices 49 cents higher ($1.84 on Jan. 26, 2009; $2.33 on Jan. 23, 2017)
Donald Trump left office with gas prices 6 cents higher ($2.33 on Jan. 23, 2017; $2.39 on Jan. 25, 2021).
The organization notes the price during Trump’s administration was largely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic when demand dropped. GasBuddy data shows the price for gasoline dropped around May 2020 and has since been steadily climbing.
As AAA reports, the demand for gasoline has also been increasing as the price increases. Officials say when the demand decreases, oil companies pulled back on production. Now that the demand is climbing, some oil companies are still working to meet demand.
In its mid-November report, AAA says pump prices will likely remain high as long as oil prices remain above $80 per barrel. Check here for 10 driving tips that will help you save money as prices remain high.

Why Gas Prices Might Not Come Down Anytime Soon
By Mohit Oberoi, CFA
Sep. 14 2021, Published 11:58 a.m. ET
Consumer price data for Aug. 2021, released on Sep. 14, showed that U.S. retail inflation rose 5.3 percent (annualized) during that month, and core inflation (which excludes food and energy) rose 4 percent. Whereas inflation eased from Jul. 2021, it was still high. Higher gas prices are contributing to the rise in inflation. Why is gas so expensive right now?

Gas prices in the U.S. are a function of both domestic and international factors. The biggest driver for gas prices is crude oil prices. Like all commodities, crude oil prices depend on supply-demand dynamics.
How are gas prices determined in the U.S.?
In the short term, market sentiment, refining costs, and refiner margins (reflected in crack spreads) are also factors in gas prices. Specific events or changes, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack or a change in taxation, can also affect them

Why are gas prices going up?
Gas prices have been going up in the U.S. due to crude oil prices rising. WTI is back above $70, and crude oil prices were higher as of Sep. 14 on fears that another storm could impact Texas oil production.

Energy "independence"... dead at 2 years old?
After 50 years of effort, the US became a net energy exporter in 2019, including no oil from Saudi Arabia last week (first time in 35 yrs). Sadly, the EIA now projects we will be a net importer in 2021 & 2022. #oil #recession

When will gas prices come down?
The near-term outlook for crude oil looks bullish. The economy's continued upward momentum bodes well for global oil demand. Whereas Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude oil prices to rise to $80 by the end of 2021, considering their current momentum, that could happen earlier. Higher crude oil prices would mean higher gas prices in the U.S. in 2021.

Another factor to watch would be the global COVID-19 situation. If the situation worsens and lockdowns are reintroduced, crude oil prices and gas prices in the U.S. could come down. Also, if the Fed decides to begin tapering at its September policy meeting, it could pressure risk assets, including commodities such as energy.

Okay, so I've got some information from these articles. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, it seems that gas prices are influenced by a lot of different factors. The main one appears to be the cost of crude oil. Crude oil is the raw material that's refined into gasoline, so if the price of crude goes up, it makes sense that gas prices would follow suit.

But there are other costs involved too, like refining costs, taxes, distribution, and retail markup. All these add to the final price at the pump. So even if crude oil prices stay the same, increases in any of these other areas can drive up gas prices.

One article mentioned that supply and demand play a big role. If more people are driving and needing gas, but the supply hasn't increased to match that demand, prices will go up. Conversely, if there's a lot of gas supply but not much demand, prices might drop.

I also read about how global events can affect gas prices. For example, conflicts in the Middle East, where a lot of oil is produced, can disrupt supply and cause prices to rise. Natural disasters, like hurricanes, can also impact oil production and refining, leading to higher prices.

Moreover, the strength of the US dollar affects oil prices because oil is traded in dollars globally. If the dollar weakens, oil prices tend to rise because it costs more in dollars to buy the same amount of oil.

There's also the role of commodity traders who buy and sell oil futures. Their activities can influence oil prices based on supply and demand expectations.

Looking at the current situation, it seems that after the pandemic, when many economies were locked down, oil demand dropped sharply, leading to a decrease in oil production. As economies reopened and demand surged again, oil producers couldn't ramp up production fast enough, causing a supply crunch and pushing prices up.

Additionally, some government policies can impact gas prices. For instance, if a government imposes higher taxes on gasoline, that directly increases the price consumers pay. On the other hand, policies that encourage alternative fuels or energy efficiency might help reduce reliance on gasoline and potentially lower prices.

One article specifically mentioned that President Biden's policies, such as suspending oil and gas leases in certain areas, might be limiting supply and contributing to higher prices. However, it's important to note that the oil industry is complex, and the full impact of such policies might take time to materialize.

Overall, it seems that gas prices are rising due to a combination of increased demand as economies recover from the pandemic, limited supply because of production constraints, and possibly some geopolitical factors and market speculation.

I think to get a more precise answer, I'd need to look into current events and specific data on oil production and demand. Maybe checking recent news articles or reports from organizations like the EIA (Energy Information Administration) would help.

Let me try searching for more recent information on this topic.

It’s like buying a company’s stock on the stock market, except instead of stock, it’s an actual product that will be taken to market and sold. Traders make their money by projecting what prices will be, buying lower, and selling higher. So if a commodity trader were to purchase a futures contract on gasoline, they’d want that gasoline to be worth more money in the future. Bidding between traders on that gasoline can cause its actual price to rise. 6
7. Value of the U.S. dollar declines
When the value of the dollar declines, so does the profit made by anyone selling products for dollars. To compensate, producers will respond to declining dollar values by raising prices. This is true of any industry, and the fuel sector is no exception. If inflation rises, expect gas prices to follow suit. 7
So, why do gas prices go up? Simply put all of the above. Many of the factors mentioned earlier play off of one another, such as distribution interruption and supply, and they are all always at play in influencing the price of gas, whether negatively or positively. Since the average person has effectively no influence on any of these factors, your best bet is to position yourself so that you are affected by rising gas prices as little as possible. Buying a hybrid car or some other efficient model is a good place to start.
However you prepare for the fluctuations of the gasoline market, you should always be prepared in case you find yourself out of gas one day. Learn more about what to do if you run out of gas.

3 reasons why gas prices are so high right now

Drivers are feeling the pain at the pump.

Gas prices in the US have hit a seven-year high.
Demand has increased as the economy reopened and Americans have begun driving more.
Meanwhile, supply has been constrained because of lower US production and OPEC decisions.

Americans are once again feeling pain at the gas pump, and it's because of a classic clash between rising demand and constrained supply.
An October report from AAA found that gas prices across the US hit their highest average levels since 2014 higher than they've been at any point since 2014.
It's gotten even worse since then. Data from the US Energy Information Administration, which found gas prices rising throughout 2021, hitting levels not seen since the middle of the last decade. Prices continued to spike throughout October, hitting an average of $3.40 a gallon on November 22:
The reasons for the price spike are textbook supply and demand from an economics textbook: Americans have gotten back to driving more this summer as the pandemic has moderated, and a combination of domestic supply interruptions and trouble in energy markets overseas have made crude oil more expensive.
Demand is up as Americans take to the road again
As with so many other aspects of everyday life, the COVID-19 pandemic radically changed how Americans travel. Lockdowns and the uncontrolled early spread of the virus led to canceled travel and a sharp reduction in commutes.
By summer 2021, however, Americans were back on the road. The number of vehicle miles traveled measured by the Federal Highway Administration plummeted in spring 2020, but in the last few months, highway traffic was back up to what would normally be seen in midsummer:
That increase in the amount of driving Americans are doing also means an increase in demand for fuel for cars.
US oil production and refining haven't kept up
In addition to that ramp-up in demand, there have been some big supply constraints as well.
The Energy Information Administration noted in mid-September that Hurricane Ida shut down a large swath of the US's oil drilling and refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico in late August.
While rigs and refineries have quickly come back online since, crude oil inventories remain low, suggesting an ongoing lack of supply. EIA wrote that as of late September, oil stored at Cushing, Oklahoma, one of the main crude depots in the US, was down 40% from the start of the year.
Other EIA data shows that crude oil inventories across the country remain subdued:
A crunch in domestic oil supply and stockpiles coupled with a rise in demand leads to higher gas prices.
Energy markets around the world are in a crunch
In addition to domestic oil supply slowing down, oil and energy markets overseas also aren't helping matters on the supply front.
OPEC and other major oil-exporting countries have repeatedly agreed to only modest increases in production, despite oil consumers like the US and India pushing for higher exports, according to CNBC. The cartel most recently agreed to increase production by just 400,000 barrels per day in December, after President Joe Biden directly called for more production to ease rising prices. But it's a delicate balance, as shown by some cartel members' response to Biden and other world leaders tapping their strategic oil reserves: a reported pause in ramping up production .
It also shows how the cartel of oil exporters still holds a huge amount of power in global oil markets, even as the US has vastly increased production over the last decade and countries around the world begin the process of moving toward greener energy sources.
Broader energy markets have been facing supply shortages as well. European natural gas and electricity prices have skyrocketed, and traders expect higher oil and other energy prices for months to come. Russia, a key provider of natural gas to the EU, has held back on increased deliveries to the West, keeping prices volatile and high.
Put together surging demand from the US reopening with supply crunches both domestic and global, and it should be no surprise that gas prices are spiking.

Why Gas Prices Might Not Come Down Anytime Soon
By Mohit Oberoi, CFA
Sep. 14 2021, Published 11:58 a.m. ET
Consumer price data for Aug. 2021, released on Sep. 14, showed that U.S. retail inflation rose 5.3 percent (annualized) during that month, and core inflation (which excludes food and energy) rose 4 percent. Whereas inflation eased from Jul. 2021, it was still high. Higher gas prices are contributing to the rise in inflation. Why is gas so expensive right now?

Gas prices in the U.S. are a function of both domestic and international factors. The biggest driver for gas prices is crude oil prices. Like all commodities, crude oil prices depend on supply-demand dynamics.
How are gas prices determined in the U.S.?
In the short term, market sentiment, refining costs, and refiner margins (reflected in crack spreads) are also factors in gas prices. Specific events or changes, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack or a change in taxation, can also affect them

Why are gas prices going up?
Gas prices have been going up in the U.S. due to crude oil prices rising. WTI is back above $70, and crude oil prices were higher as of Sep. 14 on fears that another storm could impact Texas oil production.

Energy "independence"... dead at 2 years old?
After 50 years of effort, the US became a net energy exporter in 2019, including no oil from Saudi Arabia last week (first time in 35 yrs). Sadly, the EIA now projects we will be a net importer in 2021 & 2022. #oil #recession

The U.S. oil and gas industry is also reeling from the impact of Hurricane Ida. Over the last couple of years, the U.S. has emerged as a key energy exporter. Trump saw boosting energy exports as a quick way to bridge the country’s massive trade deficit.

Why is gas so expensive right now?
Gas is pricey now that crude oil prices are higher, and higher energy prices are boosting inflation. As energy prices go up, so do transportation, logistics, and input costs for a lot of industries.

When will gas prices come down?
The near-term outlook for crude oil looks bullish. The economy's continued upward momentum bodes well for global oil demand. Whereas Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude oil prices to rise to $80 by the end of 2021, considering their current momentum, that could happen earlier. Higher crude oil prices would mean higher gas prices in the U.S. in 2021.

Another factor to watch would be the global COVID-19 situation. If the situation worsens and lockdowns are reintroduced, crude oil prices and gas prices in the U.S. could come down. Also, if the Fed decides to begin tapering at its September policy meeting, it could pressure risk assets, including commodities such as energy.

The Real Reason Gas Prices Are So High Right Now
It's not the Biden administration's energy policies nor Big Oil illegally manipulating prices.

On Wednesday, amid a fresh surge in gas prices, the Biden administration announced that it had asked the FTC to investigate whether oil and gas companies were doing anything illegal to manipulate prices. Republicans have countered that it’s a cheap political stunt and blamed President Joe Biden’s energy policies.
But the truth, experts say, is not as easy as either side makes it out to be. In fact, the biggest driver may not be oil companies or politicians. Instead, the price surge is largely driven by the whims of international producers and U.S. investors.
The cost of gas has risen 50% compared to last year, according to AAA data. That same data shows the average price of a gallon in the U.S. is $3.41, though a gallon is even more pricy in some states. California leads the way, with gas costing $4.70 per gallon on average.
“Big Oil is fueling climate change and siphoning money away from struggling families with high gas prices, all while spending huge sums lobbying climate deniers and preventing us from shifting gears to cheaper and cleaner alternatives,” Democratic Sen. Ed Markey tweeted Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry’s largest lobbying arm, blamed the administration for “cancel[ing] important infrastructure projects” (i.e. the Keystone XL pipeline) in a statement issued Wednesday.
When I asked Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, to explain what exactly drives the cost of gas at the pump on any given day, he laughed. “It’s both a simple question and a complicated one,” he said. “The simple explanation is it’s the cost of the oil, plus the cost of refining it, plus the cost of getting it to the refinery from the gas station, plus the cost of running a gas station, plus taxes. The thing is, every one of those things is complicated.”
There are many variables that go into determining how much each of those steps costs. But the price of crude oil is often what gets the most attention, thanks to how much they can change at the drop of a hat. Crude oil prices comprise the bulk of what comes after the dollar sign at the pump, and even a little bit of oversupply or a little less oil on the market can have a drastic shift on global prices.
“Oil prices are fundamentally the thing that are most volatile in that equation,” said Williams-Derry. “When you look at gas prices, you should be looking first and foremost at the price of oil.”
And contrary to the image that fossil fuel supporters like to project, oil and gas supply doesn’t move in a perfectly free market. Internationally, oil production is largely under the control of a literal cartel: the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. That coalition of 13 oil-producing giants, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Iran, has an outsize influence on production and prices globally. As of 2018, OPEC members controlled 79.4% of the world’s proven oil reserves.
“A lot of oil prices have to do with decisions by major producers, notably OPEC, whether to use their spare capacity,” Williams-Derry said.
Domestically, investors in American gas companies—which have seen a growing share of the world’s production over the past decade with the shale boom—have a lot of input on the moves producers in Texas and elsewhere in the country make.
Both OPEC and American companies just went through a major upheaval. The coronavirus pandemic drove oil demand so low that the price of a barrel of oil briefly hit negative dollars, down from highs around $100 a barrel before the pandemic. That volatility had some big ramifications as parts of the world try to get back to normal. OPEC ordered producers to significantly cut production when prices were bottoming out; even as prices are rising now, they’re sticking to their disciplined regimen, like a fitness fanatic faithfully following a no-carb diet.
In the U.S., investors are pretty spooked by both the covid-19 pandemic as well as the fact that the fracking boom produced too much oil, oversupplying the market and making prices fall. Lower prices mean less money to line their pockets. Williams-Derry said that during the shale boom, American oil companies were spending more on drilling than they were earning on the price of oil. As a result, U.S. investors, Williams-Derry said, “are now punishing anybody who produces.”
That lower supply and the now-rising demand have conspired to drive crude oil prices higher than they were last year. In this context, it’s easy to see that API and their supporters’ claims about the administration’s actions ring false. “Anybody who blames a politician for high prices is ignoring basic market dynamics,” Williams-Derry said. “Blaming someone who is in office today for a problem that started last year, that doesn’t make much sense.”

The flip side is also true. Here at Earther, we’re all for holding oil companies accountable for misdeeds (of which there are many ). But it’s unlikely that any FTC investigation will uncover anything that producers haven’t already been doing for decades, out in the open. When it comes to oil as a global commodity, contrary to what API claims, more oil on the market isn’t necessarily what producers want. Oil producers’ interests don’t always align with what’s best at the pump. Which itself is a pretty good argument for untethering the economy from fossil fuels.

I have worked in the oil industry fo r years, the ideas that a politician has any power, or that collusion occurs between oil companies are equally laughable. Oil prices are high, because when the cratered in 2020, multiple companies were wiped out and went bankrupt, no one drilled anything for about a year, and the existing wells declined. No one noticed or cared, because since eve ryone was stuck at the house, driving was limited. The few oil companies that remained used up all of their available credit to stay afloat. As vaccines became available and people starting driving and flying more, and prices rebounded, many of those companies who were scared by their recent experience hedged their o il at a price half of what it is now. For those that hedged at low prices, they do not have the money to drill more wells, they can barely make loan payments. And they cannot take out new loans on their assets, as banks were all impacted by the wave of bankruptcies, and are not excited about granting new loans. The compounding effect is that we have a bunch of old wells that are declining, did not drill many new wells for a year and a half, and do not have access to capital (because oil is hedged at $40, or banks won’t give out loans) to drill significantly more wells. Eventually this will loosen, but even then, most of the time it will take you four months to a year from the time a well started drilling, to the point where it is selling oil, so even if oil companies were inclined to rapidly increase drilling, it would be six months before anyone noticed. In the meantime, I recommend quit driving or flying, oil production only exists because consumers demand it, if you want a villain for climate change it is not Exxon, it is every person with an SUV, or Truck, who don’t carpool, casual flying etc.

No it’s not.
Maybe casual flyers can shoulder some of the blame, but I thought we had moved past blaming individual citizen s as the drivers of climate change when they make up a small fraction of carbon emissions. Many people would happily (and many begrudgingly) buy electric SUVs and trucks if reliable options existed. Many people would take public transportation if a safe and reliable system existed in their city. The fact is, there are many factors of individual persons’ hands that need action by local, state, and federal government to provide the cleaner options that are better for the environment. But companies like Exxon have lobbyists to stop politicians from passing laws that could offer more sustainable options for citizens.

Simple googling shows transportation and electricity are half of carbon emissions. Both of which us, the end consumer, have huge influence over.

and yet there will be people who will yammer on about it being Biden’s fault for canceling Keystone XL or not selling more new leases. They forget about demand dropping drastically last and all the impacts that had. At one point, the US was using as much gasoline as it did in the early 1970s.
“But he’s cutting our supplies and eliminating our energy independence!!!”
Yeah. By stopping a largely incomplete pipeline that would be used to IMPORT petroleum.
Sounds like a gift to US producers if you ask me.

The villain is Joe Biden and democrat policies. Looking back at history, every time the mid-east is destabilized petroleum has increased in price. Biden moved out of Afghanistan and cancelled the pipeline project. Those two actions provide the oil industry the reason to increase prices to cover dramatic changes in politics. Trump had the most stabile prices since the 1970's because of his politics. I worked in the oil industry.
Well owner’s have the thought that oil in the ground in money in the bank. They will restrict or shut off production for higher prices if there is any reason at all. Drilling companies buy up leases and they will just let it sit until they can get more money for their work. Unstable policies regarding taxes and new regulations give another reason.
Stabilizing the politics is the only way to stabilize petroleum prices. While there are a lot of green people, believe me, you don’t want to shut off petroleum.  You won’t have any plastic kayaks to use for protests nor electricity to warm up yourself in the winter time. Tires, won’t be available to bring your food, and cellphones are hardly something at this point that can be made with plants.

Being a Texan, I like to remind the grumpy GOPers I (often) come across that high gas prices means American oil workers have jobs. When gas prices drop, we see thousands of layoffs in the region. Therefore, high gas prices are pro-American jobs and you’ re a Marxist commie for trying to make Venezuela rich with cheap gas prices. For some reason, they don’t like hearing that.

What causes gas prices to rise?

SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) – While the national average price for a gallon of regular gas remains higher than we’ve seen in the last three years, prices are starting to dip slightly, according to a new report. But who – or what – is to blame for the current prices?
As AAA explains, the price we pay at the pump is largely dependent on driving habits and the supply of crude oil. The current dip in the national average price may be due to seasonal driving habit changes, according to AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports the total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 1.6 million bbl to 212.7 million bbl last week. The demand for gasoline dropped from 9.5 million b/d to 9.26 million b/d. This dip, paired with an increase in the domestic crude oil supply, caused downward pressure on prices, AAA explains.

So what else impacts the price of gasoline?
According to EIA, there are four factors impacting the price tag:
The cost of crude oil
Refining costs and profits
Distribution and marketing costs and profits
Taxes
As EIA explains, the cost of crude oil is the largest component of the price of gasoline. Crude oil prices are, in turn, impacted by seven other factors, including supply, demand, and financial markets. Taxes are also impacted by multiple components, including taxes imposed by federal, state, and local governments. Refining costs and profits will vary by season and region within the U.S., EIA says, and are impacted by demand as well.

Who owns a gas station can also impact the price at the pump. According to EIA, some stations are owned and operated by refiners while others purchase gasoline from refiners and marketers for resale. The price set by individual retailers can vary greatly depending on numerous factors like where the station is, what the local hiring market is like, state and local fees, and sources for supply.

While legislation can impact the price of gasoline, politicians – like the president – have limited control over what happens. The National Association of Convenience Stores reiterates the EIA, saying gas prices are largely dependent on oil prices, which are dependent on supply and demand. Presidential candidates may campaign on lowering gas prices but trends show that has yet to truly happen.

According to the NACS, as the last four presidents left office, gas prices were higher than when they entered office. Using EIA numbers, NACS shows:
Bill Clinton left office with gas prices 39 cents higher ($1.06 on Jan. 25, 1993; $1.47 on Jan. 22, 2001)
George W. Bush left office with gas prices 39 cents higher ($1.47 on Jan. 22, 2001; $1.84 on Jan. 26, 2009)
Barack Obama left office with gas prices 49 cents higher ($1.84 on Jan. 26, 2009; $2.33 on Jan. 23, 2017)
Donald Trump left office with gas prices 6 cents higher ($2.33 on Jan. 23, 2017; $2.39 on Jan. 25, 2021).
The organization notes the price during Trump’s administration was largely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic when demand dropped. GasBuddy data shows the price for gasoline dropped around May 2020 and has since been steadily climbing.
As AAA reports, the demand for gasoline has also been increasing as the price increases. Officials say when the demand decreases, oil companies pulled back on production. Now that the demand is climbing, some oil companies are still working to meet demand.
In its mid-November report, AAA says pump prices will likely remain high as long as oil prices remain above $80 per barrel. Check here for 10 driving tips that will help you save money as prices remain high.

Alright, so from these articles, I can see that gas prices are influenced by a variety of factors, but the main driver seems to be the cost of crude oil. Crude oil prices are affected by supply and demand dynamics, both globally and domestically.

During the pandemic, when many economies were locked down, there was a significant drop in demand for oil, leading to a decrease in production. As economies began to reopen and demand for oil increased, suppliers struggled to ramp up production quickly enough, leading to a supply crunch and higher prices.

Additionally, international factors like OPEC's production decisions and global events such as hurricanes impacting oil production and refining capacities have contributed to the rise in gas prices.

It's interesting to note that while politicians often get blamed for gas price fluctuations, the reality is that their influence is limited. Gas prices are largely determined by market forces, particularly supply and demand for crude oil.

I think understanding this helps to dispel some of the myths about who or what is responsible for gas price increases. It's not solely the fault of oil companies or government policies; it's a complex interplay of many factors.

Given this information, I can conclude that the current rise in gas prices is primarily due to increased demand as economies recover from the pandemic, coupled with constraints in oil supply due to production limitations and global market dynamics.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The cost of gas is rising primarily due to increased demand as economies recover from the pandemic and constraints in oil supply due to production limitations and global market dynamics.}} \]
