Alright, so I've got this question: "Are social media cleanses effective?" Hmm, interesting topic. I'm not entirely sure what a social media cleanse is, to be honest. I think it has something to do with taking a break from social media, but I'm not completely sure. Maybe I should look that up first.

What Does Social Media Cleansing Mean?
Social media cleansing refers to a person’s attempt to clean up his or her social media presence online, often for the purposes of helping them get a job. Employers often check out potential employees online. Therefore, potential employees who have posted pictures, comments or text that could prevent candidates from making a favorable impression on an employer may look to clean up their profiles.

Techopedia Explains Social Media Cleansing
According to a CareerBuilder survey taken in 2009, 45 percent of employers use social media sites to screen potential employees. In addition, most of the surveyed employers reported finding more negative information about potential hires than positive. The process of vetting candidates through social media is referred to as social media snooping, and it can cost candidates who may have posted embarrassing or unprofessional content on social media sites to miss out on a job. As such, job seekers may engage in social media cleansing by updating privacy settings, removing embarrassing photos and running searches on their names to turn up other areas where damaging information about them may appear online.

5 Potential Mental Health Benefits of Deleting Social Media
Thinking of going on a social media cleanse? Here's what you need to know.

If there were ever a time to think about taking a social media cleanse, it’s now. As we head into an election season marked by civil unrest and the new coronavirus pandemic, it’s tempting to throw your phone out the window or, at the very least, unplug. Whether it’s the latest pandemic news, rants from relatives with questionable political views, or FOMO-inducing vacation selfies from your friends—there’s never been a better time to consider a social media cleanse. But if you’re wondering how you can break away when the world seems to implode every few minutes, you’ve come to the right place. Below you’ll find everything you need to know about taking a social media cleanse, including more than a few benefits.
What is a social media cleanse?
"Social media cleanse"—a fancy term for taking a break from social media —has become a buzz-phrase in our increasingly plugged-in society. That’s probably because there’s a long history of what one might call “the celeb social media cleanse.” In December 2015, Ed Sheeran took an indefinite hiatus from Instagram. (He also stepped away in December 2019 and recently returned to announce his daughter's birth.) Demi Lovato, who has a historically tumultuous relationship with the Twitterverse, has stepped away from social media numerous times so that she doesn’t "have to see what some of y'all say." Chrissy Teigen, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and a handful of other celebs have all followed suit at different points—seeking respite from the realm of mirror selfies, nonstop notifications, and internet trolls, if only for a mere 24 hours. And we probably all know someone who at some point the past few years has taken time away from social media.
You might need a social media cleanse too.
Jut about anyone can absolutely benefit from taking a social media break. It all comes down to whether your time on social media is making you feel more connected or, well, less.
“Seeing others’ curated, polished images of only happy moments or attractive photos can set up an unrealistic expectation of ourselves and the destructive experience of constantly comparing oneself with others,” Christine Moutier, M.D., practicing psychiatrist and chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), previously told SELF.
She explained that we might find ourselves feeling more disconnected and isolated when we're overusing social media. This is especially true if you’re already dealing with self-esteem, anxiety, or depression (or general stress from a pandemic ). So if you’re feeling any of those feelings, it could be time to take a break.
Okay, but how do you do a social media cleanse?
In a world where we go live on Instagram to brush our teeth, it's no surprise many of us have glamorized the idea of taking a break from the digital and getting back to our pre-technology roots. But it’s not really that glamorous. It basically involves temporarily (or permanently) deactivating your social media accounts and deleting the apps from your phone for an extended period of time. This could be a few days, weeks, months, or even an entire year —the choice is yours.
It’s easy enough to delete a few apps from your phone, but if you’re worried about maintaining your cleanse, there are apps, like Freedom and Self Control, that can keep you from accessing Instagram and Facebook on your phone and computer as well.
Are there actual benefits to taking a social media cleanse?
Every time I step away from Twitter, or remove Instagram from my phone, or temporarily deactivate my Facebook account, the same questions arise: Is deleting social actually doing anything for my mental health? Are all those TikToks, Snapchat stories, Instagram double-taps, and Facebook updates impacting my life that much? Or am I just making these periodic forays into the land of no social media for naught?
I posed these questions to a couple of experts. Their consensus: Social media is associated with some bad stuff, but it's associated with a bunch of good stuff too. If you're feeling fine about your technology habits, there's no need to guilt yourself into a social media cleanse. But if your affinity for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, or any social media app is causing you a ton of stress or getting in the way of your life, then taking a break might be helpful. Here, six potential mental health benefits of a temporary social media cleanse.
1. It might help you sleep better.
Raise your hand if you sleep with your phone? This is a pretty common experience, but it can take a toll on your sleeping habits. As SELF previously reported, artificial light (like from your phone or your TV) can interfere with your body's production of melatonin—the hormone responsible for helping you get to sleep. So, yeah, looking into that brightly lit social media void right before you settle in for some shut-eye can disrupt your ability to fall asleep. (You're not doing yourself any favors when you try to assuage your insomnia by checking Instagram or scrolling through your Facebook feed either.) Needless to say, separating yourself from social media might lead you to spend less time on your phone—which might help you get to sleep faster.
2. It can help you to reprioritize more personal forms of interaction.
"Social media can be a great tool for keeping in touch with friends and family, but excessively using social media—at the expense of in-person interactions with friends or family—can negatively impact relationships and well-being," Jacqueline Nesi, a clinical psychology Ph.D. candidate at the University of North Carolina, tells SELF.
I know seeing friends and family IRL isn’t super realistic right now, but that doesn’t mean that all of our interactions have to happen through Instagram DMs. Consider getting creative: Try writing an actual letter (using the United States Postal Service) or making time to do video calls with the people you love instead of yelling on Facebook at people you haven’t actually seen in over 15 years.
3. It might help you relax a little bit more.
A 2017 meta-analysis published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking looked at 61 studies to assess the very common claim that excessive social media and technology use is associated with things like deceased self-esteem, loneliness, and depression. But the researchers warn these associations could be slightly overstated, and even if relationships exist between usage and bad stuff, that doesn't necessarily mean that technology and social media causes it.
Still, Jacob Barkley, Ph.D. and psychology professor at Kent State University, tells SELF that taking a break from technology could help some people mitigate anxiousness. For one thing, it could lessen the obligations some people associate with constant communication. Responding to new texts, emails, and Facebook messages nonstop can become stressful, and getting away from that—even for just a day—can feel great. (Barkley suggests setting up an automatic email reply to give people a heads up that you're on hiatus, so you don't have to worry about missing any urgent messages.)
4. It can help curb your FOMO.
Another huge plus of getting off social media? Avoiding the oh-so-daunting FOMO, or fear of missing out. "When you're linked up to this huge network through this one device, [you can] feel that where you are isn't where it's at," Andrew Lepp, Ph.D. and professor researching media use and behavior at Kent State University, tells SELF. "It's almost natural to think that among all these other places there must be one that's more interesting than where you are right now."
But obviously FOMO goes both ways. For some people, actively avoiding social media can create a FOMO all its own—for example, worrying that you'll miss a friend's big life announcement on Instagram or forget to wish someone a happy birthday because you missed a Facebook reminder.
5. It can free you up so that you have more time for other things.
The logic is simple: If you stop dedicating time to one thing, you free up for time for other things.
Getting out from behind a screen might inspire you to get out a little more. Maybe for a walk or some exercise (which is associated with a bunch of great things, including decreased anxiety, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America ). Lepp says he and his family go tech-free every Sunday—spending their time hiking or enjoying a nice meal togethe r instead. You might prefer to spend your time painting, going to the park, hanging out with friends, volunteering, working out, cooking, or doing a whole range of other things. The social media–free world is your metaphorical oyster; do with it what you will.
You can ease back into social media whenever you're ready.
Just as you’ve set the parameters for taking a social media break, you’re in charge of how you ease back in. During this time away, maybe you’ve figured out which social media platforms really stress you out. If so, you can decide to keep those off of your phone indefinitely. Or maybe this time away has inspired you to log back in and unfollow (or mute) some people so that you’re not seeing them on your feed. Maybe you loved your time away so much that you’ve decided to make this a quarterly (or weekly) thing.
As you ease back into life post-cleanse, you should also consider keeping any new hobbies or habits you picked up during your hiatus. If getting off of TikTok helped you get outside more, then—by all means—try to keep that momentum as you ease back into your normal social media routine.
Mostly, know that you can take small breaks whenever you want—you don’t need to call it a social media cleanse. You can just delete the apps anytime it’s stressing you out and redownload them when you’re ready.
A final reminder: There's no need to give up technology altogether if you don't want to.
This list of potential benefits is just that—a list of potential benefits. It's not a point-by-point thesis urging you to sacrifice your social media accounts to the technology-free gods. If you feel good about your level of social media use, keep doing your thing. If you don't, then you might consider changing things up—but even then you don't have to drop everything. You could take a break from social media once a week, or delete some apps from your phone, or simply put your phone into airplane mode for an hour or so each week. You have plenty of options. And the most important thing is that you do what makes the most sense to you.

Social Media Clean Up - A How-To with Tips From 32 Experts

Shares
With social media, it’s so easy to hide behind a screen and hit “send” that you don’t always consider the consequences of your digital footprint. Although social media networks, like Instagram, allow you to connect with like-minded people from all over the world, every comment or photo you post could potentially harm your reputation later on in life. This is where a social media clean-up comes in handy.
A social media clean-up may include anything from updating Facebook privacy settings to deleting questionable posts from Twitter. These small changes could potentially save your teen from a college rejection letter or even prevent a scandal during the job application process.
Keep scrolling to learn more about the importance of a social media clean-up and how it can improve your child’s online presence.
1. Know what is out there
‍ Andrew Selepak, Social Media Professor, University of Florida
Andrew Selepak
The best way for students to clean up and protect their online presence is to do a regular social media audit. Students should reexamine their Instagram posts, go back through their Twitter posts with Advanced Search, check their TikTok videos, and review their daily Facebook Memories notifications for posts that no longer accurately reflect their views or could damage their reputation.
Too often we make posts when we are emotional that don't accurately reflect our true views or at least our more articulate and subdued views, or posts we made when we were younger that embarrass us today.
While it is always important to pause before making a social media post that might be made in anger or despair, it is just as important to pause and review any old posts that were made under similar emotional distress, or made without thinking. Parents and educators should also remind students that posts made today for likes, comments, and follows, could be the same posts that prevent a student from getting a job, internship, or letter of recommendation tomorrow.

2. Ask yourself, “Would I be proud to have this accredited to me?”
‍ Michelle Enjoli, Founder, Connect with Michelle Enjoli
Michelle Enjoli
Social media has become a powerful tool that can be extremely beneficial or destructive to a student’s online presence based on the content they share and their use of it.
The number one piece of advice that I give to students when discussing their social media profiles is to think about the content they share on each platform. When deciding on what content to share or what conversations to take part in, a good question to ask yourself is, “If this post or conversation were to make it on national television and accredited to me, would I be proud?” If the answer is no, do not share or participate in the dialogue.
If you are looking for ideas for content that would be appropriate for you to share, think about your future. What profession do you see yourself in? Follow the accounts of people in that profession for motivation, inspiration, and education. Take a look at what they post and who they follow as well for additional ideas on how to position yourself on social media.
I also suggest routinely cleaning up your accounts by deleting inappropriate posts, comments, and other social media users that negatively affect you.
3. Remove content that would damage your reputation
‍ Aaron Simmons, Founder, Test Prep Genie
Aaron Simmons
Remove suggestive, offensive, and explicit photos and posts. Frankly, you really shouldn’t be uploading things like these on the internet because so many people can use it to invade your privacy.
If you have posted tweets, shared posts, or uploaded photos and videos of you drinking or doing something you shouldn’t, it’s best to hide it in a private folder or better yet, delete it altogether.
Do you like doing volunteer work or at-home projects? Share them. This will help build up your character which will give you better chances of getting accepted.
Remove all accounts from shady websites. Websites like JustDeleteMe are very helpful for this task. It’ll automatically detect the email address you use on your account and show you all the websites you have registered it in as well as the instructions on how to delete your account.
Bottom line: It’s important to build a positive online presence to keep yourself safe online. It becomes even more important if you are trying to appeal to a college or university. To create a positive image, try removing explicit, offensive, or suggestive photos and posts, post about positive things like volunteer work or creative projects, and clean your account of dubious websites.
4. Think about your personal data
Rob Shavell
Rob Shavell, CEO, Abine/Delete Me
Personal data has long been recognized as a vulnerable threat vector for modern cybersecurity. When it comes to data safety, people themselves are often their own worst enemies.
By oversharing on social media, people can compromise their own security.
Use a proactive data broker removal service
One of the biggest threats to data privacy comes from publicly available information, collected, collated, and sold by people search sites and data brokers. A subscription-based service (like DeleteMe) scans the net for users’ data on these sites and coordinates its removal on the subscribers’behalf.
Doing so removes ammunition for hackers looking to send phishing emails or break into corporate accounts with easy to guess passwords. It also reduces targeted advertising, such as robocalls. Reducing third-party access to personal information also minimizes the chance that targeted doxxing or online harassment will be successful.
5. Know the Rules
‍ Melissa Lowry, Melissa Lowry Education Coaching
Melissa Lowry
Social media provides teenagers with a window to the world, a portal through which they can connect with others, form & nurture relationships, support causes in which they believe, and express themselves in clever and unique ways. Establishing a positive digital footprint, however, is not as easy as it sounds, so teens should always consider few simple rules.
The "Golden Rule":
If you wouldn’t want someone to post something about you, you shouldn’t post it about someone else.
The "24-Hour" rule:
Posting angry or explosive comments in the heat of the moment can leave you with regrets. Give yourself a 24-hour “cooling off period” before posting anything angry or explosive. You may very well find that your viewpoint has changed once you’ve let an issue sit for 24 hours.
The "10 O’Clock News" rule:
Before posting pictures or videos, answer the question, “Would I want to see this on the 10 o’clock news?"
The "Leave Them Wanting More" rule:
We’ve all encountered someone who gives us TMI: Too Much Information! Social media is not your personal billboard to the world. You do not need to post every photo, say everything you feel, or selfie yourself to death. In other words, leave your followers wanting more!
The "Internet is Forever" rule:
Once you’ve posted, blogged, texted, commented, hit record, or clicked a snapshot, what you’ve posted is on the Internet forever. Yes. Forever. Refer to the four rules above if that still hasn’t sunk in!
6. Make reviewing and cleaning a practice
Mo Mulla
Mo Mulla, Founder, Parental Questions
Some tips on how to clean up your old social media posts include:
Review your posts and delete any that are no longer representative of your current beliefs or ideas
Remove any identifying information (e.g. your location, contact info) from your posts
Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your post.
Make it a practice to regularly review your social media posts and delete any that are no longer relevant
Set a time to clean up your social media posts and online profile quarterly, yearly, or as needed. Know what you want to keep and what you want to delete
7. Go way back
Jonathan Tian
Jonathan Tian, Co-Founder, Mobitrix.com
Strategies to clean up older social media posts:
Go way back into your history
Assess ALL your older posts. Analyzing all the posts from the launch of a social media account to the present day is important. Although you might not realize how different you were when you launched your account for the first time, make sure to check out all those accounts, whether you use them now or not.
Deactivate older accounts
If you have any social media accounts you have stopped using, deactivate those accounts. In some instances, it’s best to delete those accounts entirely if they aren’t being used anymore. You don’t want a college admissions officer or ahiring manager to find a long-lost account on social media and see those rubbish posts.
8. Does it pass the “Grandma test”?
Zach Reece
Zach Reece, Chief Operating Officer, Colony Roofers
As an employer, one of the first things I do when considering a new employee is to check their social media profiles. I can tell you that it can be a dealbreaker when a person has a very inappropriate social media presence.
I recommend reviewing your social media profiles at least once per year. I compare it to cleaning your room; the less frequently you do it, the longer it will take to clean your room when you eventually do it because more dirt will have piled up.
My general recommendation for deleting versus keeping posts is the Grandma test: If you believe that you can say or show the content of your post to your grandmother in person, then don’t delete it. But if you couldn’t fathom telling your grandmother or other loved one this in person, then you probably shouldn't be saying it at all, so you should delete it.
9. Think twice about pranks (old or new)
Jeremy Hulls
Jeremy Hulls, Senior Editor, Family Destinations Guide
I understand that pranks are one of the ways to create strong bonds with friends. However, pranksters are walking on a thin line between what's funny and what's embarrassing.
I've seen old prank videos from my own social media and I just realized that the prankee isn't having fun. He had a small smile but his head was facing downward. It just seems like he was embarrassed, and the smile he
had was just out of peer pressure. I believe that since everyone around is smiling, it may give the impression that everyone is having a good time.
*I deleted it.*
I strongly believe that pranks should only be posted with the consent of the prankee. If you're not sure if you should post it or not, ask the person who's at the receiving end of the prank.
10. Mean what you post
‍ Michele Ramsey, Associate Professor, Communication Arts & Sciences and Women’s Studies, Penn State Berks
Michele Ramsey
One of the first things I talk about with students is that nothing posted online is private.
Ever.
So if students use bad judgment when posting on social media, that momentary lapse of judgment can stick with them for years to come. We all make mistakes, have lapses in good judgment, and are just plain imperfect humans.
Sometimes we have opinions at one point in our lives that we look back on later and can’t imagine ever having. But with the advent of social media, those momentary lapses or opinions borne of ignorance can follow and define students for years. Cache files and screenshots mean nothing is ever really deleted, either. So thinking carefully about posts is very important.
One of the constant refrains I hear from people who don’t want to be told what they can or can’t or should or shouldn’t post on social media is that it’s a free speech issue. Students must be willing to accept the consequences of what they post, which can never be “taken back,” no matter how many times they apologize or swear that they “didn’t mean” what they said.
In terms of social media overall, students are usually surprised to learn how many future employers look at social media when hiring. And while most realize that they are taking risks if they post something problematic on a social media site, they often don’t realize that posting only bland material isn’t good for them, either.
Organizations actually do want to see that students have a life with friends, family, and events. They want to see students fitting in with people and having fun. If students don’t have any of those types of posts, employers may assume that they’ve wiped all the potentially negative messages from their profile and wonder why nothing is left and/or assume that they’re not social and may not fit into their organization. Thus, students are often surprised to learn that they should be posting appropriate pictures from typical life events like beaches or weddings or the like.
In their posts, students should:
Include expressions of gratitude for people who help them
Use appropriate humor
Show support for others
Add to discussions that support the brand they’re creating for themselves linked to their majors/careers
Share the stories/memories about their life without overly dramatic tones or deep secrets
Students should not post about illegal activities, bullying communication, trashing of teachers or complaining about school/classes, any images that others could see as negative, or anything that they wouldn’t be fine with being posted on a public billboard with their name attached.
Also, students should not post when emotional. I encourage students to write those feelings down somewhere else, not online. Finally, students shouldn’t retweet or repost the posts of others that might be inflammatory. Once someone posts something that someone else has said, that student “owns” that post as if they’d been the original poster themselves.
It’s important to know that most companies use social media for hiring and pay attention to grammar and spelling in addition to the content of posts. So, I also talk to students about using social media to create their brands.
Crafting an online brand means that they identify what makes them compelling or different and communicate those things to the world. Ways to create a brand online include blogs and social media posts that help define who they are and what they have to offer as a professional that others do not.
11. Customize your private settings
Valerie Barnett
Valerie Barnett, Founder, PleasingCare
This is one thing I do to keep my profile private and exclusive for the people I personally know. I usually do this on my social media accounts to ensure that my profile isn't exposed to the public eye. You can do this by going to your privacy settings and customizing it with the features available. There are options there where people can't search you by your name. Whereas, there will be no Google Search results about you as well.
If people can still find you on social media, such as Facebook, you can turn on the Only Me or Only Friends feature where your photos and posts are only visible to you and your personal friends. Aside from that, you can also make use of their new feature, Lock My Profile, which locks your entire profile and your information is hidden. Even your profile picture is not clickable.
By doing this, you are adding an extra layer of safety and protection from people who want to get access to you and your private information. In this present time where people are very advanced and always find a way to take advantage of other people, it would be best if you always think of a way, as well, to always keep a step ahead.
12. Delete posts without a purpose
Johnathan Smith
Johnathan Smith, Founder, CamperGuide
One way to maintain and keep a clean online footprint on your social media accounts is to manually delete unnecessary posts that were meant just for fun, or a purpose you don’t currently identify within your life.
Only keep those posts that you consider important. Now, this method would take time since you’ll have to scroll through past posts. You can also choose to delete your entire account and start a new and fresh account that can be more private and for professional use.
Cleaning your online footprint can be very useful most especially when you are trying to apply for a job. Having well-maintained social media accounts leaves a good impression on employers which will enable you to obtain a higher chance of getting hired.
Aside from that, keeping your information exclusive for your family and personal friends prevents you from fraudulent activities since all your confidential details are kept private and not visible to the public eye.
13. Use yourself as an example to teach your kids
Sharon Van Donkelaar
Sharon van Donkelaar, CMO, Expandi
Parents can show their kids how easy it is to find information about other people online. Sometimes that information is sensitive, and sadly, we're the ones that have put it there in the first place.
Doing a search can help you see what you don't like, and what needs to be gone. Listing the social media sites that you have created profiles on, revisiting them, and deleting the ones that you don't use anymore takes time, but it's actually quite simple to do as long as you have access to the email you used.
Deleting sensitive info and comments that you posted in the past helps you stay safe, and learn what you should and should not post for everyone to see in the future.
14. Look up old account usernames and passwords
Cindy Corpis
Cindy Corpis, CEO, SearchPeopleFree.net
Audit your social media accounts
You have to audit your accounts which you have created online. An audit is essential if you have opened many accounts over time for gaming, socializing, even online shopping. All those accounts are easy to forget but essential to manage.
Delete and deactivate
You need to find your older social media accounts, delete all the posts, and deactivate accounts, which you don’t need.
You might even see that your browser might have saved your older passwords and usernames. In case you have forgotten your username, rummage through your email inboxes to search email messages from the websites that may contain the username. On most sites, you can follow their account look-up process to get your account details back. Then, deactivate those web accounts and posts.
15. Keep or delete: Make the decision
Erik Nilsson
Erik Nilsson, Father, Teacher, & Founder of BookSummaryClub
You can begin by Googling yourself. It sounds simple, but you can dig up many unwanted social media posts, blogs, content, etc., that you don’t want anyone to see.
These negative posts or comments could be a make-it-or-break-it moment for an Admissions Officer or future employer. So, begin by addressing any risky content or inappropriate photos you are tagged in.
The easiest way to steer clear of any such situation is by changing your privacy settings in those old accounts. One setting, for example, will not allow anyone to tag you without your consent.
Social media users should look back on their profiles when applying for a job or higher education. In recent years, background checks and Google searches have become quite common to double-check what the candidate said in an interview.
Hence, clearing your profile of anything offensive that might lower your chances of acceptance should be removed. Here is a list of red flags to look for when deciding whether to keep or delete your old messages:
Delete pile
• Any provocative videos, pictures, or posts
• Explicit photos that include the use of drugs
• Racist or discriminatory comments
• Complaints about the past workplace
• Cynical memes or posts
Keep pile
• Profile content that reflects professionalism
• Content that shows your positive views
• Posts that highlight your personality
16. Do your old posts mirror your ideas today?
Paul Sherman
Paul Sherman, Chief Marketing Officer, Olive
Consider whether you need to just delete the posts on your social media profiles or delete your accounts altogether.
Some people have had social media accounts since they were teenagers and, unsurprisingly, find that the
things they said back then aren’t consistent with their current beliefs. However, others will find that their use of social media, in general, doesn’t align with who they are today.
Whichever person you are, you need to think about whether you still derive value from using social media – in which case, just delete old posts that are inappropriate – or if you simply don’t want to be on social media at all anymore – you need to delete your accounts and all your data.
17. Set a reminder on your calendar
Anthony Martin
Anthony Martin, CEO & Founder, Choice Mutual
Make it a habit to review your Facebook Memories after auditing all your social media accounts. It can be an effective way to ensure your posts remain clean.
Set a reminder on your phone, say every six months or so, to review all your posts. Reiterating real-life stories about how people have gotten fired from jobs for what they post online can also help support the reasons behind why you should review and delete negative posts.
Continuing to review your posts is essential since you never know if a bad comment will capture the attention of your future employer or someone who will write a recommendation letter.
You might have accidentally posted something that might be misinterpreted or was created during an emotional time. These thoughts/comments you made when you’re young can become an issue when you’re older, when it reflects your integrity, damaging your reputation. This can negatively impact your ability to secure the job you want when your employer reviews your social media profiles.
18. Take inventory, start scrubbing, and build a positive digital footprint
‍ Adam Reynolds, Web Designer/Developer, Clarion Univ. of Pennsylvania
Adam Reynolds
For students, social media has been around for most of their lives, and today’s students are likely on at least one platform every day.
If you ask a student who their favorite celebrities are, you might be surprised by what you hear. You may find athletes and movie stars on their list, but other names might pop up that you’ve never heard of. Social media stars and influencers often take the top spots as more of the entertainment students consume comes in the form of user-generated content.
As an unfathomable amount of content is generated, there is a draw for students to create content themselves. And with so many young adults creating content, they want to stand out from the crowd.
Creating a business or brand online used to be something you’d do in addition to your personal accounts, but now it’s not uncommon for your personal account to be a part of your brand. That means having your personal accounts cleaned up and ready for the world to scour.
Tips on ways students can clean up their social media feeds:
Take an inventory of your posts often
If you post a lot, look back at your content and see if any posts might be less than desirable
Delete posts that you think might cause you trouble
Try to view your posts through other people’s eyes: potential employers, family, friends, etc.
Set yourself a standard for posting in the future
Post content that is true to you, and stick to it
‍ Tips for creating a positive digital footprint:
Stop and think before you post
Your social feeds might be the only real window someone has into your life. Try to make the message you’re putting out there positive and real, setting yourself apart from the noise
Show the good and the real
There is a thirst for real and positive content in today’s social media climate: always be genuine and kind
Steer clear of fake positivity and fake drama
19. Start with a Google search, think before posting, and remove inactive accounts
Andrea Paul
‍ Andrea Paul, Founder & CEO, Health Media Experts
Check yourself on Google
Check out your name with a Google search. If there is something you don’t want to show, visit the site and remove the content. Check your interaction places, for example, discussion forums, comments sections on your feed, and the places where you are mentioned.
Remove content you don’t want to show
Immediately delete things you don’t like rather than keeping it and thinking a lot about it. Delete those images that you don’t want to show to your future employer.
Limit access
Set up a limit on your social accounts. Do not allow your friends, or anyone, to tag you in their posts or photos so that you don’t have to clean additional posts on your feed later.
Think before posting
Appear what you are and don’t post something that can risk your reputation.
Avoid unnecessary postings, which you might delete later. It would be best if you explore more on social media instead of posting more about yourself. Follow the rule of 80/20: 80 percent about others, and 20 percent about yourself.
Delete inactive accounts
You should delete the accounts that have your personal information, or there may be the risk of hacking.
Review account permissions
Check out the apps you have granted permission to a social media feed and if you’re not using the app, then take back the granted approval.
20. Before deleting your accounts, be sure to delete individual posts or photos
‍ Arash Fayz, Executive Director, LA TUTORS 123
Arash Fayz
In order to maintain a positive social media presence, students should consider setting their social media profiles to ‘private’ or ‘locked’ so that only friends can view them.
However, they should also be aware that even if their profiles are set to private, there is still the possibility of their school or classmates accessing their profiles. Students should be cognizant of what they post and not post anything they wouldn’t want screen-grabbed by another student or shared with anyone outside their immediate social circles.
If students decide to leave a social media platform for whatever reason, they should be aware that many platforms will archive their posts or information.  Therefore if there is information they don’t want made public on that platform, they should make sure to update their pages or delete individual posts or photos before deactivating their accounts.
Students should also be wary of the material being posted and shared within their social circles online. Students should make sure any articles or information they share or repost comes from a credible source.
21. Do an audit and improve your content with positive posts
‍ Aisha Marshal, Co-founder, Creative Label
Aisha Marshal
Complete a biography audit and begin to think of your Instagram bio as your resume. Be sure to include your name, an appropriate description, contact, call to action, etc.
Closely monitor your tagged photos. Be sure all images you are tagged in properly represent you and your personal brand
Showcase your community initiatives. Are you involved in charities or volunteer projects? Showcase these social impacts on your feed and in a highlight reel
Delete your oldies (If you still have older social profiles that no longer reflect you, delete them)
22. Moving forward, build a proactive strategy instead of spontaneous reactions
‍ Mark Beal, Assistant Professor of Practice in Public Relations, Rutgers University School of Communication and Information, and author of Engaging Gen Z
Mark Beal
Building a positive online presence for today’s students requires a proactive strategy versus a spontaneous reaction. Reacting on social media is being impulsive and mistakes will be made. ‍
Students, as they prepare for their transition to a career, should aspire to be ‘social media thought leaders.’ Based on their areas of interest, study, and career goals, they should strategically and consistently post relevant content on social media that positions them as a thought leader.
Content can include sharing articles as well as publishing and distributing original content featuring their point-of-view on a timely topic. Additionally, proactive and positive thought-leadership content online should go beyond mainstream social channels and extend to platforms such as LinkedIn, blogs, and even producing their own podcast.
23. Implement the Swear Jar Method
‍ Heinrich Long, Privacy Expert, Restore Privacy
Heinrich Long
The Swear Jar Method creates good habits for life. I’d start by reviewing what is and isn’t appropriate to post on social media.
What kind of thoughts, words, and content should be removed? That’s something you can decide together as a family, depending on the age of the student.
From there, institute a swear jar approach. Every time you put out negativity online – whether that’s a mean post, an inappropriate one, insulting someone, swearing online, doing something unproductive, or unnecessarily negative – you put a dollar in the jar. That should reinforce good habits online.
When the jar is full, it can be donated to an institution that helps end cyberbullying. That will motivate students to be on their best behavior and will remind them that it is their duty to uphold a standard for their online presence.
This creates good habits into adulthood when they will be immensely grateful to have a squeaky clean social media presence and to not have Facebook remind them of that time they said something inexcusable, or of that picture of underage drinking.
24. Be sure to audit who and what you follow and like online
‍ Jennifer Will, Editor, Etia
Jennifer Will
First of all, we should unfollow accounts that we are not interested in. It can be anything from food accounts to rival exes. This will not only make your feed less messy but also more positive.
Also, you don’t have to be present on all of the platforms like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc. You can cut back your activity by deleting some of the apps that you don’t use that frequently.
‍ Lastly, your feed is directly related to the comments, likes, and posts that you share and make. So, if you want to have a positive feed, you just have to focus on positive posts on social media.
25. Highlight your accomplishments and make sure that everything you post is positive
‍ Dianna Taylor, High School English Teacher, QuickQuote.com
Dianna Taylor
Most employers will find you on social media before setting up an interview. This happens because of the many people who have a negative, inappropriate social presence.
Many students are driven by their likes and shares, so they sometimes post without thinking. In the moment, they don’t realize that the wrong online personality could take away the chances of a job or even a friendship.
In order to keep your online footprint positive, it’s important to get rid of any pictures or posts that appear overly negative or divisive. Everyone should have a voice, but you have to be smart about what you make permanent.
Make sure you keep your personal sites clean. Make a professional profile to highlight your strengths and accomplishments. If you choose to post publicly, don’t say or do anything you wouldn’t want your future boss to see.
The best idea is to limit your social media privacy. With that said, even private posts and content are not guaranteed to stay that way. Anyone can take a screenshot and share your information within seconds.
26. It’s better to have a social media presence than to not have one at all
‍ Denise Walsh, BDW LLC
Denise Walsh
In today’s world, social media feeds play a significant role in defining a person’s personality. It is very likely that any employer, before hiring you, will look up your social media profiles.
You may have posted stuff for fun throughout your life, but it must be filtered before you enter your professional life. Not having a social media presence can also play a negative role in hiring; the employer will not interview you if they can’t find anything about you.
So, what methods should we use to filter our social media feeds?
Start by reviewing your media files shared, remove any inappropriate photos or videos
Remove any political posts, discriminatory comments, or any complaints about your previous employer
Keep the content that shows your positive side; information that shows your professionalism and depicts your integrity and responsibility
Think like an employer when reviewing your profile, and ask yourself if you would hire you
Edit your ‘About Me’ on your social media account updated and make it look professional
If you have a blog, that’s good, but make sure it shares a positive image of yours; you may need to remove some of the content if it depicts otherwise
The content you make public on your profile must be very carefully selected
‍
27. Utilize the “Memories” tab on Facebook to bulk edit your old posts
‍ Cat Smith, Get Social with Cat
Cat Smith
It’s so easy for students to put something out on social media that they’ll later regret. Almost no one has a spotless online presence. Facebook accounts can go back 10+ years.
Yes, that is 10+ years’ worth of old opinions, emotional moments, and random polls that accidentally give out personal data. Just imagine going from ten years old to twenty in today’s online world. It could be very embarrassing.
One of my favorite features of Facebook is the “Memories” tab. This page is available on the left side menu under “Explore” or via the lower right menu in the app. Conveniently, your notifications and feed will give you a reminder that “you have memories,” so you don’t have to remember to visit that page every day.
Once you’ve clicked through to the Memories page, you will see all of the posts you made every year on this day, going back to when you joined Facebook. Trying to clean up your web presence as a whole can be a daunting task filled with anxiety. This is a convenient way to go back in time and take out things you wish you hadn’t said or shared.
You should always be hyper-vigilant about what opinions you share publicly because even if your profile is set to “private” and you pick and choose your friends, posting online is a PUBLIC forum. Think of the Memories Tab as your personal time machine to go back and fix the small mistakes in your digital footprint.
28. Create profiles on high domain authority websites
‍ Sameer Somal, Blue Ocean Global Technology
Sameer Somal
Online reputation is everything. We are presented with opportunities based on our reputations.
Today, we interact with friends, family, and colleagues largely through text messages, email, and social media, where perception and reality are often confused.
Google and other search engines have made it easy to search for anything online. The emergence of social media allows negative comments to be shared and circulated among large numbers of internet users.
Students must take proactive measures to build a positive digital reputation; they must also prevent and address negative or defamatory content.
Some digital assets that can be considered for proactive reputation management include:
Have an active social media presence and coordinated approach for sharing content on LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram
Do a Google search for your name and evaluate your online presence
Create profiles on high domain authority websites like Behance, and about.me, resume.com to build an online presence
Set up Google Alerts or Mention Alerts to help you keep track of content being published and curated about you
Use Facebook privacy permission settings to set who can tag you in a photo or post in order to prevent any reputational damage that an inappropriate image shared by a friend/acquaintance may cause
29. Review your Google search results
‍ Amy Kilvington, Blinds Direct
Amy Kilvington
First, revisit your privacy settings and make sure your profiles have your desired privacy level. On Facebook, you can also see how other people view your page by clicking ‘View as’ on your profile.
Your goal may be to ensure that all posts are private and the only images that are publicly available are your profile and cover photos. Make sure any embarrassing pictures are also removed! An easy way to do this is to bulk delete photo albums that may contain images you don’t want new colleagues or hiring managers to see.
There are also tools available (both free and paid) to scan through your social media profiles and flag any potentially embarrassing, offensive, or controversial posts, including comments you’ve left on other people’s content. One to consider is Scrubber.
Search yourself on Google to see what content you rank for. If anything comes up that you’re not happy with, be sure to delete it from the appropriate website or social channel. If you don’t have the ability to do this, you can submit an EU Privacy Removal to Google. Once approved, certain web content that relates to your name can be deleted from the search results (although it won’t be deleted from the web completely).
30. For a fresh start, delete all social media posts before a given date
‍ Justin Lavelle, PeopleLooker.com
Justin Lavelle
Building a positive digital footprint takes more than a post or two in the morning. It is an ongoing process throughout each day that many people do not have time for. Cleaning up old social media posts to create a more positive digital footprint poses a major challenge for many students, especially when they have hundreds, even thousands, of posts over a number of years.
If you would like a fresh start, begin by giving yourself a deadline. Additionally, websites like Hootsuite, TwitterDeck, and HubSpot allow users to manage their social media posts, track followers, schedule upcoming content, and more for little to no cost.
31. Avoid sharing content that you wouldn’t want your teacher or potential employer to see
‍ Katy Lowe, Passion Digital
Katy Lowe
There are a few steps that students can take to ensure that their digital footprint is positive and won’t affect any of their future career prospects or opportunities.
Don’t post negative, hateful, harmful, or offensive things on your social media page (you can search through your old content to make sure that none of this content still exists from when you were younger)
Don’t engage with negative or harmful content
Remember that everything you post online can stay there forever, and could also be seen by anybody
Avoid sharing content that you wouldn’t want your teacher or potential employer to see
Sometimes strong or controversial opinions are better left off social media – writing can easily be misconstrued or taken out of context
Ensure your privacy settings are set to what you want them to be (many people aren’t actually aware of what their privacy settings are)
32. Encourage positive online behaviors by teaching students password security
‍ Victoria Merinda, HighSpeedInternet.com
An important part of creating a positive experience online is to educate your kids about online password security. Having their social media accounts or phones fall into the wrong hands could potentially lead to inappropriate postings on their accounts, or their information being compromised.
It’s important for family members to sit down together and explain the importance of the information they post online and how to keep their online accounts safe. One tip is to make sure you have a long password, which is a lot harder for hackers to figure out than a password that’s filled with numbers and symbols.
You can choose stronger passwords like “goosegerbilcoffeeiphonepluto” instead of weaker ones like “Sc# 3m@t1c ”. Why is the first option stronger? New guidelines show substituting numbers or other characters for letters doesn’t make passwords as hard to crack as increasing password length does.
Though it may sound simple, creating a strong password and knowing the dangers of a hacked account are Internet basics that everyone should know.
Conclusion
Once your student has spent some time online, it’s important for them to clean up their social media content regularly. This is especially important if they’re going through the college admissions (or hiring) process. Social media mistakes can happen to anyone, no matter how prepared they may be. So learning how to clean up those mistakes is a vital part of having a positive digital footprint. When students follow the steps above, they ensure that their online reputation is a positive reflection of who they are.

What is Social Media Detox & Why is it Good for You?
ListsWhat is Social Media Detox & Why is it Good for You?
Salorita Mohanty Raw_iamSalo 10 months ago
Detoxification or detox is generally a term used for consciously refraining from excess use of any particular substance, product, service or simply habit that has affected the normal lifestyle or nature.
We all know about the detox diets that were FAD a few years back and some still follow it where they believe that the particular adaptation of nutrient intake helps them eliminate toxic body elements. While detox drinks are still a thing in the food and health industry, social media detox is yet to be a prominent matter in our societies. Right from drug detox to social media detox everything is essential for the life most of us crave in the future.
It is not a new thing to know that too much of everything can be poisonous at times and deserves some specific attention and remedial solutions. Even though we are a brand that deals with video intelligence and everything digital, we too agree that a break is a must to keep ourselves sane in this overly fast-paced, AI-run, smart world.
Why do we need a Social Media Detox?
As we keep mentioning how the number of daily active users on Instagram goes up by millions each day, we are also aware of the potential of damage it can cause to humans. While some 100 million users increased in the last 2 months on Twitter and Facebook, we can google up the average number of hours that people spend on them.
It was calculated in 2020 that on an average basis an individual spends up to 2 hours a day on social media. This is an overwhelming account of time that people can spend scrolling through social media platforms and browsing mostly entertainment on their phones. It is also a precursor for the changed norms of doing business and ongoing cultures.
There have been professions like the digital marketer and social media manager that are growing popular and becoming first priority of the youth these days. However, apart from the business demands and work culture adjustments, it is very essential as well as helpful for professional to consider social media detox at the weekends or vacations.
There are several studies that have suggested the negative impacts of excessive incorporation of digital media in life. Right from affecting our emotions, creating a mental health imbalance, continuous sense of competition to a weird detachment from the reality of life. While our work cultures and professional demands may want us online for a specific period of the day, it is important to realise that this life needs to go on a break.
Here are a few pointers that will help you note the requirements for a social media detox.
Drives in insecurity: too much social media can make an individual hyper-competitive and drive them into insane heights of comparison with their counterparts all the time.
Breach of privacy: Social media is definitely an easy medium to share information, images and videos. It is also the most convenient place for companies, frauds and other groups to get that information in many ways.
Instils FOMO: The fear of missing out on information, news, trends etc. is a problematic thing these days. Everyone is too obsessed with knowing about what, who, where and when than themselves and their life.
Mental health lapses: It is no doubt that too much social media has led people on to some very sedentary, unhealthy and stressful situations. Everything affects mental health in the most worrisome conditions. Probably a reason why we are noticing an increased rate of therapy promotions, abrupt behaviour at workplaces and much more.
Social Media Detox and Leading Good Life
Apart from the several authentic studies that report social media detox as an effective remedy against deteriorating mental health and other related concerns, most of us have already faced the wrath as personal experiences. Too much social media addiction is hazardous for mental as well as physical health.
Starting from issues growing of lack of creativity, problematic attention spans, inability to recognise or react to the simple things to horrifying panic attacks and unending anxiety pangs. All of this can happen due to less to no social media detox.
Many people resolute to consider social media detox for themselves yet fail to stick by the conditions. Moreover, there is a noticeable pattern where more social media detox leading to a decrease in daily active users on social media platforms is seen during the New years that gradually grows with time. Such sudden abstinence, following the lifestyle trend and popularity of detox mechanisms, appears temporary. Hence, people must look for a planned, conscious, healthy, effortless ways to experience the social media detox.

Reset: The Benefits of a Social Media Detox - Hustle Escape
Reset: The Benefits of a Social Media Detox
A social media detox can bring about renewed focus and clarity. Here are the steps, the benefits and the takeaways from my own experience.
“Garbage in, garbage out,” my boss says as he tries to explain the dud output from our shiny new predictive analytics tool.
We are entering what I like to call the “pre-automation phase”. It’s where the overexuberant expect the world to change overnight and the complacent don’t realise that in a couple of years their jobs will be on the guillotine unless they rapidly pivot or reskill.
Like almost all multimillion-dollar corporate technology investments, it will eventually be followed by job losses. But like any system, the quality of this technology’s output depends inextricably on the quality of its input: in this case, its data sources and its assumptions.
Human beings might feel excited or threatened by the emerging role of “machines”, but we’re not entirely different to our artificial friends or foes. That’s to say, we function, in large part, on our inputs.
Put more exactly, what we feed our bodies and brains – and the systems by which we feed them – determines the quality of our health outcomes, our habits, our relationships, our decisions and the quality of our thinking. The garbage-in-garbage-out rule is almost universally applicable.
Identifying the Rut
I’ve recently been giving this idea some actionable thought. While my personal social media use is at the bare professional minimum, this blog has emerged as the leading candidate for my consumption of social media information on platforms like Twitter.
Social media is quite the lure. There are the online communities that think similarly, the accounts that share useful information, the memes to brighten a day. What’s not to like? And besides, a blog must have a social media presence, right?
Trouble is, all these things can become toxic if we don’t regulate them. Online communities can become an echo chamber that restricts wider, conflicting thinking. That useful information can become the proverbial search for a needle in a haystack, and sometimes we just end up enjoying the comfort of the hay.
And then there’s the stuff we put out there. Without genuine enthusiasm to be there, being present because it ticks a box doesn’t usually have a productive ending. Even less so when the platforms you are using are addictive by design, crafted to tickle our dopamine receptors into submission.
In short, poorly managed social media has a significant opportunity cost.
And so, I took a break.
I worked, I read, I walked, I ran, I wrote, I built, I thought. And none of these things were divided by the interlude of a social media feed.
Put in millennial lingo, I took a “digital detox”. Or as I’ll call it here for the benefit of specificity, I took a “social media detox”.
The Steps of a Social Media Detox
Loosely based on the approach set out by Cal Newport in Digital Minimalism, the social media detox has three simple steps:
Stop using social media platforms: delete the apps, block the notifications, and use commitment devices like social contracts if you’re still struggling. I recommend a period of 30 days.
Take time to pursue more meaningful activities: e.g. reflect, write, socialise, build, learn, brainstorm.
Reintroduce social media use, only if it brings value, and under stricter rules to optimise that value (more on this shortly).
The Benefits of a Social Media Detox
As it turns out, the benefits of a social media detox are wide-ranging. Here are six of these benefits, supported by research and/or common sense.
#1: Fewer distractions. Time and time again, research has pointed to the distraction residue of digital notifications. In one study, researchers found that it took more than 20 minutes to get back on task after an interruption. Of course, we can put our phones on silent, but an obvious quick win is the elimination of this nagging distraction.
#2: Renewed clarity and focus. Social media platforms are addictive by design. Likes, retweets and statuses feed off an evolutionary need for social approval. Feedback loops then serve up an addictive dopamine hit that keeps us coming back for more. It goes without saying that stepping away from this addictive lure can bring with it renewed mental focus, not to mention a heightened appreciation for delayed gratification and solitude.
#3: Improved mood. While the impact of social media on mental health remains unclear, some research suggests an association between social media use and increased rates of depression. A social media detox might therefore be expected to improve mood, compounded by the positive effects on focus and productivity.
#4: Increased gratitude. As our eyes shift to the horizon, we’ll likely spend more time engaging in meaningful leisure activities and with meaningful connections. This will foster a renewed appreciation for the things we are evolutionarily built for: face-to-face social connections, building, independent thinking. And as I’ve written before, increased gratitude may have a wide range of benefits for our overall well-being.
#5: Time to reassess the value and think. A social media detox also leaves us with newfound time. As we explore more meaningful activities, we’ll have more time to reflect on what brings us value and what doesn’t. We’ll have time to do uncluttered thinking. Replacing social media time with simple activities like walking outdoors and meditation can transform the quality of this thinking.
#6: Future intentionality. Last but not least, a period of reflection can give us the clarity we need to take back control of our digital habits. The whole point of a social media detox is that if we decide to return to social media, we do so more intentionally.
How to Reintroduce Social Media
Which brings me nicely to the next point.
The idea of the third step of the social media detox is that we start from zero use and reintroduce only what brings us value. Having reflected on this during the detox, it would be wise to think about some rules for use if we decide to return.
“Rules” may sound an extreme take, but it’s about not undoing the work we’ve done, not allowing things to drift back to the default.
As an example, here are my rules for the reintroduction of social media:
15 minutes of social media use per day (maximum). Unless you’re running a social media account as a business, there simply isn’t value in spending more time on it. And even then, there are a wide range of options for automation.
Follow no more than 150 selected accounts. A hat tip to Robin Dunbar’s research on this one. In the social media sphere this figure may be a little arbitrary, but it seems to me to be a sensible limit to extract value from the accounts I’m following.
Unfollow non-value adding accounts, e.g. serial retweeters and auctioneers.
No more than 2-3 main tweets per day. If I feel like I have something relevant and value-adding to say, I will say it. But I’ll do so with respect for others pondering their social media use.
In short, these rules aim to do three things: filter for quality information, save time, and respect the time of others.
If you choose to return to social media, think carefully about your operating rules for its reintroduction. Bottom line: How will you design your new social media space to optimise value and minimise opportunity cost? Your experience over the preceding 30 days should help you answer this.
What Now?
Of course, I accept that some people get the social media balance right without such a blanket intervention. It’s not for everyone. I also accept that not everyone will experience all the aforementioned benefits.
But if you have appraised your social media use honestly and concluded that you are spending too much time on it and not getting enough from it, then perhaps this article will sound the alarm bells required. Perhaps it will at least have you pondering the value of a brief break from social media.
As for me, the world didn’t stop. My blog traffic didn’t tank. There was no mass exodus of followers.
I took a month off social media. I read, I socialised, I wrote, I thought, I built, and I exercised instead. And now I can reset.
Maybe you should, too.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got this question: "Are social media cleanses effective?" I've done some research and read through a few articles to understand what a social media cleanse is and whether it's beneficial. Let's see what I've gathered.

First off, from Doc 1, it seems that a social media cleanse is about cleaning up one's online presence, especially on social media platforms, to make sure that what's out there doesn't harm their reputation, especially in the context of job hunting. It mentions that employers often check social media profiles, so cleaning up means removing anything that could be seen as negative or unprofessional.

Doc 2 talks about a social media cleanse in terms of taking a break from social media to improve mental health. It suggests that stepping away from platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter can have several benefits, such as better sleep, reduced FOMO, and more time for other activities. It also mentions that if someone feels fine about their social media use, they don't necessarily need to do a cleanse, but if it's causing stress, it might be helpful.

Doc 3 seems to be more focused on helping students clean up their social media profiles to present a positive image, especially for college admissions or job applications. It provides tips on what to remove and what to keep, emphasizing the importance of presenting a polished online presence.

Doc 4 discusses social media detox in a broader sense, not just cleaning up profiles but taking a break from using social media altogether. It lists reasons why one might need a social media detox, such as driving insecurity, breaching privacy, instilling FOMO, and affecting mental health negatively.

Doc 5 is another perspective on social media detox, sharing a personal experience of taking a break from social media for a month. The author talks about the benefits they experienced, like fewer distractions, renewed clarity and focus, improved mood, increased gratitude, time to reassess values, and the ability to reintroduce social media more intentionally.

So, synthesizing all this information, a social media cleanse or detox can refer to two main things: cleaning up your existing social media profiles to remove negative content or taking a break from using social media altogether. Both approaches have their merits and can be effective depending on the individual's needs and circumstances.

For someone looking to improve their online reputation, cleaning up their social media profiles makes sense. Removing inappropriate posts, adjusting privacy settings, and curating a positive image can certainly help in professional contexts like job hunting or college admissions.

On the other hand, taking a break from social media can be beneficial for mental health. It can reduce stress, improve sleep, and allow for more meaningful offline interactions. It's especially helpful for those who feel overwhelmed or addicted to social media.

In conclusion, social media cleanses can be effective, but their effectiveness depends on what the individual is trying to achieve. Whether it's improving online reputation or enhancing mental well-being, approaching social media use mindfully and intentionally seems to be key.

\boxed{\text{Yes, social media cleanses can be effective for improving online reputation and mental health, depending on individual needs.}}
