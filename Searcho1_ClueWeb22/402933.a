As an AI assistant, I'm here to help you understand how climate change affects developed countries. Let's approach this step by step.

First, I need to understand what climate change is. Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.

Now, developed countries are nations with highly developed economies, infrastructure, and often higher standards of living. Examples include the United States, countries in Western Europe, Japan, and Australia. These countries have significant contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions historically, but they also have the resources and technology to address climate change impacts.

So, how does climate change affect these countries? I think there are several key areas to consider: economic impacts, health impacts, infrastructure vulnerabilities, and environmental changes.

Let me start with economic impacts. Climate change can affect agriculture, tourism, insurance industries, and more. For instance, rising temperatures can alter crop yields and growing seasons, potentially leading to food shortages or price increases. Developed countries might have more resilient agricultural systems, but they're not immune to these changes.

Next, health impacts. Extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods, and storms can lead to injuries and deaths. Additionally, warmer temperatures can expand the range of disease-carrying insects, introducing new health risks. Developed countries have better healthcare systems, but the increased frequency and intensity of extreme events can still strain resources.

Infrastructure is another critical area. Developed countries have extensive infrastructure, including roads, bridges, energy grids, and water management systems. Climate change poses threats through sea-level rise, increased precipitation, and more intense storms, which can damage or destroy these assets. Repairing and adapting infrastructure can be costly.

Environmental changes also matter. Even in developed countries, natural ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change. This can affect biodiversity, wildlife habitats, and recreational areas, which in turn can have economic and quality-of-life implications.

I should also consider how climate change might exacerbate social inequalities within developed countries. For example, lower-income communities might be more exposed to climate-related risks and have fewer resources to adapt or recover from disasters.

Moreover, developed countries play a crucial role in global efforts to mitigate climate change. Their actions in reducing emissions and supporting international agreements can influence the overall trajectory of global warming.

Perhaps I should look into specific examples to illustrate these points. Let's consider the impact of hurricanes in the United States. Hurricanes have become more intense due to warmer ocean temperatures, and places like Florida and Louisiana have experienced devastating storms in recent years. The economic costs of rebuilding after these events are substantial.

Another example is heatwaves in Europe. The summer of 2003 saw extreme heat across Europe, leading to tens of thousands of deaths, mostly among elderly people. This event highlighted the vulnerability of populations to heat stress, even in developed countries with advanced healthcare systems.

In Australia, bushfires have become more frequent and severe due to droughts and higher temperatures. The 2019-2020 bushfire season was particularly catastrophic, causing loss of life, destruction of property, and widespread environmental damage.

These examples show that despite their development and resources, these countries are not invulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

I should also consider the concept of "climate resilience." Developed countries often have greater capacity to adapt to climate change because they have more financial resources, technological capabilities, and institutional frameworks. However, adaptation is not unlimited, and some impacts may still be significant.

Furthermore, there's the issue of moral responsibility and leadership. Since developed countries have contributed disproportionately to historical greenhouse gas emissions, there's an argument that they have a greater obligation to reduce their emissions and support climate action in developing countries.

Perhaps I should think about policy responses. Many developed countries have implemented policies to reduce emissions, such as carbon pricing, renewable energy targets, and energy efficiency standards. Some have set ambitious goals for achieving net-zero emissions in the coming decades.

However, the effectiveness of these policies varies, and there are often political and economic barriers to more aggressive action. For example, industries dependent on fossil fuels may resist transition to cleaner technologies due to short-term costs.

It's also worth noting that some developed countries are investing heavily in research and development of green technologies, which could not only help them reduce emissions but also create new economic opportunities.

In terms of international cooperation, developed countries are expected to provide financial and technological support to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. This is enshrined in agreements like the Paris Accord.

But, there's often a gap between commitments and actions. Some developed countries have fallen short in delivering promised funding, which can hinder global progress on climate change.

Moreover, climate change is a global problem that requires coordinated action. Even if developed countries significantly reduce their own emissions, without similar efforts from other nations, the overall impact may be limited.

I should also consider the potential for climate change to cause displacement and migration. As certain regions become uninhabitable due to rising seas, desertification, or other climate-related factors, people may be forced to move. This could lead to migration pressures on developed countries, presenting both challenges and opportunities.

Additionally, there are national security implications. Climate change can act as a "threat multiplier," exacerbating existing tensions and contributing to conflict over scarce resources like water and arable land. Developed countries with global interests may need to address these security dimensions.

From an economic perspective, there's a growing recognition that tackling climate change can also present opportunities for innovation and growth in green sectors. Developed countries are well-positioned to capitalize on this transition.

However, there's also the risk of "stranded assets" – investments in fossil fuel infrastructure that may become obsolete as the world moves towards cleaner energy sources. This could pose financial risks for countries and companies heavily invested in these sectors.

I should probably look at some data to get a better sense of the scale of impacts. For instance, estimates of the economic costs of climate change in developed countries could be insightful.

Let me consider conducting a search to find some quantitative data on this topic.

Developing dilemma
The effects of climate change will not be uniformly distributed across the globe and there are likely to be winners and losers as the planet warms.
Applying a broad brush to climate effects, developing countries are more likely to disproportionately experience the negative effects of global warming.
Not only do many developing countries have naturally warmer climates than those in the developed world, they also rely more heavily on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, forestry and tourism.
As temperatures rise further, regions such as Africa will face declining crop yields and will struggle to produce sufficient food for domestic consumption, whilst their major exports will likely fall in volume.
This effect will be made worse for these regions if developed countries are able to offset the fall in agricultural output with new sources, potentially from their own domestic economies as their land becomes more suitable for growing crops.
Developing countries may also be less likely to create drought resistant harvests given the lack of research funding.
Wild weather weighs on economies
The increased frequency and severity of extreme weather will weigh on government budgets.
The aftermath of natural disasters often falls on authorities who are forced to spend vast amounts on clear-up operations and healthcare costs that come with experiencing extreme weather.
Revenue reductions may also be experienced by countries heavily dependent on tourism or on selling fishing rights, for example. 1
The effects on the developing world are two-fold.
As developed countries face an increasing strain on domestic budgets, fewer resources in the form of aid and economic development funds will flow to developing countries.
The governments of these nations will be forced to channel resources away from productive and growth-enhancing projects towards countering the costs of extreme weather.
Such effects will damage near-term growth prospects. Furthermore, developing countries are likely to have less capacity to rebuild.
The time required to recover from natural disasters will be prolonged and if longer than the frequency in which such disasters occur, many developing economies could remain in a constant state of reconstruction 2.
Parts of Africa and Asia most at risk
Highly vulnerable regions in the emerging world include Sub-Saharan Africa and South and South East Asia, according to the World Bank.
In South Asia, cities such as Kolkata and Mumbai will face increased flooding, warming temperatures and intense cyclones.
Loss of snow melt from the Himalayas will also reduce the flow of water into the Indus Ganges and Brahmaputra basins.
Meanwhile in South East Asia, Vietnam's Mekong Delta, which produces most of the rice, is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels.
For Sub-Saharan Africa, food security will be a major challenge due to droughts and shifts in rainfall.
Many developing nations are situated in low latitude countries and it is estimated that 80% of the damage from climate change may be concentrated in these areas 3.
In contrast, northerly regions such as Canada, Russia and Scandinavia, may enjoy a net benefit from modest levels of warming 4.
Higher agricultural yields, lower heating requirements and lower winter mortality rates are a handful of economic benefits climate change may bring, although these benefits may diminish as warming continues.
Disproportionate risks
The prediction that developing countries will be disproportionately affected is reinforced by Standard and Poor's research on the influence climate change will have on sovereign risk.
Recognising that climate change is a global mega-trend impacting sovereign risk through economic, fiscal and external performance, they find that lower-rated sovereigns appear most exposed.
They assess sovereign vulnerability on three measures: share of the population living in coastal areas below five metres of altitude, the share of agriculture in national GDP and a country score from the "vulnerability index" compiled by the Notre Dame University Global Adaption Index.
Such an index measures the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change.
Based on these measures we can interpret the results in part as the susceptibility of an economy to climate change.
Figure 1 below summarises the results on a world map. In line with much of the economic literature, many developing nations appear most vulnerable to climate change during the remainder of the current century.
Alternatively, Figure 2 below expresses this trend of higher vulnerability amongst poorer countries by plotting the overall vulnerability ranking against GDP per capita for each country.
UK should fare better than developed peers
In the UK, the average temperature is now 1°C higher that it was 100 years ago and 0.5°C higher than it was in the 1970s.
As a higher latitude country, it is believed that the UK will fare better than many developing nations as global warming progresses.
That is not to say the nation will escape the costs of climate change - particularly given its significant coastline where rising sea levels pose an obvious threat.
According to Stern 5, estimates of the cost of floods to the UK economy as a result of 3°C - 4°C of warming are in the region of 0.2% - 0.4% of GDP annually by the middle of the century, if flood management efforts are not strengthened.
In England, the south and parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are forecast to experience the greatest impact from flooding by 2050 as shown by Figure 3.
Aside from increased flooding, water availability will become progressively more constrained and droughts more frequent 6.
Milder winters and the associated decline in cold-related mortality rates will be countered by a greater prevalence and severity of heat waves, bringing with it a higher number of heat-related mortalities.
Finally, with the agricultural sector contributing approximately just 0.6% of GDP, the benefits of longer growing seasons will be marginal to the economy.
Climate change may also indirectly affect the UK economy through global supply chains. The UK may both export to and import from climate-sensitive countries.
The subsequent influence of climate change in these economies may feed through to the domestic economy through lower demand for exports or higher prices of imports for example.

Economic impacts of climate change
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For broader coverage of this topic, see Economics of climate change.
The economic impacts of climate change vary geographically and are difficult to forecast exactly. Researchers have warned that current economic modelling may seriously underestimate the effects of climate change, and point to the need for new models that give a more accurate picture of potential damages. Nevertheless, one 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2 °C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US$17 trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario. [1]
Global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s. [2] Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses, such as population growth and increased wealth.[3] Part of the growth is also related to regional climatic factors, e.g., changes in precipitation and flooding events. It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend. [4] The trend does, however, suggest increasing vulnerability of social systems to climate change. [4]
A 2019 modelling study found that climate change had contributed towards global economic inequality. Wealthy countries in colder regions had either felt little overall economic impact from climate change, or possibly benefited, whereas poor hotter countries very likely grew less than if global warming had not occurred. [5]
The total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate, but increase for higher temperature changes. [6] For instance, total damages are estimated to be 90% less if global warming is limited to 1.5 °C compared to 3.66 °C, a warming level chosen to represent no mitigation. [7] One study found a 3.5% reduction in global GDP by the end of the century if warming is limited to 3 °C, excluding the potential effect of tipping points. Another study noted that global economic impact is underestimated by a factor of two to eight when tipping points are excluded from consideration. [7] In the Oxford Economics high emission scenario, a temperature rise of 2 degrees by the year 2050 would reduce global GDP by 2.5% – 7.5%. By the year 2100 in this case, the temperature would rise by 4 degrees, which could reduce the global GDP by 30% in the worst case. [8]

The economic impacts of climate change also include any mitigation (for example, limiting the global average temperature below 2 °C) or adaption (for example, building flood defences) employed by nations or groups of nations, which might infer economic consequences. [9] [10] [11]
Distribution of impacts[edit]
This section needs to be updated. The reason given is: Most of the sources are from 2007 or before; field has progressed significantly since.. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(December 2018)
Climate change impacts can be measured as an economic cost (Smith et al., 2001:936-941). [12] This is particularly well-suited to market impacts, that is impacts that are linked to market transactions and directly affect GDP. Monetary measures of non-market impacts, e.g., impacts on human health and ecosystems, are more difficult to calculate. Other difficulties with impact estimates are listed below:
Knowledge gaps: Calculating distributional impacts requires detailed geographical knowledge, but these are a major source of uncertainty in climate models.
Vulnerability: Compared with developed countries, there is a limited understanding of the potential market sector impacts of climate change in developing countries.
Adaptation: The future level of adaptive capacity in human and natural systems to climate change will affect how society will be impacted by climate change. Assessments may under- or overestimate adaptive capacity, leading to under- or overestimates of positive or negative impacts.
Socioeconomic trends: Future predictions of development affect estimates of future climate change impacts, and in some instances, different estimates of development trends lead to a reversal from a predicted positive, to a predicted negative, impact (and vice versa ).
In a literature assessment, Smith et al. (2001:957-958) concluded, with medium confidence, that:
climate change would increase income inequalities between and within countries.
a small increase in global mean temperature (up to 2 °C, measured against 1990 levels) would result in net negative market sector in many developing countries and net positive market sector impacts in many developed countries.
With high confidence, it was predicted that with a medium (2-3 °C) to high level of warming (greater than 3 °C), negative impacts would be exacerbated, and net positive impacts would start to decline and eventually turn negative.
Green companies in Europe outperform those in the United States in terms of green investment and digital uptake. In comparison to the United States, European businesses are less likely to have adopted digital technology, but they are more likely to invest in climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies. In Europe, the proportion of businesses that make green investments and are also digital adopters is slightly greater, at 32%. The same businesses are at 28% in the United States.
81% of the European Investment Bank 's Investment Survey respondents cited uncertainty as the most severe obstacle to investment. [13] [14]
A European survey conducted in 2021 found that 45% of young Chinese people, 32% of young Americans, 31% of British, and 25% of Europeans fear they could lose their jobs because of the fight against climate change. Specifically, Europeans aged 20 - 29 (44%) fear they could lose their job if it is incompatible with the need to combat climate change. However, 55% of Europeans believe that initiatives to combat climate change will have a net positive impact on employment, generating more jobs. [15]
The survey also found that 69% of EU, 71% of UK, 62% of US and 89% of Chinese respondents would support a tax on the items and services that contribute the most to climate change. [16]
Non-market impacts[edit]
See also: Effects of global warming on human health
Smith et al. (2001:942) predicted that climate change would likely result in pronounced non-market impacts. [12] Most of impacts were predicted to be negative. The literature assessment by Smith et al. (2001) suggested that climate change would cause substantial negative health impacts in developing countries. Smith et al. (2001) noted that few of the studies they reviewed had adequately accounted for adaptation. In a literature assessment, Confalonieri et al. (2007:415) found that in the studies that had included health impacts, those impacts contributed substantially to the total costs of climate change. [17]
Market sector[edit]
In 2019 the International Labour Organization published a report titled: "Working on a warmer planet: The impact of heat stress on labour productivity and decent work", in which it claims that even if the rise in temperature will be limited to 1.5 degree, by the year 2030, Climate Change will cause losses in productivity reaching 2.2% of all the working hours, every year. This is equivalent to 80 million full time jobs, or 2,400 billion dollars. The sector expected to be most affected is agriculture, which is projected to account for 60% of this loss. The construction sector is also projected to be severely impacted and accounts for 19% of projected losses. Other sectors that are most at risk are environmental goods and services, refuse collection, emergency, repair work, transport, tourism, sports and some forms of industrial work. [18] [19]
In 2020 McKinsey & Company issued a report about the current and future impacts of climate change on the economy. The report says that trillions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives are at risk. Climate change should strongly influence the decisions of the business and governmental leaders. [20] The report, for example, found that socioeconomic impacts can increase by 2 - 20 times compare to today level by 2050. [21]
Climate change driven migration possibly helped to trigger Brexit - the exit of Britain from European Union. [22] [23] The uncertainty about Brexit has shrunk the British economy in 2019, [24] and may cause it to contract further in the future Brexit can make it shrink it much more .
In the European Investment Bank 's Investment report 2020-2021, it was found that climate change and related weather events have had a significant influence on 23% of European companies, compared to 14% in the United States. Another 35% of European companies consider the consequences of climate change to be minimal. [25] [26]
Agriculture[edit]
See also: Effects of climate change on agriculture
Depending on underlying assumptions, studies of the economic impacts of a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) from pre-industrial levels conclude that this would have a slightly negative to moderately positive aggregate effect (i.e., total impacts across all regions) on the agricultural sector (Smith et al., 2001:938). [12] This aggregate effect hides substantial regional differences, with benefits mostly predicted in the developed world and strongly negative impacts for populations poorly connected to regional and global trading systems. Poorer countries are more exposed to the weather because of the important role of agriculture and water resources in the economy. [27]
Other sectors[edit]
A number of other sectors will be affected by climate change, including the livestock, forestry, and fisheries industries. Other sectors sensitive to climate change include the energy, insurance, tourism and recreation industries. The aggregate impact of climate change on most of these sectors is highly uncertain (Schneider et al., 2007:790). [28]
Regions[edit]
"Although greenhouse gas emissions per person are higher in high-income countries, relative impacts of climate change are greater in low-income countries". [29] This is because "low-income countries tend to be in tropical zones closer to the equator" and, due to their economic position, 'low-income' are less able to adapt. [29]
Africa: In Africa, coastal facilities are economically significant. In a literature assessment, Desanker et al. (2001:490) concluded that climate change would result in sea-level rise, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion, and flooding. Desanker et al. (2001) predicted that these changes would have a significant impact on African communities and economies. [30]
Coasts and low-lying areas: In literature assessment, Nicholls et al. (2007:338-339) concluded that the socio-economic impacts of climate change on coastal and low-lying areas would be overwhelmingly adverse. [31] Some benefits, however, were noted, e.g., the opening of new ocean routes due to reduced sea ice. Compared with developed countries, the protection costs associated with projected sea level rise were found to be relatively higher for developing countries.
Polar regions: Anisimov et al. (2001:804) reviewed the literature on climate change impacts in polar regions. [32] With very high confidence, they concluded that the impact of climate change on infrastructure would increase economic costs. New opportunities for trading and shipping across the Arctic ocean, lower operational costs for the oil and gas industry, lower heating costs, and easier access for ship-based tourism, were expected to bring economic benefits.
Small islands: In a literature assessment, Mimura et al. (2007:689) concluded, with high confidence, that on small islands, tourism would, for the most part, be negatively affected by climate change. [33] On many small islands, tourism is a major contributor to GDP and employment.
Other systems and sectors[edit]
Freshwater resources: In this sector, costs and benefits of climate change may take several forms, including monetary costs and benefits, and ecosystem and human impacts, e.g., loss of aquatic species and household flooding. In a literature assessment, Kundzewicz et al. (2007:191) found that few of these costs had been estimated in monetary terms. [34] In respect to the water supply, they predicted that costs would very likely exceed benefits. Predicted costs included the potential need for infrastructure investments to protect against floods and droughts.
Industry, settlements and society :
In a literature assessment, Wilbanks et al. (2007:377) concluded, with high confidence, that the economic costs of extreme weather events, at large national or large regional scale, would be unlikely to exceed more than a few percent of the total economy in the year of the event, except for possible abrupt changes.[35] In smaller locations, particularly developing countries, it was estimated with high confidence that, in the year of the extreme event, short-run damages could amount to more than 25% GDP.
Infrastructure: According to Tol (2008), roads, airport runways, railway lines and pipelines, (including oil pipelines, sewers, water mains etc.) may require increased maintenance and renewal as they become subject to greater temperature variation and are exposed to weather that they were not designed for. [36]
Aggregate impacts[edit]
This section needs to be updated. The reason given is: Most of the sources are from 2007 or before; field has progressed significantly since.. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.(December 2018)

Aggregating impacts adds up the total impact of climate change across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007a:76). [37] In producing aggregate impacts, there are a number of difficulties, such as predicting the ability of societies to adapt climate change, and estimating how future economic and social development will progress (Smith et al., 2001:941). [12] It is also necessary for the researcher to make subjective value judgements over the importance of impacts occurring in different economic sectors, in different regions, and at different times.
In 2020 the World Economic Forum ranked climate change as the biggest risk to economy and society. [38]
A United States government report in November 2018 raised the possibility of US GDP going down 10% as a result of the warming climate, including huge shifts in geography, demographics and technology. [39]
Smith et al. (2001) assessed the literature on the aggregate impacts of climate change. With medium confidence, they concluded that a small increase in global average temperature (up to 2 °C, measured against 1990 levels) would result in an aggregate market sector impact of plus or minus a few percent of world GDP. Smith et al. (2001) found that for a small to medium (2-3 °C) global average temperature increase, some studies predicted small net positive market impacts. Most studies they assessed predicted net damages beyond a medium temperature increase, with further damages for greater (more than 3 °C) temperature rises.
With low confidence, Smith et al. (2001) concluded that the non-market impacts of climate change would be negative. Smith et al. (2001:942) decided that studies might have understated the true costs of climate change, e.g., by not correctly estimating the impact of extreme weather events. It was thought possible that some of the positive impacts of climate change had been overlooked, and that adaptive capacity had possibly been underestimated.
Some of the studies assessed by Schneider et al. (2007:790) predicted that gross world product could increase for 1-3 °C warming (relative to temperatures over the 1990-2000 period), largely because of aggregate benefits in the agricultural sector. [28] In the view of Schneider et al. (2007), these estimates carried low confidence. Stern (2007) assessed climate change impacts using the basic economics of risk premiums (Yohe et al., 2007:821). [40] He found that unmitigated climate change could result in a reduction in welfare equivalent to a persistent average fall in global per-capita consumption of at least 5%. The study by Stern (2007) has received both criticism and support from other economists (see Stern Review for more information). IPCC (2007a) concluded that "Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions and populations and very likely underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts." [37]
Richard S Tol has twice revised his figure incorporated as fig 10-1 in IPCC reports from his "The Economic Effects of Climate Change". In the second revision he says "The IPCC discussion of this figure offers some useful cautions about interpretation:" and quotes that as saying:
"Estimates agree on the size of the impact (small relative to economic growth), and 17 of the 20 impact estimates shown in Figure 10-1 are negative. Losses accelerate with greater warming, and estimates diverge. The new estimates have slightly widened the uncertainty about the economic impacts of climate. Welfare impacts have been estimated with different methods, ranging from expert elicitation to econometric studies and simulation models. Different studies include different aspects of the impacts of climate change, but no estimate is complete; most experts speculate that excluded impacts are on balance negative. Estimates across the studies reflect different assumptions about inter-sectoral, inter-regional, and inter-temporal interactions, about adaptation, and about the monetary values of impacts. Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions, countries, and populations. Relative to their income, economic impacts are higher for poorer people." [41]
Marginal impacts[edit]
The social cost of carbon (SCC) is an aggregate measure of the impacts of climate change. It is defined as the incremental (or marginal) social cost of emitting one more tonne of carbon (as carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere at any point in time (Yohe et al., 2007:821). [40] Different GHGs have different social costs. For example, due to their greater physical capacity to trap infrared radiation, HFCs have a considerably higher social cost per tonne of emission than carbon dioxide. Another physical property that affects the social cost is the atmospheric lifetime of the GHG.
Estimates of the SCC are highly uncertain and cover a wide range (Klein et al., 2007:756). [42] The discrepancies in estimates can be broken down into normative and empirical parameters (Fisher et al., 2007:232). [43] Key normative parameters include the aggregation of impacts across time and regions. The other parameters relate to the empirical validity of SCC estimates. This reflects the poor quality of data on which estimates are based, and the difficulty in predicting how society will react to future climate change. In a literature assessment, Klein et al. (2007:757) placed low confidence in SCC estimates.
Sensitivity analysis[edit]
Sensitivity analysis allows assumptions to be changed in aggregate analysis to see what effect it has on results (Smith et al., 2001:943): [12]
Shape of the damage function: This relates impacts to the change in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. There is little information on what the correct shape (e.g., linear or cubic) of this function is. Compared with a linear function, a cubic function shows relatively small damages for small increases in temperature, but more sharply increasing damages at greater temperatures.
Rate of climate change: This is believed to be an important determinant of impacts, often because it affects the time available for adaptation.
Discount rate and time horizon: Models used in aggregate studies suggest that the most severe impacts of climate change will occur in the future. Estimated impacts are therefore sensitive to the time horizon (how far a given study projects impacts into the future) and the discount rate (the value assigned to consumption in the future versus consumption today).
Welfare criteria: Aggregate analysis is particularly sensitive to the weighting (i.e., relative importance) of impacts occurring in different regions and at different times. Studies by Fankhauser et al. (1997) and Azar (1999) found that greater concern over the distribution of impacts lead to more severe predictions of aggregate impacts.
Uncertainty: Usually assessed through sensitivity analysis, but can also be viewed as a hedging problem. EMF (1997) found that deciding how to hedge depends on society's aversion to climate change risks, and the potential costs of insuring against these risks.
Advantages and disadvantages[edit]
There are a number of benefits of using aggregated assessments to measure climate change impacts (Smith et al., 2001:954). [12] They allow impacts to be directly compared between different regions and times. Impacts can be compared with other environmental problems and also with the costs of avoiding those impacts. A problem of aggregated analyses is that they often reduce different types of impacts into a small number of indicators. It can be argued that some impacts are not well-suited to this, e.g., the monetization of mortality and loss of species diversity. On the other hand, Pearce (2003:364) argued that where there are monetary costs of avoiding impacts, it is not possible to avoid monetary valuation of those impacts. [44]

As stated, economic estimates of climate change impacts are incomplete. [45] Analysts have used integrated assessment models to estimate the economic impacts of climate change. These models do include estimates of some impacts, for instance, the effects of climate change on agriculture.[45] In other areas, models exclude some impacts. An example is the possibility that climate change could lead to migration or conflict. [45]
The Stern Review for the British Government also predicted that world GDP would be reduced by several percent due to climate related costs. However, their calculations may omit ecological effects that are difficult to quantify economically (such as human deaths or loss of biodiversity) or whose economic consequences will manifest slowly. [46] Therefore, their calculations may be an underestimate.

The effects of climate change can be compared to other effects on human society and the environment. Future socio-economic development may strongly affect climate change impacts. [47] For example, projections of the number of people at risk of hunger vary significantly according to assumptions over future socio-economic development. [48]
Some ecosystems are likely to be especially affected by climate change (e.g., coral reefs). [49] In the long-term (beyond 2050), climate change may become the major driver for biodiversity loss globally. [50]
The socio-economic impacts of climate change are likely to be greatest in communities that face other stresses. [51] For example, poor communities are vulnerable to extreme weather events, and are likely to be especially affected by climate change. [52] In general, however, other changes (e.g., demographic and technological) [53] are likely to have a greater effect on human society than climate change. [54] On the other hand, major ("non-marginal") impacts could occur with abrupt changes in natural and social systems. [52] [55] Scientific understanding of abrupt changes is limited. [45] [56]
Another consideration is how vulnerability to climate change varies with scale. At local scales, extreme weather events can have a significant impact, especially in vulnerable locations. [57] Another potentially significant impact is the long-term effect of sea-level rise on low-lying coastal areas. [52]
Comments on relative impacts[edit]
Bostrom (2009) [58] comments that:
Even the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, a report prepared for the British Government which has been criticized by some as overly pessimistic, estimates that under the assumption of business-as-usual with regard to emissions, global warming will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a permanent reduction in per capita consumption of between 5 and 20%. In absolute terms, this would be a huge harm.  Yet over the course of the twentieth century, world GDP grew by some 3,700%, and per capita world GDP rose by some 860%. It seems safe to say that (absent a radical overhaul of our best current scientific models of the Earth’s climate system) whatever negative economic effects global warming will have, they will be completely swamped by other factors that will influence economic growth rates in this century.
Other analysts have commented on the risks of climate change damages. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU, 2007) [59] comments that:
Although [the Stern Review's] figures tend to be at the upper end of the scale compared to other estimates currently circulating, even [its] quantitative estimates fail to include the economic upheavals that would arise as a consequence of climate-induced conflicts or might be triggered by climate-induced migration.
Several analysts have emphasized the importance of "catastrophic" risks due to climate change. WBGU (2007) [60] states that due to climate change, "significant impairment" of the global economy is a "distinct possibility". Weitzman (2012) [61] has commented:
Climate change potentially affects the whole worldwide portfolio of utility by threatening to drive all of planetary welfare to disastrously low levels in the most extreme scenarios. With global climate change, diversification [of risk] is limited because all eggs are inherently in one basket.
Estimates[edit]
In 2017, climate change contributed to extreme weather events causing at least $100 billion in damages. [62] The impact can be seen over a longer time period, where "over the past 20 years, an estimated 500,000 people have died and US$3.5 trillion was lost as a result of extreme weather events". [9] Increasing temperature will lead to accelerating economic losses. [63] : 16  A 2017 survey of independent economists looking at the effects of climate change found that future damage estimates range "from 2% to 10% or more of global GDP per year." [64]

Climate economics - costs and benefits
What are the costs of climate change, and the costs and benefits of tackling it?
By Richard Black

Policymakers and politicians rely on economics to guide decision making on the risks posed to society by climate change. Central to that task are economic models. They can be used to estimate the future costs of climate change impacts such as heatwaves, flooding and sea-level rise, alongside the economic benefits of preparing for them. Models also estimate the costs and benefits of measures that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Costs and benefits
The future costs and benefits of climate change are uncertain and unevenly distributed. For example. the costs of dealing with the impacts of climate change fall disproportionately on developing countries, whilst the financial costs of cutting emissions to mitigate those impacts fall mostly to developed nations.
According to Morgan Stanley, climate-related disasters cost the world $650 billion from 2016-2018. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) puts the cost of achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, in a way compatible with Paris, at $6.9 trillion a year, to 2030. And a 2019 World Bank estimate suggests the necessary global infrastructure investment would cost $90 trillion by 2030.
Already, more variable weather has likely made crops more difficult to grow. A warming world could depress growth in agricultural yields up to 30% by 2050, affecting as many as 500 million small farms worldwide. Large coastal and delta cities are predicted to flood more frequently, incurring clean-up and, in some cases, moving costs.
Measures that help people adapt to these impacts also incur costs, but evidence shows that the future benefits of action overwhelmingly outweigh the future costs of inaction. The UK National Audit Office, for instance, estimates that for every £1 spent on protecting communities from flooding, around £9 in property damages and wider impacts can be avoided.

It has been clear since Nicholas Stern’s landmark 2006 review of the economics of climate change that the costs of not acting to tackle climate change are much higher than the costs of taking action. And whilst the costs of projected impacts have only grown since then, the costs of many of the technologies for tackling climate change have fallen considerably.
Some climate impacts are inevitable because GHGs already in the atmosphere will affect the climate for decades, even centuries to come. Governments therefore have a choice of whether or not to prepare for those impacts (adapt) alongside cutting emissions (mitigating) to avoid further impacts.
Policies to combat climate change may also affect growth and prosperity. Despite wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) now being cheaper than fossil fuels in most countries, some forms of low-carbon energy are still more expensive, such as hydrogen. But climate policies that subsidise or support emerging low-carbon technology can prove cost effective in the long run, for example by making energy cheaper, avoiding climate impacts and producing co-benefits, such as reducing the health impacts of air pollution.
The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate concluded that transitioning to a low-carbon, sustainable growth path could deliver a direct economic windfall of $26 trillion and create over 65 million new jobs by 2030 compared with business-as-usual. The Energy Transitions Commission has even shown that decarbonising ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors — such as steel, aluminium, cement and heavy transport — is technically feasible by 2050 with technology that already exists. The total cost to the global economy would be less than 0.5% of GDP by mid-century — and could be reduced even further.

Worldwide employment in renewable energy was estimated at 12 million in 2020, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency - up from 11.5 million in 2019
Models with limits
Economists evaluate the impacts of climate change and policies with state-of-the-art computer models called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
IAMs include projections of the physical aspects of climate change, such as how much sea-levels rise. They also include projections of factors such as economic growth, global energy and land use, demographic change and technological progress.
Models essentially produce cost-benefit analyses of climate policies. But details about the climate system’s response to emissions and society’s progress are deeply uncertain. Where data is scarce, modelling becomes even more difficult. So model projections are inevitably sensitive to various assumptions.
The best models include a way of accounting for the profound uncertainties that exist. But some may underrate certain risks, such as the possible collapse of the polar ice sheets or ‘compound risks’, such as pest and disease outbreaks. They may also fail to capture the economic co-benefits of reducing emissions or developing low-carbon technologies. For example, limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C by 2060 has been estimated to result in co-benefits of 0.5–0.6% of global GDP, owing mostly to reductions in air pollution.
A further limit is that models may not reflect certain ethical aspects of climate change. For example, allowing high emissions in one country may have damaging effects in others. The impacts of emissions today also fall most significantly on future generations.
Economists deal with the former by applying ‘ equity weights ’ that estimate the impact of GHG emissions on different countries, and the latter by applying a ‘ discount rate ’. A discount rate effectively gives less weight to events the further they occur in the future, due in large to the assumption future societies will be wealthier than they are today. The precise discount rate to use has been a long-standing point of contention for climate economists.

The costs of climate change
The impacts of climate change over the next few decades will largely be driven by greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. The UN Environment Programme estimated in 2016 that the global cost of adapting to these climate impacts is expected to grow to $140-300 billion per year by 2030 and $280-500 billion per year by 2050.
A recent focus of IAMs has been to estimate if the world would be better off limiting global warming to the more ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5°C compared with 2°C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) showed that the risks to global aggregate economic growth due to climate impacts are projected to be lower by 2100 at 1.5°C than at 2°C. In fact, the estimated costs of damages from warming in 2100 for 1.5°C and 2°C were $54 trillion and $69 trillion, respectively, relative to 1961–1990.
Certain climate impacts, such as loss of human lives, biodiversity loss, or loss of culture or identity, are difficult to value in monetary terms, so are often omitted from projections.
Energy economics and decarbonisation
The other side of the climate economics question concerns the costs and benefits of reducing GHG emissions. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, electricity generated by onshore wind and solar PV technologies is now cheaper than from any fossil fuel source. This trend is almost certain to continue: renewable power capacity is forecast to rise more than 60% on 2020 levels, by 2026, to more than 4,800 GW – which is equivalent to the total global power capacity of fossil fuels and nuclear combined.
Still, there is no global price for emitting carbon dioxide, a result of political unwillingness to implement one, and the difficulty of locking in a future trajectory that investors have confidence in. The IMF estimates the implicit global subsidy from undercharging for energy supply costs (8%) and for its environmental costs and foregone consumption taxes (92%) in 2020 was as much as $5.9 trillion, or 6.8% of global GDP - expected to rise to 7.4% of GDP in 2025.
Meanwhile, some crucial decarbonisation technologies such as battery storage are still considered expensive, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is not yet commercially viable. But technologies such as lithium-ion batteries and electric-produced hydrogen are ‘ poised for rapid take-off ’, just as solar PV and wind power technologies were a decade ago.
Offshore wind turbines, UK | National Grid
Decarbonisation has been shown to have important benefits - globally, and in the UK. One estimate found that every $1 million invested in renewables infrastructure or energy efficiency generates 7.49 and 7.72 full-time jobs respectively. This compares with only 2.65 in fossil-fuel infrastructure.
In the UK, deploying 35 GW of onshore wind by 2035 could reduce electricity costs by 7%, support 31,000 jobs, lift productivity and enable a £360m export industry.
And whilst the UK's Climate Change Committee estimates that delivering net-zero will cost 1% of UK GDP, a 2020 Vivid Economics study calculated that the investment would deliver £90bn a year in economic co-benefits (equivalent to 4.5% of 2019 GDP).

Abstract/Summary:
Government organizations are responsible for strategic decisions regarding the economic development of individual countries and regional areas. This decision-making process is influenced by the certainty of the information presented to government officials. One area where this decision-making influence is challenging government officials is in climate-based events. The past decade has witnessed a significant rise in the number of climate events, as well as the number of people affected by climate events. Far from being under control, evidence and long-term projections suggest that these events are climate-based rather than weather-based. In these projections, climate change is a global issue with potential impacts for every country. However, the relative impact of these events will be far different in the developed and developing worlds. As detailed in this paper, the authors examined this disparity through an analysis of 10 countries with varying income levels to determine the relative impact of climate change in the context of a single infrastructure element, paved and unpaved roads. Using the latest global climate models combined with economic and infrastructure data, the study highlights the disparity of opportunity costs between high- and low-income countries. Roads are a key element in enabling developing economy communities to have access to basic services, generate an income through agriculture and gain productive employment. The potential for road damage and the inability to invest in new road infrastructure could impact the economic stability of communities. The paper provides a quantitative introduction to these issues and the challenges presented to government organizations when considering the long-term effects of climate change.

Alright, I've got this search result with several documents related to the economic impacts of climate change on developed and developing countries. Let's see what insights I can gather from these sources.

Starting with Doc 1 and Doc 2 from Schroders, they seem to be discussing how climate change affects different regions, particularly focusing on the disparity between developed and developing countries. It mentions that developing countries are more likely to experience negative effects due to their warmer climates and higher dependence on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture. On the other hand, developed countries in higher latitudes might see some benefits from modest warming, such as improved agricultural yields and reduced heating costs. However, even developed countries are not immune to the adverse effects, like increased flooding and water scarcity.

Moving on to Doc 3, which is from Wikipedia, it provides a broad overview of the economic impacts of climate change. It notes that while some regions might see short-term benefits, the overall trend is negative, especially with higher levels of warming. The article emphasizes that the poorest countries, which are often already hot, are likely to be hit hardest. It also mentions that the total economic impacts are difficult to estimate but generally increase with higher temperature changes.

Doc 4 is from the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, and it delves into the costs and benefits of climate change and climate action. It cites various studies indicating that the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of mitigation and adaptation. For example, it mentions that the cost of achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals in a way compatible with the Paris Agreement is estimated at $6.9 trillion annually by 2030. However, the potential economic benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon economy could be substantial, with one commission estimating a $26 trillion direct economic benefit by 2030 compared to business as usual.

Lastly, Doc 5 is a journal article from MIT that looks specifically at the impact of climate change on road infrastructure in different income-level countries. It suggests that developing countries may face disproportionate challenges in maintaining and expanding their road networks due to climate-related damages, which could impede their economic development.

From these documents, a pattern emerges: while both developed and developing countries will face economic impacts from climate change, the nature and extent of these impacts vary significantly. Developing countries, especially those in lower latitudes, are anticipated to suffer more severe negative consequences due to their greater reliance on climate-sensitive sectors and limited adaptive capacities. In contrast, developed countries may experience both positive and negative impacts, with some potentially benefiting from certain aspects of moderate warming.

However, it's crucial to note that no country is entirely insulated from the adverse effects of climate change. Developed countries are also vulnerable to extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climate-related phenomena, which can lead to significant economic losses. Moreover, the interconnected global economy means that climate impacts in one region can have spillover effects elsewhere through trade, supply chains, and migration.

In terms of policy responses, the documents suggest that investing in mitigation and adaptation can yield substantial economic benefits in the long run. The transition to a low-carbon economy is portrayed as not only necessary for environmental reasons but also economically advantageous, creating jobs and stimulating innovation. However, there are challenges in implementing such transitions, including the need for substantial upfront investments and the complexities involved in shifting away from established fossil fuel-based systems.

Another important aspect is the issue of equity and justice in the distribution of climate impacts and responsibilities. Developed countries have historically been the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, contributing disproportionately to the problem. Therefore, there is an argument for them to take greater responsibility in mitigating climate change and supporting developing countries in their adaptation efforts.

In conclusion, while climate change presents economic challenges for both developed and developing countries, the impacts are uneven, with developing countries generally facing greater risks. However, proactive approaches to mitigation and adaptation can offer economic opportunities and reduce future costs. It's essential for policymakers to consider these factors in制定应对气候变化的策略。
