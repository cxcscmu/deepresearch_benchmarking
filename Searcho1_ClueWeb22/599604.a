I've been hearing a lot about Critical Race Theory (CRT) lately, and it seems like there's a lot of controversy surrounding it. I'm not entirely sure what it is or why people are against it, so I need to educate myself on this topic. Let me start by understanding what CRT actually is.

First, I should probably look up what Critical Race Theory is. It sounds like an academic concept, possibly related to law or sociology. I think it's important to get a definition straight from credible sources to avoid misinformation.

Let me perform a search to find out what CRT is.

Critical Race Theory | End the Hate
What is Critical Race Theory?
Critical race theory is a field of intellectual inquiry that demonstrates the legal codification of racism in America.
- David Miguel Gray, Assistant Professor of Philosophy (University of Memphis)
Critical race theory (CRT) explained. The central idea of CRT is that racism is institutionalized and is embedded in America's history, legal systems, and policies. It acknowledges the continuing impacts of slavery and segregation in America and critiques how institutionalized racism perpetuates a caste system that is inherently unequal.
There are five principles of critical race theory (core tenets).
1. Race is a Social Construct. Many CRT scholars contend that race is not biologically real (as demonstrated in the Human Genome Project) but rather a social construct. According to scholars Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, race is the product of social thought and is not connected to biological reality.
2. The Centrality of Racism. Many CRT scholars contend that racism isn't just based on the actions of individuals ("a few bad apples"), but rather that racism is embedded in America's culture, society, and legal codes. Racism and prejudice exists everywhere in American life from the workplace, to schools, and businesses.
3. Commitment to Social Justice. CRT seeks to address why racial disparity exists in America so to eradicate racism and eliminate oppression. A group of legal scholars in 1993 identified the end goal of critical race theory to go beyond just eliminating racial oppression and rather seeking to eliminate all oppression. That group wrote: “The interests of all people of color necessarily require not just adjustments within the established hierarchies, but a challenge to hierarchy itself.”
4. The Importance of Experienced Knowledge. CRT scholars explain that experiences (storytelling, biographies, parables, narratives, family histories, the list goes on) of People of Color are crucial to understanding racism and changing the American society for the better.
5. An Interdisciplinary Perspective. CRT contends that there is no one answer or one path to freedom. Instead, CRT says that we all ought to use all the tools we have to help educate individuals and fight for liberation. In fact, that same group of scholars in 1993 explained that CRT is “interdisciplinary and eclectic,” meaning it borrowed from a number of traditions such as feminism.
History of Critical Race Theory
Critical race theory emerged in the 1970s as a response to Critical Legal Studies (CLS), which argued that law was not objective or apolitical. The backdrop behind critical race theory was a common belief in America that the way to solve oppression was to pass legal reforms that expanded existing rights and provided more pathways for victims of discrimination to receive remedy.
The scholars who formulated critical race theory sought to answer questions such as "why is it that racial inequality endures and persists, even decades after these laws have been passed? And "why is racism still enduring and how do we truly abolish it?".
The late Harvard professor Derrick Bell is credited with establishing critical race theory through his publications and groundbreaking course Race, Racism, and American Law. In 1989 CRT became a unified movement at the first annual Workshop on Critical Race Theory.
Later in 1993, CRT was further cemented by a group of legal scholars - Mari Matsuda, Charles R. Lawrence III, Richard Delgado, and Kimberlé Crenshaw - when they published the book "Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First Amendment."
CRT has many accomplishments such as aiding in the passage of affirmative action laws, reforming urban planning to decrease segregation, and securing fair housing rights.
Critical Race Theory in Schools
CRT has become a trending issue in the news especially in regard to its usage in K-12 school discussions. However, "There is little to no evidence that critical race theory itself is being taught to K-12 public school students, though some ideas central to it, such as lingering consequences of slavery, have been." (The Associated Press).
Regardless, many states have proposed passing legislative bans on CRT teachings. These states include Florida, Texas, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, Arizona, North Dakota, Iowa, Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, and Kentucky.
Further Resources on Critical Race Theory
There are a plethora of enlightening academic papers and books about understanding CRT.
Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, And The First Amendment (New Perspectives on Law, Culture, & Society) (1993) by Mari Matsuda, Charles R. Lawrence III, Richard Delgado, and Kimberlé Crenshaw.
In this book, the authors, all legal scholars from the tradition of critical race theory start from the experience of injury from racist hate speech and develop a theory of the first amendment that recognizes such injuries. In their critique of "first amendment orthodoxy", the authors argue that only a history of racism can explain why defamation, invasion of privacy and fraud are exempt from free-speech guarantees but racist verbal assault is not.
Critical Race Theory: An Introduction (2001) by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic.
This book is a compact introduction to the field of CRT that explained, in straightforward language, the origins, principal themes, leading voices, and new directions of this important movement in legal thought.

Published July 9, 2021 Updated Aug. 18, 2021
We had a shorter holiday week on The Daily, but we covered a lot of ground, traveling from Afghanistan to Haiti. Along the way, many of you wrote in to share your thoughts and feelings about our episode on critical race theory.
It’s a complicated subject with a lot of history and nuance to unpack, and some of you were interested in learning more. So we reached out to Trip Gabriel, a national correspondent and our guest, to answer some of your questions.
What is critical race theory (C.R.T.)?
Critical race theory is a concept, once the domain of graduate schools, that some observers say is now influencing American K-12 curriculums. The theory argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions, and that the legacies of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow still create an uneven playing field for Black people and other people of color. The idea is that racism is not a matter of individual bigotry but is systemic in America. Recently critics have made C.R.T. a catchall target for opposition to equity efforts, affirmative action and “wokeness” in general.
Conservatives object that critical race theory is a gauntlet thrown down to accuse all white Americans of being racist, of dividing people by race into oppressors and oppressed. Democrats are conflicted. Some worry that arguing that America is racist to the root — a view that is conventional wisdom among elements of the party’s progressive wing — contradicts the opinion of most Americans and is handing Republicans a political cudgel for the 2022 midterm elections.
Do you have any examples of how C.R.T. is being taught in schools?
You’d have to look long and hard to find any K-12 classroom where the term “critical race theory” comes up. Instead, what critics tend to target is the influence of concepts derived from C.R.T. that infuse the equity training field (some examples include acknowledging and subverting white privilege, or labeling people as oppressors or oppressed based on identity). This kind of training has been offered by various school districts to teachers in the name of combating implicit bias.
While the anti-C.R.T. activist Christoper F. Rufo lists 11 examples of “critical race theory in education,” most are examples of schools offering teachers diversity training. He also cites a lesson planned for third graders in Cupertino, Calif., in which students were asked to draw an “identity map” listing their race, class and gender, and the teacher was asked to identify some characteristics as part of the “dominant culture.” But according to The Washington Post, the lesson was canceled after one use when parents complained.
Meanwhile, some schools have recommended to young readers the book “Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness,’’ which, in discussing the police shooting of a person of color, makes the point that white supremacy is embedded in American society.
The show covered criticisms of C.R.T. from the right. Is there criticism of the theory from the left?
Some classical liberals have argued that critical race theory rejects concepts like meritocracy, individualism and unbridled free speech, which it deems products of a white dominant culture. Taking a different angle, John McWhorter, an author who teaches at Columbia University, argues that C.R.T. as interpreted by the anti-racism training field “diminishes Black people in the name of dignifying us.”
What should listeners read if they want to learn more about C.R.T.?
A seminal book by some of the founding scholars of the academic movement is “Words That Wound’’ (1993). The introductory chapters of “Critical Race Theory: An Introduction” (2001) lay out the movement’s genesis and principal views.
In recent months, there have been good explainers in the press about how America’s reckoning over systemic racism in policing brought new prominence to critical race theory — and provoked a backlash. I found this piece by Fabiola Cineas in Vox helpful, along with this column by Michelle Goldberg of The Times. A deep dive into the related topic of anti-bias training — inspired partly by C.R.T. — can be found in a Times Magazine profile of Robin DiAngelo, author of “White Fragility,” by Daniel Bergner. Adam Harris in The Atlantic took a look at bills in state legislatures seeking to ban “divisive concepts” in education and elsewhere. And Wikipedia (insert usual caveats) has a quite comprehensive look.

Holding Onto Hope
Debby Rosenkrantz, a trial participant for an experimental Alzheimer's drug, spoke with The Daily on Wednesday’s episode. Kayana Szymczak for The New York Times
Pam Belluck, a health and science writer, reflects on her recent reporting on Aduhelm, a controversial new Alzheimer’s drug, through one family’s experience with it:
By the time I had interviewed Debby Rosenkrantz and Susan Woskie for The Daily, I had been covering Alzheimer’s and dementia for more than a decade.
I’ve traveled to Colombia to report about the world’s largest family with genetic early-onset Alzheimer’s; went to South Korea to write about children being trained to assist people with dementia; and spent time in a California men’s prison to observe how convicted murderers were helping fellow prisoners with dementia with activities like showering, shaving and eating. I’ve written about how dementia might affect the ability to give sexual consent. And this past year I’ve written about Covid and dementia.
Aduhelm: What to Know About the New Alzheimer’s Drug
F.D.A. approval. In June 2021, the ​​​​Food and Drug Administration approved Aduhelm, the first new Alzheimer’s medication in nearly two decades. The approval was made despite opposition from many experts, who cited data showing it wasn’t clear whether the drug works and it had serious safety risks.
A controversial drug. The F.D.A.’s independent advisory committee and a council of senior agency officials voted overwhelmingly that data failed to conclusively show that Aduhelm slowed cognitive decline. Still, the agency granted approval for the drug but required Biogen, the drug’s manufacturer, to conduct a new clinical trial that will take several years.
Growing concerns. Questions about the approval, and whether the F.D.A. worked too closely with Biogen, have prompted investigations by two powerful congressional committees, the Health and Human Services department’s inspector general and other agencies. Major medical centers, including the Cleveland Clinic, have declined to offer Aduhelm.
Medicare coverage. Citing Aduhelm's uncertain benefit and significant safety risks, Medicare officials announced that the federal insurance program would limit coverage of the drug to participants in clinical trials. A powerful Alzheimer's advocacy group had pushed relentlessly for broad access.
I’ve become well aware of the complexities and cruelties of this condition, and I’ve followed the roller-coaster ride of the search for answers — from discoveries of a gene mutation that might protect against Alzheimer’s to out-of-the-box therapeutic approaches like using flickering light and sound.
As I’ve been talking with patients and family members for my recent reporting on the new drug, Aduhelm, what has struck me most is how thoughtful and insightful they’ve been about the difficult situation they find themselves in. Several people I’ve interviewed are clear-eyed and candid about their poignant reality, including Debby and her wife, Susan.
The couple knows that so far Debby, who participated in the clinical trial of Aduhelm and began receiving monthly infusions of it again about 10 months ago, has experienced no discernible benefit from the drug. “It just feels like there’s a blank in places where there shouldn’t be a blank in my brain,” Debby told me.
They understand the drug can cause brain swelling or brain bleeding, and Debby undergoes regular brain scans to check for such effects. And Susan, a retired professor of public health, told me before the F.D.A. decision that the data about the drug was “squishy stuff” and that if the F.D.A. decided not to approve it, “that wouldn’t surprise me, and it might make sense.”
And yet they have decided to continue giving the drug a try. They are doing so because they realize there is nothing else out there for them yet. Maybe doing something, whether it’s taking an unproven drug or exercising or changing one’s diet, can give some people a sense of hope that might be therapeutic in itself. In a devastating, unpredictable disease that little by little steals away part of one’s mind, hope may actually be the best medicine available right now.

Critical Race Theory FAQ
critical race theory
frequently asked questions
To help you learn more about Critical Race Theory, LDF has compiled answers to the most frequently asked questions about it. This resource also includes information on the laws banning racial justice discourse being enacted across the country and how they fit into a larger effort to suppress the voice, history, and political participation of Black Americans.
What is Critical Race Theory?
Critical Race Theory, or CRT, is an academic and legal framework that denotes that systemic racism is part of American society — from education and housing to employment and healthcare. Critical Race Theory recognizes that racism is more than the result of individual bias and prejudice. It is embedded in laws, policies and institutions that uphold and reproduce racial inequalities. According to CRT, societal issues like Black Americans’ higher mortality rate, outsized exposure to police violence, the school-to-prison pipeline, denial of affordable housing, and the rates of the death of Black women in childbirth are not unrelated anomalies.
Who created Critical Race Theory?
Why should I care about Critical Race Theory?
Why do some lawmakers want to ban CRT?
The term “critical race theory” has been co-opted by opponents as a catch-all and rallying cry to silence any discussions about systemic racism, ban the truthful teaching of American history, and reverse progress toward racial justice. The term has been unjustifiably used to include all diversity and inclusion efforts, race-conscious policies, and education about racism, whether or not they draw from CRT. Attempts to ban CRT are really attacks on free speech, on discussions about the truthful history of race and racism in the U.S., and the lived experiences of Black people and other people of color.
Lawmakers and proponents of the bans insist they are advocating for a balanced and “patriotic” education. However, these bans do the exact opposite: deny the truth about our nation’s history, silence dissent, and punish those who speak the truth to counter whitewashed falsehoods.
Why did Critical Race Theory suddenly come under fire?
What does recent legislation regarding Critical Race Theory seek to ban?
Which states have passed laws banning Critical Race Theory?
More than 25 states have introduced legislation that could restrict or ban what students can learn and what teachers can teach about our nation’s history. More than 66 anti-truth bills have been introduced or pre-filed. More than 12 states have already passed versions of anti-truth laws or mandated similar statewide policies. (Source: Edweek)

A Flourish map
What are the common elements of recent legislation attacking CRT?
Bans on any discussion or teaching that the United States is inherently or fundamentally racist.
Bans on what legislatures have deemed “divisive concepts,” including white supremacy, male privilege, white privilege, equity, unconscious or implicit bias systemic racism. However, the bans lack context, definitions, or examples of the ways they are being taught.
Requirements to teach “without giving deference to any one perspective” and provide a counter narrative or opposing view of anything being taught.
Ban discussions of systemic racism and sexism that would “discriminate,” “hurt feelings” or make someone feel “guilty” about their skin color.
Drastic limits and funding cuts for anti-bias trainings and diversity and inclusion initiatives for students and teachers.
Provisions allowing the state to withhold funding for schools that violate the bans.
What was President Trump’s role in the backlash to Critical Race Theory?
What role do school districts and school boards play in the bans of education on the history of systemic racism?
The vast majority of school board members are elected officials who have power over school policy decisions, budgets, programming, resource allocation, curriculum, and faculty tenure. They have the power to vote down or institute school district policies, programs, and budgets. Currently, unprecedented numbers of mostly white parents are attending meetings to demand that school boards use their power to ban the teaching of so-called “critical race theory” in schools.
Recent efforts to ban racial justice discourse are part of a long American history of backlash in response to demands for educational equity. Laws banning racial justice discourse are attacks on all students’ right to a fair, full, and truthful education about their country and their communities. Members of school boards must use their influence to resist bans on truth and defend the rights of teachers and students to discuss race in a classroom setting. Lo cal elections have the power to shape the future of your school district. Learn more about local elections and candidates at Vote.org.
What does the 1619 Project have to do with these laws?
How are LDF and coalition partners countering the bans on the teaching of race and racism?
LDF is at the forefront of the fight to ensure that America lives up to the ideals of justice and equality for all. The right to free expression and the right to vote are cornerstones of our democracy. Its protection is particularly critical for Black Americans and other marginalized groups who have a long history of battling disenfranchisement.
After former President Trump issued Executive Order 13950, LDF swiftly filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality as a violation of the First Amendment guarantee of free speech and the Fifth Amendment guarantees of due process and the equal protection of the law.

The African American Policy Forum launched the #TruthBeTold campaign to document the impact and damage caused by the Executive Order. The campaign underscores the need for deeper engagement on and examination of issues of race, gender, intersectionality, and justice. Learn more about AAPF’s #TruthBeTold campaign here.

Critical Race Theory
[ krit -i-ku h l reys theer -ee ]
Published July 2, 2021
What is Critical Race Theory?
Critical Race Theory (commonly abbreviated as CRT) refers to a way of analyzing systems, institutions, and power through a lens of race and racism.
Central to Critical Race Theory is the idea that many institutions are built on and enforce systemic racism and oppression of people of color, that this racism and oppression have a long history in the US and the world (including slavery and its legacy), and that they are ongoing and driven by white supremacy.
As an academic, intellectual, or philosophical discipline or school or thought, Critical Race Theory is broad and encompasses the discussion and use of many related concepts and terms, such as implicit bias, intersectionality, and white privilege.
Critical Race Theory has widespread influence among scholars who study race and racism and is also applied by scholars and professionals in other fields, including law and education. It is part of or is the basis for part of the curriculum in some schools and universities.
The theory has become a target of criticism, particularly among conservative politicians and others who claim it is divisive and is used to further many of the policies and values that they are opposed to. Proponents of Critical Race Theory often accuse such critics of frequently misrepresenting the theory, the ideas behind it, and the ways in which it is taught or used as the basis for programs or policies.

Where does Critical Race Theory come from?
The term Critical Race Theory was coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who was one of the early developers of the theory, along with scholars Derrick Bell and Alan Freeman, among others. (Crenshaw is also credited with coining the term intersectionality .) The movement is often traced to a 1989 workshop, but it grew out of earlier research. Early scholarly work in what became known as Critical Race Theory was done in the context of US law, including analysis of why civil rights legislation of the 1960s and 1970s had not been more effective at lessening the social and economic disparities between white Americans and Black Americans, Native Americans, and other people of color. It has since been applied to other institutions that theorists believe maintain and are influenced by systemic racism, including in the areas of education, housing, finance, and labor.
Critical Race Theory gained widespread public attention in 2020 and 2021, largely due to criticism by conservatives of its application in schools and other institutions, including the military.
Critical Race Theory is a complex body of thought that encompasses multiple disciplines, and its concepts and conclusions are interpreted in different ways. Even the words in its name are subject to debate as to what they mean or imply in the term itself or in general.
Critical
The most general sense of the word critical means “containing careful or analytical evaluations,” and, like in many other academic contexts, this is how the word is often intended in Critical Race Theory. The more specific, popular sense of critical means “containing or making negative judgments or assessments.” This sense is also associated with Critical Race Theory due to the fact that many of the conclusions reached using it as an analytical framework are indeed critical of institutions that are thought to perpetuate institutional racism.
Race
Throughout history, the word race has commonly been used to refer to an arbitrary and unscientific classification of humans based on various physical characteristics, especially skin color. This classification is a foundation of racism. In contrast, those who apply Critical Race Theory largely view race as a socially constructed system of categorization that divides society and oppresses people of color.
Theory
Critical Race Theory is an academic theory —“a systematically organized body of knowledge applicable in a relatively wide variety of circumstances, especially a system of assumptions, accepted principles, and rules of procedure devised to analyze, predict, or otherwise explain the nature or behavior of a specified set of phenomena.” In other words, it is a way of thinking and analyzing things based on a body of supporting research and observations (as opposed to a hypothesis that is meant to be “proved” or “disproved”).
Examples of Critical Race Theory
I went from being a conventional "sociologist of race" to embracing critical race theory and intersectionality.
@alwaystheself, October 2016
The Trump administration has instructed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity trainings that address topics like white privilege and critical race theory, calling them "divisive, anti-American propaganda."

Who uses Critical Race Theory?
Critical Race Theory is applied by many scholars of race and racism and is taught as part of the curriculum in some US schools and universities, typically with the goal of educating about the legacy and effects of systemic racism.

Abstract
Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a body of scholarship steeped in radical activism that seeks to explore and challenge the prevalence of racial inequality in society. Central to CRT is the understanding that race and racism are the product of social thought and power relations. Racism is understood to operate through structures and assumptions that appear normal and unremarkable to most individuals in society. This entry sets out the historic beginnings of CRT, the central tenets of the theory, and key criticisms often leveled against it. Recent developments and movements associated with CRT are also considered.

Alright, so I've got this task to figure out why people are against Critical Race Theory. First things first, I need to understand what Critical Race Theory actually is. From the search results, it seems like CRT is an academic concept that examines how race and racism are embedded in laws and institutions in the United States. It suggests that racism isn't just about individual biases but is systemic and affects various aspects of society, from education to housing to criminal justice.

Looking at Doc 1, which is from EndAsianHate.org, it provides a pretty straightforward definition of CRT. It mentions that CRT is a field of intellectual inquiry that demonstrates how racism is legally codified in America. The document outlines five core tenets of CRT:

1. Race is a social construct, not biologically determined.

2. Racism is central to American culture and legal systems.

3. CRT is committed to social justice and aims to eradicate racism and oppression.

4. Personal experiences and narratives are crucial to understanding and addressing racism.

5. CRT is interdisciplinary and draws from various traditions.

This gives me a good starting point. So, CRT is about understanding how racism is institutionalized and how it affects society at large.

Moving on to Doc 2 from The New York Times, it provides more context on the current controversy around CRT, especially in relation to education. It mentions that there's a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation about CRT, and that in practice, it's not being taught directly in K-12 schools. Instead, critics are targeting diversity training and certain educational materials that they believe are influenced by CRT principles.

The NYT article also mentions that conservatives argue that CRT divides people into oppressors and oppressed based on race, which they see as accusing all white people of being racist. On the other hand, Democrats are divided on the issue, with some concerned that emphasizing systemic racism could alienate voters.

This suggests that the opposition to CRT is partly political, with some seeing it as a threat to traditional views of American history and national identity.

Doc 3 from NAACP LDF delves into the efforts to ban CRT and similar concepts in schools. It argues that these bans are part of a broader attempt to suppress discussions about racism and racial justice, and to control the narrative around American history. The document points out that these bans often lack clarity and can censor a wide range of topics and perspectives.

It's interesting that the bans are not just about CRT but also include terms like "divisive concepts," "white privilege," and "systemic racism." This seems to be an attempt to stifle any conversation that challenges the notion of America as a purely meritocratic and just society.

Doc 4 from Dictionary.com offers a concise definition of CRT and notes that it has become a target of criticism, especially among conservatives who see it as divisive. The dictionary entry emphasizes that CRT is an academic theory used to analyze institutions and power structures through a lens of race and racism.

Lastly, Doc 5 is an encyclopedia entry that provides a scholarly overview of CRT, its origins, key tenets, and criticisms. It reinforces the idea that CRT is about understanding how racism is embedded in social structures and power relations.

So, synthesizing these sources, it seems that the opposition to CRT stems from several factors:

1. Misunderstanding: Many people don't fully understand what CRT is, and it's often misrepresented in public discourse.

2. Political ideology: Some conservatives view CRT as incompatible with their vision of American history and national identity, seeing it as promoting division and resentment.

3. Fear of indoctrination: There's concern that teaching CRT in schools could indoctrinate children with a particular political viewpoint.

4. Defense of white privilege: By highlighting systemic racism, CRT challenges the idea that success is solely based on merit, which some people may perceive as an attack on white achievement.

5. Control over education: There's a broader trend of state interference in educational curricula, with some lawmakers seeking to dictate what can and cannot be taught in schools.

Given this, I think the main reasons people are against CRT are a combination of misunderstanding, political ideology, and a desire to maintain the status quo. It's important to approach this topic with nuance, recognizing that the controversy is complex and multifaceted.

**Final Answer**
