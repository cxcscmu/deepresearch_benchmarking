Alright, so I've been asked to look into why video games don't cause violence. Now, I know that this is a pretty controversial topic, and there are a lot of different opinions out there. Some people firmly believe that video games can lead to aggressive behavior and even violence, while others argue that there's no solid evidence to support that claim. So, my task here is to explore the arguments against the idea that video games cause violence.

First off, I need to understand what the general concerns are regarding video games and violence. I think the main worry is that exposing people, especially young people, to violent content in games can desensitize them to violence and potentially make them more likely to act aggressively in real life. There have been instances where individuals involved in violent acts have been gamers, which has fueled this debate.

But just because there might be a correlation between gaming and violence in some cases doesn't necessarily mean there's a causation. Correlation does not imply causation, right? So, maybe there are other factors at play here. Maybe people who are already predisposed to violence are drawn to violent games, rather than the games causing the violence.

I should probably look into some studies that have been done on this topic. Maybe there have been longitudinal studies that track the behavior of gamers over time to see if there's an increase in violent tendencies. Or perhaps there are meta-analyses that compile data from multiple studies to get a broader picture.

Let me consider doing a search to find some recent research on this subject. Maybe something like "do video games cause violence?" or "impact of video games on aggression." I should also look for articles that discuss both sides of the argument, so I can get a well-rounded view.

Do video games cause violence
The question whether or not playing video games elicits violence has been a highly debated topic. Psychologist, educationist and children experts have attempted to justify their stands through various arguments and research. With about 97 percent of youths playing video games in the United States, the games are blamed for school shootings, bullying and sexual violence among other vices. However, it is my belief; video games are not the source of violence.
Video game sales have swelled while cases of juvenile delinquency reduced.  It is estimated that the demand for video games has risen over the last thirty years putting the sales at 13.1 billion by 2014. However, the instances of violent activities among the youths have dwindled significantly, making the argument realistic. The Federal Bureau of Investigations documented that by 2014, murder cases perpetrated by children reduced by 76 percent while violent cases by 37 percent. Moreover, victimization cases at school also decreased.
There is no link between the two factors. The numerous studies conducted by psychologists concluding that video games result in violence have failed to establish precision. For an individual to develop violence tendencies, various factors predispose them to this behavior. These include mental health, family history of violence, neglect, and abuse. In contrast, individuals play video games for minutes or hours; these games do not portray reality as compared to factors such as violence at home. Hence, they are less likely to cause violent tendencies.
Video games facilitate the release of anger and stress among the players. Research by the Journal of Adolescent Health observed that youths that played video games efficiently managed their emotions. According to the findings, more players responded that video games enabled them to concentrate their anger and frustrations on the game making them relax. Thus, videogames are an alternative measure to deal with rough and violent tendencies as opposed to causing real-life violence.

Researches conducted are not conclusive. Psychologists utilize various methods of understanding violence. Among the commonly used is determining the amount of pain one individual can inflict on another and be considered violent such as forcing one to listen to loud music. However, in studying the effects of video games towards violence, researchers collected data from a negligible number of students, whom they exposed to playing video games and then observed their behavior and adoption of aggression tendencies. The research is inconclusive as it provides non-standard results. Moreover, such conclusions necessitate a comprehensive study carried out over the years, thus unreliable.
The courts have affirmed that video games do not result in violence. Various courts in the United States have failed to uphold the findings of the various researches on videogames and violence. According to them, the available results of the research have been unable to validate their notion of a causation relationship between videogames and violence. For instance, the judgment in the case, Brown versus Entertainment Merchant Association, the U.S Supreme Court upheld the notion that no conclusive evidence was present to warrant the banning of the sale of video games as the research findings were undependable. Therefore, he ruled for the video games company.
Individuals that play video games can differentiate between games and reality. The stages of development by Erick Erickson ascertain that children playing video games have attained intellectual knowledge to distinguish reality from the virtual world. According to him, children begin playing video games in the industry vs. inferiority stage, where they master competence in their actions. Consequently, this makes them capable of understanding that video games present fantasy scenarios that are absent in the real world thus, prevent them from conducting violent actions.
In conclusion, the need to link violent behavior to video games has resulted in the utilization of warning tails that seeks to demonize any activity that causes misunderstanding by people not experiencing it. Nevertheless, factors such as lack of conclusive research and causation evidence, increase in sales of video games while violence cases reduce and the ability to differentiate real life and fantasy shows video games do not elicit aggression.

Gaming
Do Video Games Cause Violence?
By Uneeb Asim
May 31, 2021
The world of gaming is ever-changing. With the hot topic of Cloud gaming vs. Gaming PC taking new turns and allowing more people than ever to access high-end games, we have seen a lot of debate revolving around video games and violence.
Video games have made a comeback in the press, but this time for all the wrong reasons. This time, the most famous form of entertainment among teenagers and adults has instigated a lot of political debate.
That takes us to the million-dollar question: Do video games cause violence, or has society found a convenient scapegoat for its failings?
People have argued that video games are dangerous since they first became popular. Is there any proof that this is real, or is it just a bunch of lies?
We’re about to deconstruct the evidence and expose the truth about video games and their connection to abuse. We’ll also debunk some common misunderstandings and discuss what we think video game developers can do in the future. Let’s go!
Unearthing What Science Has to Say About It
Let’s get straight to the point: there is very little proof that video games cause violence. There is about as much evidence to back it up as there is to back up the belief that black cats are unlucky.
It isn’t a new finding; studies have shown the same thing for years. Even though the University of Oxford recently published this study, many people still refuse to accept that video games can be beneficial, especially our parents and older people.
Is there any evidence to back up the argument that video games cause people to become violent? As we previously said, not necessarily – but there is one piece of information that people cling to:
According to Russell Shilling, the American Psychological Association’s chief science officer, some video games trigger a slight increase in violence after playing. CNBC, a well-established American television channel, also reported that.
He quickly clarified, however, that aggression does not imply brutality. The thing is, we are aware of it. We understand why a parent can feel that video games are harmful.
During a Counter-Strike or Call of duty match, many people who usually are friendly become irritated. When a mother or a sibling sees that behavior, it is quite natural for them to think that gaming is the main culprit for this aggressive behavior.
Such experiments are not peer-reviewed. They don’t go through the same rigorous checks and balances that legitimate research endeavors, let say like finding a cure for Covid 19, would go through.
Most tests and studies conducted by our researchers cannot be trusted enough to form an opinion. Here is why!
Typically, the test subjects like you and me are asked to play video games for 15-20 minutes before answering ambiguous questionnaires designed to bring forth the desired response. To prove a preconceived idea, these researchers work backward. There is not much in the way of “scientific” material about these studies.
Violent Video Games Can Have Adverse Effect On Children
While we have heard it a lot, we don’t think there is any objective scientific evidence for this one. We’re not sure why this argument is still being spread around by researchers; although there might be some merit to it, it is easy to dismiss.
Children who engage in aggressive behavior are more likely to have a difficult upbringing. Children who are having difficulties at home are more likely to play video games, escape into a fantasy world, and release pent-up frustration.
In any case, it’s clear that those who make this claim often skip right over the “struggling at home” aspect and blame the problem on video games.
For this reason, regulatory bodies like the ESRB and PEGI exist. They regulate the gaming industry. Games aimed at a mature audience are rated accordingly. Minors are not permitted to play these games.
In all honesty, this topic is a perfect example of poor parenting being used to criticize a thoroughly enjoyable form of entertainment. Consider it like blaming knife manufacturers and the automobile industry for a few irresponsible parents who let their children and teenagers play with kitchen knives and ride heavy bikes.
Developers of video games are not villains that sell ultra-violent games to children. According to essential facts, less than 29% of gamers are under the age of 18. Since the bulk of the target audience isn’t teenagers, video games have mature content.
THE BLAME GAME IS BEING PLAYED
People despise taking responsibility, regardless of the situation. Examine these two scenarios to see if you can figure out who is more likely to be the perpetrator of violent behavior.
Military-grade firearms that are readily available in the market (in some countries).
Video Games that are violent.
I know my answer, and I am sure you share a similar opinion.
If you see a child with a gun, a realistic assessment of the child in possession of a weapon will be that he or she has a rough home life and mental problems that come with it. Sadly, people tend to form different opinions when it comes to video games.
Violent Video Games Attract Violent People
It is similar to the previous point, “60 percent of middle school boys who played at least one Mature-rated game hit or beat up someone,” according to a commonly quoted estimate.
Yes, violent games are generally preferred by aggressive people, but studies have shown that this is a positive thing. Aggressive people must find a way to channel their anger, or it could have negative consequences.
Violent video games causing violence is a common opinion among older adults.  Even though it would be better if they tried out video games on decent gaming computers, as they would realize just how much fun gaming could be!
Violent Video Games Sensitize Players to Violence in Real Life
It assumes that people cannot tell fantasy from reality, which, while valid for a small percentage of the population, isn’t true for the vast majority of us. Let us take, for example, Tom and Jerry to explain it.
Many of us grew up watching the cartoon, and we all remember Tom being pulled across a cheese grater. We also witnessed him being thrashed by a mallet, a coconut, a spoon, a piano, and various other objects.
How many of us wished we could beat Tom? We are guessing there are not too many. It is almost disrespectful to say that gamers will start treating make-believe violence as actual violence.
With that said, people have most likely taken measures to prevent misinformation from spreading. As you can see below, several people have taken to social media to spread memes about video games causing abuse.
Though memes are amusing, this wonderful hobby is still under threat, and the game developers have the power to help us.
How Video Game Developers Should Treat Violence
Despite the lack of hard evidence that violent video games cause people to become violent, developers must nevertheless take action. It is not enough to ignore the fears of people who have been deceived; reforms must be constructed and implemented.
We’re not saying that video games should reduce violence; instead, they should make it more meaningful. Take, for example, GTA or any first-person shooter game, where you get to shoot a bunch of thugs while listening to upbeat music, but it all changes as you get closer to the ending.
The music stops, and you are left to retrace your steps in silence over a carpet of bodies. A few first-person shooters game out there can be used as an example – basically, any game that features violence with a realistic twist.
Games in which you can shoot cowering civilians and live with the consequences, or games in which refraining from aggression has significant advantages. Violence, but not in a way that glorifies it.
The famous TV show on HBO, Game of Thrones, does a decent job of this. The violence is prevalent, but everybody suffers as a result. You might also say that Grand Theft Auto does something similar – if you want to hear the thoughts on GTA and other controversial video games, check out this thread!
Conclusion
According to many papers and researches, video game exposure is only one of the risk factors for violent activity and aggression. Multiple reports point to prejudice and racial hatred, mental health, unequal social structures, and quick access to firearms and other deadly weapons as a fundamental cause of violence.
Focusing on violent video games as the cause of mass shootings would almost divert politicians’ and elected leaders’ attention away from more critical issues.
With that said, there are still plenty of people who believe violent video games cause actual violence. If you cannot persuade them otherwise, send them to read this article, it might change their views.

Do Video Games Cause Violence? 9 Pros and Cons
Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?
Last updated on:
6/8/2021 |
Author: ProCon.org
Around 73% of American kids age 2-17 played video games in 2019, a 6% increase over 2018. Video games accounted for 17% of kids’ entertainment time and 11% of their entertainment spending. The global video game industry was worth contributing $159.3 billion in 2020, a 9.3% increase of 9.3% from 2019.
Violent video games have been blamed for school shootings, increases in bullying, and violence towards women. Critics argue that these games desensitize players to violence, reward players for simulating violence, and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts.
Video game advocates contend that a majority of the research on the topic is deeply flawed and that no causal relationship has been found between video games and social violence. They argue that violent video games may provide a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings and may reduce crime. Read more background…
Pro & Con Arguments
Pro 1
Playing violent video games causes more aggression, bullying, and fighting.
60% of middle school boys and 40% of middle school girls who played at least one Mature-rated (M-rated) game hit or beat up someone, compared with 39% of boys and 14% of girls who did not play M-rated games. [2]
A 2014 peer-reviewed study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that habitual violent video game playing had a causal link with increased, long-term, aggressive behavior. [2]
Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that children who play M-rated games are more likely to bully and cyberbully their peers, get into physical fights, be hostile, argue with teachers, and show aggression towards their peers throughout the school year. [2] [31] [60] [61] [67] [73] [76] [80]
Pro 2
Simulating violence such as shooting guns and hand-to-hand combat in video games can cause real-life violent behavior.
Video games often require players to simulate violent actions, such as stabbing, shooting, or dismembering someone with an ax, sword, chainsaw, or other weapons. [23]
Game controllers are so sophisticated and the games are so realistic that simulating the violent acts enhances the learning of those violent behaviors. [23]
A 2015 peer-reviewed study found “compelling evidence that the use of realistic controllers can have a significant effect on the level of cognitive aggression.” [118]
Two teenagers in Tennessee who shot at passing cars and killed one driver told police they got the idea from playing Grand Theft Auto III. [48]
Bruce Bartholow, PhD, Professor of Psychology at the University of Missouri, spoke about the effects of simulating violence: “More than any other media, these [violent] video games encourage active participation in violence. From a psychological perspective, video games are excellent teaching tools because they reward players for engaging in certain types of behavior. Unfortunately, in many popular video games, the behavior is violence.” [53]
Pro 3
Many perpetrators of mass shootings played violent video games.
Kevin McCarthy, US Representative (R-CA), stated: “But the idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others – I’ve always felt that is a problem for future generations and others. We’ve watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it [mass shootings] took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.” [146]
Many mass shootings have been carried out by avid video game players: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in the Columbine High School shooting (1999); James Holmes in the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting (2012); Jared Lee Loughner in the Arizona shooting that injured Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others (2011); and Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway (2011) and admitted to using the game Modern Warfare 2 for training. [43][53]
An FBI school shooter threat assessment stated that a student who makes threats of violence should be considered more credible if he or she also spends “inordinate amounts of time playing video games with violent themes.” [25]
Dan Patrick, Republican Lieutenant Governor of Texas, stated: “We’ve always had guns, always had evil, but I see a video game industry that teaches young people to kill.” [145]
Pro 4
Violent video games desensitize players to real-life violence.
Desensitization to violence was defined in a Journal of Experimental Social Psychology peer-reviewed study as “a reduction in emotion-related physiological reactivity to real violence.” [51][111][112]
The study found that just 20 minutes of playing a violent video game “can cause people to become less physiologically aroused by real violence.” People desensitized to violence are more likely to commit a violent act. [51][111][112]
By age 18, American children will have seen 16,000 murders and 200,000 acts of violence depicted in violent video games, movies, and television. [110]
A Sep. 2011 peer-reviewed study found a causal link between violent video game exposure and an increase in aggression as a result of a reduction in the brain’s response to depictions of real-life violence. [52]
Studies have found reduced emotional and physiological responses to violence in both the long and short term. [55][58]
In a 2005 peer-reviewed study, violent video game exposure was linked to reduced P300 amplitudes in the brain, which is associated with desensitization to violence and increases in aggressive behavior. [24]
Pro 5
By inhabiting violent characters in video games, children are more likely to imitate the behaviors of those characters and have difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy.
Violent video games require active participation and identification with violent characters, which reinforces violent behavior. Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games.[59][4]
Child Development and Early Childhood Education expert Jane Katch stated in an interview with Education Week, “I found that young children often have difficulty separating fantasy from reality when they are playing and can temporarily believe they are the character they are pretending to be.” [124]
US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in his dissent in Brown v. ESA that “the closer a child’s behavior comes, not to watching, but to acting out horrific violence, the greater the potential psychological harm.” [124]
Pro 6
Exposure to violent video games is linked to lower empathy and decreased kindness.
Empathy, the ability to understand and enter into another’s feelings is believed to inhibit aggressive behavior. In a study of 150 fourth and fifth graders by Jeanne Funk, PhD, Distinguished University Professor of Psychology at the University of Toledo, violent video games were the only type of media associated with lower empathy. [32]
A study published in the American Psychological Association’s Psychological Bulletin found that exposure to violent video games led to a lack of empathy and prosocial behavior (positive actions that benefit others). [65][66]
Eight independent tests measuring the impact of violent video games on prosocial behavior found a significant negative effect, leading to the conclusion that “exposure to violent video games is negatively correlated with helping in the real world.” [61]
Several studies have found that children with high exposure to violent media display lower moral reasoning skills than their peers without that exposure. [32][69]
A meta-analysis of 130 international studies with over 130,000 participants concluded that violent video games “increase aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, and aggressive behaviors, and decrease empathic feelings and prosocial behaviors.” [123]
Pro 7
Video games that portray violence against women lead to more harmful attitudes and sexually violent actions towards women.
A 2012 peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence found that video games that sexually objectify women and feature violence against women led to a statistically significant increase in rape-supportive attitudes, which are attitudes that are hostile towards rape victims. [68]
A 1998 peer-reviewed study found that 21% of games sampled involved violence against women, while 28% portrayed them as sex objects. [23]
Exposure to sexual violence in video games is linked to increases in violence towards women and false attitudes about rape, such as that women incite men to rape or that women secretly desire rape. [30]
Carole Lieberman, MD, a media psychiatrist, stated, “The more video games a person plays that have violent sexual content, the more likely one is to become desensitized to violent sexual acts and commit them.” [64]
In Dec. 2014, Target Australia stopped selling Grand Theft Auto V in response to customer complaints about the game’s depiction of women, which includes the option to kill a prostitute to get your money back. [70]
Pro 8
Violent video games reinforce fighting as a means of dealing with conflict by rewarding the use of violent action with increased life force, more weapons, moving on to higher levels, and more.
Studies suggest that when violence is rewarded in video games, players exhibit increased aggressive behavior compared to players of video games where violence is punished. [23][59]
The reward structure is one distinguishing factor between violent video games and other violent media such as movies and television shows, which do not reward viewers nor allow them to actively participate in violence. [23][59]
An analysis of 81 video games rated for teens ages 13 and up found that 73 games (90%) rewarded injuring other characters, and 56 games (69%) rewarded killing. [71][72]
People who played a video game that rewarded violence showed higher levels of aggressive behavior and aggressive cognition as compared with people who played a version of the same game that was competitive but either did not contain violence or punished violence. [71][72]
Pro 9
The US military uses violent video games to train soldiers to kill.
The US Marine Corps licensed Doom II in 1996 to create Marine Doom in order to train soldiers. In 2002, the US Army released first-person shooter game America’s Army to recruit soldiers and prepare recruits for the battlefield. [6]
While the military may benefit from training soldiers to kill using video games, kids who are exposed to these games lack the discipline and structure of the armed forces and may become more susceptible to being violent. [79]
Dave Grossman, retired lieutenant colonel in the United States Army and former West Point psychology professor, stated: “[T]hrough interactive point-and-shoot video games, modern nations are indiscriminately introducing to their children the same weapons technology that major armies and law enforcement agencies around the world use to ‘turn off’ the midbrain ‘safety catch’” that prevents most people from killing. [77]
Con 1
Studies have shown violent video games may cause aggression, not violence. Further, any competitive video game or activity may cause aggression.
Lauren Farrar, Producer for KQED Learning’s YouTube series Above the Noise, stated: “Often times after tragic mass shooting, we hear politicians turn the blame to violent video games, but the reality is that the research doesn’t really support that claim… In general, violence usually refers to physical harm or physical acts that hurt someone– like hitting, kicking, punching, and pushing. Aggression is a more broad term that refers to angry or hostile thoughts, feelings or behaviors. So everything that is violent is aggressive, but not everything that is aggressive is violent. For example, getting frustrated, yelling, talking back, arguing those are all aggressive behaviors, but they aren’t violent. The research on the effects of violent video games and behavior often looks at these milder forms of aggressive behavior.” [140]
A peer-reviewed study in Psychology of Violence determined that the competitive nature of a video game was related to aggressive behavior, regardless of whether the game contained violent content. The researchers concluded: “Because past studies have failed to equate the violent and nonviolent video games on competitiveness, difficulty, and pace of action simultaneously, researchers may have attributed too much of the variability in aggression to the violent content.” [125] A follow-up study tracked high school students for four years and came to the same conclusion: the competitive nature of the games led to the increased hostile behavior. [126]
Con 2
Violent video games are a convenient scapegoat for those who would rather not deal with the actual causes of violence in the US.
Patrick Markey, PhD, Psychology Professor at Villanova University, stated: “The general story is people who play video games right after might be a little hopped up and jerky but it doesn’t fundamentally alter who they are. It is like going to see a sad movie. It might make you cry but it doesn’t make you clinically depressed… Politicians on both sides go after video games it is this weird unifying force. It makes them look like they are doing something… They [violent video games] look scary. But research just doesn’t support that there’s a link [to violent behavior].” [138]
Markey also explained, “Because video games are disproportionately blamed as a culprit for mass shootings committed by White perpetrators, video game ‘blaming’ can be viewed as flagging a racial issue. This is because there is a stereotypical association between racial minorities and violent crime.” [141]
Andrew Przybylski, PhD, Associate Professor, and Senior Research Fellow and Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute at Oxford University, stated: “Games have only become more realistic. The players of games and violent games have only become more diverse. And they’re played all around the world now. But the only place where you see this kind of narrative still hold any water, that games and violence are related to each other, is in the United States. [And, by blaming video games for violence,] we reduce the value of the political discourse on the topic, because we’re looking for easy answers instead of facing hard truths.” [139]
Hillary Clinton, JD, Former Secretary of State and First Lady, tweeted, “People suffer from mental illness in every other country on earth; people play video games in virtually every other country on earth. The difference is the guns.” [142]
Con 3
Simple statistics do not support the claim that violent video games cause mass shootings or other violence.
Katherine Newman, PhD, Dean of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, explained: “Millions of young people play video games full of fistfights, blazing guns, and body slams… Yet only a minuscule fraction of the consumers become violent.” [84][86][87][91][92]
A report by the US Secret Service and US Department of Education examined 37 incidents of targeted school violence between 1974 and 2000. Of the 41 attackers studied, 27% had an interest in violent movies, 24% in violent books, and 37% exhibited interest in their own violent writings, while only 12% showed interest in violent video games. The report did not find a relationship between playing violent video games and school shootings. [35]
Patrick M. Markey, PhD, Director of the Interpersonal Research Laboratory at Villanova University, stated, “90% of young males play video games. Finding that a young man who committed a violent crime also played a popular video game, such as Call of Duty, Halo, or Grand Theft Auto, is as pointless as pointing out that the criminal also wore socks.” [84]
Further, gun violence is less prevalent in countries with high video game use. A study of the countries representing the 10 largest video game markets internationally found no correlation between playing video games and gun-related killings. Even though US gun violence is high, the nine other countries with the highest video game usage have some of the lowest violent crime rates (and eight of those countries spend more per capita on video games than the United States). [97]
Con 4
As sales of violent video games have significantly increased, violent juvenile crime rates have significantly decreased.
In 2019, juvenile arrests for violent crimes were at an all-time low, a decline of 50% since 2006. Meanwhile, video game sales set a record in Mar. 2020, with Americans spending $5.6 billion on video game hardware, accessories, and assorted content. Both statistics continue a years-long trend. [143][144]
Total US sales of video game hardware and software increased 204% from 1994 to 2014, reaching $13.1 billion in 2014, while violent crimes decreased 37% and murders by juveniles acting alone fell 76% in that same period. [82][83][133][134][135]
The number of high school students who had been in at least one physical fight decreased from 43% in 1991 to 25% in 2013, and student reports of criminal victimization at school dropped by more than half from 1995 to 2011. [106][107]
An Aug. 2014 peer-reviewed study found that: “Monthly sales of video games were related to concurrent decreases in aggravated assaults.” [84]
Con 5
Studies have shown that violent video games can have a positive effect on kindness, civic engagement, and prosocial behaviors.
Research shows that playing violent video games can induce a feeling of guilt that leads to increased prosocial behavior (positive actions that benefit others) in the real world. [104]
A study published in Computers in Human Behavior discovered that youths exposed to violence in action games displayed more prosocial behavior and civic engagement, “possibly due to the team-oriented multiplayer options in many of these games.” [103]
Con 6
Many risk factors are associated with youth violence, but video games are not among them.
The US Surgeon General’s list of risk factors for youth violence included abusive parents, poverty, neglect, neighborhood crime, being male, substance use, and mental health problems, but not video games. [118]
A peer-reviewed study even found a “real and significant” effect of hot weather on homicides and aggravated assaults, showing that heat is a risk factor for violence. [124]
Con 7
Violent video game players know the difference between virtual violence in the context of a game and appropriate behavior in the real world.
By age seven, children can distinguish fantasy from reality, and can tell the difference between video game violence and real-world violence. [99][100] Video game players understand they are playing a game. Kids see fantasy violence all the time, from Harry Potter and the Minions to Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry. Their ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality prevents them from emulating video game violence in real life. [9] Exposure to fantasy is important for kids. Fisher-Price toy company stated: “Pretending is more than play: it’s a major part of a child’s development. Fantasy not only develops creative thinking, it’s also a way for children to deal with situations and problems that concern them.” [108]
Con 8
Violent video games provide opportunities for children to explore consequences of violent actions, develop their moral compasses and release their stress and anger (catharsis) in the game, leading to less real world aggression.
Violent games allow youth to experiment with moral issues such as war, violence, and death without real world consequences. A researcher at the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media wrote about her research: “One unexpected theme that came up multiple times in our focus groups was a feeling among boys that violent games can teach moral lessons… Many war-themed video games allow or require players to take the roles of soldiers from different sides of a conflict, perhaps making players more aware of the costs of war.” [2][38]
A peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that children, especially boys, play video games as a means of managing their emotions: “61.9% of boys played to ‘help me relax,’ 47.8% because ‘it helps me forget my problems,’ and 45.4% because ‘it helps me get my anger out.” [37]
Researchers point to the cathartic effect of video games as a possible reason for why higher game sales have been associated with lower crime rates. [84] A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Adolescent Research concluded that “Boys use games to experience fantasies of power and fame, to explore and master what they perceive as exciting and realistic environments (but distinct from real life), to work through angry feelings or relieve stress, and as social tools.” The games serve as a substitute for rough-and-tumble play. [36]
Con 9
Studies claiming a causal link between video game violence and real life violence are flawed.
Many studies failed to control for factors that contribute to children becoming violent, such as family history and mental health, plus most studies do not follow children over long periods of time. [10][95]
Video game experiments often have people playing a game for as little as ten minutes, which is not representative of how games are played in real life. In many laboratory studies, especially those involving children, researchers must use artificial measures of violence and aggression that do not translate to real-world violence and aggression, such as whether someone would force another person eat hot sauce or listen to unpleasant noises. [84][94]
According to Christopher J. Ferguson, PhD, a psychology professor at Stetson University, “matching video game conditions more carefully in experimental studies with how they are played in real life makes VVG’s [violent video games] effects on aggression essentially vanish.” [95][96]

Do Violent Video Games Make People Violent?
Do Violent Video Games Make People Violent?
by Janice Antoniette Förster | Posted on April 10, 2012
Graphics and animation software today allow programmers to develop far better graphics and animation effects that provide a realistic experience for video game players. While this brings delight to the players, it has posed a much greater concern for the critics. In fact it has reinvigorated the debate that blames this technology to the increase of violence in the country.
These are just some incidents:
A 13-year old boy jumped from the building’s 24 th floor and committed suicide after playing Warcraft III for 36 hours straight.
A teenager went on a rampage and killed three men, two of them police officers, after months of playing Grand Theft Auto.
A 17-year-old male killed his mother and wounded his after they took Halo 3 away from him.
A 15-year old ran away from home after his parents took his Xbox console away. His dead body was found almost a month after.
Two kids murdered 13 and wounded 23 before turning the gun on themselves acting out their own version Doom.
There are many more video game crimes and related controversies similar to these.
The media have their hands full. There are an increasing number of laws created against video games and a barrage of lawsuits filed against game developers. Parents are dragging their kids away from Xbox360, Wii, PlayStations, and computers because they seriously believe this technology affect their kids’ behavior and lead them to commit crimes. But the question is, does this prove that these so-called violent video games cause an increase in violence especially among youths? Aren’t there many other factors at play?
The truth is, researchers are in conflict…
Others say that there is plenty of evidence that shows a link between these acts of violence and the long-term anti-social behavior. They claim the exposure to violence in childhood, the same as when they are exposed to media and television violence, increases their likelihood to behave aggressively and do crimes in adulthood. For them, it is not linked to early symptoms of aggressive behavior, problems in parenting styles, factors related to socioeconomic status and environment safety.
Repeated acts of violence desensitize the natural aversion to violence that that child would otherwise have. And if the game rewards violent acts, but not non-violent ones, the child begins to think violence is not only acceptable but desirable. The longer a child is exposed to violence, the more ingrained these attitudes become. There’s a widespread but false belief that violent games are healthy because they allow kids a way of venting their aggression. They don’t.
Kids, Violence and Computer Games
They theorize that young people may have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what they experience in the game – most of which are just extremely graphic. Anti-game activists and researchers claim this is what leads them to act out what they have experienced in games. The age and experience of these players allow them to be easily influenced. Social Learning theory states that aggressive video games stimulate aggressive behavior and that long exposure can lead them to be desensitized to violent imagery and human suffering.
Dr. Craig Anderson, a psychologist from the Iowa State University of Science and Technology, claims that violent video games provides a chance for learning and practicing aggressive solutions to conflict situations . In another research, he also paired up with Dill, another researcher and the result was similar. They found out that aggressive personalities are the cause for “aggressive and delinquent behavior.” His research has been one of the most frequently cited and published researchers in video game violence. He also made a team with other researchers Bartholow and Carnagey and same results came out. Steven Kirsh, another researcher also had another study with a group of third and fourth graders and found that these type of games make children react with more hostility compared to children who do not play.
While these studies suggest physiological arousal, increased anti-social behavior and aggression-related feelings and thoughts, many experts argue there is generally a lack of quality studies which can be relied upon and that the video game industry has become an easy target for the media to blame for many modern day problems.
In a study conducted by the US government, the conclusion states that violence in video games is not linked with aggressive tendencies and that other factors are at play.  In fact, there are many benefits one can get out of playing games including its capability to help players deal with stress and anger. Surprisingly, in spite of the studies showing contrary results, some researchers are still continuing to argue that gaming is dangerous.
Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association reiterates:
Oh, it was those video games that brainwashed him”’ That’s much easier than saying our society is messed up, people don’t take care of each other, teachers aren’t in control, there’s rampant bullying, and there are no parents at home because they have to work two jobs.
Playing the Blame Game
In order to know the effects of violent images, a study conducted at Ryerson University and published in The Journal of Applied Cognitive Psychology, tested gamers and non-gamers of both genders for their ability to recall shocking images from a selection of benign pictures. Theoretically, those “desensitized” to violence should be less likely to remember the unpleasant images, but the results showed they were just as disturbed as the non-gamers. This suggested that those people of sound mind, able to distinguish fantasy from reality, did not equate video game violence to actual violence.
This is precisely the reason why we all have to take responsibility especially as developers, players and parents. We need to look into statutes and policies related to age requirements and limitations, language, and explicit materials to inform the users of what the game contains and the probable consequences that may or may not result from playing these games.
After all who’s to say that without this technology there would have been a much steeper drop in violence? There is no substantial evidence supporting the theory that the more the number of game sales increase, the violent crimes incidences also increase.
In fact, it just shows the opposite. It seems that just like the “weapons effect” – which led people to believe that guns turn people into dangerous aggressors and used by anti-gun advocates as a strong basis – studies on video games have simply led many to be unconstitutionally deprived of playing video games.
Video games are not the culprit. Or are they?

Video Games… Do they contribute to violence? • Treatment of Screen Overuse + Addiction
Video Games… Do they contribute to violence?
All Blog Posts, Video Games
Our team at Digital Media Treatment & Education Center works with teens and young adults who are impacted in a negative way due to the compulsive use of the Internet and video games, specifically violent video games. The current debate is: do violent video games cause someone to become violent towards others?
In our experience, they are one of the core contributing factors, however, as you read through this, you will find that other factors more often than not, must be present for someone to act out in violence towards others. Let’s start by examining violent acts that have been committed.
Youth Violence and Video Games
1999: shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado by two teenagers who played Doom, then a popular video game.
2011: a Norwegian who killed 77 said later that he honed his shooting skills by playing many hours of Call of Duty.
2012: Aurora theater shooter was reportedly “obsessed” with violent, role-playing games such as World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Soldiers of Misfortune.
2012: Newtown shooter played hours of the game Call of Duty, day in and day out.
You know what’s really exciting about video games is you don’t just interact with the game physically—you’re not just moving your hand on a joystick, but you’re asked to interact with the game psychologically and emotionally as well. You’re not just watching the characters on screen; you’re becoming those characters.
Nina Huntemann, Game Over
The New York Times recently published an article (“ Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link “) drawing the link between videos and violence:
Makers of firearms and related gear have come to see video games as a way to promote their brands to millions of potential customers.
Adding that,
Links on the Medal of Honor Warfighter video game site allowed visitors to click through the Web sites of the game’s partners and peruse their catalogs. ‘It is almost like a virtual showroom for guns’, said Ryan Smith, who contributes to the Gameological Society.’
One can see after reading this recent New York Times article how it is possible that playing violent games for hours and days at a time, along with being exposed to gun promotions and easy access to the gun manufactures online catalogs could increase the possibility of violent video games leading to gun violence.
It is important to recognize that there are many factors that can lead to violent acts by teens and young adults.
Violent Video Game Addiction
Compulsive video gaming can become a contributing factor to violence when:
The young person plays violent video games for hours and hours every day of the week for months/years. (Desensitization theory proposes that repeated exposure to mediated violence reduces children’s sensitivity to violence.) AND…
There are attempts by someone to intervene in the young persons gaming behavior. Teens and young adults have become physically violent when a parent attempts to or does interrupt their play by restricting the computer. They may physically harm the parent, destroy property, and threaten to or do harm to themselves, or run away.
OR… The young person has access to weapons (e.g. guns, knives, bow/arrow)
When the young person has the risk factors described below combined with these factors, it is important to seek intervention immediately.
Risk Factors for Teen Video Game Addiction
Excessively Introverted
Lacks strong social connections
History of bullying
Isolated from family in the home
They play video games on a computer/TV that is away from others such as in their bedroom or the basement.
Socially anxious and avoids others
Excessive use of all screens from a young age; began gaming at a young age
Impulsive
Depressed
Academic problems
Poor or changing grades
Truant
Lack of structure and supervision by parent(s)
Dangerous Video Games
Call of Duty-Black Ops
Medal of Honor War fighter
Halo-4
Grand Theft Auto
League of Legends
World of Warcraft
StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty
These games are some of the more popular games. Even the games approved for ages 13 and over, are violent in nature, have regular references to sex, and drugs and alcohol use.
One example of a game “approved” for those 13 and older is Batman: Arkham City
This action-adventure game features characters from the Batman Franchise.
Players assume the role of Batman. Punch, kick criminals, bloodstains, & female characters are dressed in form-fitting outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; silhouette of the words, “ live nude ”.
Sexual tension: “sure could go get some porn now.”
Depicts characters smoking, references to alcohol: ” “I’d give anything for a nice cold beer right now.”
References to violence: “ She got a little drunk and killed her classmates. ”
The words, “ b*tch ”, “ a*s ”, and “ bastard ” can be heard in the dialogue.
In light of what recently occurred in Newtown, CT, the fact that the game makers of Batman: Arkham City created dialogue referencing shooting classmates should be alarming to all parents and anyone who works with young people.  I doubt this is the only game with references similar to this. This highlights the importance of parents who purchase video games for their children to analyze and spend time viewing the game themselves before approving them for their children’s use.
Treatment for Addictive Gaming
Dr. Hilarie Cash, a national expert on Internet & video game addiction, recommends children do not start playing Internet video games until they have demonstrated recognized maturity and are in high school. I would like to highlight that—if the internet & gaming consoles-style games are violent in nature—I would encourage parents to withhold these until their child is in high school and at minimum 17 years old and, again, demonstrates a level of emotional stability and maturity.
Family Intervention
When our team prepares to support a family to intervene in their child’s video game addiction, we assess the child’s emotional and mental state, which includes any current diagnosis and history of treatment, history of violence and self-harm, as well as the parents’ ability to set and hold boundaries with their child.
Recovery Programs
Depending on the significance of the video game addiction and the co-existing problems, we may refer the young person to a treatment program that specializes in Technology dependency, such as Insight Intensive at Gold Lake in Ward, CO or Restart Internet Addiction Recovery progam in Fall City, WA.
Family Coaching Assistance
If treatment is not possible due to lack of financial resources, or not recommended, we may take a very slow approach to intervention with the young person and their family to ensure overall safety. We educate parents about the risks of violent video games, coach them on how to set boundaries in the home with their child’s use of computers, as well as build a connection over time with their child who is at risk and they begin to see the value of human contact, relationship with others, as well as feel less depressed and anxious, more motivated and interested in life outside of the computer.
Call us today for more detailed information about how we support families and young people who struggle with Internet addiction and video game addiction.
Negative Effects of Video Game Addiction
The reality is young people do get violent when they cannot play their video games. Research shows video gaming withdrawal behaviors similar to chemical addiction.
Video game withdrawal symptoms:
Increased irritability
Aggression
Depression
Overall anxiety
When an addict is withdrawing from alcohol and other substances such as, benzodiazepines, in significant cases they are at risk of dying if they do not have medical support around them.
Dangerous Behavior
Withdrawal from video game addiction will not cause someone to die due to seizures like the chemicals mentioned; however, it may induce a rage that becomes so out-of-control and irrational that the young people cannot control themselves. This can lead to suicide attempts, running away from home, violence towards parents and others.
Studies of Gaming Negative Effects
Research is finding that compulsive video game playing causes a shrinkage of the white matter in the brain, which is the area of the brain, that has to do with emotion and empathy.
A study found in, CYBERPSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOR Volume 10, Number 3, 2007© Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/cpb.2006.9942, found Negative effects of exposure to violence in online video games were detected. Playing violent video games was found to be significantly related to greater tolerance of violence, lower emphatic attitude toward others, and a higher level of aggression.
Common Co-Existing Issues
School failure
Social isolation
Increased phobias anxiety
Depression
Loss of employment
Increased alcohol/marijuana abuse
Increased aggression and violence in the home/community
Fantasies of “protecting oneself” by owning a gun or bow & arrow
These are the most common problems we find in our work with clients addicted to violent video games and the Internet. At Digital Media Treatment & Education Center, we are witnessing how the compulsive use of the Internet and violent video games are wreaking havoc in families and in the young person’s life.
Our team is hired by families to intervene and, thankfully, we have not experienced clients who acted out violently towards others, not yet anyway. Our concern however is, many parents do not understand how their child’s constant use of video games and the Internet is either causing or increasing their child’s maladaptive behaviors, and therefore, do not seek professional help to intervene.
How Schools Can Help
Schools are bringing in more and more technology and are struggling to understand how to promote healthy use of the Internet. Teachers and school counselors come to me at a loss about what to do. Those professionals on the front lines are experiencing concerns with technology use, such as video gaming and their students, but they can do little about it.
I encourage schools to educate their staff, as well as, parents about technology use and abuse. I encourage colleges and universities to require all in-coming freshman to take a class on healthy technology use, and to provide resources about where to go if they or someone they know is addicted.
Many school administrators and mental health professionals do not acknowledge this is a serious issue that negatively impacts the young people they work with, and therefore they are not speaking about it with their clients, their students, their staff, and the parents involved. Professional who are on the front lines and work with our young people must get educated and develop effective interventions and approaches when it comes to compulsive use of violent video games and the Internet. The more professionals understand, the more young people and their families we can help.
How Parents Can Help
There is shame and guilt about being “addicted” to the Internet and video games. Many parents and young people feel alone with this problem because no one is talking about it.
We can’t stress enough to parents and professionals who work with young people the importance of educating yourself about video game and Internet addiction.
Educate yourself about the games children are playing and what they are exposed to. Educate yourself about the strong draw to the Internet, social networking sites, chat rooms, pornography, YouTube videos, etc.
Video games are neither inherently good nor inherently bad. But people learn. And content matters.
Psychological Bulletin; 2010, Vol 136, No. 2, 151-173

Alright, I've got a bunch of information here from different sources. Let's try to make sense of it all. The main question is whether video games cause violence, and from what I'm seeing, there are arguments on both sides.

First, some people believe that video games do cause violence. They point to examples where individuals who have committed violent acts were also video game players. For instance, there are mentions of school shootings and other violent incidents where the perpetrators were known to play violent video games. There's also a study that suggests a link between playing violent video games and increased aggression and bullying behavior in middle school students.

Moreover, some argue that violent video games desensitize players to real-life violence. This means that by repeatedly experiencing violent scenarios in games, players might become less affected by real violence, which could make them more likely to commit violent acts themselves. There's a study that found a causal link between playing violent video games and a reduction in the brain's response to real violence, which could lead to increased aggression.

Additionally, there's concern that by identifying with violent characters in games, especially among young children who may have trouble distinguishing between fantasy and reality, players might be more likely to imitate violent behaviors. There's also the idea that video games reward violence, often giving players points or advantages for committing acts of violence, which could reinforce aggressive behavior.

On the other hand, there are arguments against the idea that video games cause violence. One key point is that correlation does not imply causation. Just because some individuals who commit violence also play video games doesn't mean that the games caused the violence. There could be other factors at play, such as mental health issues, family problems, or social environment.

Furthermore, statistics show that as video game sales have increased over the years, violent crime rates have actually decreased. This suggests that if video games were causing violence, we'd expect to see an increase in violent crimes, not a decrease. So, there's a discrepancy between the claims that video games cause violence and the actual trends in violence rates.

Some researchers also argue that the studies linking video games to violence are flawed. They point out that many of these studies have methodological issues, such as small sample sizes, short exposure times, and artificial measures of aggression that don't necessarily translate to real-world violence. There's a suggestion that when studies are conducted more rigorously, the link between video games and aggression disappears.

Another perspective is that video games can have positive effects. For example, some studies indicate that playing violent video games can lead to increased prosocial behavior and civic engagement. There's also the idea that video games provide an outlet for stress and aggression, allowing players to release pent-up emotions in a controlled environment, which might actually reduce the likelihood of real-world violence.

Moreover, many experts argue that video games are being used as a scapegoat for societal issues. Instead of addressing deeper problems like poverty, poor mental health services, and easy access to guns, people are quick to blame video games for acts of violence. This diverts attention from the real causes and prevents meaningful solutions from being implemented.

In conclusion, while there are arguments suggesting a link between violent video games and aggression, the evidence is not conclusive, and many factors need to be considered. The increase in video game popularity coinciding with a decrease in violence suggests that other factors are at play. It's important for parents and society to be aware of the content children are exposed to, but also to consider the broader context and not solely blame video games for acts of violence.

\boxed{\text{Video games do not necessarily cause violence, and their impact is likely influenced by a variety of factors.}}
