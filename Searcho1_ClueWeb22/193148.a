So I have this question: "How are managers today different from managers in the past?" Hmm, I guess I need to think about how management has evolved over time. I'm not really sure where to start, so maybe I should do some research to get a better understanding.

First, I need to define what I mean by "managers in the past." Let's say, for the sake of this discussion, that "the past" refers to management practices from, say, the early 20th century up to maybe the mid-1900s. And "today" would be the current era, like the 21st century so far.

I remember reading something about classical management theories, like those by Frederick Taylor and Max Weber, who were influential in the early days of management. Their approaches were more hierarchical and focused on efficiency and structure. Maybe that's different from how managers operate now.

Maybe I should look into the evolution of management styles and theories over time. There might have been shifts in priorities, techniques, and even the skills required for management.

Let me consider the technological aspect. Today, with the advent of computers, the internet, and various software tools, managers have access to a lot more data and communication tools than they did in the past. That probably changes how they make decisions and interact with their teams.

Also, the workforce has changed. There's more diversity, remote work is becoming common, and there are different generational expectations in the workplace. Managers today need to handle a more diverse and dispersed team, which might require different management approaches.

Perhaps I should think about leadership styles. In the past, management was often authoritarian, with managers making all the decisions and expecting obedience from subordinates. Nowadays, there's a trend towards more collaborative and servant leadership, where managers focus on supporting their team members and fostering a positive work environment.

Another factor could be the globalized business environment. Today, many companies operate internationally, which requires managers to handle cultural differences and manage global teams. That wasn't as common in the past.

I also recall hearing about the importance of emotional intelligence in modern management. Managers are expected to understand and manage their own emotions and those of their team members, which might not have been as emphasized in the past.

Maybe I should look into specific management theories from different eras to see how they compare. For example, scientific management from the early 1900s, human relations movement in the mid-20th century, and more contemporary approaches like agile management.

Let me try to list some key differences I can think of so far:

1. **Technological Advancements:** Managers today use advanced technology for communication, data analysis, and decision-making, whereas past managers relied more on manual methods.

2. **Workforce Diversity and Remote Work:** Modern managers deal with more diverse teams and often manage remote workers, requiring different management techniques.

3. **Leadership Styles:** Shift from authoritarian to more collaborative and supportive leadership styles.

4. **Globalization:** Managing international operations and diverse cultural contexts.

5. **Emotional Intelligence:** Greater emphasis on emotional intelligence and soft skills in management.

But I feel like this is a bit superficial. I need to dig deeper to understand the core differences in the role and approach of managers today compared to the past.

Maybe I should consider the goals and challenges of managers in different time periods. In the past, efficiency and cost reduction might have been paramount, while today, innovation, adaptability, and employee well-being are also critical.

Additionally, the business environment has changed dramatically. Past managers operated in a more stable and predictable environment, whereas today's managers face rapid changes, increased competition, and the need to stay ahead of technological disruptions.

I think it would be helpful to look at specific examples or case studies where management practices have evolved over time. For instance, how a company like General Electric has adapted its management strategies from the industrial age to the digital age.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look at management literature and see how key texts from different eras reflect the changing roles and responsibilities of managers.

Let me consider the education and training of managers. Have the requirements for managerial positions changed over time? Are there new skills or qualifications that are now necessary?

I suspect that in the past, managerial positions were often filled based on seniority or technical expertise, whereas today, there is a greater emphasis on formal management education and specific soft skills.

Moreover, the way managers measure success might have changed. In the past, metrics like production output and cost control were likely the main indicators of managerial performance. Today, metrics might include employee satisfaction, customer experience, and innovation outcomes.

Sustainability and social responsibility are also becoming increasingly important in modern management. Managers today are expected to consider the environmental and social impact of their decisions, which may not have been a major concern in the past.

I should also think about the speed of decision-making. With faster access to information and quicker communication channels, managers today might need to make decisions more rapidly than their predecessors.

On the other hand, the pace of change might also require managers to be more strategic and forward-thinking, anticipating future trends and challenges.

Perhaps another difference is in the way managers build and maintain relationships. In the past, relationships might have been built through in-person interactions and hierarchical networks, whereas today, managers need to be adept at building virtual relationships and managing matrixed organizations.

I'm starting to see that there are numerous dimensions in which managers today differ from those in the past. To organize my thoughts, maybe I can categorize these differences into areas like technology, leadership style, workforce management, business environment, and managerial skills.

Let me try to expand on each of these areas:

1. **Technology:**

   - Past: Manual record-keeping, limited communication options (face-to-face, phone, mail).

   - Today: Digital tools for communication (email, instant messaging, video calls), data analytics, project management software, etc.

2. **Leadership Style:**

   - Past: Authoritarian, directive, top-down approach.

   - Today: Collaborative, participative, servant leadership, focusing on empowerment and development of team members.

3. **Workforce Management:**

   - Past: More homogeneous workforce, majority of employees working onsite.

   - Today: Diverse workforce, inclusion of different generations, genders, cultures; increased remote work and flexible schedules.

4. **Business Environment:**

   - Past: More stable, less globalized, slower pace of change.

   - Today: Highly competitive, globalized, rapid technological changes, need for agility and innovation.

5. **Managerial Skills:**

   - Past: Focus on technical skills, efficiency, cost control.

   - Today: Emphasis on emotional intelligence, communication, adaptability, strategic thinking, and sustainability.

This seems like a comprehensive list, but I wonder if there are other aspects I'm missing. Maybe I should look for academic research or articles that compare modern management to traditional management practices.

Let me try conducting a search to find some reliable sources on this topic.

Here is a quick response, and I could provide more details when I have a little more time and not in such a morning rush to get to work.
Traditional style of management is more comparable to the military style of management - very hierarchical, organized, disciplined, and sort of - "I am the boss, I tell you, you do. No questions asked". Strictly follows the direct chain of command. The ability of management is derived from the power of the position (not much of a management, if you ask me). Not much, if any, of soft skills required either. In today's world of management, it is used in the military (of every country out there) and countries like India, China, Japan and some European companies. However, it only works (I mean really works) in the military. Most of the western world (outside the military) has moved away from it due to the long-term downsides to the business in the areas of workforce morale etc.
Modern style of management largely depends on soft skills - consensus building, relationships, listening, and understanding, taking the team along with you willingly than dragging them along with you. The "manager" in this case may or may not have any actual power to adversely affect his/her followers, if they do not follow. The power of a manager is derived from the people who the manager manages (the managed) - and the managed give that power willingly to the manager. It is more comparable in modern day to a matrix organization and pure project management at its best. In my opinion, this is the best form of management in the long run, because it builds moral, participation, and sense of ownership among the managed.

The modern management accounting practice are typically different from that of traditional management accounting as they enable managers to make sound decisions to minimize cost as well in the same time add value to the products and services by improving the quality of products, which is required by the customers, and reduce waste. In addition, the modern management accounting systems allow the organisation as whole to develop the innovative capacity of the organisation and flexibility so that it can continually change and improve performance financially as well in its non financial areas of performance.
Traditional vs. Modern Innovative
Traditional will focus on cost control and, in particular, what is recognized as ‘variance analysis’ and which involves evaluating forecast outcomes with real outcomes – for example for costs such as materials and labour. The types of activity, therefore, that management accountants have traditionally involved themselves with include:
• Cost analysis
• Cost control
• Budget preparation
• Budgetary control processes
• Cost/benefit analysis
• Investment appraisal.
More modern, ‘innovative’ approaches include initiatives such as:
• Business process re-engineering: This is about rethinking and re-designing business processes as a means of reducing costs and improving delivery
• Zero-based budgeting: re-thinking budgets in a way that engage justifying and prioritising all items of expenditure
• Activity-based management: looking at what actually causes costs to be incurred, and being better able to forecast and control costs
• Life cycle costing: considering a product’s costs over its entire life cycle (rather than just, for example, the initial building costs)
• Total quality management: the process of continuous quality improvement
• ‘beyond budgeting’: a challenge to traditional budgeting techniques via the use of more flexible and wide ranging processes
• Balanced scorecards: the use of key performance indicators within four different perspectives – financial, customer, internal business process and learning/growth.
Non financial performance measurement approached gained momentum as a result of dissatisfaction with the traditional techniques such as balance sheets and income statement, as technology increasing and increasing global competition, companies able to recognize better their fault and might to improve their existing capabilities and create new ones – the most successful of these being Economic Value Added (EVA).
Initially Return on Investment (ROI) was used to enhancement the intuition and insight of managers. It was used to send down the goal for division managers to meet from corporate office. Since managers reward and endorsement prospects depended on the ability to meet targets, these core managers has a strong incentive to adjust their information accordingly.
Some businesses have built accounting teaching modules for their managers that help them recognize the detailed information they get. Management accountants have a vital responsibility in preparing and distributing training materials. Nowadays multifaceted managerial surroundings technical functions, particularly accounting, need to become more than suppliers of information. They must turn into a kind of an educating where managers can obtain training. So far in numerous organizations, accountants are too hectic to turn out to be instructors and internal reward systems likely depress such performances.

As the range of management accounting messages enlarge to contain non-financial presentation indicators, management accountants get an additional challenge. Many managers have complexities visualizing the cause and result relationships that connect cost drivers to financial returns. Yet this is the key information needed to manage value, and education is regularly required to help managers recognize improved the reason and result relations that cause shareholder value.
Increasing functional area means that managers are ever more detached from shareholder values. Many managers are powerfully devoted to the association without being dedicated to the financial aim that drives it. Management accountants have a responsibility to take part in instilling financial control and assigning financial values to non-financial managers. One technique is to need operating managers (rather than accountants) to systematically organize and present the financial study of their industry unit.
At the similar occasion that the management accounting role must pay great amount of attention to the efficiency of its inner infrastructure processes, other demands are occurring. There is rising pressure to decrease on the whole cost of the finance function as a fraction of revenues. There are gradually more time consuming demands for more comprehensive external reporting. While these final goals are vital and must be achieved, setting the precedence there only boost the risk that internal accounting communications will be unsuccessful to get their objectives and that management accounting system modify will be further postponed.
Conclusion
As discussed above, the modern management accounting relevant to modern organizational management issues as well rectify and reform the  traditional management  accounting practices to make decisions and specialized decisions based on relevant financial and non-financial information depending on the nature of activities, size, external circumstances and market conditions, customer profiles, organizational human resource issues, structural issues.
Even the modern management accounting is not additional but can be entirely different. As well, some are more appropriate to various organizations and some are not, given the internal management practices, size of organizations, top management support, human resource practices. Organizational structural issues, employee motivational factors, centralization decentralization issues. In other words, before considering implementing modern management accounting practices the management must have a feasibility study considering the above issues and evaluate the cost and benefit of the systems in financial and non-financial terms. Otherwise the benefits are applied without through evaluation and commitment by top management, therefore the benefits of these practices will not be realized fully. If carefully considered based on enough facts and not on emotions, then the modern management accounting with other strategies will certainly helpful for management to make sound decisions and therefore contribute to the success of the organization than the traditional management accounting practices.

Difference Between Traditional and Modern Farming
August 3, 2011 Posted by Aron
Traditional vs Modern Farming
Traditional farming and Modern farming differ from each other in a big way.  Traditional farming adheres to the traditional methods of agriculture.  On the other hand, modern farming experiments with the implementation of advanced technology in the field of agriculture.  This is the main difference between them.
Traditional farming makes use of the traditional and age old agriculture equipment.  On the other hand, modern farming makes use of the modern equipment.  Technology-intensive farming methods are used in modern farming.
Traditional farming tolerated the unpredictable environment better than modern farming that relies heavily on modern procedures and equipment.  Traditional farming is characterized by low-input husbandry, whereas modern farming is characterized by high-input husbandry.
Traditional farming may yield less, but there is sufficient quality attached to its yield.  On the other hand, modern farming may fall short of quality as far as its yield is concerned thanks to the overuse of the modern and technological equipment in its processes and procedures.  Thus, it is an accepted fact that traditional farming is laden with quality.
Another important difference between traditional farming and modern farming is that traditional farming needs great amount of labor and hence, the job opportunities provided to laborers are more.  On the other hand, modern farming does not need great amount of labor since the machines take care of everything.  Hence, the job opportunities provided to laborers are comparatively poor and less.
Pesticides, plant breeding, agronomy, antibiotics related to animal husbandry, hormones are some of the methods used in modern farming.  Most of these methods are not employed in traditional farming.  On the other hand, traditional farming relies more on the traditional and home made preparations to ward of pests and insects.  These are the important differences between traditional farming and modern farming.

Traditional Management Model vs. Modern Management Model
The world economy increasing becomes globalization, which lead to broad mixture of local, national and global markets and organizations, due to different ethic, values and cultures, even both parties speak same language, there still could lead misunderstanding, therefore today’s managers face more challenges, such as understanding the changing trends in the market, how to maintain beneficial interpersonal relationship with employees and clients, concerning  about business ethics and corporate social responsibility surround managerial actions. And the turbulent global environment push managers spend more time crossing borders to conduct business, it is necessary to understand how to communicate effectively with people in different cultures to fulfill the organization’s missions and create values for the stakeholders.
Traditional top-bottom management model was successful in the 20th century, however managerial hierarchies and traditional approaches may impose heavy costs on the business that would become administrative burden in future. Moreover, business and environmental changes occurred at a slow pace in the past which was easy for managers to deal with, however today’s market changes at a fast rate,  the development of technologies also aggravate market competition, the traditional hierarchical management need a long time to response the market changes, which could not give managers enough freedom to plan and organize their works. Therefore, in order to adapt to ever changing business environment, it is critical to improve the structures of the company and global management approaches, come up with strategies which enable business cope with the changes in the external and internal environments.
Comparing Traditional Management Model and Modern Management Model
The purpose of this section is through comparing the differences between traditional organization and modern organization to identify the problems in traditional management model, discuss why traditional management model cannot meet the needs of global business management.
Traditional Organization Management
The structure of traditional organization like the military system, which is hierarchical, organized and discipled. The power flows vertically and upward, the employees are departmentalized and follow a chain of command. Each department has its own rules and regulations, the superior of the department who is responsible to report to the managers. Every employee strictly follows the business strategies, has own job description and accountability to the superior, therefore traditional organization structure is likely fixed and rigid in general.
For the traditional management model, it could be the advantage that structure of the organization is simple to design and operation, it is easy for the employees understand their authority and responsibility. Moreover, due to the chain of command from top level to subordinate level, the employees have fixed responsibility who are responsible to their direct superior, it could reduce the probability of conflict and maintain discipline in a line organization. However, due to the hierarchy management model was developed in industrial age, the system of decision makers, executives, managers and employees worked well when the companies operated in relative isolation from the rest of world and manufactured physical products. By contrast, today increasing number companies become globalized, they not only produce physical products but also sell ideas, which would encounter disadvantages when using traditional management model.
Because the traditional organization has many layers of management, all the people need time to weigh up and coordinate the issues, it would be taken long time to make decision, therefore many managers may feel their opinions is being ignored. Moreover, in terms of interpersonal communication, the message easily get distortion when directives move through a traditional hierarchy organization. Because each supervisor or manger may interpret the words in different way, until the message reach employees, it may be different from the original intention. Furthermore, in terms of manager competence, in traditional management model, the authority is assigned to the position rather than the individual, which require constant check the effectiveness of individuals in various positions to see if they have actual ability to fulfill the job. In addition, the traditional management likely pay more attention to company’s goals and objectives, emphasis increasing sales or profits to please the shareholders, which may lead the company neglect social responsibility and business sustainable development.
Modern Organization Management
In order to suit for rapid innovation and growing technology industry, the modern organization management more focus on networking and collaborating, emphasized on dynamic nature of communication and importance of integration of individual and organizational interests, which largely depends on soft skill development such as consensus building, tacit knowledge,  experience, learning, intuition, self-confidence, flexibility, prioritization of problems, working under pressure and ambiguity tolerance.
Comparing Traditional and Modern Management models
The main difference between traditional organization and modern organization in several aspects.
Stability: Traditional organizations usually are stable in business activities and progress, while modern organizations are more dynamic with multiple business strategy, which need multiple process to deal with constant changes.
Flexibility: In traditional organization, its structure is usually fixed, the strategy is planned, and the management is inflexible. While the modern organization, they need always improve the workflow, update its competitive edges, and the employees are required to promote the skills and knowledge to connect with the market and changings.
Teamwork: The flow of traditional business is ‘tall hierarchy’, which focus on individual responsibility and obey to his superior, while modern one is ‘flat hierarchy’, which more focus on teamwork and cooperation, its collaborative working mode would more conducive to brainstorming and help the companies improve work efficiency and make marketing strategy.
Stimulate morale: Modern organization management enable employees give more freedom and flexibility to fulfill their works, which are beneficial to mobilize enthusiasm of the staffs.
Management policy: In traditional business, the management policies are conservative, which usually follow traditional rules and regulation, make static workflow model to maintain business strategy and employee management system. While modern management model would do modification such as rescheduling, flexible entity management, dynamic business strategy.
From above analysis, we can find the context of modern management emphasis on how individual contribute to the organization and corporate performance, the chief executives pay more attention on retaining control of organization, its performance of is decided by the financial returns and share price of the organization. Moreover, the modern organization reflects the principles related to total quality management, such as learning organization, high performance organization and balanced score cards, so it could be the challenge to traditional management model.
Through the comparing, it is clear traditional management model has its limitations and may not meet the needs of global economic development, in the perspective of modern management, due to the various social, legal, political, technical and economic factors, the effective coordination and cooperation depends on different organizational relationships. With globalization, in modern organization more and more managers are working with colleagues from around the world, the context of global management involves culture environment management, organizational environment management and situational contingencies, to build global management skills, which not only require the managerial competence such as planning, organizing, coordinating, controlling, but also need develop multicultural competence to understand and work effectively across culture, therefore it is necessary to understand the context of global management and improve cross-border effectiveness to accomplish global corporate objectives.

Difference between traditional organisation and modern organisation

13 minute read
It is easily recognizable that there are lots of differences between the traditional organization and the new modern organizations And somehow the modern organizations are more practical and flexible than traditional organizations in case of their productivity and case of their skills of employees.
What is a traditional organization
Normally, traditional organizations are the organizations that are established in the 20th century. These traditional organizations follow a business structure design that is hierarchical. That means the power of the organization goes vertical and upward. All of the employees of this type of organization follow a chain of command, where a higher position gets more value in the organization. and each of the departments has its own departmental head, and all of the employees of that particular department reports to the departmental head. And the departmental head reports to the Manager. In this way, the hierarchical organization structure is followed in these types of traditional organizations.
What is a modern organization
Modern organizations are those organizations, which have emerged in this ongoing century. Type of organization believes in-network relationships and collaboration so that they can produce great results for their organization. This type of modern organization rapidly improves their technology and working pattern, so that they can keep their organization up-to-date with the modern evolving world.

Difference between traditional and modern organization
When we talk about the traditional under today's organization, there is a lot of difference between this organization's & the Primitive organizations, which used to exist before the Industrial Revolution, which was very different from today's organization. Let's just go through certain differences.
1. Flexibility
Where traditional organizations were stable. Whereas today's organizations are Dynamic. Why do we say dynamic because of the changes in technology and several different changes coming because of globalization in the organization? This keeps on changing according to the changing scenario, whereas the derivative organizations, were very stable and they had some particular methodology of working as they were rigid they were not ready to adapt to the changes. That is the reason we think that traditional organizations were inflexible. Whereas today's organizations are flexible.
2. Point of Focus
Traditional organizations are job-focused whereas today's organizations are skill-focused. Why do we say skill focus because when an organization today, gives certain work to the employees, they give the work based on the competency of the employee? That means they look into the skill sets of the employee and then that particular work is given part of the perimeter of organizations. They just looked into whatever work needs to be done irrespective of the competency of an individual that particular work was given and were told to the individual that you need to accomplish this particular work. So of course as skill-focused organizations are better because if one individual has that particular skill, for example, If an individual possesses marketing skills, he definitely should be given work related to marketing and not related to HR or any technical operations.
3. Task Operation Style
In traditional organizations, work was defined by job positions. Whereas a new organization work is defined in terms of tasks to be done, which I have already explained traditional organizations were individual-oriented. Well as new organizations are team-oriented people work in teams. These teams can be virtual. These teams can be cross-functional teams depending upon the requirement of the organization teams are made and people work in the team's traditional. Visions are welcomed, new organizations are involvement-oriented where we talk about the involvement. That means in today's organization even employees are asked to give suggestions while the decision is made whereas in primitive organizations most of the decisions are made by the senior employee. It was just that directions were given to the individuals or the employees and they were not asked for their suggestions because his employees were not happy in those organizations and that belongingness factor was missing.
4. Employment Type
Generally in the case of traditional organization people receives a permanent job.  That's means in traditional organizations the firing rate is very low, just like a government organization.  But in the case of modern organizations jobs are becoming temporary.  The organization provides vacancies for a single project.  After the project ends there is no connection between the employee and the company.  Again he has to apply for the next project for that organization and then only he can continue that job.  As in modern age, the population is increasing day by day and that's why there are lots of qualified people around the city.   And the amount of vacancies is very less than the number of applicants. that's why an employee can be found very easily for any organization.
5. Workdays and working Time
In the case of the traditional organization, there was a limited workload for every employee. and also the working days for a week is also predefined. That's why there was a similar rule to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on every working day.  And he was fully allowed to take a rest at the weekend.  But where in the new organization there is no fixed working time.  as in modern days, technology is also increasing day by day.  and every organization is also adapting to the new technology.  In the case of old age, an employee can not work online or there was no concept of work from home.  but in modern age employee can work from his home.  that's why in the case of some new organization there is no fixed working time.  An employee just has to finish his work within his deadline.  in the case of some new organization, they also pressurize their employee with some extra workloads that they have to complete beyond the office work hour.
6. Decision-Making criteria
Traditional organization managers always made decisions, whereas in a modern organization's employee participates in decision-making new organization focused on customer orientation. They look into what is the requirement of the customer. What are the preferences of the customer and according to that decisions are made by traditional organizations? They had a relatively homogeneous Workforce. Whereas today's organizations. They have Workforce diversity because there are a lot of people who are coming from different backgrounds different countries, and they work together.
7. Relationship
International organizations, they were hierarchical relationships wherein today's organizations, they are more focused towards literal and network relationships and hierarchical relationship. You will find that there was a tall hierarchy is a lot of levels were there because of the decision making the slope and the empowerment of the employees but not that much but when we talk about today's organizations, then they are usually horizontal or lateral and networked. We're in Employee is empowered to take decisions at their level.
Conclusion
While comparing traditional organization vs modern organization, I have found that the structure of the traditional organization is simpler than any modern organization. It is very easy to understand their duties and responsibility for any employer of a traditional organization. Normally they have fixed responsibilities, that's why it becomes easier to work in a traditional organization.
Note: You can also read about some good preparation habits to become more productive
Where in the case of modern organizations they have complex policies, which become challenging to understand for any new employee. But they are more focused on networking and collaborating that's why rapid Innovation and continuous growth in skill development can be found in modern organizations. That's why the employees working in a modern organization become more flexible, self-confident, and quick problem solvers.
comparison and contrast between the traditional organization and the modern organization
So in conclusion, I must say that there is a lot of differences between the traditional organization and modern organization. Both of the organizations have some positive points and some down points. And according to me it totally depends upon the employee that in which organization he wants to take part or work. if a person relies on job security then definitely he should go for the traditional organization but if a person prefers to adopt the latest technology and to stay updated and to be more productive then the modern organization is the right choice for him.
Frequently Asked Questions / FAQ
Similarities of traditional and modern organizational design
The similarities anyone can find between the traditional and modern
        organization structure design, that both of the organizations are
        concerned about the division of workload. Every employee of that
        organization is assigned a particular role and they have to fulfill some
        particular tasks that have been assigned for them. A hierarchy of
        authority can also be found in both organizations. That's why top-level
        Management is the most valuable path for both organizations. Teamwork or
        coordinated effort are also be used in both organizations to increase
        their productivity. These are the similarities you can find in both of
        the organizations.
Difference between traditional and new organizational design
Here the difference between the design of the two organizations means
        the difference between the structure of the two organizations. That's
        why the answer to this question will be the same that is mentioned in
        the respective article.
Types of traditional organization
There are three types of traditional organization. Such as the line
        Organisation, functional organization, line and staff organization.
Example of a modern organization
General Electric is a good example of a modern organization. It is an
        American multinational company, its headquarters is situated in New
        York. you can find more details in Google about General Electric company
        or from its official website ge.com
We hope after reading this post your doubt about the comparison and contrast between the traditional organization and the modern organization is clear. So if you like this post do share it with your friends and family and follow Scikn on our social media like Facebook and Linkedin.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can gather from them.

First, there's a discussion from CiteHR about traditional versus modern management styles. It mentions that traditional management is more hierarchical and authoritarian, similar to military management, where the boss makes decisions and expects obedience without question. Modern management, on the other hand, focuses more on soft skills like consensus building, relationships, and understanding the team's needs. It seems like modern management is more about empowering the team and fostering a collaborative environment.

Next, there's an essay from UK Essays about management practices, both traditional and modern innovative. It talks about how traditional management accounting focuses on cost control, variance analysis, budgeting, and investment appraisal. Modern approaches include things like business process re-engineering, zero-based budgeting, activity-based management, life cycle costing, total quality management, beyond budgeting, and balanced scorecards. It seems like modern management is more holistic, considering not just financial aspects but also non-financial performance indicators.

The essay also mentions that non-financial performance measurements have gained importance due to increasing technology and global competition. Methods like Economic Value Added (EVA) are used to assess performance beyond just financial metrics. It's interesting that management accountants now have a role in educating managers about these complex concepts, which suggests a shift towards more comprehensive training and understanding within organizations.

Another document is about traditional versus modern farming, but that might not be directly relevant to my question about managers. Maybe I can skim it quickly to see if there are any parallels. It talks about traditional farming using age-old equipment and methods, while modern farming uses advanced technology. Traditional farming is characterized by low-input husbandry and yields less but with higher quality, whereas modern farming may yield more but with potential compromises in quality. There's also a mention of job opportunities, with traditional farming requiring more labor, thus providing more employment, whereas modern farming, being more mechanized, provides fewer job opportunities. Perhaps there's a similar dynamic in management, where traditional management might involve more hierarchical layers and thus more management positions, while modern management flattens the hierarchy, reducing the number of management roles.

Lastly, there's a comparison between traditional and modern organizational structures from MBA Knol and SciKn. These seem quite relevant. According to these sources, traditional organizations have a hierarchical structure, similar to a military setup, with power flowing vertically from top to bottom. Employees are departmentalized, and there's a clear chain of command. Each department has its own rules and regulations, and employees have fixed job descriptions and responsibilities.

Modern organizations, in contrast, emphasize networking and collaboration. They are more dynamic and focus on teamwork and cooperation. The structure is flatter, with fewer layers of management, which allows for quicker decision-making and more flexibility. Modern organizations also prioritize employee skills and competencies over job positions, and they are more adaptable to change.

From these sources, I can start identifying key differences between managers in the past and those today:

1. **Structure and Hierarchy:**
   - Past: Hierarchical, top-down approach.
   - Present: Flatter structures, more collaborative.

2. **Decision Making:**
   - Past: Decisions made by top management with little input from lower levels.
   - Present: More inclusive, with input from team members and a focus on empowerment.

3. **Focus:**
   - Past: Primarily financial metrics and cost control.
   - Present: Balanced focus on financial and non-financial performance indicators, such as customer satisfaction, employee well-being, and sustainability.

4. **Technology:**
   - Past: Relied on manual methods and basic tools.
   - Present: Leverage advanced technology for communication, data analysis, and decision support.

5. **Workforce Management:**
   - Past: Homogeneous workforce, with most employees working onsite.
   - Present: Diverse workforce, including remote workers and flexible schedules.

6. **Leadership Style:**
   - Past: Authoritarian and directive.
   - Present: More participative, focusing on coaching and development.

7. **Adaptability:**
   - Past: Operated in a more stable environment, with slower changes.
   - Present: Need to adapt quickly to rapid changes in technology and market conditions.

8. **Employee Engagement:**
   - Past: Emphasis on obedience and compliance.
   - Present: Focus on engagement, motivation, and retention.

9. **Skill Sets:**
   - Past: Technical skills and efficiency were paramount.
   - Present: Soft skills, emotional intelligence, and strategic thinking are highly valued.

10. **Performance Measurement:**
    - Past: Primarily financial metrics like profit and loss.
    - Present: Use of balanced scorecards, KPIs, and other non-financial indicators.

These points give me a solid foundation, but I feel like I can delve deeper into some of these areas. For instance, how has the shift towards扁平化组织结构影响了管理者的角色和责任？现代管理者是否需要具备不同的技能来有效地领导跨职能团队？此外，全球化和远程工作的增加如何改变了管理实践？

也许我应该查找一些关于现代管理者所需技能的研究或文章。了解管理者在过去和现在所需的技能差异可能会提供更多的见解。

让我尝试进行另一次搜索，以获取更多关于现代管理者技能和职责的信息。

Here is a quick response, and I could provide more details when I have a little more time and not in such a morning rush to get to work.
Traditional style of management is more comparable to the military style of management - very hierarchical, organized, disciplined, and sort of - "I am the boss, I tell you, you do. No questions asked". Strictly follows the direct chain of command. The ability of management is derived from the power of the position (not much of a management, if you ask me). Not much, if any, of soft skills required either. In today's world of management, it is used in the military (of every country out there) and countries like India, China, Japan and some European companies. However, it only works (I mean really works) in the military. Most of the western world (outside the military) has moved away from it due to the long-term downsides to the business in the areas of workforce morale etc.
Modern style of management largely depends on soft skills - consensus building, relationships, listening, and understanding, taking the team along with you willingly than dragging them along with you. The "manager" in this case may or may not have any actual power to adversely affect his/her followers, if they do not follow. The power of a manager is derived from the people who the manager manages (the managed) - and the managed give that power willingly to the manager. It is more comparable in modern day to a matrix organization and pure project management at its best. In my opinion, this is the best form of management in the long run, because it builds moral, participation, and sense of ownership among the managed.

Critically asses and evaluate what functions Managers Perform in a Modern organisation and what skills they require?
There are many different views on what functions managers should or are expected to perform within a modern organisation and what skills they require. Rosemary Stewart (1967) expressed this idea,  'A manager is someone who gets things done with the aid of people and other resources '. Being a manager is not only a distinct occupation but is also a desired universal human activity. Individuals learn through experience, skills and expectations that we have a certain  'duty ' to manage our lives, for example, a mother should manage her child into a good upbringing. There are certain required functions that a manager must …show more content…
There is great competition for jobs in the modern world as new applicants from all over the globe can offer new and exciting differences to a business, it is these individual and unique skills that separate a good manager form the rest. Companies look for a mix of skills and experience depending on the business itself, including personal qualities, habits and social graces. These certain skills include personal qualities, such as a positive attitude, which can be reflected onto other employees as a manager is usually seen as a role model. As well as this they also require good communication skills not only to talk to an individual but to also listen and become aware of current issues.  'Active listening helps managers gather relevant information '[iii]. However, it must be taken into account that due to recent globalisation and individuals from different cultures and backgrounds taking on such management jobs that this may create problems. Across the globe, different managers learn different techniques and work within different conditions. This may be a problem as management as a whole may be done differently, a manger from Saudi Arabia may be influenced by culture and not employing an unmarried woman, for example. Another personal skill an experienced manager requires is the ability to handle

The desperate call-to-arms, "Change or Die"— which can be heard echoing down the corridors of businesses everywhere — is evidence that leaders have recognised the need to change.

Most also know that current mind-sets, techniques, and tools are ineffective for creating such an organisation. These people are displaying the talents required to successfully negotiate

Managers are people who combine different types of resources and coordinate them efficiently and effectively to achieve goals set by their organisations. The term “efficient” in the aspect of management means the managers employ the resources wisely and cost-effectively, whereas the term “effective” means the managers make the right decision and strive hard to achieve the objectives by performing planning, organising, leading and controlling functions. These four functions are extremely important

Modern leadership
Following are the roles of Modern leaders -
Empathy: The leader should be empathetic.

Likeable: a leader should be likeable. People follow the leaders who are likeable eg Steve Jobs, Elon Musk
Influencer: A leader has to play a key role in influencing others.
Team player leader wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships.
Traditional leader
According to my following are the roles of a traditional leader:
Time-Bound Goals:
Traditional leaders set a time-bound goal for a group. This goal will help remain the team on track to achieve whatever they are all set to achieve in a particular period.
Team Together :
A traditional leader keeps the team together. By exercising those powers, he is supposed to keep the top intact to achieve the goal. Any conflicts that arise in the group are to be controlled by the leader of the group.
Solicit Support:
A leader’s job is to get the team working to achieve the goals set to achieve a bigger vision. The leader is the first person to be held accountable for any missed deadlines.
Act as a philosopher & Freeform:
The subordinates need guidance regarding their professional and personal life. They need to be guided through the difficult decisions that they have to make to advance their careers and families. A leader plays a huge role in brainstorming through all these situations.

A Traditional Manager's Guide for Modern Leadership Styles
A Traditional Manager’s Guide for Modern Leadership Styles
Modern leadership is an intimidating terrain to explore without the right tools. Good thing, learning about modern leadership styles will help you navigate that terrain.
Gone are the days of traditional leadership in which bosses give instructions and expect their subordinates to follow blindly. Authoritarian administration like that is looked down on nowadays. Modern leaders don’t only tell people what to do, but they now also listen, collaborate, and encourage growth among their team members.
From visionary to authentic authority, there’s a wide range of modern leadership styles to choose from. How do you know what style best suits you as a leader? What kind of management would best compliment your industry? Is there just one type you can use? If so, which one?
You can actually use a combination of types because your leadership depends on what your people need. As a modern leader you should be dynamic and adaptable. Similar to how your team needs to grow, your management skills need to grow, too.
Choose the kind that best suits your company’s growth, no matter what your industry is. Explore the new terrain of modern leadership by checking out our list below to help your team become the best they can be.
Visionary leadership
In a visionary leadership, leaders inspire and empower people to achieve difficult but rewarding goals. These experts motivate other people in their field by articulating their vision so clearly that employees can figure out how to achieve the said goals on their own. This type of leader empowers people to strive towards a unified goal, leading the charge towards success for all.
It can be difficult to be successful with this management style. To achieve this esteem as a leader, you must take the time to truly listen to your team members. Smart visionaries know how to listen. They give genuine attention to people and can gain their trust. They know how to use that trust wisely to inspire and empower towards a goal.
The visionary approach is helpful when  you need to make a big organisational change and get everyone on the same page. It’s great for professional teams who already know what to do with little to no supervision. It may not suit leaders and teams with little experience in their field.

Laissez-faire
Laissez-faire is a French term that translates to “let them do.” In this style, the leader gives all authority to their employees. In a smoothly-run laissez-faire, the boss only appears at the beginning of the process (to provide guidelines and information) and at the end (to critique and provide advice).
This type of leader encourages self-direction to promote creativity and innovation among their employees.
This type of authority is common among start-ups in which the founder puts full faith in his employees while he oversees the rest of the company. It is also common, and even beneficial, in teams composed of skilled professionals needing freedom and creativity.
On the other hand, this would not be a good style for companies that can’t self-manage. If a team isn’t equipped to solve problems on their own, a laissez-faire leadership would result in poor output and member development.
Transactional leadership
This leadership style focuses on rewarding workers with incentives to improve their performance. As a transactional boss, you give your team certain benefits for accomplishing a certain amount of work. If they do more than what’s expected of them, you reward them with bonuses. This establishes clear responsibilities for employees; so they know exactly what their effort is worth.
As clear-cut as this management style is, it’s also mostly effective for short-term work.  You’re motivating your workers to do their jobs in exchange for payment. Studies show that for long-term work, these extrinsic rewards aren’t as effective as intrinsic rewards. This type isn’t helpful in developing better and more creative workers in the long run.
Pacesetting
In this type of management, bosses set a challenging work pace for their employees for a difficult but rewarding goal. You’re in front of the pack; as the leader, you create a need for better performance amongst your team to motivate them to work hard. You set a tough pace for your team; so they’re encouraged to aim towards a greater goal.
People in certain fields, like sales, flourish when they’re recognised for their specific achievements. A good manager can balance the drive for high performance while creating healthy competition.
Though a research by the Harvard Business Review shows that the pacesetting leaders should avoid implementing stretch goals, they also found that complacent teams benefit from their use. If you have a good but complacent team, you can try pacesetting as a style to motivate them out of their complacency.
You shouldn’t maintain this for too long, though. Maintaining stretch goals for a long period may cause burnout and will set your employees up for failure, if they aren’t able to match your pace. This may lead to a loss of motivation and a decrease in morale in your company in the long run.
Transformational leadership
As the name implies, this kind of leadership involves constant transformation based on the people’s goals. Your company has its basic tasks, but as its leader, you’re constantly challenging them to get out of their comfort zones and achieve more challenging goals.
This management style of leadership is best practised by companies focused on growth. As the leader, you’re constantly transforming your employees’ goal so they’re motivated to improve. Communication is key, though, so you don’t lose sight of your members’ individual growth and lower their morale, overall.
Democratic leadership
This type of administration encourages you, the leader, to make decisions based on the insights of each person. As the leader, you collaborate with your employees and oversee a consensus decision on a project or goal.
The obvious pro to this is that you’re getting the most information and feedback possible from the most dependable sources: your employees. You’re also letting your team feel valued in their opinions. In valuing their opinions you’re training them to think for themselves and be more responsible with their input.
This, however, only works if you have the time to hear everyone’s opinions. If your company environment doesn’t allow for long discussions on projects, then this may not be the best for you. The democratic approach best works in companies where people have the time to collaborate and brainstorm on their choices.
Modern leadership styles guide
Coaching
Think of this in a way a coach manages his sports team. The coach nurtures the strengths of each individual member while devising strategies to help the team work better together. To be effective in coaching, leaders  need to communicate with their members to improve on their skills and build better rapport.
This type of management works best in companies where the employees have already demonstrated competency in their positions. Much like in sports, a coach would be working on an already adept team. This kind of direction wouldn’t be conducive to new hires.
This management style requires time and strong interpersonal skills. You need to take your time to build mentoring relationships with each individual so that they open up to you about their strengths and weaknesses. This will result in a group that communicates well and embraces one another’s unique skills to get the job done.
Affiliative leadership
The affiliative leader is all about peace and harmony. In this kind of management, you create trust by solving personality conflicts among members. You affiliate yourself with your team by being patient and kind, to form a harmonious environment for everyone.
This management style is usually applied to newly formed teams. It allows everyone the time to figure out their personality issues in the early stages of company development. This is also applicable to teams that need healing from stressful, high-risk environments. It helps employees solve their issues; so they can get back on track as a team.
Don’t apply this for too long, though. Too much peace and harmony can lead to complacency, if you’re not careful. Once you’ve created a healthy work environment, make sure to motivate your team to strive towards greater goals, again.
Authentic leadership
This is the simplest but most genuine of all the styles. Authentic leadership focuses on development-oriented and altruistic solutions to solve modern issues. Bosses build credibility by building authentic bonds with their employees.
Authentic leaders are motivated by the growth and prosperity of their subordinates and their company, and they develop a work environment that focuses on mutual trust and transparency.
This is a simple concept in theory but a difficult type to execute. It requires the genuine integrity of the leader for it to be successful. It’s not just a type of management, but it’s also a kind of personality in a boss that needs to be nurtured in every member of the company for it to succeed.
In summary
After reading the nine management styles of leadership, you may resonate with one or many of them. Choose what’s best for your company, whether it’s one or a combination of management types. There are countless ways to develop your leadership skills, but at the end of the day, it’s all about listening, collaboration, and growth, both for you and your employees.
Don’t just stick to the style you’re comfortable using. Step out of your comfort zone and try new techniques. Understand that you need to take into account your company’s culture, your people, your situation, and your capabilities as a leader.
As the times change, so should your management style. Don’t be afraid to step into the scary and new terrain of modern leadership styles. You have the right tools, now go and lead!

Okay, from these search results, I can see that the concept of management has indeed evolved significantly over time. Let's try to synthesize this information to answer the question: "How are managers today different from managers in the past?"

First, it's essential to understand that "managers in the past" likely refers to those in the early to mid-20th century, when management was more hierarchical and rigid. "Managers today" operate in a vastly different business environment, characterized by globalization, rapid technological change, and a more diverse and mobile workforce.

One of the primary differences is in the organizational structure. Traditional managers operated within a hierarchical, top-down structure, similar to a military command system. This is often referred to as a "tall" hierarchy, with many levels of management between top executives and frontline workers. In contrast, modern managers work in flatter organizations with fewer layers of management. This shift allows for quicker decision-making and more direct communication between different levels of the organization.

Another significant difference lies in leadership style. Traditional managers were often authoritarian, making decisions unilaterally and expecting obedience from subordinates. Modern managers, on the other hand, tend to adopt a more collaborative and participative approach. They involve team members in decision-making processes, foster open communication, and focus on developing their employees' skills and abilities. This shift reflects a recognition that engaged and empowered employees are more productive and innovative.

In terms of skills and competencies, traditional managers were often valued for their technical expertise and ability to control costs and processes. While these skills are still important, modern managers must also possess strong soft skills, such as emotional intelligence, adaptability, and the ability to manage diverse teams. The increasing importance of technology in business means that managers today need to be tech-savvy and able to leverage data and analytics to inform their decisions.

Moreover, the role of the manager has expanded to include a greater emphasis on strategic thinking and long-term planning. In the past, managers may have focused primarily on day-to-day operations and short-term goals. Today's managers are expected to align their teams' activities with the organization's overall strategy and to anticipate and adapt to future trends and challenges.

Another area where modern managers differ from their predecessors is in their approach to performance measurement and management. Traditional managers relied heavily on financial metrics, such as profit and loss statements, to evaluate performance. While financial metrics remain crucial, modern managers also consider non-financial indicators, such as customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and sustainability practices. This broader perspective acknowledges that long-term success depends on more than just financial performance.

Furthermore, the rise of globalization and remote work has changed the way managers operate. Today's managers must be adept at managing diverse, geographically dispersed teams and navigating cultural differences. They need to be skilled in virtual communication and collaboration tools and be able to foster a sense of unity and purpose among team members who may never meet in person.

In summary, managers today differ from those in the past in several key ways:

1. **Organizational Structure:** Flatter hierarchies vs. tall hierarchies.

2. **Leadership Style:** Collaborative and participative vs. authoritarian and directive.

3. **Skills and Competencies:** Emphasis on soft skills and adaptability vs. technical expertise and cost control.

4. **Role and Responsibilities:** Strategic thinking and long-term planning vs. focus on day-to-day operations.

5. **Performance Measurement:** Balanced use of financial and non-financial metrics vs. reliance on financial metrics alone.

6. **Workforce Management:** Diverse and remote teams vs. homogeneous and onsite teams.

These differences reflect the evolving nature of business and the need for managers to adapt to new challenges and opportunities.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Managers today differ from those in the past in terms of organizational structure, leadership style, skills and competencies, role and responsibilities, performance measurement, and workforce management.}} \]
