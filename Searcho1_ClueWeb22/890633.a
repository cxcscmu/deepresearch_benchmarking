Alright, I've got this question: "Does working from home work? Evidence from a Chinese experiment." It sounds like I need to look into some research or study conducted in China about the effectiveness of working from home. I'm not really sure where to start, so I think I'll begin by searching for studies or articles that discuss working from home in China.

First, I need to understand what aspects they might be looking at in this experiment. Probably things like productivity, employee satisfaction, cost savings for the company, maybe even impacts on the environment. So, perhaps I should look for keywords like "working from home," "telecommuting," "China," and "study" or "experiment."

Let me try formulating a search query for this. Maybe something like: "Chinese study on working from home effectiveness." That seems straightforward. Hopefully, that will lead me to some academic papers or reports on the topic.

About 10% of US employees now regularly work from home (WFH), but there are concerns this can lead to “shirking from home.” We report the results of a WFH experiment at CTrip, a 16,000- employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned to work from home or in the office for 9 months. Home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which about 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick-days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the success of the experiment, CTrip rolled-out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental employees to re-select between the home or office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH.

Evidence from a Chinese Experiment on Working from Home
Home workers increased the minutes they worked on each shift by 9.2 percent.
CTrip is China's largest travel agency, with 16,000 employees and a market capitalization of about $US 5 billion. Beginning in December 2010, it conducted a randomized experiment that measured the productivity of employees working at home versus those working in one of its call centers.
In Does Working From Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment (NBER Working Paper No. 18871 ), co-authors Nicholas Bloom, James Liang (who co-founded CTrip and helped to make its productivity data available), John Roberts, and Zhichun Jenny Yang present the results of that experiment. They find that the home worker group increased its productivity by 13 percent over the trial's nine month lifetime, with no measurable difference in the quality of calls.
Thanks to reduced breaks and sick days, home workers increased the minutes they worked on each shift by 9.2 percent. In a workforce with an average commute of 80 minutes per day, the employees attributed their reduction in sick days to the fact that on some days they felt well enough to work at home but not well enough to commute.
Their calls handled per minute also increased by 3.3 percent. When asked, the home workers attributed that improved performance to the quieter home environment. Work satisfaction also was higher for home workers, and attrition was half that of the control group working in the call centers. Interview results suggested that the home workers were less likely to quit because no other comparable home-working jobs existed.
CTrip estimates that the improvement in performance was worth about $375 per employee per year, that working from home reduced its office costs by $1,250 per employee per year, and that reducing attrition saved about $400 per employee per year in training costs and lost productivity. The only negative result from the experiment was that rates of promotion for home workers were almost 50 percent lower, possibly because they were not visible to office-based managers.
Of the 994 employees in the airfare and hotel booking departments at CTrip's Shanghai call center, 503 volunteered for the experiment. Of the volunteers, 249 met all conditions, such as working for the firm for at least six months, being willing to work from home for nine months, having home access to broadband internet, and access to an independent workspace at home during their shift. They were invited to apply for the experiment. Applicants with even-numbered birth dates worked from home as part of the 131-member treatment group. Applicants with odd-numbered birth dates continued working at a company call center as part of the 118-member control group. The home workers worked from home four days per week, returning to the call center for one shift on one day.
At the end of the experiment, CTrip expanded the work from home option to the entire firm. Two-thirds of the control group opted to remain in the office. Half of the home workers elected to return to the office, citing "concerns over the loneliness of home working and the lower rates of promotion." As a result of the self-selected exodus of people, a large fraction of whom had performed relatively badly at home, the performance gains by home workers nearly doubled after the experiment ended.

Abstract
A rising share of employees now regularly engage in working from home (WFH), but there are concerns this can lead to “shirking
from home.” We report the results of a WFH experiment at Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call
center employees who volunteered to WFH were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for nine months.
Home working led to a 13% performance increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer breaks and sick
days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more convenient working environment). Home workers also
reported improved work satisfaction, and their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance
fell. Due to the success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the experimental
employees to reselect between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them switched, which led to the gains from
WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of learning and selection effects when adopting modern management
practices like WFH. JEL Codes: D24, L23, L84, M11, M54, O31.

... La diffusione di modalità innovative nell'organizzazione e gestione delle risorse umane -e specificamente la propensione delle imprese ad adottare forme di lavoro agile (o smart working) -è un tema ampiamente dibattuto già da prima dell'insorgere dell'emergenza sanitaria da Covid-19 (Blinder e Krueger 2013; Bloom et al. 2015). La letteratura economica ha tradizionalmente identificato nella flessibilità funzionale e operativa la caratteristica principale che rende lo smart working un'opzione conveniente per le imprese.  ...
... Per tutte queste ragioni il lavoro da casa potrebbe essere meno produttivo e, quindi, meno remunerato. D'altra parte, esistono diversi studi che mettendo in luce una relazione positiva tra lavoro da casa e produttività e salari (Bloom et al. 2015; Beckmann 2016;Godart et al. 2017;Clancy 2020). White (2019) mostra che i lavoratori statunitensi che svolgono la loro attività da remoto sono passati dal sopportare una penalità salariale del 26% nel 1980 a un premio del 5% nel 2014.  ...
... In merito al divario retributivo di genere, non c'è una chiara evidenza sull'effetto del lavoro da casa. Gariety e Shaer (2007), SINAPPSI | Connessioni tra ricerca e politiche pubbliche | Anno XI n. 3/2021 | Rivista quadrimestrale dell'INAPP Bloom et al. (2015), Arntz et al. (2019), Angelici e Profeta (2020) sottolineano che il lavoro da remoto può ridurre (o almeno non aumentare) le differenze salariali tra uomini e donne. Weeden (2005), Goldin (2015) e Bertrand (2018) mostrano, tuttavia, risultati nella direzione opposta.  ...

... Work productivity at home was measured by self-assessment on a modified scale (including, e.g. 'Working in a home office makes it easier for me to do my job') (Bloom et al. 2015). The CRA of 0.890 is considered to be sufficiently high.  ...
... The openness to technology construct consists of 18 items and provides good reliability with a CRA of 0.972. We also controlled for age and gender, according to Bloom et al. (2015). Based on other studies on WFH, we further controlled for a dedicated room for WFH ('own workroom'; dummy variable).  ...

... However, the paper makes several contribution to the literature. Compared to experiments (Bloom et al., 2015; Angelici and Profeta, 2020), we use a sample of individuals that is representative of the whole labour market and that we can follow over a long time period to document how WfH is related to changes in contractual hours, overtime hours, hourly wages, and monthly earnings. 4 We also investigate the role of compensating wage differentials using information on job satisfaction, and take into account other schemes used to compensate overtime such as time off.  ...
... 4 Bloom et al. (2015) study the effect of WfH on productivity, promotion and work satisfaction in a Chinese call-center firm. Angelici and Profeta (2020) analyse the effect of WfH on productivity, well-being and work-life balance in an Italian firm of the multi-utility sector.  ...
... To the extent that managers consider that women use WfH for private needs but men do so for business needs, such perceptions may increase gender wage gaps. In addition, workers working remotely have fewer face-toface interactions with their managers and face thus a higher risk of being overlooked for promotion (Bloom et al., 2015; Harrington and Emanuel, 2021).  ...

... The effectiveness of WFH for both the company and the employees is illustrated in previous research. The most vivid benefits for companies are the reduced real estate cost, improved employees performance, and reduced turnover (Bloom et al., 2015; Gajendran & Harrison, 2007). For many employees, WFH can increase job satisfaction and decrease work stress due to the flexibility offered in arranging the work (Gajendran & Harrison, 2007;Golden, 2006;Himawan, Helmi, et al., 2021).  ...
... In this sense, working alone at home provokes a sense of social isolation and disconnectedness (Donnelly & Proctor-Thomson, 2015), which experience could be exacerbated in the societies where social connectedness is strongly upheld. In a field experiment in China, Bloom et al. (2015) found that many WFH employees requested to return to work from office because they feel lonely at home. Furthermore, loneliness was cited as the number one reason why WFH became less attractive and led employees to feel less motivated at work (Bloom et al., 2015).  ...

... In the pandemic context, many studies have recently examined WFH, particularly from the perspective of identifying those jobs that can be performed remotely [3][4][5][6][7]. In [8], the authors explained that the working from home concept is also known as teleworking. The concept of teleworking is used in its current context to indicate working remotely, away from the office.  ...
... Academic interest in WFH is not necessarily restricted to the pandemic; this issue has been investigated numerous times in the past decade and even before [8, 26,27]. Teleworking and WFH were conceived as a substitute for office-based work [13], an alternative [28] or an option [12], or as a flexible work form [29]. During the pandemic, it was redefined as a "policy" or as a "forced" process [30].  ...
... Recent data from the General Authority for Statistics (GAS) in 2021 showed that the percentage of employees WFH in telecommunications, banking and education exceeded 70% IT, banking and insurance industries represented the highest percentage of WFH employees in many different countries [17]. Qualitatively, the literature revealed no strong evidence for the suitability of WFH for all jobs [3,4, 8, 34,35]. Moreover, WFH is most appropriate for employees who have a degree of autonomy and for jobs that have few face-to-face contacts and knowledge-based tasks [36].  ...

... Studies on remote work are usually limited to a single organization, industry or country (Bloom et al. 2015; Moss 2018). By drawing on large amounts of data to answer the above research question, we contribute a broad overview on how the overall digital resilience of employees develops beyond the borders of a single company or location.  ...
... In this paper, we focus on the sudden shift to remote work following the outbreak of the global pandemic covid-19. While this can be considered a short-term disruption, remote work exists since decades and gains increasing popularity in a digitized work era (Bloom et al. 2015). It is thus one aspect of the continuing digitalization process.  ...
... They chose remote, for instance, to save commute time and cost and spend more time at home with their families. As a consequences, these employees are more satisfied with their jobs, report lower stress levels and demonstrate a higher productivity (Bloom et al. 2015; Moss 2018). It is therefore no surprise, that these employees post about remote work in a positive tone online.  ...

... However, this is all at the cost of feeling isolated, which, in the long run, may reduce the benefits and the desirability of this practice. In addition, telecommuting is compatible with only a limited number of (mainly routine) jobs (Bloom et al., 2014).  ...
... The persistence of the pandemic has forced employees to work from home for a prolonged period. "On the one hand, the current massive levels of unplanned, fulltime use of smart working reveals that it is feasible both for routine and non-routine tasks and can be useful in emergency periods" (Bloom et al., 2014; Angelici & Profeta, 2020). On the other hand, while the use of smart working for a limited period can be beneficial both for employees and employers, in the long run, it causes workers to feel isolated, and negatively affect their productivity (reducing the relational capital) and work-life balance.  ...

... A few randomized-controlled trials provide evidence that WFH can be more productive than working in the office. For example, Bloom, Liang, Roberts and Ying (2015) randomly assigned employees at a large Chinese travel company to work from home. They find that the home-based teleworkers are more productive, have fewer unscheduled absences, and lower quit rates than their office counterparts.  ...
... 3 In areas where office space is more expensive, employers have an additional incentive to encourage WFH with monetary incentives. On the other hand, employers who place a higher value on teamwork may encourage on-site presence with higher wages or promotions, leading to lower wage trajectories for teleworkers even with no differences in individual worker productivity (Rhee, 2008; Bloom et al., 2015; Glass and Noonan, 2016).  ...

... Combined with other changes during the pandemic, such as reduced stigma around working from home, technological innovations, and investments in human and physical capital that support working from home, these better-than-expected employee experiences with telework may contribute to a four-fold increase in the share of full workdays that are remote, from 5% before the pandemic to 20% after the pandemic [12]. These effects are consistent with some earlier studies, including a controlled randomized experiment by a large Chinese company which found that worker productivity and satisfaction were higher among those who worked at home, and turnover went down [13]. There are also supportive results from teleworkers in the US federal government [14].  ...
... In addition, firms with greater telework flexibility had higher stock returns during the pandemic [15]. The Chinese company study did, however, identify a downside: employees who teleworked were less likely to receive promotions, suggesting that remote workers are more likely to be "out of sight, out of mind" [13]. It is important to examine different types of workers, as other studies have found negative productivity effects during the pandemic, including a study of 10,000 IT workers at a large Asian company which found that hours worked increased as a result of working from home during the pandemic, largely due to the increased time costs of communication and coordination, and average productivity declined, especially for employees with children [16].  ...

... The implications of telecommuting from home and remote employment on work-life balance are being examined in the literature, contending that telecommuting probably increases the versatility of working operations, which in turn enhances balance in work and life (Sullivan, 2012). However, it is stressed that the benefits of working from home are questionable since they solely rely on social and economic factors (Bloom et al., 2015). In fact, telecommuting can prompt a few drawbacks, which concerns both disabled administrative exposure because of a de-contextualization of working practices The capacity of telecommuters to explore the work-life interface is adversely affected by tainting among work & life.  ...
... The studies suggest that telecommuting can reduce work-related exhaustion by eliminating daily commuting (Bloom et al., 2015). Since it contextualizes work obligations in the day to day life setting, working from home can prompt an inadvertent convergence of work-related obligations and family exercises (Hilbrecht et al., 2008), which may escalate the remote workers' feeling of weariness (Kim et al., 2015;Mas-Machuca et al., 2016).  ...

On the one hand, scholars argue that working from home offers substantial benefits and resources on the employee level, such as advantages for commuters as well as for physically handicapped people or parents who need to take care of their children (Fitzpatrick and Fishman, 2008), increased self-management and improved relationships as well as work comfort, flexibility and an undisturbed environment (Crosbie and Moore, 2004). Furthermore, it was shown that organisations and employers also profit from their employees working from home due to increases in productivity resulting from less interruptions, fewer breaks, fewer sick days and working on the weekend (Bloom et al., 2015; Harris, 2003).  ...

Additional studies in the business and management literature (Bloom et al., 2015; Bonet and Salvador, 2017;Choudhury, 2017), which were conducted before the pandemic forced the widespread adoption of WFH to assess the importance of physical proximity and face-to-face interactions on innovation and other firm-level strategies, also reached mixed conclusions regarding the possibility of expanding WFH without incurring into additional costs. These negative results about WFH and productivity contrast with more positive findings offered by Barrero et al. (2021) and the more neutral evidence provided by Etheridge et al.

... Higher intensity of home-based work and infrequent physical contact, leading to weaker social ties, are likely to contribute to psychological problems such as isolation and depression (Mann and Holdsworth, 2003), which are negatively correlated with perceived productivity and job satisfaction (Golden, 2009 Researchers and policymakers are looking closely at the impact of remote work on labor factors such as work hours, individual and organizational performance, work-life balance, and occupational safety and health. Benefits to workers include greater control over their work, which can have a positive impact on the quality and quantity of work performed; increased job satisfaction, as it allows individual contributions to organizational performance and success to be placed in the context of daily life (Bloom et al., 2015); and increased meaningfulness of work, leading to positive feelings among workers about their work. In addition, working from home could improve work-life balance through greater work flexibility and job plasticity, which improves employees' ability to manage work-life interactions (Troup and Rose, 2012) and thus increases personal well-being due to greater freedom and choice in managing work obligations.  ...

Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment
Partners:
In an attempt to reduce employee turnover and increase productivity, companies are increasingly allowing employees to work from home. Researchers analyzed the impact of working from home on productivity and work-life balance by randomly assigning some employees of a call center in China to work from home. Working from home significantly increased employees’ productivity and job satisfaction, although they were less likely to be promoted than similar-performing peers working in the office.
Policy issue
The societies of developed countries have changed drastically in the past 50 years, leading to major changes in the workplace. In the US, women now make up almost 50 percent of the workforce, and 48 percent of all households are now led by two working parents. 1 More working adults are caring for elderly relatives and are enrolled in higher education courses. 2 To try to give more flexibility to workers, companies are increasingly allowing their employees to work from home. In addition to improving work-life balance, working from home may reduce companies' rent costs and employee turnover and also benefit communities by lowering commuter congestion and emissions. Despite its potential benefits, many companies have been slow to adopt the practice because they are unsure how it will impact the productivity of workers. Employees working from home may find it easier to focus in a quieter environment and may miss less work if they schedule personal activities, like doctor's appointments, in the time they save by not commuting. On the other hand, the lack of supervision may allow workers to multitask by watching TV or playing computer games, and thus reduce the quality of their work.
Context of the evaluation
Researchers partnered with CTrip International Corporation, which was one of the first firms in China to allow call center employees to work from home. Established in 1999, CTrip has 16,000 employees and is the largest travel agency in China. CTrip makes hotel, flight, and tour reservations for clients over the phone through call centers in Shanghai and Nan Tong. Call center representatives work in teams of 10 to 15 people taking orders, resolving problems with reservations, and contacting airlines and hotels. They work five eight-hour shifts per week and have no flexibility to choose when they work. They are paid a flat wage of about 1300 renminbi (US$212) per month plus a monthly bonus, averaging an additional 1300 renminbi (US$212), based on order volumes and call quality. Promotion to team-leader is also based on performance, so workers are given ample incentive to perform well.

Details of the intervention
Researchers designed a randomized evaluation of CTrip's work-at-home pilot program to test its effect on worker productivity, employee satisfaction, and promotions. From a group of 996 employees, 503 volunteered to participate, of which 249 were qualified by virtue of having worked at the firm for 6 months, having broadband internet, and having their own workspace in their homes. From this group, those with even-numbered birthdays (day of birth ending in 0, 2, 4, etc.) were randomly selected to work at home. Those with odd-numbered birthdays were required to continue working from the office and served as the comparison group.
Employees selected to participate in the program worked four days per week from home and one day in the office. They were still supervised by their team leader, who always worked in the office, and they maintained the same hours, wage levels, type of work, and computer and communication equipment.
Working from home changed participants' working conditions in three main ways. First, they saved about 80 minutes per day in commuting time, giving them time to take care of personal and family responsibilities. Second, they were unable to receive real-time support from their supervisors. Finally, they generally worked alone and in a quieter environment than comparison employees in the office.
Researchers took advantage of CTrip's comprehensive employee database to measure the impact of working at home on employee performance, promotions, and job satisfaction. Performance was measured by the number of calls answered and made, time spent on the phone, and calls answered per minute. Researchers and CTrip also conducted surveys and interviews to measure work exhaustion and attitudes.
Results and policy lessons
Impact on employee productivity and promotion: Employees working from home performed significantly better than comparison employees working in the office, but were less likely to be promoted than similar-performing peers working in the office. Employees working from home made 13 percent more calls per week and answered forty more calls per week relative to comparison employees. They attributed this difference to having a quieter environment at home. They also worked 9.2 percent more minutes per day than the comparison group because they did not have to commute, took shorter breaks, and took fewer sick days. Despite managers' fears, working from home had no impact on the quality of calls. However, working from home had a negative effect on promotion opportunities. Conditional on performance, employees working from home were less likely to be promoted than their office-based peers. This was likely due to reduced training opportunities and less face-to-face contact with team leaders.
Impact on employee satisfaction: Employees working from home reported having a more positive attitude and less exhaustion from work than the comparison group. They were 16 percentage points more likely to report being satisfied with work. Employees working from home were also less likely to quit their job than those in the comparison group. During the 9 month period of the study, 35 percent of the comparison group quit while 17 percent from the work-at-home group quit, representing an approximately 17 percentage point (50 percent) decrease.
Post-study: CTrip considered the program so successful that it offered the option to work from home to the entire airfare and hotel departments in August 2011. CTrip estimated that they saved about US$2,000 per employee per year working from home. After scaling up the program in 2011, about half of the original work-from-home group decided to return to work in the office and 35 percent of the comparison group chose to begin working from home. The work-from-home program further increased productivity after employees learned whether they were more productive working from home or in the office. After the program had been rolled out, those working from home were 22 percent more productive relative to their counterparts in the office.
Employee and company learning: This study highlights the importance of both employee and company learning in the adoption of a new management practice like working from home. Before the evaluation, both groups were unsure about its impact, and the nine-month evaluation and subsequent roll-out process were essential for their ability to evaluate its effectiveness. CTrip learned that, despite an overall business slowdown, working from home improved performance compared to working in the office. They also learned that allowing employees to choose whether they work at home or the office had the greatest effect on performance, that employees of all performance levels improved by working at home, and that working from home dramatically reduced attrition.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got this question: "Does working from home work? Evidence from a Chinese experiment." It seems like I need to look into a specific study or experiment conducted in China about the effectiveness of working from home. From the search results, it looks like there's a notable study by Nicholas Bloom, James Liang, John Roberts, and Zhichun Jenny Ying, which was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2015. The study is titled "Does Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment."

Looking at Doc 1 and Doc 2, both from Stanford Graduate School of Business and NBER, it appears that this study was conducted at a large Chinese travel agency called CTrip. The researchers performed a randomized experiment where call center employees who volunteered to work from home were randomly assigned to either work from home or in the office for nine months. The key findings were that home working led to a 13% performance increase, partly due to fewer breaks and sick days, and a quieter working environment. Additionally, home workers reported improved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell.

Doc 3 from NBER provides a digest of the research, summarizing that home workers increased their working minutes per shift by 9.2%, attributing this to reduced sick days because they felt well enough to work from home even when not fully healthy. Their calls handled per minute also increased by 3.3%, which they attributed to the quieter home environment.

Doc 4 is from ResearchGate, providing an abstract of the study, which aligns with the information from the previous documents.

From Doc 5, which is from the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), there's a detailed description of the evaluation, including the methodology, context, and results. It reiterates that working from home increased productivity and job satisfaction but reduced the likelihood of promotion, possibly due to less visibility to managers.

After reviewing these documents, it seems clear that the study found positive effects of working from home on productivity and job satisfaction, with some caveats regarding promotions. The experiment was conducted in a specific context—a call center in China—and involved a large sample size, which adds to the credibility of the findings.

However, it's important to consider the broader implications and whether these results can be generalized to other types of jobs and industries. The study focused on call center employees, who might have different job requirements compared to, say, knowledge workers or those in creative fields. Moreover, the cultural and institutional context in China could influence the outcomes differently than in other countries.

Additionally, the study was conducted before the widespread adoption of remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work globally, and many organizations have had to adapt quickly, sometimes without the infrastructure or managerial practices in place to support effective remote work. This might lead to different outcomes compared to the controlled experiment in the CTrip study.

Furthermore, the study highlights that after the experiment, when CTrip offered the option to work from home to the entire firm, over half of the original experimental employees chose to return to the office. This suggests that while working from home had benefits, there were also drawbacks that led many employees to prefer working in the office.

Possible reasons for this could include social isolation, difficulties in separating work and personal life, or the lack of certain resources at home. These factors might have influenced employees' decisions to return to the office, even if working from home initially improved their productivity and job satisfaction.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from this Chinese experiment, working from home appears to have several benefits, including increased productivity, improved job satisfaction, and reduced turnover. However, there are also potential downsides, such as reduced promotion opportunities and the need for employees to have a suitable home workspace.

Given these findings, organizations might consider offering flexible work arrangements that allow employees to choose when and where they work, potentially leading to even greater improvements in productivity and job satisfaction, as seen in the CTrip study after the rollout to the entire firm.

\boxed{\text{Yes, working from home can be effective, as evidenced by a significant increase in productivity and job satisfaction in a large-scale Chinese experiment, though there are considerations regarding promotions and employee preferences.}}
