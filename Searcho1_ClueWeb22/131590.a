So I've been asked about how social media affects sleep. I know that a lot of people, especially young adults and teenagers, use social media a lot these days. I've heard that it might not be great for sleep, but I'm not exactly sure how or why. Maybe I should look into this more.

First off, I think about my own experiences. I often find myself checking my phone before bed, scrolling through Instagram or Facebook, and sometimes I stay up later than I meant to because I get caught up in what's happening on social media. So, personally, I can see how it might affect sleep negatively.

But I need to look beyond my own experience to answer this question properly. There must be research on this topic. Maybe some studies have been done to see the relationship between social media use and sleep quality or duration.

I should probably start by understanding what social media is and how it works. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and others allow users to create and share content, connect with friends and family, and engage with communities based on shared interests. They are highly interactive and often designed to be addictive, keeping users engaged for longer periods.

Now, thinking about sleep, there are several factors that can influence it: the amount of screen time before bed, the content being consumed, the mental state after using social media, and perhaps even the blue light emitted by devices, which can interfere with the body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.

Maybe I should consider each of these aspects separately to get a clearer picture.

First, screen time before bed. I know that experts recommend avoiding screens at least an hour before bedtime because the blue light they emit can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. So, if people are using social media on their phones or computers right before bed, that could be disrupting their sleep.

Second, the content on social media. Some posts might be stressful, upsetting, or stimulating, which could keep people's minds active and make it difficult for them to wind down. On the other hand, maybe some content is relaxing and doesn't have a negative impact. It might depend on what individuals are exposed to.

Third, the mental state after using social media. There's been talk about phenomena like FOMO—fear of missing out—which can cause anxiety if people see others having fun or achieving things while they're not. This anxiety could interfere with sleep. Also, comparing oneself to others on social media can lead to feelings of inadequacy or depression, which are also known to affect sleep.

Fourth, the behavioral aspect. If people are spending a lot of time on social media, they might be sacrificing sleep time to stay connected. Essentially, they choose to spend hours on their phones instead of getting enough sleep.

Moreover, notifications and the urge to check for updates can disrupt sleep, even if someone has gone to bed. If their phone is nearby and set to notify them of new messages or likes, that could wake them up or prevent them from getting deep sleep.

I should also consider that not all effects are negative. Some people might find social media relaxing or use it to connect with others about sleep-related topics or support groups. However, I suspect that the overall impact is more detrimental than beneficial when it comes to sleep.

To get a better understanding, I should look for scientific studies or reviews that have investigated this relationship. Maybe there are meta-analyses or systematic reviews that can provide insights based on multiple studies.

Let me try to recall if I've come across any such studies in the past. I think I remember reading somewhere that increased social media use is associated with poorer sleep quality, especially among adolescents and young adults. But I need to verify that.

Perhaps I should look for key terms like "social media," "sleep," "sleep quality," "sleep duration," "adolescents," "teenagers," "young adults," and see what research has been done in these areas.

I should also consider the methodology of such studies. Are they correlational, showing a relationship between social media use and sleep issues, or are there experimental studies that demonstrate causation? It's important to distinguish between correlation and causation.

Additionally, maybe there are factors that mediate or moderate the relationship between social media use and sleep. For example, personality traits, pre-existing mental health conditions, or the time of day when social media is used.

It would be helpful to look at both quantitative and qualitative research. Quantitative studies can provide data on sleep metrics like duration and efficiency, while qualitative studies might offer insights into users' experiences and perceptions.

I should also consider the context in which social media is used. Is it before bed, during the night, or throughout the day? Each of these contexts might have different impacts on sleep.

Another angle is the design of social media platforms themselves. Are they intentionally designed to be engaging and keep users online for longer, potentially at the expense of their sleep?

I've heard of terms like "infinite scroll" and algorithms that prioritize content to keep users hooked. These design features could contribute to extended screen time and subsequently affect sleep.

Furthermore, perhaps the multitasking nature of social media use could play a role. People might be using social media while in bed, associating their sleeping environment with activity rather than rest, which could confuse their brain's association with the bed as a place for sleep.

This reminds me of the recommendation to use the bed only for sleep and sex to strengthen the mental association between bed and sleep.

Also, the emotional impact of social media can't be overlooked. Cyberbullying, for instance, is a serious issue that can lead to stress and anxiety, thereby affecting sleep.

Moreover, the constant connectivity provided by social media can lead to an always-on culture, where people feel pressure to respond immediately to messages or updates, even late at night.

I should also think about the potential differences across various social media platforms. For example, Instagram is visual and focus on appearances, which might trigger body image concerns, while Twitter is more about news and实时讨论，可能引起焦虑或兴奋。这些不同的情感反应可能以不同的方式影响睡眠。

另外，夜间使用社交媒体可能会扰乱生物钟，因为蓝光抑制褪黑激素的产生，而褪黑激素对于调节睡眠-觉醒周期至关重要。因此，即使内容本身不是特别刺激，单纯是屏幕发出的蓝光也可能干扰睡眠。

也许有些人会使用社交媒体来放松，比如在睡前看一些轻松的内容，这可能对某些人有帮助，但总体而言，研究表明社交媒体使用与睡眠问题之间存在关联。

我需要找到一些具体的统计数据或研究发现来支持我的观点。也许可以查找最近的学术文章或可靠的新闻来源。

让我尝试进行一次搜索，看看能找出什么信息。

首先，我将搜索“社交媒體對睡眠的影響”看看有什么相关研究或文章。

Expert Tips & Advice
How to Keep Social Media From Ruining Your Sleep
by
John-Manuel Andriote
/ March 27, 2020
These days, it's hard to disconnect from social media. With health experts recommending we practice social distancing for potentially months, scrolling through Facebook and Instagram has become the de facto way for many of us to stay in the loop with friends and loved ones. And the near-constant barrage of news updates about coronavirus has plenty of us glued to our phones, refreshing our Twitter feeds every few minutes. All of this can lead to some pretty poor sleep—and not just because it ratchets up your anxiety.
The connection between social media and sleep
Researchers who study our social media usage and its effects agree that it impacts sleep. But they can only tell us there is a correlation between social media usage and sleep. No one has yet demonstrated that usage actually causes sleep disruption.
Obviously, your sleep patterns will be disrupted if you're chatting, posting, or tweeting later than when your body tells you it needs to shut down for the day. This is called “direct sleep displacement."
On an emotional level, multiple studies have tied social media use to increased risk for depression and anxiety—two of the biggest contributors to insomnia. In adolescents, it has also been tied to low self-esteem. Researchers attribute this in part to teenagers' tendency to compare themselves unfavorably to their peers. Of course, there are plenty of adults who can't sleep for worrying that their own lives aren't nearly as perfect as their friends' selective online self-presentations.
If worry isn't keeping you awake, the blue light from the smartphones and other devices we use to access social media will disrupt sleep by delaying the body's natural circadian rhythms that are so acutely tied to light and darkness.
“The blue light on our phones mimics daylight and sends signals to the brain that the time to sleep has not yet arrived," says Sanam Hafeez, PsyD, Columbia University neuropsychologist. “While most phones have a nighttime mode nowadays, the constant movement of the retina as we scroll through Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, TikTok, and every other app out there affects the process of inducing sleep."
Some people, particularly adolescents, actually look at online media as a sleep aid. The jury is out on social media's effectiveness compared to, say, music videos or photos, because its uniquely interactive nature means it tends to stimulate and promote arousal rather than relaxation. “Psychologically," says Hafeez, “social media can keep you preoccupied to the point where sleep begins to get postponed as you keep interacting with your feed."
Nighttime use—especially close to bedtime—has the biggest negative impact on sleep. A study of 1,763 young American adults aged 19-32 years found that those who checked their social media within the 30 minutes before they go to bed were more than one and a half times more likely to experience disturbed sleep than those who used it earlier in the day.
Although we can't draw a straight line between social media use and poor sleep, research lets us say this much: The more you use social media, the more likely you are to have poor sleep because both the overall time and frequency of use have been tied to sleep problems.
Teens, social media, and poor sleep
Most research on the relationship between social media use and sleep focuses on adolescents and young adults mainly because young people are the strongest users of social media. Their experiences offer lessons (and cautionary tales) for older folks who might be more engaged with social media than many of their age peers.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adolescents aged 13-18 years get 8-10 hours of sleep in every 24-hour period. Yet fewer than one in three U.S. high school-age students get the recommended amount of sleep.
The American Academy of Pediatrics reports growing concern because insufficient sleep among adolescents has implications for mental health, academic performance, and safety. It also negatively affects cognitive performance, mood, immune function, cardiovascular risk, weight, and metabolism.
A University of Pittsburgh study of 1,788 young U.S. adults aged 19-32 years found they spent a median of 61 minutes per day on social media. More than half of them reported medium or high levels of sleep disturbance.
A larger University of Glasgow study of 11,872 adolescents aged 13-15 years found an average social media use of one to three hours per day. A third (33.7%) were classed as low users (less than one hour); 13.9% were high users (three to five hours), and 20.8% were very high users (five or more hours). Girls reported spending more time on social media than boys.
Not surprisingly, heavier use was associated with poor sleep patterns. Very high social media users were more likely to report problems falling asleep and waking up on school days and trouble falling back asleep after awakening during the night.
The University of Glasgow researchers emphasize that research on the effects of adolescents' social media use should be measured within the context of what is currently considered “normal" usage. They note that most research tends to focus on “addicted" social media users, adding that comparing higher users' sleep patterns against average users “can better support practical and realistic discussions" of adolescents' social media use.
How to keep social media from ruining your sleep
Consider these practical steps to make sure your, or your teen's, social media use doesn't turn into an antisocial intruder on your need for healthy sleep:
Turn off your smartphone and devices. “Give yourself a deadline by which smart devices should be placed away," says Hafeez.
Set time limits. “The first thing to do when attempting to minimize social media-related insomnia and anxiety is to assess your current social media usage and find a way to keep track of this metric," says Hafeez. There are apps you can download to prevent you from accessing your social media accounts.
Don't keep your phone next to the bed. Besides helping avoid the snooze button on your alarm, “it is also a helpful measure to take to ensure that, even if your mind is still winding down, you don't use social media as a crutch to preoccupy your mind," says Hafeez.
Develop a relaxing and entertaining pre-bedtime routine without social media. “This means," says Hafeez, “that once your deadline hits and your phone is charging on the opposite side of the room, you begin your nighttime routine ."
Take a break from social media. As in most areas of life, moderation and healthy boundaries are keys to using social media in a way that will support your overall health and well-being. “There is no mystical power our electronics have over us," says Hafeez. “We must simply learn to evaluate our habits and reconfigure our bedtime routine so that it is conducive to a restful and re-energizing sleep."

Social Media and Sleep
By Michelle Zhang, Wellness Writer
Social media is becoming inescapable in our society. According to a February 2019 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, 72 percent of American adults use social media. And 90 percent of adults between 18 to 29 are on social media.
Still, there’s a lot of bad press surrounding social media despite its widespread use, and it’s not without reason. One recurring criticism is how social media can negatively affect our sleep.
The technology is relatively new, and the full effects of social media on our lives are still being studied. So far, there is plenty of evidence that too much social media can cause us to struggle to fall asleep.
Studies on How Social Media Affects Sleep
A 2019 study examined the sleep quality of 13 to 15-year-olds and their social media use. On average, teenagers used social media for one to three hours daily. More social media usage was tied to poorer sleep patterns, such as delayed sleep and wake times and trouble falling back asleep after waking up in the night.
In 2014, more than 1,700 young adults reported how much time they spent on social media per day and how many weekly visits to social media websites they made. Higher volume and frequency of social media use was tied to increased odds of sleep disturbances.
A 2016 study examined 197 first-year students who used Twitter in their first quarter at college. The students’ tweets were organized by the researchers according to their emotional state, while the students provided weekly reports on their sleep quality. Frequently tweeting late on a weekday night was tied to lower sleep quality, as were tweets linked to fear. However, tweeting during the evening was related to better sleep quality.
An Oxford study found that adults who checked social media 30 minutes before bed were more likely to experience sleep disturbances.
Too Much Blue Light Keeps You Awake
The simplest explanation for how social media can keep you up is too much blue light exposure. Blue wavelengths boost our attention and reaction times, keeping us awake. And many electronics give off these blue wavelengths, causing us to wake up when our bodies should be shutting down for sleep.
Any kind of light can suppress the release of melatonin, a hormone that helps us fall asleep. However, blue light is most effective at suppressing melatonin.
For best results, sign off your devices two to three hours before bedtime. If you can’t avoid using electronic devices before bed, consider a pair of glasses that filter out blue light. You can also check if there’s a “Nighttime Mode” that will replace your screen’s blue light with more soothing yellow hues.
Blue light exposure may not be the only factor keeping you up at night. There’s also evidence of a psychological component when it comes to how social media disrupts sleep.
Why Does Social Media Use Feel Good?
Our brains rely on dopamine, a “feel-good” chemical, to motivate behavior and turn it into a habit. It’s released after a scrumptious meal, a thorough workout, and after we socialize successfully. Dopamine helps to reinforce specific behavior patterns.
Social media is full of positive and negative social interactions, the former of which can cause a release of dopamine. This leaves us desiring likes and reblogs for the sense of reward they bring us. Some platforms even recognize this and work to increase your feeling of reward, sending out all sorts of notifications so you’ll check for updates.
Social Media, Anxiety, and Depression
Too much social media isn’t just tied to sleep loss. It can affect your waking hours as well, leaving you anxious and depressed.
A 2016 study observed the social media use of 467 Scottish adolescents. It measured overall use, usage at night, emotional investment in social media, sleep quality, self-esteem, and anxiety and depression levels. Those who used it more, whether overall or at night, didn’t sleep as well and had lower self-esteem and higher levels of anxiety and depression than those who used it in moderation.
Another 2016 study surveyed 1,787 adults between 19 to 32 years old about their social media use and depression levels. Social media use was associated with higher depression levels.
Yet another 2016 study examined the impact of social media on anxiety in 563 young adults. More time spent on social media was linked to greater levels of anxiety.
Why can social media cause or worsen anxiety and depression? One reason may be how many people tie their social media to their identity.
Many social media users feel pressured to establish themselves as important. Therefore, a lack of social media attention can cause people to feel unpopular or disliked, particularly if they’re already feeling lonely or anxious. There’s also the perception that even if you’re successful on social media, just one wrong comment can cause you to fall out of favor or even be harassed and shunned.
Plus, a lot of social media focuses on photos and videos instead of just text posts. Many people compare themselves to others and feel self-conscious about their bodies, leading to low self-esteem or eating disorders.
Benefits of Social Media
Don’t panic yet! You don’t need to quit social media use completely. A 2019 study analyzed a sample of more than 1,000 American adults. Using social media as part of a daily routine has a positive effect on social well-being, mental health, and self-rated health.
“Routine social media use may compensate for diminishing face-to-face social interactions in people’s busy lives,” said Mesfin Awoke Bekalu, the study’s research scientist, in an interview with Harvard.
Self-regulation is the key to a healthy relationship with social media, he said. It becomes unhealthy when you’re too emotionally connected. This could manifest in regularly checking for updates out of fear that you’ll miss something, or feeling a sharp pang of disappointment when your friends aren’t online at the same time you are.
An earlier 2010 study also suggests that social media can have benefits. Over two years, 740 people were surveyed. Respondents described:
How they used the Internet
Their physical health
Their depression levels
If they had a serious illness or cared for someone with one
The study found that using the Internet to stay in touch with loved ones was tied to small decreases in depression. This conclusion is backed by other studies that show social support improves well-being and means the Internet may be a good way to strengthen those social networks.
A 2018 study recommends limiting yourself to 30 minutes of social media use a day.
A Successful Social Media Strategy
Harvard Medical School recommends you remain mindful of how you interact with social media, not just how much you use it. Is it a replacement for something you might be able to do in real life? If so, you might want to try a substitute activity such as talking with friends, walking outside, reading a book, or creating artwork.
“It’s fine to do a quick check on what other people are doing, or to keep track of social events to attend,” Jeremy Nobel, MD, writes. “It is less healthy to monitor social media for what we’re missing out on.”
The social media platform you use matters as well. Some, such as Facebook, may leave you unfavorably comparing yourself to others. Others may allow for more creative expression. If you find yourself feeling more lonely as you use social media, reduce the time you spend using it. Remember, you want to develop a sense of community.
How Much Sleep Do I Need?
How much sleep you need depends on your age group. The younger you are, the more you need.
Age Group
Recommended Amount of Sleep
Newborns 0 to 3 months old
14 to 16 hours
Infants 4 to 11 months old
12 to 15 hours
Toddlers 1 to 2 years old
11 to 14 hours
Preschoolers 3 to 5 years old
10 to 13 hours
Children 6 to 13 years old
9 to 11 hours
Teenagers 14 to 17 years old
8 to 10 hours
Adults 18 to 25 years old
7 to 9 hours
Adults 26 to 64 years old
7 to 9 hours
Adults age 65 and older
7 to 8 hours
Lifestyle factors can also affect how much sleep you need. Working on your feet all day can cause you to need more sleep than a person with a desk job. Athletes can benefit from sleeping 10 hours a day to recover from their intense physical activity.
Not getting enough sleep affects your daily performance. When you’re sleep-deprived, your physical and mental reactions slow down, reducing your productivity.
Chronic sleep loss is tied to heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Too little sleep can also compromise your immune system and decrease your chances of resisting infection.
Creating a New Bedtime and Wake-Up Routine
It can be hard to cut down on your social media time before bed, but it’s necessary to minimize blue light exposure so you can get a good night’s rest. Instead, try a bedtime routine without electronics and focus on relaxing. Soothing activities can include reading, knitting, doing some light stretches, and a warm bath.
If you can, don’t just log off of social media at least an hour or two before bedtime, but keep all electronic devices out of your bedroom. Just having a computer or TV in your room causes your brain to associate it with things other than sleep. For people who need to remain “on-call” and must sleep with a phone in their room, disable all unnecessary notifications.
If you find sleep eluding you for more than 20 or 30 minutes after you lie down on your mattress, it’s important to stifle any urge to reach for an electronic device and check social media. The blue light will only wake you up more instead of relaxing you.
Instead, get out of bed and try a soothing activity. Try making yourself a cup of warm milk or herbal tea. Relax by reading a chapter in a favorite book. When you feel yourself grow sleepy, return to bed.
You should try to fall asleep and wake up around the same time every day because that is the only way to develop a consistent sleep schedule. Yes, that does mean you should try to avoid sleeping in on your days off; we recommend no more than an extra hour of sleep. But if you’re getting enough sleep every night, you shouldn’t need to sleep more on the weekend.
A sign you’re getting a good night’s sleep is if you’re waking up a few minutes before your alarm is set to go off. And when your alarm does go off, don’t just hit the snooze button. This weakens the association in your mind that the alarm means it’s time to get up, which may eventually lead to you sleeping through your wake-up call.
Frequently Asked Questions

Key points
We’ve seen an explosion in the use of social media platforms over the past decade, and how we are using social media is having a massive impact on our sleep. So in this article we’re going to explore exactly how social media affect sleep. We’ll cover:
Why we should all try to limit screentime as bedtime approaches.
How social media affects our sleep habits and can lead to sleep deprivation.
Steps you can take to reduce the impact of social media on your sleep.
Social media and sleep
How many of us would admit to taking our phone to bed and scrolling through Facebook/Insta/Twitter before falling asleep? For lots of people, young and old, it’s now the norm to sleep with a mobile phone in our bedroom. 1 2
Polls have shown that browsing social media is now one of the most common pre-sleep activities, between going to bed and falling sleep. While it might feel relaxing to lie in bed and check a newsfeed, the reality is that this constant connectivity can have major negative effects on our sleep.
Are your social media habits leaving you feeling sleep deprived?

The rise of social media
In 2012, only 5% of adults were using social media; this had shot up to 70% at the last count (2020) and it’s even higher in younger adults, at over 90%. 3
There’s also been huge increases in how long we spend on social media: amongst 16-64 year olds, average time spent has been creeping up, from 90 minutes per day in 2012, to now being about two and a half hours per day. 4 This equates to around 1/6th of our waking hours!
But what happens when staying connected continues into bedtime? How exactly does social media affect your sleep? Read on to see how your bedtime social media habits might be stopping you from getting a good night’s sleep.
Mobiles and melatonin: how looking at your phone can affect your sleep
It’s well-established that looking at phone screens can impact sleep. Mobiles emit mostly blue light, and these wavelengths are particularly good at keeping us productive and focussed, so perfectly suited for daytime phone usage.
At night-time, however, this isn’t ideal. At its simplest, exposure to light tells us to be awake, so looking at a bright light from a phone just before bed is telling your body it’s still time to be awake and not sleep time.
In the hours leading up to bedtime, as natural light levels decrease, our brains start to produce a hormone called melatonin, which causes our alertness to begin to dip. It signals to our bodies to wind down and prepare for sleep.
The blue light emitted by mobile phones affects your melatonin levels more than any other wavelength does. It signals to your brain that it’s daylight, melatonin production is suppressed and sleep becomes delayed. 5
Without melatonin signalling to us that we are sleepy, we remain awake and alert, in a state of ‘cognitive arousal’.
Cognitive arousal: getting wound up when you should be winding down!
When you go to bed, your brain is preparing for sleep, but by looking at social media, you’re providing endless stimulation, signalling to your brain and body to remain active and keep engaged.
It’s not simply the fact that you’re looking at social media which keeps you awake, the type of content has a big impact too.
How it affects you emotionally (for example, after viewing a sad video), socially (a group chat on WhatsApp) and cognitively (reading content that gets you thinking) are all very important in determining the knock-on effects it has on sleep. 6 7
Passively scrolling through a newsfeed before turning off is less engaging and will affect your sleep less than getting involved in a heated debate on twitter.
Similarly, photo-sharing platforms (generally more passive participation) will have less impact on sleep than those which actively engage their users to respond, such as messaging sites. 8
This comes down to how much involvement the interaction calls for. Looking at photos can be done quite serenely. Debating global politics is going to call for a more involved interaction.
The take home from this is that if you must use social media before you go to sleep, try to avoid areas that will stimulate you and demand high levels of engagement.

Delayed bedtime: time spent surfing should be spent snoozing
How many times have you thought you’d just quickly check your social media account before going to sleep, only to find yourself falling down a rabbit hole of entertaining videos, photos, funny comments, chatting with friends, reading newsfeeds…? And just like that, an hour or even two have passed.
When we finally put down our phones, it also takes us longer to fall asleep, the quality of sleep is reduced and you wake up feeling sleepy and unrefreshed. 9
Your bedtime has been displaced and additionally, you’ve lost some valuable sleep time, so your sleep duration will generally be shorter. Sleep displacement by social media is well-recognised amongst adolescents, and recent studies are beginning to show similar effects across adult age groups, too.
For people still in education, who have early start times, this is a particularly bad combination. For adults, this often leads to later wake-up times and has a knock-on effect on time available to complete tasks over the coming day. 5 8
Fear of missing out (FOMO)
A study from 2012 found that young people spend 54% of their internet time on social media. 10 In teenagers, the fear of missing out (FOMO) and social disapproval are driving forces in the use of social media at night time. If you’re not connected, then you’re missing out; everybody else is online, so why are you not? 9
Studies are starting to show similar results in adults; FOMO is definitely not unique to teenagers. 8
Sadly, FOMO can feel like a no-win situation: you log off, but feel guilty because you’re no longer responding immediately to notifications, you can lose sleep worrying about what you’re missing and what people will think of you for not being available.
Or, you stay online and your sleep is compromised, you’re setting yourself up for anxiety, poor focus and increased risk of depression.
There’s no need to feel like you have to be available 24/7; we need to move away from these ways of thinking. Logging off or taking a break is totally fine. The bottom line is simple: we all need to sleep.
Denying yourself sleep to appear constantly online is just sabotaging your own well-being. Sleep deprivation can negatively affect your health in many different ways, so it seems crazy that we’d put our wellbeing at risk just to keep up to date on social media.
If you feel like you’re struggling to disconnect and your sleep is being compromised, the team at Sleepstation can provide you with the tools you need to get a good night’s sleep.
Disturbed sleep: alerted by all those alerts
When you do eventually fall asleep, this isn’t the end of social media’s hold on your brain. Message alerts, notifications, texts, updates…
In our eagerness to appear always available and connected, many of us further jeopardise our sleep by keeping our phone within grasp, on vibrate or unmuted.
Plus, once sleep has been disturbed by an alert, we often remain awake thinking about and anticipating further beeps and pings, which leads to fragmented sleep.
The best way to avoid this is to turn your phone off, put it on airplane mode or leave it on silent. Keeping it out of the bedroom at night would be ideal, but if this feels like a step too far, leave it on the other side of the room, as far away from your bed as possible.
The chicken and the egg: insomnia and social media
It’s the middle of the night and you find yourself unable to sleep, so you reach for your phone and check your social media accounts.
It’s an easy distraction from whatever is keeping you from sleeping, but then you find you can’t disengage, so you keep scrolling, you become more alert, so you can’t sleep. It’s a vicious cycle.
Research is now underway to examine the relationship between insomnia and social media use, and two important questions are being asked:
Does night-time social media use cause insomnia? Or
Do people with insomnia use social media to cope with their sleep problems? 11
This angle is now being examined in greater depth, so for some, night-time social media usage may actually be their way of coping with a sleep problem, as opposed to causing it.
Positive steps you can take
Social media has many good points; it connects people, can bring friends and families closer together, it informs us and is entertaining. But sleep and social media do not make for good bedfellows.
We need to be mindful of how often and at what times we connect. Social media usage around bedtime can have major repercussions for your sleep.
Reducing exposure to social media can help you to disconnect and may improve your sleep quality.
Ideally, aim to wind-down your usage in the 2 hours before bedtime, but at a minimum, at least 30 minutes before bed.
Instead of scrolling through your phone, screen-free time will help prepare you for sleep. Maybe read a book, relax, take a bath, listen to music. Try whatever works to relax you, without involving looking at a screen.
If possible, keep your phone out of your bedroom at night! Buy a cheap alarm clock and leave your phone on charge in another room. You want to aim to create an ideal bedroom setup for good sleep, which means limiting distractions in the bedroom and making the space an inviting, calm and comfortable place to retreat to.
If you think you’re developing unhealthy sleep patterns due to social media then speak to us at Sleepstation. We can work with you to get to the root cause of your sleep issues and we’ll help you to improve your bedtime sleep habits.
Summary
Social media usage around bedtime can negatively affect how long and how well you sleep.
Looking at social media in bed can make it harder for you to fall asleep.
It can also reduce the amount of time you sleep for and leave you feeling unrefreshed the next day.
Try to limit (or stop) social media use a couple of hours before bedtime, to allow your body to wind down and prepare for sleep.
If possible, keep your mobile phone out of the bedroom-easier said than done!

Impact of Social Media Addiction on Your Sleep and Health

Impact of Social Media Addiction on Your Sleep and Health
Posted by Phoebe Hart on Jun 17, 2020 9:40:00 AM
Social media networks are now seen as a significant distraction factor. Lots of people limit their presence there (and that of their children, too) to less than an hour per day. But are they really such a threat to one’s health?
The good news is that they aren’t if used wisely and within some reasonable limits. But the bad news is that binging on social media might affect our sleep habits and general health, and not for good.
Social Media and Circadian Rhythms
There are complex relations between gadgets as a whole, social media in particular and our circadian rhythms. The scientists are still doing their research to find out the mechanism that connects these things. But there are already proven phenomena, such as sleep deprivation connected with social media and social media-induced depressions and addictions.
Social media is a place of concentrated emotions. Lots of pages deliberately post heavily emotional content, and people on these platforms aren’t restricted with morals and politeness that govern us in real life. Some people can even worry about the popularity of their social profiles. Thankfully, their problems can be solved by review websites like Likes Finder. But the emotional impact of social media is still a problem.
The notorious saying “it’s the Internet, baby” doesn’t play well with our emotions. The stress and negative (or even highly positive, just overwhelming) feelings can cause anxiety or depression, and these states affect our sleeping habits a lot.
The Special Hormone - Melatonin
But the emotional factor isn’t the only one. Our brain knows when to go to sleep thanks to melatonin - a special hormone that is created in our body when our circadian rhythm enters the sleeping phase. When the level of melatonin in our blood is high enough, we fall asleep. But this hormone is also heavily dependent on the level of light registered by our eyes.
Humans, as a species, are mostly daily creatures. The “night owl” type is an anomaly, created by our evolution as sentinels, who guarded primordial tribes at night and shooed away night predators. But nowadays the artificial lights and the very schedule of modern life creates a situation when we only have our personal time, free of work, chores or whatever, late at night.
Our biological clock tells us to go to sleep, while our common sense says that we need to enjoy life after work and our melatonin bounces from “nearly enough” to “it’s still too light here” because of the light from our gadgets’ screens. We socialize and see the light at the time inappropriate for our primal biology, and that messes up our sleeping habits big time.
Social Media and Disturbed Sleep
The research conducted in 2014 showed a strong correlation between the time spent on social media networks and disturbed sleep. Among 1788 young people aged 19 to 32 was a linear relationship between social media use and sleep disturbance.
The frequency of logging into your Facebook or Instagram affects your emotional and mental state and therefore affects your health. Moreover, spending too much time on social media networks may create dependency. Reading the news feed may become a “soothing ritual” before a person goes to sleep; but instead of actually soothing the anxiety piles up and results in fractured night sleep, even more so if you are used to reading your feed during the night.
Nighttime and Blue Screens
Our brain sees social media as a gathering of fellow tribes people and activates the centers that are needed for socializing. Unfortunately, these parts of our brain require the most energy (for example, our “speech center” requires almost the most effort and energy in comparison to any other part of the brain).
Our speech and reading, abstract thinking and empathy turn on and make us highly alert, which is the opposite of sleepiness. No wonder that even after finishing our reading, we still need an hour or two to cool down our brain and finally go to bed.
Social media are also the biggest time consumers amongst all the habits, except, possibly, smoking. We spend a lot of time watching the feed even after all the messages were answered. Minute after minute we lose several hours of our productive time and, as a result, we have to work late in the evening, going to sleep much later than we had to.
You're the One in Control
Social media networks aren’t evil by design. To improve the quality of your sleep, you may just limit their usage in the evening, several hours before sleep. Use the social media time trackers on your gadgets, set alarms or use only messengers, not news feeds. At first, it may be quite hard to adjust to the new social media habits, but if you really need to improve your sleeping routine, it will be totally worth it!
Evidence is mounting that the screen time/sleep deprivation correlation might affect children and teenagers even more than adults. The latest study comes from a high school junior who won the 2013 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair for her research that discovered that adolescents who partook in more than 3.5 hours of screen time a day were more likely to suffer sleep deprivation than those with only two hours of screen time.
Now What?
So, what should you do to reduce the effects of screen time at night to possibly stave off sleep deprivation? Reducing the brightness of your device can help, as well as using amber-colored glasses when watching a screen after the sun goes down.
The obvious answer is to resist watching too much TV or using your smartphone in the hour or two before bedtime. Find some other way to wind down, including reading a book—not on your tablet, but the 20th century way with pages and a bookmark. Not turning on your television or laptop right before bed will give your brain a rest, in more ways than one.
If you think it may be more than too much tv or computer time, contact Alaska Sleep Clinic for a free 10 minute phone consultation.

Does Social Media Have an Effect on Sleep?
Social Media and Youth
Tips for Using Social Media
There’s no doubt that social media has transformed the world we live in. An ever-increasing number of social media services allow users to connect with people all over the globe in an instant, providing connection, news, and endless entertainment.
For many users, social media is a constant presence. Whether it’s to find information, chat, or share pictures, the majority of Americans check their social media at least once daily 1 and many continue to look at social media close to bedtime.
Unfortunately, social media and sleep don’t mix well. Excessive use of social media close to bedtime can reduce sleep quality and increase the risk of a multitude of sleep issues.
Does Social Media Have an Effect on Sleep?
Checking social media, sending emails, or looking at the news before bed can keep us awake, as nighttime use of electronics can affect sleep through the stimulating-effects of light from digital screens.
While all light can interfere with our circadian rhythms, the 24-hour internal rhythms that control processes like the sleep-wake cycle, the blue light emitted from electronic screens has the greatest impact on sleep 2. Blue light stimulates parts of the brain that makes us feel alert 3, leaving us energized at bedtime when we should be winding down.
The impacts of blue light exposure may be worse for those who wake up to check their phone after falling asleep. Approximately 21% of adults say that they wake up to check their phone during the night, leaving them at an even higher risk of losing sleep and developing a sleep disorder like insomnia.
The pull of checking social media before bed may be too hard to resist. A poll of hospital employees and university students found that a staggering 70% of people report using social media after getting into bed 4, with almost 15% spending an hour or more doing so each night.
Fear of Missing Out
One reason for the excessive use of social media before bed is the fear of missing out, commonly referred to as FOMO. Social media presents us with an impossible dilemma- endless opportunities for interaction, yet only so much time in the day. FOMO is one response to this dilemma, characterized by a never-ending desire to stay connected to what others are doing and seeing.
People who experience more FOMO are more likely to check their social media within 15 minutes of trying to sleep5, significantly contributing to sleep issues. Those with high levels of FOMO are also more likely to check their social media during other inappropriate times, such as during university lectures and while driving a car.
Social Media and Youth
Research supports the common observation that young people are always on their phones. Around 95% of adolescents have access to a smartphone and, not surprisingly, around 45% report being online “almost constantly”6.
Social media is a double-edged sword for young people. On one hand, it allows adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings and receive social support. On the other hand, an increasing amount of research suggests that excessive time on social media puts adolescents at high risk for mental health problems 7, such as depression and anxiety.
There are several potential links between using social media and developing mental health issues in young people, but recent research points to the importance of social media’s effect on sleep patterns 8. This research found that the more time adolescents spent on screen-based activities (like social media, web surfing, watching TV, and gaming), the more trouble they had falling asleep and the less sleep they got during the night. These sleep issues were then linked with increased symptoms of insomnia and depression.
Tips for Using Social Media
Checking social media too close to bedtime can interfere with good sleep hygiene, which involves increasing practices that promote sleep and eliminating practices that harm sleep. Because checking social media is so tempting and easy, it’s important to be intentional in creating good social media habits.
Here are some tips for taking control of your social media and making sure that it doesn’t interfere with getting quality sleep.
Talk to your children about social media: Social media gives children and adolescents the power to connect with diverse people all over the world. But with great power comes great responsibility, so give your kids the tools they need to thrive in a digital world.
Make tuning-out a habit: While connecting with others through social media can be beneficial and make us feel good, we all need a little time away. Practice giving yourself screen-free time every day, perhaps while socializing, around mealtime, and before bed.
Notice your FOMO: Fear of missing out is real, and learning to cope with feelings of anxiety can help you fall asleep rather than impulsively check your social media. If you notice yourself feeling FOMO close to bedtime, try some relaxation exercises to help you fall asleep.
Silence alerts and notifications: Most electronics have visual or audio alerts when you receive a message or an update on social media. Keeping these turned on can wake you up during sleep, increase feelings of FOMO, and lead to compulsive social media usage. Instead, try turning off or silencing your social media alerts and notification.
Charge your phone in a different room: Keeping your phone and computer in another room is one of the best steps you can take to resist checking social media near bedtime. Try keeping electronics in the office or the kitchen instead, where they’ll be easy to access when you need them, but won’t tempt you to sacrifice sleep.
Talk to a doctor or counselor: If social media is impacting your sleep, work, or relationships, there are people who can help. If you’ve tried to cut back on social media and are having trouble doing it alone, reach out to a doctor, therapist, or counselor who can offer support and tips for reducing screen time and improving your sleep.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, I have these search results from different sources. Let me see what they say.

First, there's a blog post from Saatva about how social media affects sleep. It mentions that social media can disrupt sleep in a few ways. One is direct sleep displacement, meaning that time spent on social media takes away from time that could be spent sleeping. Another is the emotional impact—using social media can lead to increased anxiety and depression, which are known to interfere with sleep. Also, the blue light from screens can mess with the body's circadian rhythms, making it harder to fall asleep.

The article talks about a study where people who checked social media within 30 minutes before bed were more likely to experience sleep disturbances. It suggests that heavy social media users are more likely to have sleep problems, but it's not clear if social media causes poor sleep or if people who already have sleep issues are more likely to use social media.

There's also a focus on teens and young adults, who are heavy social media users and may be particularly vulnerable to these effects. The article provides some tips for reducing the negative impact, like setting time limits, avoiding screens before bed, and developing a bedtime routine without social media.

Next, there's an article from Zoma Sleep that discusses both the positive and negative aspects of social media on sleep and overall well-being. It mentions a study where teenagers who used social media more had poorer sleep patterns, and another study showing that higher social media use was associated with increased odds of sleep disturbances in young adults.

The article also talks about the blue light emitted by screens disrupting sleep by suppressing melatonin production. It suggests that wearing blue-light-blocking glasses or using nighttime modes on devices can help mitigate this effect.

Additionally, the article touches on the psychological aspects, such as how social media can trigger feelings of anxiety and depression, which in turn can affect sleep. It references a study where social media use was linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression in young adults.

However, the article also notes that social media can have benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, which can positively impact mental health. It emphasizes the importance of moderation and being mindful of how social media is used.

Another article is from Sleepstation, which delves into how social media affects sleep, particularly focusing on the blue light emitted by screens and its impact on melatonin production. It explains that blue light tricks the brain into thinking it's still daytime, thus delaying the onset of sleep.

The article also discusses the concept of cognitive arousal, where engaging with social media before bed keeps the brain active and alert, making it harder to wind down. It mentions that different types of social media platforms can have varying degrees of impact on sleep, with more interactive platforms potentially being more disruptive.

Furthermore, it talks about the "fear of missing out" (FOMO), which can drive people to check social media late at night, fearing they'll miss out on important updates or social interactions. This can lead to delayed bedtimes and shorter sleep durations.

The article suggests that social media use around bedtime can become a coping mechanism for insomnia, creating a vicious cycle where sleep is further disrupted. It recommends reducing social media use before bed, engaging in screen-free wind-down activities, and considering keeping phones out of the bedroom to improve sleep quality.

Another source is from Alaska Sleep Education Center, which discusses the impact of social media addiction on sleep and health. It highlights how social media can interfere with circadian rhythms due to the blue light emitted by screens and the emotional content on these platforms.

The article mentions a study showing a linear relationship between social media use and sleep disturbance in young people. It also talks about how social media can cause anxiety and depression, which are known to affect sleep.

Moreover, it points out that the constant availability and connectivity via social media can lead to overstimulation of the brain, making it difficult to relax and fall asleep. The article suggests limiting social media use in the evening and finding alternative ways to wind down before bed.

Lastly, there's an article from the Sleep Foundation that explores the relationship between social media and sleep. It explains how the blue light from screens can suppress melatonin and disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to sleep problems.

The article also discusses the concept of fear of missing out (FOMO), which can compel people to check social media frequently, even at the expense of sleep. It cites a study showing that people with higher FOMO tendencies are more likely to check social media before bed, exacerbating sleep issues.

Furthermore, the article emphasizes the particular vulnerability of adolescents to social media's negative effects on sleep, as they are heavy users and more susceptible to sleep disruptions.

The Sleep Foundation provides tips for using social media in a way that minimizes its impact on sleep, such as setting time limits, creating screen-free zones, and talking to children about responsible social media use.

Overall, these sources consistently highlight that social media can negatively affect sleep through various mechanisms, including blue light exposure, emotional stimulation, and the displacement of sleep time with screen time. They also offer recommendations for mitigating these effects, such as reducing screen time before bed, using devices in a way that minimizes blue light exposure, and fostering healthier social media habits.

Given this information, I can conclude that social media does have a detrimental effect on sleep for many people, especially when used excessively close to bedtime. It's important to be aware of these risks and to implement strategies to protect one's sleep and overall well-being.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Social media can negatively affect sleep through blue light exposure, emotional stimulation, and displacement of sleep time with screen time.}} \]
