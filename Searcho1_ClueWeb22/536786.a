So I have this question: "How is public opinion about American institutions measured?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has something to do with surveys and polls. Maybe like those political polls you hear about during elections? But I need to be more precise than that.

First off, I should probably understand what public opinion means in this context. Public opinion refers to the collective attitudes or beliefs held by the general population towards certain topics or issues. In this case, it's about American institutions, which could include things like the government, courts, military, schools, and maybe even businesses or media.

So, to measure public opinion about these institutions, researchers or organizations must be gathering data on what people think about them. I imagine this is done through various methods, possibly including surveys, interviews, social media analysis, and maybe even public demonstrations or voting patterns.

Let me think about surveys first. Surveys are a common way to gauge public opinion. They can be conducted through telephone interviews, online questionnaires, or in-person interviews. These surveys typically ask participants a series of questions about their views on specific institutions. For example, they might ask how much trust people have in the judicial system or how satisfied they are with the performance of the federal government.

But surveys have their limitations. Response rates can be low, which might skew the results if certain groups are underrepresented. Also, the wording of questions can influence answers, so there's a need for careful design to avoid bias.

Apart from surveys, maybe public opinion is also measured through analyzing social media activity. With so many people expressing their thoughts online, platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit could provide insights into prevailing opinions about institutions. However, this method might not be entirely representative since not everyone uses social media, and online discussions can be heavily influenced by outliers or bots.

Another way could be through analyzing attendance at public events or participation in protests related to these institutions. For instance, if there are large protests against a particular institution, that might indicate negative public opinion. But this is probably a less reliable method because attendance at such events can be influenced by many factors beyond opinion, like convenience or organizational efforts.

Voting patterns could also reflect public opinion towards institutions, especially in the case of elections where certain candidates represent particular views on institutions. But again, voting is just one aspect and might not capture the full spectrum of public opinion.

I should probably look into some reputable organizations that track public opinion in the U.S. I recall hearing about Gallup polls; they've been around for a long time and are known for their surveys on various topics, including trust in institutions. There's also Pew Research Center, which conducts a lot of public opinion research. Maybe looking into how these organizations measure public opinion would give me a better idea.

Let me consider doing a quick search to find out more about methods used to measure public opinion on American institutions.

Americans' Confidence in Major U.S. Institutions Dips

Americans' Confidence in Major U.S. Institutions Dips
by Megan Brenan
Story Highlights
33% average confidence in 14 major institutions, down from 36% in 2020
Public schools, medical system down after double-digit increases in 2020
Small business, military elicit the most confidence; Congress, the least
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans' average confidence in major U.S. institutions has edged down after increasing modestly several months into the coronavirus pandemic last year. Currently, an average 33% of U.S. adults express "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in 14 institutions, marking a three-percentage-point dip since 2020 and a return to the level seen in 2018 and 2019.
These findings, from a June 1-July 5 poll, are the latest in Gallup's tracking of the public's confidence in a variety of key U.S. institutions, which began in 1973 during the Watergate scandal. Gallup has tracked 14 core institutions since 1993, and the public's confidence in them has remained relatively low -- particularly over the past 15 years, when the average has not risen above 36%. Before 2006, averages at or above 40% were more common. In addition to the core institutions, Gallup measures confidence in other societal institutions, though with less frequency.
Confidence in Most Institutions Down After Increases in 2020
In 2020, confidence in several specific institutions increased as the nation dealt with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. These include some of the business and societal sectors most affected by the public health and financial effects of the coronavirus situation, including the medical system, public schools, small business, organized religion and banks. This year, these same five institutions show the greatest decreases in confidence. However, they all are perceived at least slightly better than they were in 2019 before the pandemic. In particular, confidence in the medical system is substantially higher now (44%) than it was two years ago (36%).
Confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court and the criminal justice system are each down four points since 2020 and remain below their 2019 levels. Meanwhile, decreases since last year in Americans' confidence in eight other institutions are not statistically significant. These include the military, technology companies, organized labor, newspapers, television news, the presidency, big business and Congress.
In addition to big business, the police was the only other institution that saw a drop in confidence between 2019 and 2020. Since then, confidence in the police has edged up three points, to a slim 51% majority.

Last year's confidence reading for the police, which was taken in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing and the related nationwide protests, was the lowest on record and the first time it was below majority level. While the latest three-point uptick is not statistically significant, the measure remains shy of its 2019 level. Further analysis of the racial differences in confidence in the police is available here.
Overall Confidence Rankings Remain Fairly Stable
The police are one of just three institutions in which a majority of Americans express a great deal or quite a lot of confidence. The other two -- small business and the military -- have consistently ranked at the top of the list since 1989.
At the other end of the spectrum are Congress, television news, big business, the criminal justice system and newspapers, each of which has a confidence rating at or below 21%. Congress or big business has ranked at the bottom of the list since 2007.
The other eight institutions earn middling confidence ratings from the public, ranging from 28% for organized labor to 44% for the medical system.
Confidence in Most Institutions Politically Polarized
Majorities of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, as well as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, express confidence in the military and small business. Both party groups express similarly low confidence in the Supreme Court, big business, banks and the criminal justice system.
However, partisans' confidence in the remaining 10 institutions diverges. Republicans have far more confidence than Democrats in the police and the church. Meanwhile, Democrats' confidence in the other eight institutions outpaces Republicans' by double digits.

GALLUP, June 1-July 5, 2021
The largest partisan gap in confidence for any institution is for the presidency, with 49 points separating Democrats' and Republicans' ratings. Confidence in the presidency has become increasingly linked to the party affiliation of the president, with supporters of the president's party much more confident than supporters of the opposition party, consistent with the greater party polarization in presidential job approval ratings. Between 1993 and 2004, the average party gap in confidence in the presidency was 34 points. Since then, it has averaged 50 points.
Bottom Line
When the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. in 2020, it caused great upheaval in most aspects of Americans' lives. It also resulted in an overall uptick in average confidence across 14 institutions, driven largely by sharp one-year increases -- among the largest Gallup has measured -- for the U.S. medical system and public schools. Now, with the worst of the pandemic seemingly over and the intensity of the racial justice protests subsiding, Americans' confidence has retreated to more typical levels seen in recent years.
Average confidence in the 14 institutions Gallup has tracked long-term continues to lag behind where it has been historically. The pandemic thrust many U.S. institutions into the spotlight, and the discussion of these institutions' roles in the pandemic has been controversial at times. Grappling with how to set policies to contain the spread of the pandemic while simultaneously attempting to limit its impact on economic, educational and faith activities has proven challenging.

Public Opinion and How It's Measured
American Government
Public Opinion and How It's Measured
The term public opinion refers to attitudes and positions that the American people hold on particular issues facing the country. It is often sharply divided on emotional issues such as affirmative action or gay rights. Opinion on a particular issue usually changes only gradually, if at all. For example, the distribution of opinion on abortion has hardly moved since the early 1970s. A president's approval rating usually goes up in time of crisis; George W. Bush's certainly did in the days and weeks after September 11, 2001. But that same measure declined dramatically as opposition to the war in Iraq grew during his second term.
In the rare case when public opinion shifts sharply on an issue, research shows that policy often follows suit. However, the public certainly does not always get its way on policies. Sometimes the reason is that certain groups in the populace are particularly committed and intense in their beliefs. A good example is gun control; a large majority of Americans want more of it, but those who oppose it feel much more strongly and are willing to work much harder to achieve their political goals. Another barrier to popular passions is the Supreme Court. For example, although a large majority of Americans prefers laws allowing prayer in schools or banning flag burning, even relatively conservative Supreme Courts have ruled that government would violate the constitutional rights of minorities if it created either policy.
Accurate measurement of public opinion through polls is a relatively recent phenomenon. George Gallup and Elmo Roper first developed statistical techniques for this purpose in the 1930s, but many refinements to their methods have been necessary. For example, Gallup had to change how interviewees were selected after predicting that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry Truman in 1948. Fortunately, polling organizations learn from experience.
Polling techniques
Television stations often ask viewers to call so that they may express an opinion for or against a particular policy. Newspapers and Internet sites also occasionally indulge in this form of entertainment. These gimmicks may be called "polls," but they are completely unscientific because respondents choose whether to participate, and the group that is motivated enough to do so will not represent everyone else in a community. A key element of scientific polling, by contrast, is the representative sample, which requires that every possible respondent has the same probability of participating. This is accomplished today by using computers to dial telephone numbers randomly and then picking which person in a household to interview using another random method.
Obviously, no poll is perfect. But if the pollster succeeds at generating a random sample, then between 1,200 and 1,500 people will give an accurate picture of national opinion. The level of accuracy is often called the margin of error and indicates how much answers will bounce around the truth from poll to poll. Some people wrongly assume that the margin must include the truth, so if a poll estimates that 54 percent of Americans oppose the licensing of gun owners, with a margin of 3 percentage points, they assume the truth must lie between 51 percent and 57 percent. This is not true, however. One time in 20 a poll will draw an unlucky sample, one that represents national opinion poorly, even if the pollster did everything right.
Avoiding bias
In addition to sampling errors, polls can be biased by the type of questions asked and the way the polls are conducted. Questions must be as neutral as possible to avoid skewed results. "Do you believe serial murderers should be executed?" gets a much different response from "Do you support capital punishment?" Interviewers must be careful not to inject their own views into the process by how they ask a question. A poll is also only as good as the respondents, and its validity clearly depends on their willingness to tell the truth about their positions.
Polls are an integral part of American politics. Besides the polling organizations, the news media routinely conduct and report the results of their own surveys. Pollsters also have high-profile positions on campaign and White House staffs. This concern for measuring public opinion indicates that public opinion is useful in understanding the positions of the American people and what policies they support.

The Institutions Americans Trust Most And Least
Confidence In Institutions
by
Jul 2, 2018
In this era of "fake news", trust is always being called into question, whether it's the content in the president's Twitter feed or the creepy notion that your Amazon Echo is listening in on your private conservations with sinister intentions. Even though "In God We Trust" is the official motto of the United States, distrust is rampant in 21st century America. When it comes to the nation's institutions which are bedrocks of the country, however, trust levels are remaining consistent.
Gallup recently polled U.S. adults about their confidence levels in 15 different societal institutions, finding only three had a majority-level of trust. Average confidence across the institutions has still remained consisent over the past three decades and all of them garner at least some trust. In 2018, the military remains the most trusted institution with 74 percent of Americans having some or quite a lot of confidence in it.
It comes as little surprise that small business is widely trusted given its importance to the community and it comes second with 67 percent. Even though the police has attracted criticism due to heavy-handed arrests and a spate of controversial shootings, it is the only other institution with majority trust at 54 percent. When it comes to the church and organized religion, trust levels stand at 38 percent while the presidency is close behind with 37 percent. Television news and Congress come last with just 20 and 11 percent trust among the public respectively.

Gallup’s Institutional Trust Poll | Ethics Alarms
Gallup’s Institutional Trust Poll
July 18, 2021 / Jack Marshall
Gallup has another of its yearly trust polls out, this one covering institutions. It should surprise no one that virtually every institution covered showed a decline in public trust. This is a long-term trend, and for a democracy, an existential threat that our leaders in all of those institutions have not been taking sufficiently seriously. The one surprise in the survey is that the only institution that showed a rise in public trust since last year: the police!
Here is the list:
I am thrilled to see trust in the public schools crashing. Most of the drops in trust levels are small enough to be shrugged off, although a 1% drop when you only had 12% trust to begin with—that’s Congress—could be significant. I suppose one could quibble that Gallup’s term, “confidence,” is different from “trust.” I don’t see the distinction: I don’t trust people and things I have no confidence in, and I have no confidence in those I can’t trust.
Now look at how the scores broke down by levels of “confidence” and over time. Since it’s a long way to the end, a couple of observations at the front (you will have more, I’m sure:
The Presidency trust levels are a yo-yo, and despite the assault on President Trump, he does not appear to have done the kind of damage to the institution that has been claimed by his critics.
Congress, on the other hand, has lost the trust of the public in two decades, the legacy of Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, Harry Reid, and various GOP Speakers like Hastert, Gingrich and Ryan.
The trust in newspapers is bolstered by public confidence in local papers, but TV news has also cratered, thanks to, well, all of the news networks.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's a document from Gallup about measuring public opinion on American institutions. It talks about how they conduct polls and measure confidence in various institutions like the military, public schools, and Congress. It seems like Gallup has been doing this for a long time, since 1973, and they track confidence levels in these institutions year over year.

Then, there's a piece from Morning Consult that's tracking trust in U.S. institutions on a weekly basis. They survey a large number of U.S. adults and look at how much trust people have in institutions like the U.S. government, Congress, the Supreme Court, and even Hollywood and the news media. It's interesting that they break it down by political affiliations, showing how trust varies between Democrats and Republicans.

Next, there's a Cliff's Notes explanation of public opinion and how it's measured. It explains that public opinion is about the attitudes and positions that people hold on particular issues, and that measuring it accurately through polls is important. It mentions that scientific polling involves random sampling to ensure that the sample represents the general population. It also points out that polls can be biased if the questions are leading or if respondents aren't truthful.

There's also a Statista chart that shows the institutions Americans trust the most and least, based on a Gallup poll. The military is at the top with 74% trust, followed by small business and the police. At the bottom are Congress and television news. This gives a visual representation of where public trust lies.

Lastly, there's a blog post from Ethics Alarms discussing a Gallup institutional trust poll. The author comments on the decline in trust across most institutions and expresses particular sentiments about trust in public schools and other institutions.

From these sources, it seems that public opinion about American institutions is primarily measured through polls and surveys conducted by organizations like Gallup and Morning Consult. These polls typically ask participants about their level of confidence or trust in various institutions, and the results are analyzed to understand public sentiment.

These polls are important because they provide insights into how the public perceives these institutions, which can influence policy decisions, public discourse, and even election outcomes. It's also interesting to see how trust levels can fluctuate over time and how different demographic groups may have varying levels of trust in the same institution.

One thing I notice is that the military consistently ranks high in trust, while Congress and the news media rank low. This suggests that certain institutions are more trusted than others, perhaps due to their perceived integrity, effectiveness, or responsiveness to public needs.

Moreover, the Cliff's Notes explanation highlights the importance of accurate measurement in polling. It's crucial that polls use random sampling and neutral questioning to avoid bias and ensure that the results are representative of the general population's opinions.

In conclusion, public opinion about American institutions is mainly measured through standardized polls and surveys conducted by reputable organizations. These measurements are vital for understanding societal attitudes and informing decisions in various sectors, including politics, media, and public policy.
