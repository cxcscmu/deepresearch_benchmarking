Alright, so I need to understand how fiscal policy works. I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I know that fiscal policy has something to do with government spending and taxes. Maybe I should look into what fiscal policy is and how it affects the economy.

First things first, I should probably define what fiscal policy is. From what I recall, fiscal policy refers to the government's decisions about taxing and spending. The government uses these tools to influence the economy, like controlling inflation, reducing unemployment, and promoting growth. But I need to make sure I have a solid grasp of the basics.

Maybe I should search for a reliable source that explains fiscal policy in simple terms. Let me try searching for "what is fiscal policy" to get a clear definition.

Deflation - if the price of goods and services are dropping, people start hoarding money, which limits the money supply and reduces prices even further. Eventually there is not enough money left to keep the economy going. This is a common problem of gold or gold-backed currencies in growing economies.

For example, if the government is trying to spur spending among consumers, it can decrease taxes. A cut in taxes provides families with extra money, which the government hopes they will turn around and spend on other goods and services, thus spurring the economy as a whole.

In economics and political science, fiscal policy is the use of government revenue collection (taxes or tax cuts) and expenditure to influence a country's economy. The use of government revenue expenditures to influence macroeconomic variables developed in reaction to the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the previous laissez-faire approach to economic management became unworkable. Fiscal policy is based on the theories of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose Keynesian economics theorized that government changes in the levels of taxation and government spending influence aggregate demand and the level of economic activity. Fiscal and monetary policy are the key strategies used by a country's government and central bank to advance its economic objectives. The combination of these policies enables these authorities to target inflation (which is considered "healthy" at the level in the range 2%–3%) and to increase employment. Additionally, it is designed to try to keep GDP growth at 2%–3% and the unemployment rate near the natural unemployment rate of 4%–5%. [1] This implies that fiscal policy is used to stabilize the economy over the course of the business cycle.[2]
Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can affect macroeconomic variables, including:
aggregate demand and the level of economic activity
saving and investment
income distribution
allocation of resources.
Fiscal policy can be distinguished from monetary policy, in that fiscal policy deals with taxation and government spending and is often administered by a government department; while monetary policy deals with the money supply, interest rates and is often administered by a country's central bank. Both fiscal and monetary policies influence a country's economic performance.

Monetary or fiscal policy?[edit]
Main article: Monetary/fiscal debate
Since the 1970s, it became clear that monetary policy performance has some benefits over fiscal policy due to the fact that it reduces political influence, as it is set by the central bank (to have an expanding economy before the general election, politicians might cut the interest rates). Additionally, fiscal policy can potentially have more supply-side effects on the economy: to reduce inflation, the measures of increasing taxes and lowering spending would not be preferred, so the government might be reluctant to use these. Monetary policy is generally quicker to implement as interest rates can be set every month, while the decision to increase government spending might take time to figure out which area the money should be spent on. [3]
The recession of the 2000s decade shows that monetary policy also has certain limitations. A liquidity trap occurs when interest rate cuts are insufficient as a demand booster as banks do not want to lend and the consumers are reluctant to increase spending due to negative expectations for the economy. Government spending is responsible for creating the demand in the economy and can provide a kick-start to get the economy out of the recession. When a deep recession takes place, it is not sufficient to rely just on monetary policy to restore the economic equilibrium. [3] Each side of these two policies has its differences, therefore, combining aspects of both policies to deal with economic problems has become a solution that is now used by the US. These policies have limited effects; however, fiscal policy seems to have a greater effect over the long-run period, while monetary policy tends to have a short-run success. [4]
In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the American Economic Association (AEA) found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement "Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement "Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided." [5] In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed. [6]
Stances[edit]
See also: Procyclical and countercyclical variables § Economic policy making
Depending on the state of the economy, fiscal policy may reach for different objectives: its focus can be to restrict economic growth by mediating inflation or, in turn, increase economic growth by decreasing taxes, encouraging spending on different projects that act as stimuli to economic growth and enabling borrowing and spending.
The three stances of fiscal policy are the following:
Neutral fiscal policy is usually undertaken when an economy is in neither a recession nor an expansion. The amount of government deficit spending (the excess not financed by tax revenue) is roughly the same as it has been on average over time, so no changes to it are occurring that would have an effect on the level of economic activity.
Expansionary fiscal policy is used by the government when trying to balance the contraction phase in the business cycle. It involves government spending exceeding tax revenue by more than it has tended to, and is usually undertaken during recessions. Examples of expansionary fiscal policy measures include increased government spending on public works (e.g., building schools) and providing the residents of the economy with tax cuts to increase their purchasing power (in order to fix a decrease in the demand).
Contractionary fiscal policy, on the other hand, is a measure to increase tax rates and decrease government spending. It occurs when government deficit spending is lower than usual. This has the potential to slow economic growth if inflation, which was caused by a significant increase in aggregate demand and the supply of money, is excessive. By reducing the economy's amount of aggregate income, the available amount for consumers to spend is also reduced. So, contractionary fiscal policy measures are employed when unsustainable growth takes place, leading to inflation, high prices of investment, recession and unemployment above the "healthy" level of 3%–4%.
However, these definitions can be misleading because, even with no changes in spending or tax laws at all, cyclic fluctuations of the economy cause cyclic fluctuations of tax revenues and of some types of government spending, altering the deficit situation; these are not considered to be policy changes. Therefore, for purposes of the above definitions, "government spending" and "tax revenue" are normally replaced by "cyclically adjusted government spending" and "cyclically adjusted tax revenue". Thus, for example, a government budget that is balanced over the course of the business cycle is considered to represent a neutral and effective fiscal policy stance.
Methods of fiscal policy funding[edit]
Governments spend money on a wide variety of things, from the military and police to services such as education and health care, as well as transfer payments such as welfare benefits. This expenditure can be funded in a number of different ways:
Taxation
Seigniorage, the benefit from printing money
Borrowing money from the population or from abroad
Dipping into fiscal reserves
Sale of fixed assets (e.g., land)
Selling equity to the population
Borrowing[edit]
A fiscal deficit is often funded by issuing bonds such as Treasury bills or and gilt-edged securities but can also be funded by issuing equity. Bonds pay interest, either for a fixed period or indefinitely that is funded by taxpayers as a whole.  Equity offers returns on investment (interest) that can only be realized in discharging a future tax liability by an individual taxpayer.  If available government revenue is insufficient to support the interest payments on bonds, a nation may default on its debts, usually to foreign creditors. Public debt or borrowing refers to the government borrowing from the public.  It is impossible for a government to "default" on its equity since the total returns available to all investors (taxpayers) are limited at any point by the total current year tax liability of all investors.
Dipping into prior surpluses[edit]
A fiscal surplus is often saved for future use, and may be invested in either local currency or any financial instrument that may be traded later once resources are needed and the additional debt is not needed.
Fiscal straitjacket[edit]
The concept of a fiscal straitjacket is a general economic principle that suggests strict constraints on government spending and public sector borrowing, to limit or regulate the budget deficit over a time period. Most US states have balanced budget rules that prevent them from running a deficit. The United States federal government technically has a legal cap on the total amount of money it can borrow, but it is not a meaningful constraint because the cap can be raised as easily as spending can be authorized, and the cap is almost always raised before the debt gets that high.

Governments use fiscal policy to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, so that certain economic goals can be achieved:
Price stability;
Full employment;
Economic growth.
The Keynesian view of economics suggests that increasing government spending and decreasing the rate of taxes are the best ways to have an influence on aggregate demand, stimulate it, while decreasing spending and increasing taxes after the economic expansion has already taken place. Additionally, Keynesians argue that expansionary fiscal policy should be used in times of recession or low economic activity as an essential tool for building the framework for strong economic growth and working towards full employment. In theory, the resulting deficits would be paid for by an expanded economy during the expansion that would follow; this was the reasoning behind the New Deal .
The IS curve shifts to the right, increasing real interest rates (r) and expansion in the "real" economy (real GDP, or Y).
The IS-LM model is another way of understanding the effects of fiscal expansion. As the government increases spending, there will be a shift in the IS curve up and to the right. In the short run, this increases the real interest rate, which then reduces private investment and increases aggregate demand, placing upward pressure on supply. To meet the short-run increase in aggregate demand, firms increase full-employment output. The increase in short-run price levels reduces the money supply, which shifts the LM curve back, and thus, returning the general equilibrium to the original full employment (FE) level. Therefore, the IS-LM model shows that there will be an overall increase in the price level and real interest rates in the long run due to fiscal expansion. [7]
Governments can use a budget surplus to do two things:
to slow the pace of strong economic growth;
to stabilize prices when inflation is too high.
Keynesian theory posits that removing spending from the economy will reduce levels of aggregate demand and contract the economy, thus stabilizing prices.
But economists still debate the effectiveness of fiscal stimulus. The argument mostly centers on crowding out: whether government borrowing leads to higher interest rates that may offset the stimulative impact of spending. When the government runs a budget deficit, funds will need to come from public borrowing (the issue of government bonds), overseas borrowing, or monetizing the debt. When governments fund a deficit with the issuing of government bonds, interest rates can increase across the market, because government borrowing creates higher demand for credit in the financial markets. This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services, either partially or entirely offsetting the direct expansionary impact of the deficit spending, thus diminishing or eliminating the achievement of the objective of a fiscal stimulus. Neoclassical economists generally emphasize crowding out while Keynesians argue that fiscal policy can still be effective, especially in a liquidity trap where, they argue, crowding out is minimal. [8]
In the classical view, expansionary fiscal policy also decreases net exports, which has a mitigating effect on national output and income. When government borrowing increases interest rates it attracts foreign capital from foreign investors. This is because, all other things being equal, the bonds issued from a country executing expansionary fiscal policy now offer a higher rate of return. In other words, companies wanting to finance projects must compete with their government for capital so they offer higher rates of return. To purchase bonds originating from a certain country, foreign investors must obtain that country's currency. Therefore, when foreign capital flows into the country undergoing fiscal expansion, demand for that country's currency increases. The increased demand, in turn, causes the currency to appreciate, reducing the cost of imports and making exports from that country more expensive to foreigners. Consequently, exports decrease and imports increase, reducing demand from net exports .
Some economists oppose the discretionary use of fiscal stimulus because of the inside lag (the time lag involved in implementing it), which is almost inevitably long because of the substantial legislative effort involved. Further, the outside lag between the time of implementation and the time that most of the effects of the stimulus are felt could mean that the stimulus hits an already-recovering economy and overheats the ensuing h rather than stimulating the economy when it needs it.
Some economists are concerned about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that would have otherwise been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have been unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to wage inflation and therefore price inflation .

Fiscal policy is part of the financial infrastructure that helps keep the economy running like a well-oiled machine. While the fiscal policy you’re most familiar with is probably the taxes that you pay on every paycheck or purchase, fiscal policy at its core is any legislative move the government makes to drive the economy.
What Is Fiscal Policy?
Fiscal policy is the legislative actions a government makes to regulate its economy to attain growth and alleviate poverty, usually through spending and taxation. Much of the theory around fiscal policy comes from the ideas of British economist John Maynard Keynes, and it can impact “macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, economic growth, total demand for goods and services and overall employment,” says Jason Steeno, president of CoreCap Advisors Investments in Southfield, Mich.
Though fiscal policy is a constant in each country’s economy, it is generally most visible in periods of major economic contraction. The Great Depression of 1929, the Great Recession of 2008-2009 and the Covid-19 recession are good examples of the U.S. federal government taking an aggressive stance on fiscal policy by injecting stimulus funds directly to the American people. In those periods, the government financed major jobs programs to keep Americans working and expanded unemployment benefits to protect potentially impoverished U.S. households.
“The primary goal of fiscal policy is to help the economy avoid operating at the extremes, such as in a recession or out-of-control economic growth, in a way, stabilizing the business cycle and regulating economic output,” Steeno notes.
Fiscal policy objectives may also include maintaining economic and price stability, optimizing employment, fueling economic development and providing capital when and where it is needed across a nation’s economy.
How Fiscal Policy Is Implemented
To meet fiscal policy goals, governments deploy two primary tools to maximize economic outcomes—collecting taxes and then spending them. These are generally enacted by elected officials and their appointees in legislative and executive branches of governments.
Taxes. By collecting tax revenues on individuals and businesses, via tax vehicles like capital gains and property taxes, among others, the federal government can steer financial assets to areas of the economy where they’re needed most. Those tax amounts are substantial. In 2020, the U.S. government collected $3.42 trillion in taxes. That amounts to $108,000 collected in taxes every second.
Government spending. When a nation collects taxes, it has the financial means to establish fiscal policy. Federal tax dollars are spent on nationwide needs like infrastructure, defense, public works, government employment, subsidies and public health, research and welfare programs.
The financial figures tied to government spending are huge. In 2020, the U.S. government spent $6.55 trillion. That spending amount accounts for 31% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which stood at $21.0 trillion in 2020.
By spending trillions annually, the government aims to pour more cash back into the U.S. economy and to boost demand for private sector products and services.
Expansionary Fiscal Policy and Contractionary Fiscal Policy
Depending on its intent, fiscal policy can be classified one of two main ways: expansionary fiscal policy or contractionary fiscal policy.
Expansionary fiscal policy is meant to help the economy grow, recover or generally expand, such as after a large economic dip or crash. This might include lowering taxes to give consumers more money to spend or increasing government spending on projects that will help stimulate the economy, like programs that aid people and businesses at risk of poverty or failure. Recent examples of this include the Covid-19 stimulus packages and the Paycheck Protection Program.
In contrast, contractionary fiscal policy aims to help cool off periods of too rapid growth that might pose a threat to a steady economic growth rate. (For context, experts generally consider a healthy growth rate about 2% to 3%.) Though it might not seem bad for there to be too much economic growth, it can lead to runaway inflation, asset bubbles and uber-low unemployment levels that leave businesses unable to find enough employees. All of these combined can set the stage for a recession or economic collapse. To prevent this, the government might raise taxes to discourage business and consumer spending or taper off on government spending programs to temporarily suppress the economy and get it back to a stable growth level.
Fiscal vs. Monetary Policy
When it comes to running the economy, countries generally have two main options: fiscal policy and monetary policy. At face value, these might sound identical, but they’re actually quite different, though they often work in tandem to keep the economy stable.
The primary difference between fiscal policy and monetary policy is who’s calling the shots.
Fiscal policy. With fiscal policy, the U.S. government, via the executive and legislative bodies, shapes large economic decisions. The federal government relies on taxes and government spending as its primary tools.
Monetary policy. Monetary policy stems from central banks, like the Federal Reserve, which have a measure of independence and operate outside the realm of the federal government. Key monetary policy tools include adjusting a nation’s money supply  by buying back government debt and changing interest rates.
The Bottom Line
No doubt, fiscal policy can have a substantial impact on the financial fortunes of all Americans over the long haul—but average consumers have more economic power than they may think.
“While the government will do what it deems necessary to help our economy, and there are varied and conflicting opinions on how much the government should do, what’s most important is that individuals monitor their finances to be smart about their own spending and savings plans,” says John Bergquist, managing member of Lift Financial, in South Jordan, Utah. “This way, your family’s economy won’t be tossed to and from by the whims of what’s happening at the federal government level.”

F iscal policy is the use of the government budget to affect an economy. When the government decides on the taxes that it collects, the transfer payments it gives out, or the goods and services that it purchases, it is engaging in fiscal policy. The primary economic impact of any change in the government budget is felt by particular groups—a tax cut for families with children, for example, raises the disposable income of such families. Discussions of fiscal policy, however, usually focus on the effect of changes in the government budget on the overall economy—on such macroeconomic variables as GNP and unemployment and inflation.
The state of fiscal policy is usually summarized by looking at the difference between what the government pays out and what it takes in—that is, the government deficit. Fiscal policy is said to be tight or contractionary when revenue is higher than spending (the government budget is in surplus) and loose or expansionary when spending is higher than revenue (the budget is in deficit). Often the focus is not on the level of the deficit, but on the change in the deficit. Thus, a reduction of the deficit from $200 billion to $100 billion is said to be contractionary fiscal policy, even though the budget is still in deficit.
The most immediate impact of fiscal policy is to change the aggregate demand for goods and services. A fiscal expansion, for example, raises aggregate demand through one of two channels. First, if the government increases purchases but keeps taxes the same, it increases demand directly. Second, if the government cuts taxes or increases transfer payments, people's disposable income rises, and they will spend more on consumption. This rise in consumption will, in turn, raise aggregate demand.
Fiscal policy also changes the composition of aggregate demand. When the government runs a deficit, it meets some of its expenses by issuing bonds. In doing so, it competes with private borrowers for money lent by savers, raising interest rates and "crowding out" some private investment. Thus, expansionary fiscal policy reduces the fraction of output that is used for private investment.
In an open economy, fiscal policy also affects the exchange rate and the trade balance. In the case of a fiscal expansion, the rise in interest rates due to government borrowing attracts foreign capital. Foreigners bid up the price of the dollar in order to get more of them to invest, causing an exchange rate appreciation. This appreciation makes imported goods cheaper in the United States and exports more expensive abroad, leading to a decline of the trade balance. Foreigners sell more to the country than they buy from it, and in return acquire ownership of assets in the country. This effect of fiscal policy was central to discussions of the "twin deficits" (budget and trade) of the eighties.
Fiscal policy is an important tool for managing the economy because of its ability to affect the total amount of output produced—that is, gross domestic product. The first impact of a fiscal expansion is to raise the demand for goods and services. This greater demand leads to increases in both output and prices. The degree to which higher demand increases output and prices depends, in turn, on the state of the business cycle. If the economy is in recession, with unused productive capacity and unemployed workers, then increases in demand will lead mostly to more output without changing the price level. If the economy is at full employment, by contrast, a fiscal expansion will have more effect on prices and less impact on total output.
This ability of fiscal policy to affect output by affecting aggregate demand makes it a potential tool for economic stabilization. In a recession the government can run an expansionary fiscal policy, thus helping to restore output to its normal level and to put unemployed workers back to work. During a boom, when inflation is perceived to be a greater problem than unemployment, the government can run a budget surplus, helping to slow down the economy. Such a countercyclical policy would lead to a budget that was balanced on average.
One form of countercyclical fiscal policy is known as automatic stabilizers. These are programs that automatically expand fiscal policy during recessions and contract it during booms. Unemployment insurance, on which the government spends more during recessions (when the unemployment rate is high), is an example of an automatic stabilizer. Unemployment insurance serves this function even if the federal government does not extend the duration of benefits. Similarly, because taxes are roughly proportional to wages and profits, the amount of taxes collected is higher during a boom than during a recession. Thus, the tax code also acts as an automatic stabilizer.
But fiscal policy need not be automatic in order to play a stabilizing role in business cycles. Some economists recommend changes in fiscal policy in response to economic conditions—so-called discretionary fiscal policy—as a way to moderate business cycle swings. These suggestions are most frequently heard during recessions, when there are calls for tax cuts or new spending programs to "get the economy going again."
Unfortunately, discretionary fiscal policy is rarely able to deliver on its promise. Fiscal policy is especially difficult to use for stabilization because of the "inside lag"—the gap between the time when the need for fiscal policy arises and when it is implemented by the president and Congress. The tax cut proposed by President Kennedy to stimulate the economy in 1962, for example, was not enacted until 1964. If economists forecast well, then the lag would not matter. They could tell Congress in advance what the appropriate fiscal policy is. But economists do not forecast well. Most economists, for example, badly underpredicted both the rise in unemployment in 1981 and the strength of the recovery that began in late 1982. Absent accurate forecasts, attempts to use discretionary fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations are as likely to do harm as good.
The case for using discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize business cycles is further weakened by the fact that another tool, monetary policy, is far more agile than fiscal policy. Even here, though, many economists argue that monetary policy is too prone to lags to be effective, and that the best countercyclical policy is to leave well enough alone.
Whether for good or for ill, fiscal policy's ability to affect the level of output via aggregate demand wears off over time. Higher aggregate demand due to a fiscal stimulus, for example, eventually shows up only in higher prices and does not increase output at all. That is because over the long run the level of output is determined not by demand, but by the supply of factors of production (capital, labor, and technology). These factors of production determine a "natural rate" of output, around which business cycles and macroeconomic policies can cause only temporary fluctuations. An attempt to keep output above its natural rate by means of aggregate demand policies will lead only to ever-accelerating inflation.
The fact that output returns to its natural rate in the long run is not the end of the story, however. In addition to moving output in the short run, fiscal policy can change the natural rate, and ironically, the long-run effects of fiscal policy tend to be the opposite of the short-run effects. Expansionary fiscal policy will lead to higher output today but will lower the natural rate of output below what it would have been in the future. Similarly, contractionary fiscal policy, though dampening the level of output in the short run, will lead to higher output in the future.
Fiscal policy affects the level of output in the long run because it affects the country's saving rate. The country's total saving is composed of two parts—private saving (by individuals and corporations) and government saving (which is the same as the budget surplus). A fiscal expansion entails a decrease in government saving. Lower saving means, in turn, that the country will either invest less in new plant and equipment or increase the amount that it borrows from abroad, both of which lead to unpleasant consequences in the long term. Lower investment will lead to a lower capital stock and to a reduction in a country's ability to produce output in the future. Increased indebtedness to foreigners means that a higher fraction of a country's output will have to be sent abroad in the future rather than being consumed at home.
Fiscal policy also changes the burden of future taxes. When the government runs an expansionary fiscal policy, it adds to its stock of debt. Because the government will have to pay interest on this debt (or repay it) in future years, expansionary fiscal policy today imposes an additional burden on future taxpayers. Just as taxes can be used to redistribute income between different classes, the government can run surpluses or deficits in order to redistribute income between different generations.
Some economists have argued that this effect of fiscal policy on future taxes will lead consumers to change their saving. Recognizing that a tax cut today means higher taxes in the future, the argument goes, people will simply save the value of the tax cut they receive now in order to pay those future taxes. The extreme of this argument, known as Ricardian Equivalence, holds that tax cuts will have no effect on national saving, since changes in private saving will offset changes in government saving. But if consumers decide to spend some of the extra disposable income they receive from a tax cut (because they are myopic about future tax payments, for example), then Ricardian Equivalence will not hold; a tax cut will lower national saving and raise aggregate demand. The experience of the eighties, when private saving fell rather than rose in response to tax cuts, is evidence against Ricardian Equivalence.
In addition to its effect on aggregate demand and on saving, fiscal policy also affects the economy by changing incentives. Taxing an activity tends to discourage that activity. A high marginal tax rate on income reduces people's incentive to earn income. By reducing the level of taxation, or even by keeping the level the same but reducing marginal tax rates and reducing allowed deductions, the government can increase output. The "supply-side" economists who were prominent early in the Reagan administration argued that reductions in tax rates would have a large effect on the amount of labor supplied, and thus on output. Incentive effects of taxes also play a role on the demand side. Policies such as the investment tax credit, for example, can greatly influence the demand for capital goods.
The greatest obstacle to proper use of fiscal policy—both for its ability to stabilize fluctuations in the short run and for its long-run effect on the natural rate of output—is that changes in fiscal policy are necessarily bundled with other changes that please or displease various constituencies. A road in Congressman X's district is all the more likely to be built if it can be packaged as part of countercyclical fiscal policy. The same is true for a tax cut for some favored constituency. This naturally leads to an institutional enthusiasm for expansionary policies during recessions that is not matched by a taste for contractionary policies during booms. In addition, the benefits from such a policy are felt immediately, whereas its costs—higher future taxes and lower economic growth—are postponed until a later date. The problem of making good fiscal policy in the face of such obstacles is, in the final analysis, not economic, but political.

What is fiscal policy? Definition and meaning
Fiscal policy is the use of public spending and taxation to impact the economy. Public spending means government spending. National governments use fiscal policy to encourage strong and **sustainable growth. In other words, to achieve full employment and reduce poverty.
** Sustainable growth is growth that can continue over the long-term. In other words, no serious problems that can damage the economy will emerge.
The aims of fiscal policy have gained prominence since the 2007 global financial crisis. Governments stepped in to support financial systems, stimulate growth, and minimize the impact of the crisis on vulnerable groups.
The prominence of fiscal policy as a policy tool historically has fluctuated. Up to 1929, a laissez-faire approach – minimal government intervention – dominated North America’s and Western Europe’s economic scene.
The adjective ‘ fiscal ‘ refers to anything to do with government taxes, spending, and debts. A ‘fiscal problem,’ therefore, is a ‘government finance problem.’
People who believe that fiscal policies are crucial for economic regulation are ‘ fiscalists ‘.
Fiscal stimulus
Governments can try to boost the economy by either increasing public spending or reducing taxes. These two measures come under the umbrella term ‘fiscal stimulus.’
When all is fine, the government will likely adopt a neutral fiscal policy. During a recession, however, it will probably prefer an expansionary fiscal policy. When the economy is overheating, it will adopt a contractionary policy.
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression dramatically changed how leaders and governments intervened in their nations’ economies. In fact, in the United States and the United Kingdom, the change was dramatic.
In the 1930s, policymakers pushed for governments to do more to kick-start the economy.
During the 1980s, governments across the world scaled back the size and function of governments. In that decade, markets started taking on an enhanced role in the allocation of goods and services.
Since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, a more fiscal policy was back in fashion. In other words, government intervention returned.
How does fiscal policy work?
When politicians influence the economy, they have two main tools at their disposal; fiscal policy and monetary policy.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is the main focus of a nation’s central bank. It involves regulating interest rates, i.e., effectively regulating the cost of borrowing, and the money supply.
The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and other central banks manage monetary policy. They do so to control inflation and stabilize their currency.
Put simply; they use monetary policy to ensure that the economy is following the right path.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy refers to government spending policies that impact macroeconomic conditions. Governments carry out policy through public spending. Government borrowing and the collection of taxes also form part of fiscal policies.
Through fiscal policy, governments attempt to bring down unemployment, stabilize business cycles, and influence interest rates. Additionally, in times of recession, they adjust their policy to kick-start the economy.
By boosting public spending and reducing taxes, aggregate demand will increase, and the economy will grow, Keynesian economists believe.
Fiscal policy changed considerably when John Maynard Keynes, (1883-1946), an English economist, came onto the scene. He fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments.
Keynes believed that the government could change economic performance by adjusting tax rates and government spending. His ideas are the basis for the school of thought we call Keynesian Economics.
According to Keynes, when the government alters the levels of taxation and government spending, it influences aggregate demand. This subsequently changes the level of economic activity.
Keynes said we could use fiscal policy to stabilize the economy over the course of the business cycle. Put simply; he believed it could prevent the undesirable boom-and-bust economic cycle.
Instruments of fiscal policy
The two main instruments of fiscal policy are:
First, changes in the level and composition of taxation,
Second, changes in government spending.
These two policy instruments can affect the following variables in an economy:
Aggregate demand and economic activity levels.
The distribution of income.
Savings and investment in the economy.
According to the International Monetary Fund:
“Governments directly and indirectly influence the way resources are used in the economy. The basic equation of national income accounting helps show how this happens: GDP = C + I + G + NX.”
John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge, England, in 1883. He died in Firle, Sussex, England, in 1946. (Image: leftfootforward.org)
Fiscal policy stances
There are three main stances of fiscal policy – neutral, expansionary, and contractionary.
Neutral Fiscal Policy
Governments follow this policy when the nation’s economy is in equilibrium. In other words, tax revenue completely funds government spending.
Governments also adopt this policy when the budget outcome has a neutral effect on economic activity levels.
Expansionary Fiscal Policy
This is when the government spends more than it collects from taxation. Governments adopt this approach when the economy is in recession. We also call it a reflationary fiscal policy.
Contractionary Fiscal Policy
Governments take this approach when their expenditure is lower than their tax revenue. They aim to pay off government debt.
Even if spending or tax laws stay the same, cyclic fluctuations in the economy may cause tax revenues to go up or down.
This will subsequently affect some types of government spending, which in turn can alter the deficit situation. We do not consider these factors to be policy changes.
We use the terms ‘expansionary’ and ‘contractory’ in both monetary and fiscal policies with the same meanings.
How to fund fiscal policy
Government expenditure can be funded in several different ways:
Taxation.
The benefit from printing money (Seigniorage).
Borrowing money by issuing securities, government bonds, and bills. Less creditworthy nations might borrow directly from the World Bank or other international financial institutions.
Consumption of fiscal reserves, i.e., dipping into its savings.
Selling assets, such as land or floating government-owned companies. Left-leaning parties often refer to this as ‘selling the family silver.’
Keynesian economics suggests that greater government spending, accompanied by lower tax rates, are the best ways to boost aggregate demand.
When the economic boom starts, we must subsequently reduce spending and raise taxes.
Keynesian economists say we should use this approach when there is low economic activity. We can also use it during a recession. The aim is to achieve full employment and build the framework for strong economic growth, they say.
In theory, the resulting debt build-up would be paid for when the economy expands and government income increases.
Republicans in the USA and Conservatives in the UK dislike Keynesian policies. They say that all they achieve are high debts plus no growth.
Keynesian policies go against right-of-center parties’ policies of discouraging government interference in the economy.
According to lexicon.ft.com, fiscal policy is:
“A government’s policy regarding taxation and public spending.”
There is a method to determine whether current fiscal policies might overburden future generations of taxpayers. We call it generational accounting.
Fiscal drag
Sometimes, fiscal policy may be deflationary unintentionally, as occurs with ‘ fiscal drag .’
Fiscal drag occurs when earnings growth and rising prices push more earners into higher tax brackets. This happens in a progressive tax system.
If their tax burdens are greater, their spending declines, i.e., there is fiscal drag.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered that fiscal policy is primarily about how the government uses its spending and taxation to influence the economy. It seems like it's a tool to manage things like unemployment, inflation, and overall economic growth.

So, to break it down, fiscal policy involves two main levers: government spending and taxation. When the government spends more or cuts taxes, it's trying to stimulate the economy, which is called expansionary fiscal policy. Conversely, when it spends less or increases taxes, it's trying to cool down the economy, which is contractionary fiscal policy.

I remember during the 2008 financial crisis, there was a lot of talk about fiscal stimulus packages. That must be an example of expansionary fiscal policy, where the government pumped money into the economy to counteract the recession.

But I also recall that some people were against this, arguing that it would lead to too much debt. So, there seems to be a trade-off between stimulating the economy in the short term and managing debt levels in the long term.

Moreover, I see that fiscal policy is different from monetary policy, which is managed by the central bank and involves tools like interest rates and money supply. It seems like both policies can influence the economy, but through different mechanisms.

I think another important aspect is that fiscal policy can affect different sectors of the economy differently. For example, government spending on infrastructure might benefit construction companies and create jobs in that sector, while tax cuts for lower-income families might increase consumer spending more broadly.

Also, there's mention of something called Ricardian equivalence, which suggests that people might save more in response to tax cuts, anticipating future tax increases to pay off the debt. If that's the case, then tax cuts might not stimulate the economy as much as intended.

I need to think about how all these pieces fit together. So, if the government wants to stimulate the economy during a recession, it can increase spending or cut taxes. This should, in theory, increase aggregate demand and help pull the economy out of the downturn.

However, if the government runs large deficits for extended periods, it could lead to higher national debt, which might have negative consequences in the future, like higher interest payments or reduced flexibility in responding to future crises.

Additionally, fiscal policy can have distributional effects, meaning it can affect different groups in society differently. For instance, certain tax cuts might benefit the wealthy more than the poor, or government spending on social programs can help alleviate poverty.

I also noticed that fiscal policy can influence the exchange rate and trade balance, especially in open economies. For example, a fiscal expansion might lead to higher interest rates, attracting foreign capital and causing the currency to appreciate, which could make exports less competitive.

Given all these complexities, it seems like implementing effective fiscal policy requires careful consideration of various factors and potential trade-offs.

Maybe I should look into some historical examples to better understand how fiscal policy has been used in practice and what outcomes it has produced.

I recall that during the Great Depression in the 1930s, fiscal policy became more prominent as a tool for economic management, following the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. Before that, there was more of a laissez-faire approach, where the government干预较少。

另外，20世纪80年代，很多国家减少了政府的规模和作用，市场在资源配置中的作用增强。但2007-2008年的全球金融危机后，财政政策再次成为焦点，政府介入以支持金融体系，刺激经济增长，并减轻危机对弱势群体的影响。

看来财政政策的重要性随时间波动，取决于经济状况和主导的经济思想。

也许我应该更深入地理解财政政策如何影响宏观经济变量，比如国内生产总值（GDP）、就业和通货膨胀。

首先，政府支出直接增加总需求，因为政府购买商品和服务。其次，减税可以增加个人和企业的可支配收入，鼓励消费和投资，从而间接增加总需求。

但是，如果经济已经接近满负荷运行，额外的需求可能会导致通货膨胀，而不是增加产出。因此，财政政策的效果可能取决于经济周期所处的阶段。

在衰退期间，资源未充分利用，财政刺激可以有效地增加产出和就业。而在经济过热时，同样的政策可能会加剧通胀。

此外，财政政策还会影响私人部门的投资。当政府借款增加时，可能会与私人借款人竞争资金，导致利率上升，这被称为“挤出效应”。高利率可能抑制私人投资，抵消财政刺激的部分效果。

另一方面，通过投资于基础设施、教育和研发等长期项目，财政政策也可以促进经济的潜在增长能力。

而且，财政政策可以用于自动稳定器的功能。例如，失业保险在经济衰退时自动增加支出，帮助稳定需求，而税收系统可以根据收入自动调整，经济好时税收增加，经济差时税收减少。

尽管自动稳定器可以在一定程度上缓解经济波动，但有时政府也会采取积极的、有针对性的财政措施来应对特定的经济挑战。

然而，实施积极的财政政策存在一些实际困难。比如，政策的时滞问题，从认识到需要采取行动，到制定政策，再到政策产生实际影响，可能需要一段时间。在这段时间里，经济状况可能已经发生变化。

此外，政治因素也会影响财政政策的制定和执行。政客们可能出于选举考虑，采取短期行为，而不是从长远角度考虑经济健康。

与货币政策相比，财政政策的决策过程通常更加缓慢和复杂，因为它涉及立法机构的批准。中央银行可以相对迅速地调整利率，而财政政策的变化则需要更长时间。

不过，近年来，一些经济学家和政策制定者提倡采用更灵活和前瞻性的财政政策框架，以更好地应对经济挑战。

总之，财政政策是政府管理经济的一种重要工具，通过调整支出和税收来影响总需求和经济表现。它的有效性和适当性取决于多种因素，包括经济环境、政策设计、实施时机以及与其他政策工具的协调。

为了更全面地理解财政政策，我可能需要进一步研究相关的经济学理论，如凯恩斯主义经济学，以及考察实际案例，看看财政政策在不同情况下的应用及其结果。

或许我可以查找一些关于美国或其他国家在不同时期实施财政政策的例子，分析它们的目标、执行方式和最终效果。

此外，了解财政政策与货币政策之间的相互作用也很重要，因为两者共同影响着整体经济状况。

可能我还需要关注财政可持续性的问题，即政府如何在追求短期经济目标的同时，确保其债务水平不会变得不可持续。

总之，财政政策是一个复杂的领域，涉及到许多相互关联的概念和现实世界的考量。通过进一步的研究和思考，我相信我能更清楚地理解它的工作原理及其对经济的影响。
