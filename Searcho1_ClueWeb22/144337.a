Alright, so I need to list the pros and cons of gun ownership. This is a pretty sensitive topic, and it's important to approach it objectively. I don't have personal experience with guns, so I'll need to do some research to get accurate information.

First, I should probably define what gun ownership means. It refers to people having legal possession of firearms for various purposes like self-defense, hunting, sport shooting, etc. Now, to look at the pros and cons, I need to consider the benefits and drawbacks associated with individuals owning guns.

Let me start with the pros.

One of the main arguments in favor of gun ownership is the right to self-defense. Many people feel that having a gun gives them a sense of security and the ability to protect themselves and their families from potential threats. I remember hearing about the Second Amendment in the U.S., which guarantees the right to bear arms. So, for many Americans, gun ownership is not just about protection but also about upholding their constitutional rights.

Another pro is hunting. In many countries, including the U.S., hunting is a traditional activity for food and sport. Gun owners often argue that responsible gun use for hunting is an important part of cultural heritage and helps in wildlife management.

Additionally, gun ownership can be seen as a form of recreation. Shooting sports and target practice are activities that many people enjoy. Competitions and clubs dedicated to these activities exist worldwide.

Now, moving on to the cons.

One major con is the risk of gun violence and accidents. There are statistics showing that countries with higher rates of gun ownership also tend to have higher rates of gun-related deaths and injuries. This includes not only homicides but also suicides and accidental shootings. I need to verify this with some data.

Another concern is the potential for guns to fall into the wrong hands, such as criminals or unstable individuals. If someone with malicious intent has access to a gun, it can lead to serious harm. There have been numerous mass shooting incidents in the U.S. that highlight this issue.

Furthermore, there's the argument that having a gun doesn't necessarily make one safer. Some studies suggest that the presence of a gun in the home increases the likelihood of injury or death, either through accidents, suicide, or homicide by a family member or acquaintance.

I also need to consider the regulatory aspects. Proper licensing and background checks are essential to ensure that guns are only in the hands of responsible individuals. However, even with regulations, there are still loopholes that can be exploited.

Moreover, the availability of guns can escalate conflicts. In situations where arguments turn physical, the presence of a gun can turn a fight into a fatal incident much more easily than other forms of assault.

I should also think about the mental health aspect. Access to guns may make it easier for individuals with mental health issues to act on harmful impulses.

On the other side, proponents of gun control argue that stricter laws and regulations can reduce gun violence. For example, countries with tighter gun control laws generally have lower rates of gun-related deaths.

But opponents argue that gun control doesn't address the root causes of violence and that law-abiding citizens should have the right to protect themselves.

I need to look up some facts and figures to support these points. Maybe start by searching for statistics on gun ownership and gun violence.

Gun ownership and gun violence in America, by the numbers
February 15, 2018 / 12:23 PM / CBS News
Wednesday's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida claimed 17 lives and injured more than a dozen others. It was not the first mass shooting - or even the first shooting at a school - in 2018. Below are some statistics on gun ownership and gun violence in America.
357 Million
That was the number of guns in the United States in 2013, according to a Washington Post review of data from the Congressional Research Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. At the time that figure was determined, there were only 317 million people living in the United States – meaning the country had roughly 40 million more firearms than residents.
3 percent
That's the percentage of people who own over half of the nation's guns, according to survey data compiled by researchers at Harvard University and Northwestern University.
400,000
That's the number of firearms stolen every year, according to the same Harvard/Northwestern survey data.
Over 3 million
That's the number of times federal, state, or local background checks have denied a gun to person prohibited from owning one, according to a Department of Justice study published in 2016.
18
That's the number of times a weapon has been fired on school grounds in 2018, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that favors stricter regulations on guns.
In eight of the incidents, a gun was fired but no one was injured.
Two of the incidents were suicides.
Of the other eight, three happened in Texas, two in California, two in Michigan, and one happened in Florida (Wednesday's shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland.)
Over 150,000
That's the number of students attending primary or secondary schools in the U.S. who have experienced a shooting on their campus, starting with the 1997 shooting at Columbine High School. The figure comes from the Washington Post, which analyzed "online archives, state and federal enrollment figures, and news stories." The Post notes that at least 170 such schools have been affected.
30
That's the number of mass shootings that have occurred thus far in 2018, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a website that aggregates data "from over 2,500 media, law enforcement, government and commercial sources."
1,827
That's the number of deaths that have occurred in 2018 as a result of shootings, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
11,564
That's the average number of Americans murdered every year by gun violence, according to The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control organization. The number was obtained, according to the group, by averaging "the most recent five years of complete data from death certificates (2011-2015) and estimates of emergency room admissions (2010-2014) available via CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System.
114,994
That's the average number of Americans annually "shot in murders, assaults, suicides & suicide attempts, unintentional shootings, or by police intervention," according to the Brady Campaign.

19 Amazing Gun Violence Statistics [2022 Update]
19 Amazing Gun Violence Statistics [2022 Update]
Branka Vuleta
January 04, 2021
The topics of guns and violence have always gone hand in hand, especially in the eyes of mainstream media. Ask a hundred random people about what they think regarding the degree of correlation between guns and violence, and you’ll no doubt get a resounding “high” as your answer.
Now:
Gun violence statistics have traditionally been a mixed bag of extreme opinions. From pro-gun lobbyists to anti-gun lobbyists, there has been little in the way of a balanced argument. This is where the information you will find here differs from most of the sources on the internet. By employing a non-biased approach, we will provide you with facts and information from which you can be empowered and fully informed.
The things is:
Simply labeling gun violence as “bad” or as being on the increase is neither good enough nor logical, as these are simply sweeping statements that mean nothing when examined.
After all, let’s also not forget:
Gun shooting statistics clearly show that guns can be used as defensive or deterrent tools and measures, keeping the peace instead of disturbing it.
Most of what we know about guns comes from either what we see in the movies or what the media chooses to tell us. Having movies and the media as your primary source of gun violence facts is definitely not a good roadmap for anyone looking for revealing and unbiased facts.
With all that said, let’s dive right in.
Fascinating Gun Violence Stats (Editor’s Choice)
418 mass shootings took place in the US last year.
Gun violence severity in high school shootings has increased by over 50%.
Police officers are 75% more likely to be victims of gun violence in high gun ownership states than in low gun ownership states
Over 500,000 bump stocks may be in US civilian hands.
82 mass shootings that took place on US soil between 1982 and December 2019 involved guns that were legally obtained.
Gun Crime Statistics under the Microscope
1. 39,383 people died as a result of gun violence in 2019.
This figure comes from the FBI gun violence statistics and information from the Gun Violence Archive. As staggering as it is, it only tells part of the story when it comes to gun violence facts. This is because although it includes the number of the 24,090 of gun-related suicides, featured in full in gun suicide statistics, it doesn’t incorporate the 29,765 additional injuries related to firearms.
This is due to the fact that most gun deaths statistics only take into account primary deaths related to guns (deaths that occurred within a week of the gun-related injury).
2. In 2019 alone, there were 36 shootings at K-12 schools.
Statistics on gun violence in the US highlight the fact that shooting incidents at K-12 schools are a major concern. Gun crime statistics from 1970 to 2019 show a small but worryingly steady increase in K-12 school shootings, with 2018 topping off a staggering amount of 97 shootings.
Although the figure has dropped significantly in 2019 to 36 shootings, the overall data over the last decade shows a steady rise in shootings.
Which leads to the fact that...
3. Most American children are just as likely to be killed by a gunshot as they are by cancer.
According to some of the most shocking gun violence stats, most children in the US are in danger of being a victim of gun crime. In fact, firearm-related injury is the second most common cause of death for children, accounting for 15% of all child deaths.
4. Police officers are 75% more likely to be victims of gun violence in high gun ownership states when compared to low gun ownership states.
US gun violence statistics against police officers conducted over the last decade show that the likelihood of officers being shot in high gun ownership states rested around the 75% mark, something that represents firearms statistics. Unsurprisingly, large numbers of guns in an area were shown to directly correlate with the increased risk of officers being shot.
Mass Shooting Statistics
5. 418 mass shootings took place in the US last year.
Although this figure is high, it does show a decrease of 5% within the United States gun violence statistics. This encouraging trend has been attributed to the gun control legislation support that has been garnished by students of Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida.
The students launched a deluge of campaigns following the Parkland shooting incident that took place on their school grounds. As a result, they were able to gain the support of the media and the public, which effectively led to the government introducing more stringent gun control laws, something that has gone a long way towards bringing down American gun violence statistics.
6. Gun violence severity in high school shootings has increased by over 50%.
According to gun violence statistics FBI, some of the deadliest mass shooting incidents in the US in recent years have taken place at high schools.
Statistics on gun violence show that in addition to the Parkland shooting incident, 10 students were killed and 14 were wounded in the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas. And in Kentucky, Marshall County High School saw 2 students killed and 16 wounded. These figures from 2018 and are 54% higher than those seen 5 years previous in 2013.
7. Over 500,000 bump stocks may be in US civilian hands.
Statistics of gun violence reflect that the sales of items called bump stocks -- devices which can be attached to semi-automatic weapons to increase their fire rate -- have led to the devices being in the hands of nearly half a million US citizens. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) estimates a total of 539,000 bump stocks to still be in civilian circulation.
The issue being:
The federal government banned the sale of bump stock devices in December 2018. But prior to that, thousands of the bump stocks were being sold to the public, and some were even bought in bulk.
Unintentional Shootings
8. 82 mass shootings that took place on US soil between 1982 and December 2019 involved guns that were legally obtained.
Gun control stats show a recurring and prevalent pattern that shows the vast majority of shootings have been carried out with illegally obtained firearms.
And gun control facts clearly show gun registration and background checks are woefully inadequate and largely at fault.
Child gun violence statistics clearly reflect that 82  shootings in the US since the early 1980s involved legally owned guns, while only 16 involved guns that were illegally obtained.
9. Every day, 90 people are unintentionally shot in the US.
The number of unintentional shootings is on the rise. Current data and CDC gun violence statistics show that in 2019, approximately 90 people were unintentionally shot in the US on a daily basis. Although gun violence statistics worldwide highlight are growing, the US overtakes this rate of growth by almost 2.5%. Analysts and experts attribute this to lax laws on firearm purchase and possession. In addition, more guns are also finding themselves in the hands of minors or inexperienced owners.
10. On an average day in the US, only one person is killed by legal intervention.
World gun violence statistics point to a disturbing fact that amidst the large number of gun-related deaths that take place in the US on a daily basis, only one of these is due to legal intervention.
11. Every 16 hours, someone in the US is killed by an unintentional shooting.
The gun violence rates for gun crime and accidental death are on the rise and are under current scrutiny from many different watchdog organizations. But what isn’t always factored into most statistical analysis and gun death statistics is the number of unintentional shootings that occur.
Shockingly...
The latest data reflects that at least one person will die in the US as a result of an accidental shooting every 16 hours.
12. One in three children in the US lives in a household that stores a loaded and unlocked firearm.
Alarming gun control statistics show more children are exposed to the dangers of accidental shootings or have access to firearms that can prove as a convenient yet devastating outlet for any troubled young individual. Figures reflecting gun violence statistics by state show an increase in this problem, and no sign of decline.
Gun Death Statistics
13. Over 36,000 people are killed in the US every year.
The US has become a country where guns are have become judge, jury, and executioner. Gun statistics show that over 36,000 Americans lose their lives every year due to gun crime.
Which means:
Approximately 100 lives are lost to gun violence daily on American soil.
Did you know...
14. The majority of gun crime deaths (61%) are the result of suicide.
The growth of suicide by gun statistics shows a sad picture as to the state of affairs between Americans and firearms and our inadequate approach to mental health and wellbeing.
15. 2549 of gun-related deaths are due to unintentional shootings.
Gun violence in America statistics reflect that the number of unintentional shootings has been rising for the last ten years. With laws only recently seeing a tightening, the last decade has given birth to a slew of gun-related crimes due to protocols and measures for background checks and monitoring being mainly ineffective and flawed.
As a result, last year alone saw a saddening 2549 deaths due to unintentional shootings, a figure that is 15% higher than gun violence statistics 2018. What’s more, over 70% of those unintentional shootings involved children under the age of 18.
16. Over 1000 people are shot and killed by police officers yearly.
Police shootings severely damage the trust between communities and law enforcement. Trust is fragile in poor areas at best, and shootings can result in irreversible damage.
At present:
The number of gun deaths in the US reflects that over 1000 people are killed daily due to police shootings.
Urban Gun Violence
17. 52% of gun homicide victims in the US are black males.
Gun violence statistics 2019 show rates in communities of color have now reached epidemic proportions. Unfortunately for residents in these types of areas, the majority end up paying for the mistakes of the few. Most gun crime in these areas is caused by a small percentage of individuals (approx 13%), meaning that the remaining 87% are left to deal with the aftermath.
Amazingly:
52% of gun homicide victims in the whole of the US are black males, despite black males making up only 7% of the US population.
Which means that...
18. Black Americans are 10 times more likely to be shot than white Americans.
Facts about gun violence and results from studies on gun homicide deaths over the last decade show that black Americans were up to 10 times more likely to be shot and killed than white Americans.
Which leads us to the fact that often...
19. A small part of a city (5% or less), can account for the majority of its crime.
Empirical data, gathered and collated from gun homicide statistics, shows that most of the gun violence in US cities can be attributed to small parts of a city.
A great example of this can be found in Boston where the cost of gun violence is taking a heavy toll on its inhabitants. In this major US city, gun violence is on the rise. As a standalone fact, one can easily assume the city must be all at fault. However, when placed under the microscope, we find that over 53% of Boston’s gun crime occurs in less than 3% of the city.
To Sum It All Up
As you can see from our list of alarming gun-related violence statistics shared today, incidents and deaths are on the rise in the US.
Despite firearms being synonymous with gang-related crimes or suicides, a large aspect of most civilian related gun crime revolves around children.
The key here is really not to demonize guns in any way, shape or form, as that would be a fool’s errand.
The US has championed and will perhaps always champion the people’s right to own firearms in order to defend their homes and families. Challenging this right would only give rise to a reactive backlash from extreme pro-gun groups and lead to further complications.
Instead, it would be wise to put time and effort into decreasing gun death rates by making sure gun owners pass more rigorous background checks. They also need to undergo more consistent monitoring protocols to ensure the responsible use of firearms. Finally, gun owners need to be educated in the proper use and storage of their weapons. By implementing these measures, we can make positive strides toward moving away from statistics of a negative nature and move toward more positive ones.

Gun Control Statistics And Safety Facts
Blog
22 March 2019
Gun control facts and statistics
The United States is listed as the country with the most number of civilian gun owners. Recent Gun Control Statistics show that there are about 120 guns per every 100 Americans. Gun ownership in the United States is not as complex as every citizen of legal age has a right to own a gun for protection purposes. The legal system has put in place measure to ensure that firearms are controlled among citizens. Ownership, manufacturing, allocation of, and destruction of firearms is regulated by the federal gun laws in place.
What is Gun Control? Gun Control Statistics Explained in Detail
The gun control debate often turns up after every mass shooting. But what exactly is entailed in firearms regulations? In essence, gun control can be defined as the set policies that police the manufacture, ownership, sale, and transfer of guns by common citizens. Gun control proponents push for legislation, enforcement, and application of measures that will limit the ownership and use of firearms by civilians. The second amendment of the American constitution interprets the policies for gun possession. Those who oppose gun control argue that restricting the use of guns is unwise because citizens will not be able to protect themselves when faced with danger. The Gun Control debate is still a contentious issue that is widely discussed by the American public and congressional committees. Some view the regulation of guns as one of the solutions to stop mass shootings.
The recent past has unfortunately seen a rise in mass shootings and misuse of firearms by both legal and illegal gun owners. The deaths reported have caused numerous debates in the public domain and Congress, yet nothing conclusive has been achieved so far. According to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), 2019 alone has had a total number of 10950 gun incidents across the country. 2979 people have lost their lives so far. Gun control statistics show that 2018 registered the highest number of school shootings ever, with 94 school gun violence incidents. The US Naval Postgraduate School also reported that 55 people were killed in the gun attacks. Most of these shootings happen in places like businesses, private residences, worship buildings like churches and temples, government properties and of course schools and any other open place.
Gun deaths in the United States get an awful great deal of attention. Rightfully so, as a developed nation, the rate of violent deaths including a gun, and the horrendously regular shootings targeting schools, is high. Compared to the whole world though, the U.S. rate can be found in well listed below nations such as El Salvador and Venezuela which had 72.5 and 64.3 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population in 2016, respectively. According to the Little Arms Survey, in the U.S. this rate is 3.1.
5 of the Deadliest Mass Shootings in the United States in the Past Decade
Las Vegas Shooting: October 1, 2017.
The shooter was 64-year-old Stephen Paddock who opened fire in a concert at the Mandalay Bay Resort and casino. 58 people lost their lives and about 500 were wounded. The shooter opened fire for about 15 minutes before law enforcers got to the scene. Stephen Paddock was later found dead in a hotel room. His death was ruled as a suicide.
Orlando Shooting: June 12, 2016.
29-year-old Omar Saddiqui Mateen started shooting at revelers in a gay night club in what came to be one of the worst mass shootings in the US. 49 people died and about 53 sustained injuries. Police reports showed that Omar had links with the terrorist group ISIS. He was shot dead in the club as police tried to free the hostages he had held captive.
Virginia Tech shooting: April 16, 2007.
Seung-Hui Cho, a 23-year-old student began shooting random people at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, in Blacksburg. The mass shooter of Korean descent killed 32 people and injured about 20 others. The shooting happened in two locations; West Ambler Johnston Hall and Norris Hall. Seung-Hui Cho later turned the gun on himself.
Sandy Hook Shooting: December 14, 2012.
20 children between the ages of 6 and 7, and 6 adults who were staff and members of Sandy Hook Elementary school faculty were killed by Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old mass murderer. The shooter had shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, at home before going on a shooting spree at the Connecticut school. The shooter later killed himself.
Sutherland Springs Shooting: November 5, 2017.
The lives of 26 people and one unborn child were put to an end by one Devin Patrick Kelley. 20 others were injured in the mass shooting which took place at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The 26-year-old was found dead in his car in what police believed to be a self-inflicted death. The Sutherland Shooting recorded the highest number of deaths caused by mass shootings in places of worship.
How likely are you to die in a mass shooting? It is the least of your worries. You are more than a thousand times more likely to die from Parkinson's Disease.
A Shift In Gun Control Mindset
When taking a look at the period prior to the Parkland shooting, it is interesting to see how younger generations feel about gun control.
The support for gun control over the defense of gun rights in America is greatest among 18 - 29 years of age, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, with a spike after the shooting in 2016 at an Orlando nightclub. The general trend is showing a decrease in support for gun control over weapon rights considering since the year 2000.
Safety Measures for Gun Owners
You can't ignore the Gun Control Statistics presented in this article. At Centerfire Shooting Sports we take gun safety very seriously and we believe that responsible firearm owners are not a threat to society. However, gun safety starts with you, the gun owner. The following tips are crucial to becoming a responsible firearm owner.
Understand the firearm you are using
Do not use any gun without properly researching on how it should be handled. Know every part of your gun and understand how to operate it. Do not use a gun you are not familiar with out of curiosity or just because you find it fancy. Different guns have features which vary from one gun to another. Do not jump to use a pistol if you are only familiar with shotguns. Get to learn about everything mechanical about your gun.
Unload your gun when not using it
Make it a habit to only load your gun when you are in a shooting area or a safe field. Otherwise, ensure that your ammunition is stored in a secure place. Isolate your firearms even as you load them. Always remember to unload the gun after you are done using it. Do not go with the loaded gun in your car, house or any other place where the gun can be accessed by either children or people who are not authorized to handle firearms. Open the action, look at the receiver, magazine and the chamber before handing out your gun to others.
Use the right ammunition
Go through your manual and ammunition boxes to understand the type of ammunition your firearm needs. Using the wrong ammunition will not only damage your firearm but also cause unnecessary accidents. You may not know this but a single cartridge of incorrect caliber or gauge can destroy your firearm. Check your gun's specifications on the manual to be sure of the suitable ammunition. The experts at Centerfire Shooting Sports are always on hand to answer any questions you might have about your guns and ammunition.
Protect your eyes and ears when shooting
Wear protective gear when you go for target practice. It is important that you have ear and eye protection. The sound that comes from shooting can be too loud and damage your ears. Always wear shooting glasses as they will protect you from falling shots, twigs, solvents that irritate the eyes, and keep you safe in case the gun malfunctions. Do not go on a hunting spree without an ear and eye protection.
Service your gun on a regular basis
Guns need continuous servicing just like any other mechanical devices or equipment. Taking care of your gun will ensure that it does not wear easily and lasts longer. Do not hand your gun over for servicing to an amateur; be sure that whoever has it is skilled and will not alter anything inside. You can consult your manufacturer on how often your firearm needs servicing. Centerfire Shooting Sports has an on site gun mechanic that can also service your gun.
Never use your gun when under the influence
Avoid consuming alcoholic drinks, prescription medicine or any other drug that has an effect on your body when using guns. This is because you need to be in the right state of mind before shooting. Having taken in any drug may make you lose focus and shoot things you had not targeted. Do not be tempted to use your gun even for fun when you are not in a sober state.
Take note of the muzzle at all times
This is perhaps the most common rule everyone who possess a gun is told. Ensure that the muzzle is pointed in the right direction. Most of the gun accidents reported are caused by people who do not point the muzzle in a safe direction. This leads to people accidentally shooting at things they had no intentions of shooting.

Bottom Line
Guns, gun laws, and gun possession policies vary from country to country. Worldatlas.com states that Serbia, Yemen, Cyprus, and Saudi Arabia are the other top four countries with the highest ratio of firearms owned by 100 people. Gun owners in America have the right to own any type of firearm they wish. Gun laws vary from state to state and so one is advised to look at the laws before visiting a particular state.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) is a non-governmental organization that prides itself in defending firearm ownership and advocating for equal rights and safety for every gun holder in the United States. The organization has been receiving some heat in the recent past, as gun control supporters feel like NRA members are a stumbling block to gun regulation. The bottom line is every adult who owns a gun should be responsible with how they handle the weapon because despite the fact that it can keep you safe, a gun can be dangerous to self and those around you.

18 Balanced Gun Self-Defense Statistics
America is marked by heated debates whether owning guns should be illegal, as it is in other countries. Research shows that many people believe gun laws should be stricter and guns banned altogether, as seen in all recent anti-gun rallies.
Gun self-defense statistics, meanwhile, show that gun-owning citizens were able to defend themselves. On the flip side, permissive gun laws allow criminals easy access as well.
To present you with a balanced view on gun ownership, we’ve prepared a list of essential stats and facts.
Guns Saving Lives Statistics (Editor’s Choice)
43% of Americans thinks gun ownership rights should be limited
18 states have issued Constitutional Carry laws
In the US, there were 1.3 million instances of violent crime in 2020
On average, an American stops 2.3 deaths from a shooting rampage
Every year, women use guns to defend themselves against sexual assault 200,000 times
The highest number of homicides occurred in 2020
There were 40 active shooter incidents in 2020
In 2020, there were over 670 registered self-defense incidents in the US
Gun Ownership in the US
1. On average, 88.8 out of 100 Americans own a gun.
(American Gun Facts)
The most recent data about gun ownership, use, and self-defense statistics show that the US homicide rate per 100,000 residents is only 4.8. Similarly, there are only 466 violent crimes per 100,000 Americans.
By comparison, in the UK, a country where gun laws are much stricter, the number of violent crimes per 100,000 citizens is 2,034.
2. 42% of American households owned at least one gun in 2020.
(Statista)
Statista research shows that 45% of American males own a gun at this time, the majority of whom are white. Similarly, 36% of those aged 65 or older own or used to own a firearm.
Another 35% of college-educated US citizens are gun owners.
3. The majority of Americans own a gun for protection.
(Just Facts/Gallup)
Defensive gun use stats show that nearly two-thirds (63%) of Americans cite safety/protection as the reason why they own a gun. Another 40% of Americans own and use their firearms for hunting, while a minority of 15% use guns for target shooting and other general recreation activities.
Gun Ownership Rights Debate
There are ongoing animated discussions concerning Americans’ right to own guns. Some argue that the laws which make buying guns easy should change, arguing that they enable criminals. Proponents of gun ownership rights, meanwhile, often cite guns preventing crime statistics to support the status quo.
4. As of 2020, 57% of the United States residents thought that firearms sales laws should be stricter.
(Statista)
The number decreased by comparison to 2019, when 63% of people believed that laws should be stricter.
Only 9% of Americans believed that gun laws should be less strict, while 34% did not think the laws should change.
5. 43% of the United States population wants gun ownership rights to be limited.
(Statista)
This 2021 statistic shows that maintaining or limiting gun ownership rights in the US often varies based on the respondent’s political identification. 81% of Republicans, who often point to self-defense statistics, believe that protecting people’s rights to own guns is more important. In comparison, 72% of Democrats hold the opposite opinion.
This divide leads to an almost balanced overall public opinion, 43% for limiting gun ownership and 48% arguing that rights should be maintained.
6. 18 states have adopted constitutional carry legislation.
(CPRC)
As of February 2021, Utah joined in the Constitutional Carry law, allowing residents to carry guns openly or concealed, even without a permit.
There are only seven states where the right to carry guns is still not issued yet.
Violent Crimes Statistics
There are many informative articles on US crime and the following FBI statistics suggest that many of these cases could be prevented and lives saved by citizens owning guns.
7. There were 1.3 million violent crimes in 2020 in the United States.
(Statista)
Violent crime’s primary offenses are murder and non-negligent manslaughter, robbery, rape and sexual assault, and aggravated assault. Even though the number of US violent crimes has significantly fallen in the last 20 years, it has actually increased in the last several years.
8. 2020 was the year with the highest number of homicides ever.
(Pew Research, NPR)
More specifically, FBI statistics show there were 21,570 homicides in the US that year. Compared to 2019, that represented a 30% (4,901) increase.
In other words, in 2020, there were 7.8 murders for every 100,000 people in the US, as opposed to 2019, when there were six murders per 100,000 people.
9. The US burglary rate was 314.2 cases per 100,000 people in 2020.
(Statista)
Burglary statistics show that the past several years mark an abrupt year-on-year decrease in the burglary offense counts numbers. In fact, in 2019, the burglary rate was 340.5 cases per 100,000.
New Mexico held the record for highest US burglary rate in 2020, with 648.8 cases per 100,000 people, followed by Oklahoma, with 613.3 cases per 100,000 people.
Defensive Gun Use Statistics
The number of incidents, deaths, and shots fired on average in self-defense, is still worrying, even if lower than the previous years.
10. There are 673 registered self-defense incidents in the United States in 2020.
(Heritage)
The US has statistics on how many defensive gun uses per year there are. The oldest data was from 2019, when there were 751 incidents.
The following year marks an almost insignificant fall, considering these 673 incidents happened in the pandemic times. In 2022, so far, there have been 16 gun self-defense incidents already.
11. There were 1,453 defensive gun use deaths in 2020.
(Gun Violence Archive)
However, the number of crimes prevented by guns is significantly lower than in the previous years. The statistics show that in 2019, 1,595 deaths were caused in self-defense. As for 2021, there were 1,244 deaths caused by defensive gun use.
12. Police reported six self-defense instances when people had to fire multiple shots in 2020.
(CPRC)
Many gun-related violence articles and statistics show the average number of shots fired in self-defense. For example, in Voder, Colorado, hundreds of rounds were fired in property trespassing when a 59-year-old man had to defend himself and his wife against four armed intruders.
Similarly, self-defense facts mention an intruder was shot multiple times and severely wounded by a homeowner in Alabama.
13. There were four cases in 2019 when people had to fire ten or more shots in self-defense.
(CPRC)
These CPRC facts reveal a number of home invasions or property theft stopped by guns. Four men forced their way into a house in Houston, Texas. The house owner shot all four in self-defense.
A 17-year-old boy was shot as he broke into a house in Tallahassee, Florida. The homeowner fired his gun about 25 times in his attempt to protect his life and property. Similarly, in LA, a business owner defended himself against a gang trying to extort money from him.
14. On average, a US citizen stops 2.3 deaths from a shooting rampage.
(American Gun Facts)
Gun self-defense statistics show that armed citizens kill 1,527 criminals a year, while police officers kill 606.
Surprisingly, however, citizens have a significantly lower error rate than police officers. American residents have a 2% error rate, while US police officers have an 11% error rate.
15. Women use guns to defend against sexual assault 200,000 times a year.
(American Gun Facts)
FBI crimes stopped by concealed carry statistics show that this fact leads to a 5% decrease in rape cases. Similarly, concealed carry laws have also helped reduce murder cases by 8.5% and other violent assaults by 7%.
Mass Shooting Statistics
Mass shootings are one of the primary concerns of Americans when it comes to debating gun ownership laws. The statistics mirroring these debates, also show opposing views, as is tthe FBI report and the claims made by USA Today.
16. In 2020, the FBI reported 40 active shooter incidents.
(FBI)
That’s an increase from the year before when there were 30 such cases. In 2020, there were 164 casualties. Of them, 126 were wounded and 38 killed, including one law enforcement officer.
17. Statistics report 611 mass shootings, 298 kids killed, and 699 injured in 2020.
(Gun Violence Archive)
If the number of kids aged 0 to 11 appears high, the number of teens is even higher. In 2020 1,071 teens died, and about 3,000 were injured.
In comparison to 2019, these numbers are on the rise. If the year 2020 registered 611 mass shootings, there were nearly 200 fewer such incidents the previous year. The number of deaths among children is also significantly lower in 2019: 209 kids aged 0–11 and 778 teens (aged 12–17).
18. 90% of law enforcement officers believe that legally armed citizens could reduce the number of mass shootings.
(USA Today)
There are multiple examples the police rely on when stating this. The most notable is that of a mass shooting stopped by an armed citizen. Another one is a Florida man who used his AR-15 to defend himself against no less than seven home intruders, firing 30 rounds at them. Like him, a Maryland mother fought three burglars off her property by merely loading her gun.
The report includes evidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shows that guns are used 16 to 100 times more often to protect life than to take life.
Gun Self-Defense – Good or Bad?
Overall, gun self-defense statistics and facts point to American citizens’ different and often contradictory viewpoints, as well as law enforcement officers’ ones, regarding gun ownership rights. Research shows that the debate is closely connected to political affiliation.
However, US residents’ primary concern remains the mass shootings and active shooter cases that leave many victims. Most studies suggest that the ‘good guy’ with a gun very rarely responds quickly enough to stop an active shooter.
People Also Ask
How often are guns used in self-defense?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most studies on defensive gun use found that American residents use their firearms defensively between 500,000 and 3 million times every year.
There’s good reason to believe that most defensive gun uses are never reported to law enforcement. Thus, local, national, or international press and media pick up much fewer cases than the police may do.
How many mass shootings were stopped by armed civilians?
There aren’t many cases of armed residents stepping in a mass shooting or active shooter incidents. Not even when they legally own weapons.
The cause is that active shootings happen in crowded areas, and it takes too long for people to respond. However, the press picked up a few compelling examples, such as a father who used his concealed gun to stop a mass shooting in a McDonald’s in Alabama or another who used his gun to stop a racist shooter outside a Kentucky Kroger.
How many crimes are stopped by gun owners per year?
Citizens manage to prevent an estimated 2.5 million crimes a year. That is 6,849 every day! And in most cases, the gun is never fired, and no blood is shed. Every year, firearms help prevent 400,000 life-threatening crimes.
Convicted felons claim that they avoid committing crimes when they think that the victim might be armed. Similarly, they are less likely to enter a house where people are at home from fear of being shot.
What percentage of guns are used in self-defense?
Data shows that 63% of Americans own a gun for protection and are likely to use their firearms in self-defense. Experts have debated the actual use of firearms in self-defense instances for many years. Depending which expert you ask, the numbers per year may range from several million to hundreds of thousands of self-defense gun use cases.
The latest data show that people use guns in self-defense reasonably rarely. According to Harvard University research, people defended themselves using a firearm in as little as 0.9% of crimes.
How many lives are saved by the defensive use of firearms?
Every year, firearm use prevents 400,000 life-threatening violent crimes, including aggravated assaults, sexual assault, and homicide attempts. Generally, Americans believe that gun ownership stops crime.
This belief drives laws that make concealed (and entirely legal) ownership easy. It’s unclear how many of the defensive gun uses involve carrying guns in public places by concealed-carry permit holders. Still, our records show that concealed carry permit holders can and do save lives.
How many home invasions were stopped by guns?
The National Crime Victimization Surveys provide little evidence as to how many home invasions or property trespassing have been prevented by firearms used defensively. However, several examples are coming from the media.
For instance, in 2019, a 17-year-old boy was shot as he broke into a house in Tallahassee, Florida. The homeowner fired his gun about 25 times in his attempt to protect his life and property. Similarly, in LA, a business owner defended himself against a gang trying to extort money from him.
How many gun deaths are in self-defense?
Studies indicate that there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides every time a gun was fired in a home in self-defence or in a legally justifiable shooting.
Over 38,000 people died in the US from use of firearms during 2019, according to a non-profit organization. Out of the total number of gun-related deaths, over 1,500 were caused in self-defense. In 2020, gun self-defense statistics showed 1,453 defensive gun use deaths.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can work with. The first document is from CBS News, and it has some statistics on gun ownership and gun violence in America. It says there are 357 million guns in the US, which is more than the number of people. That's a striking number. It also mentions that 3% of people own half of the guns, and that 400,000 guns are stolen every year. That seems like a lot.

Then there's information about background checks. Over 3 million times, federal, state, or local background checks have denied a gun to someone who's prohibited from owning one. That's a significant number, but I wonder what the total number of background checks is. Maybe I should look that up.

Moving on, there's data about school shootings. In 2018, there were 18 times when a weapon was fired on school grounds. In eight of those incidents, no one was injured, which is fortunate. But overall, it's concerning that this happens so frequently.

The Washington Post is mentioned, saying that over 150,000 students have experienced a shooting on their campus since Columbine. That's heartbreaking. And the Gun Violence Archive reports over 1,800 deaths from shootings in 2018 and over 30 mass shootings.

The Brady Campaign provides some averages from recent years: about 11,500 deaths and 115,000 injuries from gun violence annually. These numbers are pretty high compared to other developed countries.

Okay, so in terms of cons, it's clear that gun violence is a significant issue in the US, with high numbers of deaths and injuries, including mass shootings and school shootings. The ease of access to guns seems to be a contributing factor, as suggested by the high number of guns per capita and the number of guns stolen annually.

Now, looking at the pros of gun ownership. One of the main arguments is self-defense. Many people feel safer having a gun to protect themselves and their families. There's also the historical and cultural significance of gun ownership in the US, tied to the Second Amendment.

Additionally, guns are used for recreational purposes like hunting and target shooting. Many people enjoy these activities and see them as an important part of their lifestyle.

I need to find some statistics or studies that support these points. Maybe some data on how often guns are used in self-defense successfully.

Let me check the second search result, which is from BrandonGaille.com. It has gun ownership statistics by state in America. It says that about 42% of households have a gun, and 30% of individuals own a gun. That's helpful for understanding the prevalence of gun ownership.

It also breaks down gun ownership by demographics: 47% of males vs. 13% of females, 33% of whites vs. 18% of non-whites, and political affiliations, with 41% of Republicans owning guns compared to 23% of Democrats.

Interesting. So, there are clear demographic differences in gun ownership.

The reasons for ownership are protection against crime (67%), target shooting (66%), and hunting (58%). So, protection is the primary reason, followed closely by recreation.

Looking at the top 10 countries with the highest gun ownership, the US is at the top, which aligns with the earlier statistic of 120 guns per 100 people.

Now, moving on to gun crimes. 67% of murders are committed with firearms, and 8% of violent crimes involve visible weapons. But on the positive side, civilians defend themselves with guns almost a million times per year, and guns are used to frighten away intruders almost half a million times per year.

Also, 40% of felons decide not to commit a crime because they believe a victim is carrying a gun, and 69% of felons have been scared off or shot at by armed victims.

These numbers suggest that guns can be effective for self-defense and may have a deterrent effect on crime.

However, I need to verify these numbers because they seem quite high. Maybe I should look for more recent data or different sources to confirm.

The document also mentions right-to-carry laws, with 40 states having shall-issue laws, meaning that concealed permits are issued to qualified applicants. Nine states have may-issue laws, where local authorities have more discretion, and one state (Illinois) had no-issue laws, meaning right to carry is forbidden, but I think Illinois has since changed its laws.

Fatal gun accidents are also listed, with breakdowns by age group. It's concerning that young children are involved in some of these accidents.

Education level and income levels of gun owners are also provided, but I'm not sure how relevant that is to the pros and cons discussion.

Moving on to the gun industry statistics, there are almost 50,000 licensed gun dealers in the US, and Florida is approaching one million issued weapons permits, making it the most armed state.

There are also 5,000 gun shows per year, with about 1,000 firearms sold in two days at each show. That's a lot of guns changing hands.

Now, looking at the third search result from LegalJobs.io, which has gun violence statistics. It starts with the number of mass shootings in the US in the past year, which is 418, and notes that this is a 5% decrease from previous years, possibly due to increased gun control legislation supported by students from Stoneman Douglas High School.

It also mentions that gun violence severity in high school shootings has increased by over 50%, which is alarming.

There's information about bump stocks, with over 500,000 potentially in civilian hands, but I think these have since been banned federally.

Unintentional shootings are also a concern, with 90 people unintentionally shot every day in the US.

In terms of gun deaths, over 36,000 people are killed annually, with 61% of those being suicides.

So, it's important to note that a significant portion of gun deaths are suicides, which might not be directly related to the debate on gun ownership for self-defense or crime.

However, it does highlight the need for better mental health resources and possibly stricter gun storage laws to prevent access to guns by individuals who may be suicidal.

The document also mentions that one person is killed by legal intervention every 16 hours, which I assume refers to police shootings, but I need to confirm that.

Furthermore, it states that one in three children lives in a household that stores a loaded and unlocked firearm, which is a worrying statistic for accidental shootings and access by children.

Now, moving on to the fourth search result from CenterfireSS.com, which discusses gun control statistics and safety facts.

It mentions that the US has the most civilian gun owners, with 120 guns per 100 Americans, which aligns with earlier statistics.

The article talks about the complexity of gun ownership in the US and the regulations in place, such as background checks and storage requirements.

It also addresses the gun control debate, with proponents pushing for legislation to limit gun ownership and use, while opponents argue that restricting guns would leave citizens unable to protect themselves.

The article cites the Gun Violence Archive for 2019 statistics: 10,950 gun incidents and 2,979 deaths, with 94 school gun violence incidents in 2018.

It also compares US gun death rates to other countries, noting that the US rate is lower than some countries like El Salvador and Venezuela but still较高 compared to many developed nations.

The article lists some of the deadliest mass shootings in the US over the past decade, including Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and Sutherland Springs.

It then shifts to discussing safety measures for gun owners, emphasizing responsible ownership and providing tips such as understanding the firearm, unloading when not in use, using correct ammunition, wearing protective gear, regular servicing, not using guns under the influence, and always being aware of the muzzle's direction.

The article also recommends attending gun safety classes, which is a good point.

Finally, the fifth search result is from SafeAtLast.co, which provides gun self-defense statistics.

It starts by noting that many people believe gun laws should be stricter, as seen in anti-gun rallies, but presents a balanced view by including statistics on how guns are used for self-defense.

Some key points include:

- 43% of Americans think gun ownership rights should be limited.

- 18 states have constitutional carry laws, allowing people to carry guns without a permit.

- In 2020, there were 1.3 million violent crimes in the US.

- On average, an American stops 2.3 deaths from a shooting rampage.

- Women use guns to defend themselves against sexual assault 200,000 times a year.

- There were 40 active shooter incidents in 2020.

- Over 670 registered self-defense incidents in the US in 2020.

These statistics suggest that guns are indeed used effectively for self-defense, but also that there are significant issues with gun violence and mass shootings.

It's important to consider both sides of the argument. On one hand, guns can save lives and prevent crimes, as evidenced by the self-defense statistics. On the other hand, the high rates of gun violence, including mass shootings and accidental deaths, indicate that there are serious problems with gun access and regulation in the US.

Perhaps a middle-ground approach could involve stricter background checks and safety training for gun owners, combined with measures to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, such as through theft or illegal sales.

I should also consider international comparisons. For example, countries with stricter gun laws generally have lower rates of gun violence. This suggests that regulation can play a role in reducing gun-related deaths and injuries.

However, it's also worth noting that no country has completely eliminated gun violence, even those with very strict gun laws. So, while regulation can help, it may not solve the problem entirely.

Another factor to consider is that guns are sometimes used by law enforcement and security personnel to maintain public safety. So, in certain professional contexts, guns serve a valuable purpose.

Moreover, guns are an integral part of American culture, with a long history of ownership and use for hunting and sport shooting. For many, owning a gun is a personal choice and a cherished right.

In conclusion, the pros of gun ownership include self-defense, protection of property, participation in sporting activities, and adherence to constitutional rights. The cons include the risk of gun violence, both intentional and accidental, the potential for guns to fall into the wrong hands, and the tragic occurrences of mass shootings.

To strike a balance, it may be necessary to implement comprehensive gun laws that ensure responsible ownership while also addressing the root causes of gun violence, such as mental health issues and social inequalities.

I should also consider that gun control is a highly politicized issue in the US, with strong emotions and vested interests on both sides. Therefore, any discussion on the pros and cons must be approached with sensitivity and a commitment to factual information.

Perhaps the best way forward is to continue researching and understanding the complexities of gun ownership and its impacts, and to engage in constructive dialogue aimed at finding solutions that respect individual rights while promoting public safety.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Pros: Self-defense, protection, hunting, sport shooting, constitutional rights. Cons: Gun violence, accidents, mass shootings, easy access for criminals.}} \]
