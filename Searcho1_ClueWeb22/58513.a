As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and analysis on the topic of former lawmakers serving as lobbyists and potential long-term dangers associated with this practice.

First, I need to understand what lobbying is and why former lawmakers might become lobbyists. Lobbying involves advocating for specific interests or causes to influence political decisions, often by communicating with legislators and other government officials. Former lawmakers may have valuable insights into the legislative process and relationships with current officials, making them potentially effective lobbyists.

One possible danger is the creation of a revolving door between public service and private interest representation. This can lead to conflicts of interest, where former lawmakers may use their insider knowledge and connections to benefit private clients at the expense of the public good. This could erode public trust in government and undermine the integrity of the democratic process.

Another concern is the potential for undue influence. Lobbyists, including those who were formerly lawmakers, might have disproportionate access to decision-makers, allowing them to shape policies in ways that favor their clients rather than the general population. This could result in legislation that benefits special interests over the common welfare.

Moreover, the long-term impact could be a systematic bias in policy-making towards the interests of those who can afford to hire high-level lobbyists. This might lead to inequality in representation, where only certain groups have their voices heard in the political arena.

Additionally, there's the issue of regulatory capture, where regulators become aligned with the industries they are supposed to oversee, possibly due to the prospect of future employment as lobbyists or in industry roles. This can weaken监管效力并导致不良后果。

为了减轻这些潜在的危害，一些国家和地区已经实施了冷却期制度，要求议员在离职后一段时间内不能从事游说活动。此外，透明度和披露要求也可以帮助公众了解谁在影响政策以及如何影响。

总之，虽然前立法者担任游说者可能有其合理性，但必须谨慎管理以防止对民主进程的长期损害。

\boxed{\text{Yes, there are long-term dangers such as conflicts of interest, undue influence, inequality in representation, and regulatory capture.}}
