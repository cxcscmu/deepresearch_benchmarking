Globalization - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Globalization
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Globalization is the connection of different parts of the world resulting in the expansion of international cultural, economic, and political activities. It is the movement and integration of goods, contacts and people among different countries. There are advantages and disadvantages to globalization, all of which have economic, social, political, and cultural impacts. Globalization describes mainly trade practices, extending also to the communication patterns and cultural system that underlie these practices.

Definition[change | change source]
It is a term which may be used broadly to mean doing things as distant people do them, or more narrowly to mean complying to global standard s in economy, politics, culture, education, environment or other matters. It describes the way countries and people of the world interact and integrate. Many things have become globalized as people come into contact.
Economic globalization is how countries are coming together as one big global economy, [1] This is all making international trade easier. In the late 20th century, many people agreed to lower tariffs, or taxes on goods that are imported from other countries. Telegraphy and bull other communication technologies have helped people to buy and sell products from around the world, thus bringing globalization. Herman E. Daly has said that there is an important difference between internationalization and globalization. Internationalization is about nations working together for the same goals. These are things like treaties, alliances, and other international agreements.  Globalization is about international trade that are 
being less blocked by national borders .
Political globalization is how institutions and countries can influence the whole world. The United Nations are an example of globalization because most countries of the world are members of its General Assembly. This international organization can make countries follow rules and apply economic sanctions to a country that doesn't. This means the countries in the U.N will punish them by not talking or trading with them, so they don't benefit from globalization.
Cultural globalization is how culture is becoming homogeneous, which means that people from all over the world act in similar way. For example, many people around the world write with the Latin alphabet, wear T-shirts and jeans and watch Hollywood movies and other media.
Criticism[change | change source]
Some people, like Noam Chomsky, do not like globalization because they feel it only helps rich people get richer by making poor people poorer. Offshore outsourcing, such as a company hiring workers in a developing country, is often a part of globalization. This sometimes means that some people in a developed country lose their jobs. Joseph Stiglitz said that international groups like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have made it harder for poorer nations to get richer.  Globalization also means that problems from other countries will affect your country. For example, the Great Depression of the 1930s started in the United States but affected the entire world.
Many countries also dislike it when international organizations such as the United Nations tell them what to do. However they obey to avoid sanctions. Many people also criticize the fact that globalization means that fewer people are deciding what  brands, like Coca-Cola and McDonald's, taking over smaller, local shops and businesses.  They criticize the fact that powerful countries have bigger influence on world culture than others. For example, the United States is the biggest cultural exporter, which means that countries around the world are becoming like the United States. However, this hurts local cultures. Jean Baudrillard believes that globalization hurts local cultures and is the cause of most terrorism.  He also believes that most supporters of globalization just want to stay in power. [2]
Gregory Meyjes interprets globalization as a largely hegemonic, unequal process of socio-cultural imposition. Questioning the various processes (economic, political, cultural) by which globalization or globalisation has favored rapid Anglo-cultural dominance over a more gradual, egalitarian evolution towards an inclusive world civilization, Meyjes argues for cultural policies that support "ecological" relations between local ethnocultural traditions, by protecting cultural specificity in the short term and allow as many cultural groups as possible to organically contribute to the whole. At the global level, Meyjes therefore proposes the term universalization or universalisation to denote a process of (largely) non-imposed socio-cultural exchange between state-level and sub-state-level groups and "nations" – i.e. a transnational process that informs the gradual emergence of a universal civilization.

Others, like Thomas Friedman, believe that globalization can bring people together and make everyone richer without getting rid of local cultures.  People who support globalization also believe that it makes war less likely because it is bad for business. [3]Francis Fukuyama also argued that globalization would eventually lead to a system of world governance which would cause wars to end. [4]
Many believe that globalization helps out poorer nations by bringing them business.  A report by the World Bank said that poverty in India and Indonesia was cut in half because of globalization.  The report also said that people in poorer nations are living longer and better because they were making more money. [5]

What Is Globalization?
Globalization is the spread of products, technology, information, and jobs across national borders and cultures. In economic terms, it describes an interdependence of nations around the globe fostered through free trade .
Key Takeaways
Globalization is the spread of products, technology, information, and jobs across nations.
Corporations in developed nations can gain a competitive edge through globalization.
Developing countries also benefit through globalization as they tend to be more cost-effective and therefore attract jobs.
The benefits of globalization have been questioned as the positive effects are not necessarily distributed equally.
One clear result of globalization is that an economic downturn in one country can create a domino effect through its trade partners.

Understanding Globalization
Corporations gain a competitive advantage on multiple fronts through globalization. They can reduce operating costs by manufacturing abroad, buy raw materials more cheaply because of the reduction or removal of tariffs, and most of all, they gain access to millions of new consumers.
Globalization is a social, cultural, political, and legal phenomenon.
Socially, it leads to greater interaction among various populations.
Culturally, globalization represents the exchange of ideas, values, and artistic expression among cultures.
Globalization also represents a trend toward the development of a single world culture.
Politically, globalization has shifted attention to intergovernmental organizations like the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Legally, globalization has altered how international law is created and enforced.
On one hand, globalization has created new jobs and economic growth through the cross-border flow of goods, capital, and labor. On the other hand, this growth and job creation are not distributed evenly across industries or countries.
Specific industries in certain countries, such as textile manufacturing in the U.S. or corn farming in Mexico, have suffered severe disruption or outright collapse as a result of increased international competition.
Globalization's motives are idealistic, as well as opportunistic, but the development of a global free market has benefited large corporations based in the Western world. Its impact remains mixed for workers, cultures, and small businesses around the globe, in both developed and emerging nations .
The History of Globalization
Globalization is not a new concept. Traders traveled vast distances in ancient times to buy commodities that were rare and expensive for sale in their homelands. The Industrial Revolution brought advances in transportation and communication in the 19th century that eased trade across borders.
The think tank, Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), states globalization stalled after World War I, and nations' moved toward protectionism as they launched import taxes to more closely guard their industries in the aftermath of the conflict. This trend continued through the Great Depression and World War II until the U.S. took on an instrumental role in reviving international trade.1
Globalization has sped up to an unprecedented pace, with public policy changes and communications technology innovations cited as the two main driving factors.
One of the critical steps in the path to globalization came with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed in 1993. 2 One of NAFTA's many effects was to give American auto manufacturers the incentive to relocate a portion of their manufacturing to Mexico where they could save on the costs of labor. 3 NAFTA was replaced in 2020 by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMC). 4
Governments worldwide have integrated a free market economic system through fiscal policies and trade agreements over the last 20 years. The core of most trade agreements is the removal or reduction of tariffs.
This evolution of economic systems has increased industrialization and financial opportunities in many nations. Governments now focus on removing barriers to trade and promoting international commerce.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Globalization
Advantages
Proponents of globalization believe it allows developing countries to catch up to industrialized nations through increased manufacturing, diversification, economic expansion, and improvements in standards of living .
Outsourcing by companies brings jobs and technology to developing countries, which help them to grow their economies. Trade initiatives increase cross-border trading by removing supply-side and trade-related constraints.
Globalization has advanced social justice on an international scale as well, and advocates report that it has focused attention on human rights worldwide that might have otherwise been ignored on a large scale.
Disadvantages
One clear result of globalization is that an economic downturn in one country can create a domino effect through its trade partners. For example, the 2008 financial crisis had a severe impact on Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain. All these countries were members of the European Union, which had to step in to bail out debt-laden nations, which were thereafter known by the acronym PIGS.
Globalization detractors argue that it has created a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small corporate elite that can gobble up smaller competitors around the globe.
Globalization has become a polarizing issue in the U.S. with the disappearance of entire industries to new locations abroad. It's seen as a major factor in the economic squeeze on the middle class .
For better and worse, globalization has also increased homogenization. Starbucks, Nike, and Gap dominate commercial space in many nations. The sheer size and reach of the U.S. have made the cultural exchange among nations largely a one-sided affair.
What Is the Simple Meaning of Globalization?
In essence, globalization is about the world becoming increasingly interconnected. Countries today are more connected than ever before, due to factors such as air travel, containerized sea shipping, international trade agreements and legal treaties, and the Internet. In the world of business, globalization is associated with trends such as outsourcing, free trade, and international supply chains.
Is Globalization Good or Bad?
Proponents of globalization will point to the dramatic decline in poverty that has taken place throughout the world over the past several decades, which many economists attribute in part to increased trade and investment between nations. Similarly, they will argue that globalization has allowed products and services such as cellphones, airplanes, and information technology to be spread far more widely throughout the world. On the other hand, critics of globalization will point to the negative impact it has had on specific nations’ industries, which might face increased competition from international firms. Globalization can also have negative environmental impacts due to economic development, industrialization, and international travel.
Why Is Globalization Important?
Globalization is important because it is one of the most powerful forces affecting the modern world, so much so that it can be difficult to make sense of the world without understanding globalization. For example, many of the largest and most successful corporations in the world are in effect truly multinational organizations, with offices and supply chains stretched right across the world. These companies would not be able to exist if not for the complex network of trade routes, international legal agreements, and telecommunications infrastructure that were made possible through globalization. Important political developments, such as the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China, are also directly related to globalization.

Alright, so I've got these definitions from different sources. Let's see what they have in common and what differs.

From Simple English Wikipedia, globalization is described as the connection of different parts of the world, leading to the expansion of international cultural, economic, and political activities. It mentions the movement and integration of goods, contacts, and people among different countries. There are also mentions of economic, political, and cultural globalization.

Investopedia defines globalization as the spread of products, technology, information, and jobs across national borders and cultures, with a focus on economic interdependence through free trade.

Another source talks about globalization as the process through which the world is becoming increasingly interconnected due to advances in technology and trade.

From these, I can see that globalization generally refers to the increasing interconnectedness of the world, both economically and culturally, facilitated by advancements in technology and trade.

But there are different aspects to it. Economic globalization seems to be a big part, involving free trade, movement of capital and labor, and the integration of national economies into the global economy.

Political globalization is mentioned, like the influence of international organizations like the UN on national policies.

Cultural globalization refers to the spread of culture, where local cultures might be influenced by or even replaced with global culture, often dominated by western culture, particularly American.

I also see that globalization has both supporters and critics. Supporters argue that it brings economic growth, reduces poverty, and promotes peace by making war less likely due to its negative impact on business.

Critics, on the other hand, argue that it benefits wealthy individuals and countries at the expense of poorer ones, leads to job losses in certain sectors, and can homogenize cultures, leading to loss of local identities.

It's interesting to note that some sources distinguish between globalization and internationalization. For example, internationalization might refer to increased international trade and relations, while globalization is more about the integration and interdependence of economies and cultures.

I should also consider the historical perspective. Globalization isn't a new phenomenon; it has been happening for centuries with trade routes and cultural exchanges. However, the current wave of globalization, especially post-World War II, has been significantly accelerated by advances in technology, transportation, and communication.

Now, the question is about how globalization impacts people. So, I need to think about the effects of these interconnectedness and integrations on individuals and communities.

First, economically, globalization can bring job opportunities in certain sectors, especially in developing countries where multinational corporations set up factories and offices, taking advantage of lower labor costs.

However, it can also lead to job losses in certain industries in developed countries, as jobs are outsourced to places where labor is cheaper.

Moreover, globalization can lead to increased competition, which might drive innovation and lower prices for consumers, but it can also lead to the domination of markets by large multinational corporations, potentially squeezing out local businesses.

Culturally, globalization can expose people to diverse cultures and ideas, promoting tolerance and understanding. It can also lead to the spread of popular culture, often from the West, which might overshadow or even erase local cultures.

Environmentally, globalization can have negative impacts, such as increased carbon emissions from transportation and the exploitation of natural resources in less regulated countries.

Politically, globalization can lead to the diffusion of political ideas and practices, but it can also lead to a loss of sovereignty as nations have to comply with international norms and regulations set by global bodies.

Socially, globalization can lead to the spread of social movements and ideas across borders, but it can also lead to social tensions as people grapple with changes brought about by globalization.

I think it's important to consider that the impacts of globalization are not uniform; they vary greatly depending on the context, the sector, and the individuals involved.

For instance, a factory worker in the US might see their job moved overseas, leading to unemployment and economic hardship. At the same time, a worker in a developing country might gain employment in that same factory, lifting them out of poverty.

Similarly, a small business owner in a developing country might struggle to compete with large multinational corporations, while consumers in the same country might benefit from access to a wider range of products at lower prices.

So, globalization has both winners and losers, and the distribution of its benefits and costs is uneven.

Moreover, the process of globalization can exacerbate inequalities within and between countries. While it can lift many people out of poverty, it can also concentrate wealth in the hands of a few.

There's also the issue of cultural homogenization versus cultural diversity. Some argue that globalization leads to a homogenized global culture, dominated by Western, particularly American, values and consumer culture, which can threaten local cultures and identities.

Others argue that globalization can also lead to a richer cultural exchange, where diverse cultures influence each other, leading to new hybrid cultures.

In terms of political impact, globalization can lead to the strengthening of international institutions and cooperation, which can be beneficial for addressing global issues like climate change and pandemics.

However, it can also lead to a erosion of national sovereignty, as countries have to conform to global standards and regulations set by international bodies, which might not always align with national interests.

Furthermore, the rapid spread of information and ideas through globalization can empower civil society and social movements, but it can also facilitate the spread of misinformation and extremist ideologies.

Given these complexities, it's clear that globalization has multifaceted impacts on people, and these impacts are often context-specific.

To get a better understanding, perhaps I should look for specific examples or case studies where the effects of globalization on people are evident.

Let me think of some examples.

First, the rise of e-commerce platforms like Amazon has revolutionized retail, making it easier for consumers to access a wide variety of products from around the world.

This has benefits in terms of convenience and choice for consumers, but it has also disrupted traditional retail sectors, leading to store closures and job losses in some areas.

Another example is the call center industry, which has grown significantly in countries like India and the Philippines, providing employment opportunities and boosting their economies.

However, workers in these industries often face long hours, stress, and the pressure of meeting performance targets set by multinational corporations.

In terms of culture, the spread of Hollywood movies and American fast food chains around the world is a clear example of cultural globalization.

While this can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism, it's also true that many people around the world enjoy and appreciate American culture, and it has become a part of the global cultural landscape.

At the same time, there are efforts to preserve and promote local cultures in the face of globalization.

For instance, some countries have implemented policies to protect their national cinemas or traditional crafts from being overwhelmed by foreign influences.

In the realm of politics, the anti-globalization movement has gained traction in recent years, with protests against trade agreements and the perceived negative effects of globalization on jobs and national sovereignty.

This has manifested in political movements and parties that advocate for protectionist policies and stricter controls on immigration and trade.

On the other hand, there are also movements that champion the benefits of globalization, arguing that it fosters international cooperation and understanding, and that it is essential for addressing global challenges like climate change and poverty.

Considering all these aspects, it's evident that globalization has profound and wide-ranging impacts on people's lives, touching on economic, cultural, political, and social dimensions.

It's a complex phenomenon that cannot be easily reduced to simplistic pro or con arguments.

Instead, a nuanced understanding is needed, recognizing both the opportunities and challenges that globalization presents.

Moreover, it's crucial to consider how the benefits of globalization can be more equitably distributed, ensuring that it doesn't just benefit a small elite while leaving others behind.

Policies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts, such as retraining programs for displaced workers and measures to protect local industries and cultures, may be necessary.

In conclusion, globalization is a multifaceted process that has transformed the way people live, work, and interact across the globe.

Its impacts are varied and often contradictory, reflecting the diverse ways in which it intersects with different aspects of human life.

As such, ongoing dialogue and critical examination are essential to navigate the complexities of globalization and harness its potential for positive change while mitigating its drawbacks.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Globalization is a multifaceted process characterized by the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of countries and people around the world, driven by advances in technology, trade, and communication. It encompasses economic, political, cultural, and social dimensions and has both positive and negative impacts on people's lives, including job creation and loss, cultural exchange and homogenization, and the diffusion of political ideas and practices.}} \]
