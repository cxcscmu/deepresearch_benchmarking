Alright, so I need to figure out how music affects people. That seems pretty broad, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I should probably understand what aspects of people's lives music can influence. Maybe it's their emotions, their behavior, their cognitive functions—things like that. Let me start by thinking about my own experiences with music.

Personally, I know that music can really change my mood. Like, if I'm feeling down and I listen to something upbeat, it can lift my spirits. Conversely, if I'm anxious, maybe some calm, slow music can help relax me. So, emotional impact is definitely one area. But I need to back this up with actual research and facts, not just my personal feelings.

I should probably look into some studies or articles that have been written on this topic. Maybe there are psychological studies that have investigated how music affects different aspects of human behavior and emotion. It might also be interesting to see if different types of music have different effects.

Let me consider making a list of possible areas where music could have an impact:

1. Emotional state

2. Cognitive performance (like concentration, memory)

3. Physical responses (heart rate, breathing)

4. Social behavior

5. Mood improvement

6. Stress reduction

7. Motivation

That seems like a good starting point. Now, I need to find some reliable sources that can provide insights into these areas.

Maybe I can start by searching for "how music affects emotions" and see what comes up. I should look for peer-reviewed articles or articles from reputable sources like universities or well-known psychology websites.

Another thing to consider is that different cultures may have different relationships with music, so perhaps there's a cultural aspect to how music affects people. It might be worth exploring that as well.

Also, thinking about the brain and how it processes music could be insightful. I recall that there's a field called neuromusicology or something like that, which studies the neural basis of music perception and production. Maybe looking into that could provide some deeper understanding.

Wait, maybe I should define what music is before delving too deep. Music is an art form that involves organized sounds and silence, often involving melody, harmony, and rhythm. But even that definition might be too simplistic, as music can be very diverse across cultures and time periods.

Perhaps I should approach this by considering the different ways people engage with music. For example, active engagement like playing an instrument or singing, and passive engagement like listening to music. Maybe these different modes of engagement have different effects on people.

Also, the context in which music is experienced might matter. For instance, listening to music alone in your room versus hearing it in a public concert setting could elicit different responses.

I should also think about the volume at which music is played. Loud music might have different effects compared to soft music.

Moreover, the lyrics in songs can carry meaningful messages that can influence listeners, especially in genres like rap or rock where lyrics are prominent.

It might be useful to categorize the effects of music into positive and negative impacts. For example, music can be therapeutic and help with mental health, but it could also potentially have negative effects, like triggering bad memories or increasing anxiety in certain situations.

Wait a minute, I should be careful not to generalize too much. What affects one person positively might affect another negatively, depending on individual preferences and circumstances.

Maybe I need to acknowledge that the impact of music is highly subjective and varies from person to person.

But still, there must be some general patterns or trends that researchers have observed.

Let me try to structure this better. Perhaps I can look into specific examples or case studies where music has been used to achieve certain outcomes, like in therapy or in advertising.

In therapy, music therapy is a recognized practice that uses music to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. So, there must be documented evidence of its effectiveness in certain areas.

In advertising, music is often used to evoke特定的情感或增强品牌记忆。了解音乐如何在这些情境中发挥作用可能会提供一些见解。

此外，学校和工作场所也可能使用背景音乐来影响学生和员工的表现。有研究探讨过音乐对学习和工作效率的影响吗？

我记得在高中时，有些同学喜欢在学习时听古典音乐，认为它能帮助集中注意力。这可能与所谓的“莫扎特效应”有关，但我不确定这是否被科学证实。

也许我应该调查一下“莫扎特效应”的真实性。这是指听莫扎特的音乐可以暂时提高空间推理能力的说法。但据我所知，这一效应的存在是有争议的。

所以，在讨论音乐对认知功能的影响时，需要谨慎对待这类声称。

另外，音乐还在运动和健身中扮演重要角色。很多人在跑步或锻炼时听音乐，因为它可以提高动力和耐力。有没有研究支持这一点呢？

看来我需要收集更多关于音乐在不同领域影响的证据。

也许我可以制定一个计划，分步骤来探索这个问题：

第一步：研究音乐对情绪的影响。

第二步：探究音乐对认知功能的潜在影响。

第三步：考察音乐的生理效应，如心率和呼吸的变化。

第四步：分析音乐在社会和文化背景下的作用。

第五步：探讨音乐在治疗和康复中的应用。

第六步：考虑音乐的负面影响，如果有的话。

这样分阶段进行，可以使我的研究更加系统和全面。

现在，让我从第一步开始，即音乐对情绪的影响。

我需要找到一些研究，说明音乐如何影响人的情绪状态。也许可以从情感共鸣或者音乐诱发的情绪反应等方面入手。

比如说，快乐的音乐能让人们感到高兴，而悲伤的音乐则可能引发哀伤的情绪。

但是，有时候人们会故意听与他们当前情绪不匹配的音乐，比如在难过的时候听欢快的歌曲，这又会产生什么效果呢？

也许这种情况下，音乐可以帮助他们转移注意力或改变情绪。

另外，音乐疗法中常常利用音乐来帮助人们表达和处理情绪，特别是对于那些难以用语言表达自己感受的人，比如儿童或某些心理健康问题患者。

所以，音乐在情绪调节方面似乎有着重要的作用。

不过，我还是需要找到具体的研究来支持这些观点。

让我尝试进行一次搜索，看看能否找到一些相关的研究或综述文章。

Abstract
This volume presents an integrative review of the relationship between music and emotions. The first section reflects the various interdisciplinary perspectives, taking on board views from philosophy, psychology, musicology, biology, anthropology, and sociology. The second section addresses the role of our emotions in the composition of music, the ways that emotions can be communicated via musical structure, and the use of music to express emotions within the cinema. The third section looks at the emotions of the performer--how they communicate emotion, how their emotional state affects their performance. The final section looks at the ways in which our emotions are guided and influenced while listening to music, whether actively or passively.

Music and emotion
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Simon Vouet: Saint Cecilia, c.   1626
Research into music and emotion seeks to understand the psychological relationship between human affect and music. The field, a branch of music psychology, covers numerous areas of study, including the nature of emotional reactions to music, how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt, and which components of a musical composition or performance may elicit certain reactions. The research draws upon, and has significant implications for, such areas as philosophy, musicology, music therapy, music theory and aesthetics, as well as the acts of musical composition and of musical performance .

Philosophical approaches[edit]
Appearance emotionalism[edit]
Two of the most influential philosophers in the aesthetics of music are Stephen Davies and Jerrold Levinson.[1] [2] Davies calls his view of the expressiveness of emotions in music "appearance emotionalism", which holds that music expresses emotion without feeling it. Objects can convey emotion because their structures can contain certain characteristics that resemble emotional expression. "The resemblance that counts most for music's expressiveness ... is between music's temporally unfolding dynamic structure and configurations of human behaviour associated with the expression of emotion." [3] The observer can note emotions from the listener's posture, gait, gestures, attitude, and comportment. [4]
Associations between musical features and emotion differ among individuals. Appearance emotionalism claims many listeners' perceiving associations constitutes the expressiveness of music.  Which musical features are more commonly associated with which emotions is part of music psychology.  Davies claims that expressiveness is an objective property of music and not subjective in the sense of being projected into the music by the listener. Music's expressiveness is certainly response-dependent, i.e. it is realized in the listener's judgement.  Skilled listeners very similarly attribute emotional expressiveness to a certain piece of music, thereby indicating according to Davies (2006) that the expressiveness of music is somewhat objective because if the music lacked expressiveness, then no expression could be projected into it as a reaction to the music.
The process theory[edit]
The philosopher Jenefer Robinson [5] assumes the existence of a mutual dependence between cognition and elicitation in her description of 'emotions as process, music as process' theory (or 'process' theory). Robinson argues that the process of emotional elicitation begins with an 'automatic, immediate response that initiates motor and autonomic activity and prepares us for possible action' causing a process of cognition that may enable listeners to 'name' the felt emotion. This series of events continually exchanges with new, incoming information. Robinson argues that emotions may transform into one another, causing blends, conflicts, and ambiguities that make impede describing with one word the emotional state that one experiences at any given moment; instead, inner feelings are better thought of as the products of multiple emotional 'streams'. Robinson argues that music is a series of simultaneous processes, and that it therefore is an ideal medium for mirroring such more 'cognitive' aspects of emotion as musical themes' 'desiring' resolution or leitmotif's mirrors memory processes. These simultaneous musical processes can reinforce or conflict with each other and thus also express the way one emotion 'morphs into another over time'.
Conveying emotion through music[edit]
The ability to perceive emotion in music is said to develop early in childhood, and improve significantly throughout development. [6] The capacity to perceive emotion in music is also subject to cultural influences, and both similarities and differences in emotion perception have been observed in cross-cultural studies. [7] [8] Empirical research has looked at which emotions can be conveyed as well as what structural factors in music help contribute to the perceived emotional expression. There are two schools of thought on how we interpret emotion in music. The cognitivists' approach argues that music simply displays an emotion, but does not allow for the personal experience of emotion in the listener. Emotivists argue that music elicits real emotional responses in the listener. [9] [10]
It has been argued that the emotion experienced from a piece of music is a multiplicative function of  structural features, performance features, listener features, contextual features and extra-musical features of the piece, shown as:
Experienced Emotion = Structural features × Performance features × Listener features × Contextual features × Extra-Musical features
where:
Structural features = Segmental features × Suprasegmental features
Performance features = Performer skill × Performer state
Listener features = Musical expertise × Stable disposition × Current motivation
Contextual features = Location × Event [9]
Extra-musical features = Non-auditory features × Expertise [11]
Structural features[edit]
Structural features are divided into two parts, segmental features and suprasegmental features. Segmental features are the individual sounds or tones that make up the music; this includes acoustic structures such as duration, amplitude, and pitch. Suprasegmental features are the foundational structures of a piece, such as melody, tempo and rhythm.[9] There are a number of specific musical features that are highly associated with particular emotions. [12] Within the factors affecting emotional expression in music, tempo is typically regarded as the most important, but a number of other factors, such as mode, loudness, and melody, also influence the emotional valence of the piece. [12]
Structural Feature
Definition
Associated Emotions
Tempo
The speed or pace of a musical piece
Fast tempo: excitement, anger. Slow tempo: sadness, serenity.
Mode
The type of scale
Major tonality: happiness, joy. Minor tonality: sadness.
Loudness
The physical strength and amplitude of a sound
Intensity, power, or anger
Melody
The linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity
Complementing harmonies: happiness, relaxation, serenity. Clashing harmonies: excitement, anger, unpleasantness.
Rhythm
The regularly recurring pattern or beat of a song
Smooth/consistent rhythm: happiness, peace. Rough/irregular rhythm: amusement, uneasiness. Varied rhythm: joy.
Some studies find that perception of basic emotional features are a cultural universal, though people can more easily perceive emotion, and perceive more nuanced emotion, in music from their own culture. [13] [14] [15]
Music has a direct connection to emotional states present in human beings. Different musical structures have been found to have a relationship with physiological responses. Research has shown that suprasegmental structures such as tonal space, specifically dissonance, create unpleasant negative emotions in participants. The emotional responses were measured with physiological assessments, such as skin conductance and electromyographic signals (EMG), while participants listened to musical excerpts. [16] Further research on psychophysiological measures pertaining to music were conducted and found similar results; musical structures of rhythmic articulation, accentuation, and tempo were found to correlate strongly with physiological measures, the measured used here included heart rate and respiratory monitors that correlated with self-report questionnaires. [17]
Music also affects socially-relevant memories, specifically memories produced by nostalgic musical excerpts (e.g., music from a significant time period in one’s life, like music listened to on road trips). Musical structures are more strongly interpreted in certain areas of the brain when the music evokes nostalgia. The interior frontal gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, and insula were all identified to have a stronger correlation with nostalgic music than not. [18] Brain activity is a very individualized concept with many of the musical excerpts having certain effects based on individuals’ past life experiences, thus this caveat should be kept in mind when generalizing findings across individuals.
Performance features[edit]
Performance features refer to the manner in which a piece of music is executed by the performer(s). These are broken into two categories: performer skills, and performer state. Performer skills are the compound ability and appearance of the performer; including physical appearance, reputation, and technical skills. The performer state is the interpretation, motivation, and stage presence of the performer. [9]
Listener features[edit]
Listener features refer to the individual and social identity of the listener(s). This includes their personality, age, knowledge of music, and motivation to listen to the music. [9]
Contextual features[edit]
Contextual features are aspects of the performance such as the location and the particular occasion for the performance (i.e., funeral, wedding, dance). [9]
Extra-musical features[edit]
Extra-musical features refer to  extra-musical information detached from auditory music signals, such as the genre or style of music. [11]
These different factors influence expressed emotion at different magnitudes, and their effects are compounded by one another. Thus, experienced emotion is felt to a stronger degree if more factors are present. The order the factors are listed within the model denotes how much weight in the equation they carry. For this reason, the bulk of research has been done in structural features and listener features. [9]
Conflicting cues[edit]
Which emotion is perceived is dependent on the context of the piece of music. Past research has argued that opposing emotions like happiness and sadness fall on a bipolar scale, where both cannot be felt at the same time. [19] More recent research has suggested that happiness and sadness are experienced separately, which implies that they can be felt concurrently. [19] One study investigated the latter possibility by having participants listen to computer-manipulated musical excerpts that have mixed cues between tempo and mode. [19] Examples of mix-cue music include a piece with major key and slow tempo, and a minor-chord piece with a fast tempo. Participants then rated the extent to which the piece conveyed happiness or sadness. The results indicated that mixed-cue music conveys both happiness and sadness; however, it remained unclear whether participants perceived happiness and sadness simultaneously or vacillated between these two emotions. [19] A follow-up study was done to examine these possibilities. While listening to mixed or consistent cue music, participants pressed one button when the music conveyed happiness, and another button when it conveyed sadness. [20] The results revealed that subjects pressed both buttons simultaneously during songs with conflicting cues. [20] These findings indicate that listeners can perceive  both happiness and sadness concurrently.  This has significant implications for how the structural features influence emotion, because when a mix of structural cues is used, a number of emotions may be conveyed. [20]
Specific listener features[edit]
Development[edit]
Studies indicate that the ability to understand emotional messages in music starts early, and improves throughout child development. [6] [12] [21] Studies investigating music and emotion in children primarily play a musical excerpt for children and have them look at pictorial expressions of faces. These facial expressions display different emotions and children are asked to select the face that best matches the music's emotional tone. [22] [23] [24] Studies have shown that children are able to assign specific emotions to pieces of music; however, there is debate regarding the age at which this ability begins. [6] [12] [21]
Infants[edit]
An infant is often exposed to a mother's speech that is musical in nature. It is possible that the motherly singing allows the mother to relay emotional messages to the infant. [25] Infants also tend to prefer positive speech to neutral speech as well as happy music to negative music. [22] [25] It has also been posited that listening to their mother's singing may play a role in identity formation. [25] This hypothesis is supported by a study that interviewed adults and asked them to describe musical experiences from their childhood. Findings showed that music was good for developing knowledge of emotions during childhood. [26]
Pre-school children[edit]
These studies have shown that children at the age of 4 are able to begin to distinguish between emotions found in musical excerpts in ways that are similar to adults. [22] [23] The ability to distinguish these musical emotions seems to increase with age until adulthood. [24] However, children at the age of 3 were unable to make the distinction between emotions expressed in music through matching a facial expression with the type of emotion found in the music. [23] Some emotions, such as anger and fear, were also found to be harder to distinguish within music. [24] [27]
Elementary-age children[edit]
In studies with four-year-olds and five-year-olds, they are asked to label musical excerpts with the affective labels "happy", "sad", "angry", and "afraid". [6] Results in one study showed that four-year-olds did not perform above chance with the labels "sad" and "angry", and the five-year-olds did not perform above chance with the label "afraid". [6] A follow-up study found conflicting results, where five-year-olds performed much like adults. However, all ages confused categorizing "angry" and "afraid". [6] Pre-school and elementary-age children listened to twelve short melodies, each in either major or minor mode, and were instructed to choose between four pictures of faces: happy, contented, sad, and angry. [12] All the children, even as young as three years old, performed above chance in assigning positive faces with major mode and negative faces with minor mode. [12]
Personality effects[edit]
Different people perceive events differently based upon their individual characteristics. Similarly, the emotions elicited by listening to different types of music seem to be affected by factors such as personality and previous musical training. [28] [29] [30] People with the personality type of agreeableness have been found to have higher emotional responses to music in general. Stronger sad feelings have also been associated with people with personality types of agreeableness and neuroticism. While some studies have shown that musical training can be correlated with music that evoked mixed feelings [28] as well as higher IQ and test of emotional comprehension scores, [29] other studies refute the claim that musical training affects perception of emotion in music. [27] [31] It is also worth noting that previous exposure to music can affect later behavioral choices, schoolwork, and social interactions. [32] Therefore, previous music exposure does seem to have an effect on the personality and emotions of a child later in their life, and would subsequently affect their ability to perceive as well as express emotions during exposure to music. Gender, however, has not been shown to lead to a difference in perception of emotions found in music. [27] [31] Further research into which factors affect an individual's perception of emotion in music and the ability of the individual to have music-induced emotions are needed.
Eliciting emotion through music[edit]
Along with the research that music conveys an emotion to its listener(s), it has also been shown that music can produce emotion in the listener(s). [33] This view often causes debate because the emotion is produced within the listener, and is consequently hard to measure. In spite of controversy, studies have shown observable responses to elicited emotions, which reinforces the Emotivists' view that music does elicit real emotional responses. [6] [10]
Responses to elicited emotion[edit]
The structural features of music not only help convey an emotional message to the listener, but also may create emotion in the listener. [9] These emotions can be completely new feelings or may be an extension of previous emotional events. Empirical research has shown how listeners can absorb the piece's expression as their own emotion, as well as invoke a unique response based on their personal experiences. [21]
Basic emotions[edit]
In research on eliciting emotion, participants report personally feeling a certain emotion in response to hearing a musical piece. [33] Researchers have investigated whether the same structures that conveyed a particular emotion could elicit it as well. The researchers presented excerpts of fast tempo, major mode music and slow tempo, minor tone music to participants; these musical structures were chosen because they are known to convey happiness and sadness respectively. [19] Participants rated their own emotions with elevated levels of happiness after listening to music with structures that convey happiness and elevated sadness after music with structures that convey sadness. [19] This evidence suggests that the same structures that convey emotions in music can also elicit those same emotions in the listener.
In light of this finding, there has been particular controversy about music eliciting negative emotions. Cognitivists argue that choosing to listen to music that elicits negative emotions like sadness would be paradoxical, as listeners would not willingly strive to induce sadness. [10] However, emotivists purport that music does elicit negative emotions, and listeners knowingly choose to listen in order to feel sadness in an impersonal way, similar to a viewer's desire to watch a tragic film. [10] [33] The reasons why people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad has been explored by means of interviewing people about their motivations for doing so. As a result of this research it has indeed been found that people sometimes listen to sad music when feeling sad to intensify feelings of sadness. Other reasons for listening to sad music when feeling sad were; in order to retrieve memories, to feel closer to other people, for cognitive reappraisal, to feel befriended by the music, to distract oneself, and for mood enhancement. [34]
Researchers have also found an effect between one's familiarity with a piece of music and the emotions it elicits. [35] In one study, half of participants were played twelve random musical excerpts one time, and rated their emotions after each piece. The other half of the participants listened to twelve random excerpts five times, and started their ratings on the third repetition. Findings showed that participants who listened to the excerpts five times rated their emotions with higher intensity than the participants who listened to them only once. [35] This suggests that familiarity with a piece of music increases the emotions experienced by the listener.
Emotional memories and actions[edit]
Music may not only elicit new emotions, but connect listeners with other emotional sources. [9] Music serves as a powerful cue to recall emotional memories back into awareness. [36] Because music is such a pervasive part of social life, present in weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies, it brings back emotional memories that are often already associated with it. [9] [21] Music is also processed by the lower, sensory levels of the brain, making it impervious to later memory distortions. Therefore creating a strong connection between emotion and music within memory makes it easier to recall one when prompted by the other. [9] Music can also tap into empathy, inducing emotions that are assumed to be felt by the performer or composer. Listeners can become sad because they recognize that those emotions must have been felt by the composer, [37] [38] much as the viewer of a play can empathize for the actors.
Listeners may also respond to emotional music through action. [9] Throughout history music was composed to inspire people into specific action - to march, dance, sing or fight. Consequently, heightening the emotions in all these events.  In fact, many people report being unable to sit still when certain rhythms are played, in some cases even engaging in subliminal actions when physical manifestations should be suppressed. [21] Examples of this can be seen in young children's spontaneous outbursts into motion upon hearing music, or exuberant expressions shown at concerts. [21]
Juslin & Västfjäll's BRECVEM model[edit]
Juslin & Västfjäll [39] [40] developed a model of seven ways in which music can elicit emotion, called the BRECVEM model.
Brain Stem Reflex: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by music because one or more fundamental acoustical characteristics of the music are taken by the brain stem to signal a potentially important and urgent event. All other things being equal, sounds that are sudden, loud, dissonant, or feature fast temporal patterns induce arousal or feelings of unpleasantness in listeners...Such responses reflect the impact of auditory sensations – music as sound in the most basic sense.'
Rhythmic Entrainment:[41] 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is evoked by a piece of music because a powerful, external rhythm in the music influences some internal bodily rhythm of the listener (e.g. heart rate), such that the latter rhythm adjusts toward and eventually 'locks in' to a common periodicity. The adjusted heart rate can then spread to other components of emotion such as feeling, through proprioceptive feedback. This may produce an increased level of arousal in the listener.'
Evaluative Conditioning: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music simply because this stimulus has been paired repeatedly with other positive or negative stimuli. Thus, for instance, a particular piece of music may have occurred repeatedly together in time with a specific event that always made you happy (e.g., meeting your best friend). Over time, through repeated pairings, the music will eventually come to evoke happiness even in the absence of the friendly interaction.'
Emotional Contagion: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced by a piece of music because the listener perceives the emotional expression of the music, and then "mimics" this expression internally, which by means of either peripheral feedback from muscles, or a more direct activation of the relevant emotional representations in the brain, leads to an induction of the same emotion.'
Visual Imagery: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because he or she conjures up visual images (e.g., of a beautiful landscape) while listening to the music.'
Episodic memory: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because the music evokes a memory of a particular event in the listener's life. This is sometimes referred to as the "Darling, they are playing our tune" phenomenon.' [42]
Musical expectancy: 'This refers to a process whereby an emotion is induced in a listener because a specific feature of the music violates, delays, or confirms the listener's expectations about the continuation of the music.'
Musical expectancy[edit]
With regards to violations of expectation in music several interesting results have been found. It has for example been found that listening to unconventional music may sometimes cause a meaning threat and result in compensatory behaviour in order to restore meaning. [43]
Aesthetic Judgement and BRECVEMA[edit]
In 2013, Juslin created an additional aspect to the BRECVEM model called aesthetic judgement. [44] This is the criteria which each individual has as a metric for music's aesthetic value. This can involve a number of varying personal preferences, such as the message conveyed, skill presented or novelty of style or idea.
Comparison of conveyed and elicited emotions[edit]
Evidence for emotion in music[edit]
There has been a bulk of evidence that listeners can identify specific emotions with certain types of music, but there has been less concrete evidence that music may elicit emotions. [9] This is due to the fact that elicited emotion is subjective; and thus, it is difficult to find a valid criterion to study it. [9] Elicited and conveyed emotion in music is usually understood from three types of evidence: self-report, physiological responses, and expressive behavior. Researchers use one or a combination of these methods to investigate emotional reactions to music. [9]
Self-report[edit]
The self-report method is a verbal report by the listener regarding what they are experiencing. This is the most widely used method for studying emotion and has shown that people identify emotions and personally experience emotions while listening to music. [9] Research in the area has shown that listeners' emotional responses are highly consistent. In fact, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on music performance found that happiness, sadness, tenderness, threat, and anger were identified above chance by listeners. [45] Another study compared untrained listeners to musically trained listeners. [45] Both groups were required to categorize musical excerpts that conveyed similar emotions. The findings showed that the categorizations were not different between the trained and untrained; thus demonstrating that the untrained listeners are highly accurate in perceiving emotion. [45] It is more difficult to find evidence for elicited emotion, as it depends solely on the subjective response of the listener. This leaves reporting vulnerable to self-report biases such as participants responding according to social prescriptions or responding as they think the experimenter wants them to. [9] As a result, the validity of the self-report method is often questioned, and consequently researchers are reluctant to draw definitive conclusions solely from these reports. [9]
Physiological responses[edit]
Emotions are known to create physiological, or bodily, changes in a person, which can be tested experimentally. Some evidence shows one of these changes is within the nervous system. [9] Arousing music is related to increased heart rate and muscle tension; calming music is connected to decreased heart rate and muscle tension, and increased skin temperature. [9] Other research identifies outward physical responses such as shivers or goose bumps to be caused by changes in harmony and tears or lump-in-the-throat provoked by changes in melody. [46] Researchers test these responses through the use of instruments for physiological measurement, such as recording pulse rate. [9]
Expressive behavior[edit]
People are also known to show outward manifestations of their emotional states while listening to music. Studies using facial electromyography (EMG) have found that people react with subliminal facial expressions when listening to expressive music. [21] In addition, music provides a stimulus for expressive behavior in many social contexts, such as concerts, dances, and ceremonies. [9] [21] Although these expressive behaviors can be measured experimentally, there have been very few controlled studies observing this behavior. [9]
Strength of effects[edit]
Within the comparison between elicited and conveyed emotions, researchers have examined the relationship between these two types of responses to music. In general, research agrees that feeling and perception ratings are highly correlated, but not identical. [19] More specifically, studies are inconclusive as to whether one response has a stronger effect than the other, and in what ways these two responses relate. [19] [35] [47]
Conveyed more than elicited[edit]
In one study, participants heard a random selection of 24 excerpts, displaying six types of emotions, five times in a row. [35] Half the participants described the emotions the music conveyed, and the other half responded with how the music made them feel. The results found that emotions conveyed by music were more intense than the emotions elicited by the same piece of music. [35] Another study investigated under what specific conditions strong emotions were conveyed. Findings showed that ratings for conveyed emotions were higher in happy responses to music with consistent cues for happiness (i.e., fast tempo and major mode), for sad responses to music with consistent cues for sadness (i.e., slow tempo and minor mode,) and for sad responses in general. [19] These studies suggest that people can recognize the emotion displayed in music more readily than feeling it personally.
Sometimes conveyed, sometimes elicited[edit]
Another study that had 32 participants listen to twelve musical pieces and found that the strength of perceived and elicited emotions were dependent on the structures of the piece of music. [47] Perceived emotions were stronger than felt emotions when listeners rated for arousal and positive and negative activation. On the other hand, elicited emotions were stronger than perceived emotions when rating for pleasantness. [47]
Elicited more than conveyed[edit]
In another study analysis revealed that emotional responses were stronger than the listeners' perceptions of emotions. [47] This study used a between-subjects design, where 20 listeners judged to what extent they perceived four emotions: happy, sad, peaceful, and scared. A separate 19 listeners rated to what extent they experienced each of these emotions. The findings showed that all music stimuli elicited specific emotions for the group of participants rating elicited emotion, while music stimuli only occasionally conveyed emotion to the participants in the group identifying which emotions the music conveyed. [47] Based on these inconsistent findings, there is much research left to be done in order to determine how conveyed and elicited emotions are similar and different. There is disagreement about whether music induces 'true' emotions or if the emotions reported as felt in studies are instead just participants stating the emotions found in the music they are listening to. [48] [49]
Music as a therapeutic tool[edit]
Main article: Music therapy
Music therapy as a therapeutic tool has been shown to be an effective treatment for various ailments. Therapeutic techniques involve eliciting emotions by listening to music, composing music or lyrics and performing music. [50]
Music therapy sessions may have the ability to help drug users who are attempting to break a drug habit, with users reporting feeling better able to feel emotions without the aid of drug use. [51] Music therapy may also be a viable option for people experiencing extended stays in a hospital due to illness. In one study, music therapy provided child oncology patients with enhanced environmental support elements and elicited more engaging behaviors from the child. [52] When treating troubled teenagers, a study by Keen revealed that music therapy has allowed therapists to interact with teenagers with less resistance, thus facilitating self-expression in the teenager.[citation needed]
Music therapy has also shown great promise in individuals with autism, serving as an emotional outlet for these patients. While other avenues of emotional expression and understanding may be difficult for people with autism, music may provide those with limited understanding of socio-emotional cues a way of accessing emotion. [53]

Abstract
Music is universal at least partly because it expresses emotion and regulates affect. Associations between music and emotion have been examined regularly by music psychologists. Here, we review recent findings in three areas: (a) the communication and perception of emotion in music, (b) the emotional consequences of music listening, and (c) predictors of music preferences.

... novel models discussed previously are working to address these contextual and multidimensional expressions, but continued work into more holistic expressions continues to be needed. It is worth noting that work suggesting that musical emotions emerge as a byproduct of extra-musical associations that are tied to a place and time (Kivy 1990;Konečni 2008; Swaminathan and Schellenberg 2015), autobiographical memories, (Scherer 2004). Differences between the felt and perceived emotions (Evans and Schubert 2008;Gabrielsson 2002;Juslin and Sloboda 2011) suggest that there may be categorical differences in the way that emotion is understood in the mind of the listener.  ...
... Researchers confirmed that background music can have a positive impact on the affective state of individuals as they engage in varying types of work-related tasks (Fassbender et al. 2012;Lesiuk 2005;Schellenberg and Winner 2011;Sahebdel and Khodadust 2014;Su et al. 2017;Thompson et al. 2001), leading to the suggestion that music may have some measurable impact on performance. The emotions that individuals perceive can have universal qualities across cultures, but the emotions that music portrays are strongest when articulated by an individual from a musical culture that aligns with that music selection (Balkwill et al. 2004;Fritz et al. 2009;Laukka et al. 2013; Swaminathan and Schellenberg 2015) suggesting that despite the calls for universality in musical emotion, there may be limitations to how music as a stimuli during these types of tasks may be processed. This also brings into question how music works cross-culturally and the ability of music to work in the same way for all learners, all the time.  ...

... The potential for music to influence or invoke emotions in listeners is welldocumented. It is common for individuals to use music to modulate and regulate their moods (Saarikallio, 2011), and many researchers have investigated musicinduced emotional experiences (for reviews, see Eerola et al., 2018;Sachs et al., 2015; Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). Although some studies of perceived (as opposed to experienced) emotional content of music have included physiological markers, the majority of recent studies that incorporate physiological correlates of emotion during music listening start from the assumption that listeners feel emotions in response to music.  ...

... Regarding the first area, studies seek to understand how music can influence processes such as memory and learning (Ferreri & Verga, 2016). In the second case, they focus on how this artistic element can have an impact at the affective level, that is, which emotions and moods are caused by different types of music and how these are related to emotional regulation (Swaminathan & Schellenberg, 2015). Finally, the last area focuses on studies associated with identity aspects and interpersonal and intergroup relations (Bodner & Gilboa, 2009) that are the focus of interest of this research.  ...

Abstract
Music's ability to express and arouse emotions is a mystery that has fascinated both
experts and laymen at least since ancient Greece. This book offers an account of
this domain. It provides coverage of the many approaches that may be said to define
the field of music and emotion, in all its breadth and depth. The first section
offers multi-disciplinary perspectives on musical emotions from philosophy,
musicology, psychology, neurobiology, anthropology, and sociology. The second
section features methodologically oriented chapters on the measurement of emotions
via different channels (e.g., sel ... More

Abstract and Figures
The difficulty of distinguishing between mood and emotion is an issue that confronts many researchers investigating affective response to music. This paper reports a systematic interpretive review of 95 articles in which the focus was on questioning how researchers conceptualized mood and emotion, measured it, and drew conclusions from their findings. Results revealed a significant difference in the length of musical stimuli between studies of emotional response and those measuring mood changes, suggesting that this is the primary criterion by which researchers currently distinguish moods and emotions. However, it is argued that mood studies, in particular, could benefit from study designs that use appropriately worded instruments administered at several poststimulus time points in order to better distinguish the phenomenon of interest

... Music research has extensively investigated how music listening can modulate both emotion (usually referred to as brief and intense physiological, affective, and cognitive responses) and mood (referred to more enduring and less intense affective state; Garrido, 2014). Studies on emotional responses have been mainly focusing (see Garrido, 2014) on how music can take the listener on a journey through negative and positive emotions (i.e., emotional valence) as well as calm/relaxed and excited/stimulated states (i.e., arousal; Bigand et al., 2005;Juslin & Laukka, 2004).  ...

... The first model, when applied to music, has evidenced that happiness and sadness are the emotions that are most robustly expressed and induced through music (Gabrielsson & Juslin, 1996;Krumhansl, 1997). As for the second main model, studies have been focusing on how music can take the listener on a journey through negative and positive valence as well as calm/relaxed and excited/stimulated states (i.e., arousal) (Bigand et al., 2005; Garrido, 2015; Juslin & Laukka, 2003). In recent years, researchers have introduced models that are specific to music, rather than to emotions induced by any kind of stimuli (Brattico, 2020;Eerola & Vuoskoski, 2013;Juslin, 2013;Zentner et al., 2008).  ...

... Both aspects are related to emotional reactions that can be triggered by a piece of music. The emotion-regulative role of music has led to numerous studies in music psychology research (Garrido, 2014). Models that focus on the mechanisms underlying emotional reactions to music (e.g., Juslin, & Västfjäll, 2008) or on music-related regulation strategies (Baltazar & Saarikallio, 2019;van Goethem & Sloboda, 2011) have been developed.  ...

... Musical preference may be understood as an inclination or a predilection for a specific type of music (Hargreaves et al., 2015). Studies show that these choices are influenced by psychological, socioeconomic, educational, religious, and other factors (Bourdieu, 2010; Garrido, 2014; George et al., 2007;Hui, 2009). For instance, studies of musical preference in relation to gender have shown that men are more inclined to prefer genres that are more vigorous (e.g., heavy metal), musically more complex (e.g., jazz), and that strengthen their interpersonal relationships (e.g., rap) (Boer et al., 2012;Dobrota & Ercegovac, 2019), whereas women tend to prefer light music (e.g., pop), music with greater emotional content (e.g., country), and music that is related to dance (e.g., Latin music) (Colley, 2008).  ...

The experimental manipulation of immersion comprised a 'high immersion' head-mounted display (HMD) 360° spherical video (hereafter 'Immersive VR') and 'low immersion' desktop PC (2D) video (hereafter 'Desktop Video') of the same performance of Mozart's 'Agnus Dei', from Mozart's Coronation Mass (mass No.15 in C Major, K.317), scored for soloists, choir and orchestra, and lasting 4 minutes. This duration was sufficient to induce emotions (> 30s) (Garrido, 2014) and avoid adverse physiological reactions (< 20 mins) (Regan, 1995). This performance is in slow (54 bpm) three-four time, with a relatively simple texture and structure featuring solo soprano and orchestra in a cathedral without an audience.  ...

Alright, I've got some initial information on how music affects people. From the search results, it seems that music can influence various aspects of human life, including emotions, cognitive functions, physical responses, social behavior, and even therapeutic applications. The first source I found is a Wikipedia page on "Music and emotion," which provides a comprehensive overview of how music conveys and elicits emotions. It mentions that music can express emotions through its structural features like tempo, mode, and melody, and that listeners can perceive these emotions based on their cultural background and personal experiences.

Another source is a research article titled "Current Emotion Research in Music Psychology" by Swathi Swaminathan and E. Glenn Schellenberg. This article reviews recent findings in three areas: communication and perception of emotion in music, emotional consequences of music listening, and predictors of music preferences. This seems like a valuable resource for understanding the current state of research in music and emotion.

The third source appears to be a book chapter from the "Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications" edited by Patrik N. Juslin and John A. Sloboda. This handbook seems to cover a wide range of topics related to music and emotion, including theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and applications in fields like education and therapy.

Lastly, there's a research paper by Sandra Garrido titled "A Systematic Review of the Measurement of Mood and Emotion in Response to Music." This paper critically examines how researchers have conceptualized and measured mood and emotion in music studies, highlighting issues and providing recommendations for future research.

Given this information, I can start organizing my thoughts on how music affects people. First, I need to distinguish between the conveyed emotions in music and the emotions elicited in listeners. From what I've read, conveyed emotions refer to the emotions that the music seems to express, while elicited emotions are those actually felt by the listener.

According to the Wikipedia article, the perception of emotion in music is influenced by structural features such as tempo, mode, and melody. For example, fast tempo and major mode are often associated with happiness, while slow tempo and minor mode are linked to sadness. This suggests that music can convey specific emotions through its compositional elements.

Moreover, the ability to perceive these emotions develops early in childhood and improves with age. Cultural factors also play a role, as people may have different associations based on their cultural background. However, some studies suggest that the perception of basic emotions in music might be universal.

On the other hand, elicited emotions are those that the listener actually experiences while listening to music. There's been debate about whether music can truly elicit emotions or if listeners are merely imagining these emotions. Some researchers argue that music can induce genuine emotional responses, while others believe that the emotions are more cognitive in nature.

Empirical evidence supports the idea that music can elicit emotions. For instance, listening to sad music can make people feel sad, and listening to upbeat music can improve mood. Additionally, music is often used in therapeutic settings to help regulate emotions and promote well-being.

Furthermore, the context in which music is heard can influence its emotional impact. For example, music in films can enhance the emotional experience of the scene, and music in advertisements is used to evoke specific feelings that align with the product being promoted.

In terms of cognitive effects, music has been shown to influence memory, attention, and even mathematical abilities, although the "Mozart effect" has been somewhat debunked in recent years. Music can also affect physical responses, such as heart rate and breathing, and has been used in exercise to improve performance and endurance.

Socially, music plays a crucial role in bringing people together, fostering a sense of community and shared experience. It can also serve as a means of expressing cultural identity and conveying social messages.

Considering the therapeutic applications, music therapy is a recognized practice that uses music to address various physical, emotional, and cognitive needs. It has been used effectively in treating conditions such as depression, anxiety, and even neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.

In conclusion, music has a profound impact on people's lives, affecting their emotions, cognition, physiology, and social interactions. Its influence is multifaceted and can be harnessed in various ways to enhance well-being and quality of life.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Music affects people in various ways, influencing their emotions, cognitive functions, physical responses, social behavior, and therapeutic outcomes.}} \]
