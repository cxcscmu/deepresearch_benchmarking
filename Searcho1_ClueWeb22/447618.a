So I've got this question: "Why is it argued that ethical transgression is pervasive in social research?" Hmm, okay, I need to understand what this is asking. First off, "ethical transgression" means doing something that goes against ethical rules or principles. "Pervasive" means widespread or widespread. So the question is asking why some people argue that unethical behavior is common in social research.

I'm not entirely sure about this topic, so I think I need to look it up. Maybe there are some famous cases or studies that show this. Let me try to think of some examples.

One thing that comes to mind is the Milgram experiment. I remember learning about that in psychology class. It was where participants were told to give electric shocks to another person as part of a memory test. The shocks got really high voltage, but it was all fake, but the participants didn't know that. Many of them continued giving what they thought were painful shocks because the experimenter told them to. This raised a lot of ethical questions because the participants were put under a lot of stress and duress.

Another example is the Stanford prison experiment, where students were randomly assigned to be prisoners or guards in a simulated prison. The guards started treating the prisoners very badly, and the experiment had to be stopped early because it was getting out of hand. Again, ethical issues arose because the participants were experiencing psychological harm.

These are both classic studies in social psychology, but they raise questions about whether the researchers considered the well-being of the participants enough. Some people argue that these studies crossed ethical lines.

But I need to think broader than just these two examples. Is unethical behavior common in social research overall? Or are these just isolated cases?

Maybe I should look into regulations that govern research with human subjects. I think there are rules like informed consent, minimizing harm, and confidentiality. If these rules are in place, why would ethical transgressions still be pervasive?

Perhaps in practice, researchers don't always follow these guidelines strictly. Maybe there's pressure to get certain results or to publish groundbreaking findings, so they cut corners when it comes to ethics.

Also, social research often involves studying sensitive topics, like sexuality, crime, or political beliefs. In these areas, it might be harder to ensure confidentiality or to avoid causing distress to participants.

Moreover, sometimes the line between ethical and unethical is blurry. What one person considers acceptable, another might see as problematic. So, different researchers might have different standards when it comes to ethics.

I should also consider that social research methods vary widely. There's surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, etc. Each method might have its own set of ethical challenges.

Maybe I need to read some articles or papers on this topic to get a better understanding. Let me see if I can find some resources.

Ethics in research has been around since World War II and is still to this day a growing concern among researchers. The main aim of the researcher is to
“ensure that their studies are directed toward worthwhile goals and that the welfare of their subjects and their research colleagues is protected.” Alan Kimmel, 1988

There are several reasons why it is important for an investigator to adhere to ethical standards in research. First, some of these norms promote the aims of research, such as knowledge, truth, and avoidance of error. For example, prohibitions against fabricating, forging, or misrepresenting research data to promote the truth and avoid error. Second, since research often involves a great deal of cooperation and coordination among many different people in different disciplines and institutions, many of these ethical standards promote the values that are essential to collaborative work, such as trust, accountability, mutual respect, and fairness. For instance, one particular ethical norm, confidentiality, is designed to protect intellectual interests while encouraging collaboration among the participants. Third, ethical norms in research also help to build public support for research. People are more likely to fund research project if they can trust the quality and integrity of research (this particular example is relevant to the scenario being assessed.) Finally, many of the standards of research promote a variety of other important moral and social values, such as social responsibility, human rights, and compliance with the law
So although all these codes, policies and principles are very important and useful but like any set of rules they do not cover every situation that arises in research, they are often conflicting and require considerable interpretation. It is therefore important for the researcher to learn how to interpret, assess and apply various research rules and how to make decisions about how to act in various circumstances. The vast majority of decision making in the conduct of research involves the straightforward application of ethical policies.
Ethical issues that are encountered in applied social research are both subtle and complex, raising difficult moral dilemmas that, from the outside, appear unresolvable. With these dilemmas the researcher is required to strike a delicate balance between the scientific or social requirement of methodology and the human rights and values potentially threatened by the research.
Privacy and confidentiality are two ethical issues that are crucial to social researchers who request individuals to share with them their thoughts attitudes and experiences. The ethical social researcher is one who is aware of ways in which privacy and confidentiality may be jeopardised and safeguarded and is knowledgeable about the effects of privacy and confidentiality on consent.
“The nature of privacy concerns has changed over time as social scientists have become more involved in identifying social problems and testing possible solutions through field research (Boruch & Cecil, 1979)”
Organisational research focus is directed toward personnel – relating issues, including the testing and appraisal of employees for personnel decisions. In conducting these investigations, researchers and consultants may seek to improve on organisations capacities to achieve various goals (e.g. profit for a business, its employees quality of work life or the impact of the organisation on communities in isolate rural areas.
Evaluation research is a major type of applied research, typically undertaken by social scientists to determine if ongoing social programs are working as they should. Evaluations tend to focus on programs that are beneficial in nature, such as remedial education, health care and job training programs.
The results of an evaluation study, in revealing whether a social program is accomplishing what was intended can have immediate impact on social policy and political decisions regarding the program’s fate – whether it should be continued or stopped, its budget and personnel increased or cut backs made.
There are a number of vested interests in the design and implementation of evaluation studies and because their results are likely to affect people’s jobs, education and health. Like research conducted in organisations, evaluation research raises some unique ethical questions about whose interests are served an whose point of view should be represented during the research process (Kidder & Judd, 1986)
With this particular scenario there are two different situations where ethical issues will arise. Firstly, you begin to suspect that food is being stolen from the kitchen and the viability of the project may be at risk. From a researchers point of view suspicions would need to be backed up with hard evidence. If you were to say to you manager, you run the risk of them discharging you and not allowing you to carry out anymore research – how could you possibly imagine that of any of their staff? Although on the other hand if your manager was to take you suspicions on board and further investigate the matter over a closely surveyed period of time, they may benefit and appreciate your integrity that you hold with the company. In a case like this it is often difficult for the evaluator to separate their research role from their role as a work experience placement student. You have been promised the confidentiality of the staff and if you were to say anything about the stolen food it could affect your research and you rapport with the staff. The staff may turn against you and refuse to cooperate after you telling the boss on one of their colleagues.
Throughout the research you must remember what the objective is and if you remain silent with your suspicions, will your results in anyway end up being bias? This will reflect an untrue outcome and the company could face further scrutiny from the funding body.
There is also the legality aspect for the researcher to consider and stealing is against the law, could you live with yourself if you thought that you were covering up for a criminal, no matter how small the offence was? In failing to voice your suspicions Kimmel, (1988) stated you “legally could face prosecution as an “accessory after the fact” for failure to report a crime.”

If I were to be placed in this situation I personally would confront the manager of the company and explain my situation with regards to my research. I believe that stealing is wrong and should not take place no matter how big or small the offence is. Although I can understand why somebody may not say and not only put their research at rick but their social responsibility.
The second scenario where the researcher will be confronted by ethical dilemmas is in carrying out the interviews with some of the senior citizens that are receiving these ‘Meals on Wheels.’ To carry out interviews you will need the consent of the person involved, some elderly clients may not like the prospect of being intimated with questions. The elderly are of the vulnerable sector in our population and should be informed of why the interview is taking place and the effects that their answers could have on the survival and funding of the business while always remembering the objectivity of the research and expressing it in clarity to the senior citizens. The interview will involve asking how they feel about receiving their ‘Meals on Wheels,’ how they approve of the service and how would they feel if this service was to be taken away from them? This could cause distress and emotional shock among the elderly, especially if they thought that their opinion meant the deciding factor of whether the company received funding to continue its business. Many of the elderly could largely depend on this service and there must be no deception in making them fully aware why the interviews are taken place.
The senior citizens should be made aware that the researcher will be evaluating and publishing their results to the company and will have to give an open and honest account of what has been said in the interviews. The researcher is under the obligation from the code of ethics so as not to fabricate the data in anyway. The researcher, if a member of the local community, may feel tempted to fabricate the interview responses so as the company will receive their funding to finance this project as they realise how vital this scheme is for the elderly in this isolated rural area but as Kimmel noted personnel values may play a significant role in social research, therefore researchers must be careful enough to protect the integrity of their inquiries through careful data collection and analysis and accurate and objective reporting of their research findings.
If I were the researcher in carrying out the interviews I would make the elderly entirely aware of the project and encourage them to see how they are beneficiaries of it. This in return will boost their confidence of the company and help portray a better interview for the research. After all if you were a senior citizen who lived in an isolated area and the only person you may see everyday is the delivery driver of ‘Meals on Wheels’, wouldn’t you appreciate the service? Not only are they providing a food service but they also help to bring a warm and friendly atmosphere into the home.
In conclusion ethical decision making is neither a perfectly rational nor entirely timeless enterprise, and even after a considered judgement about the issues involved in a given situation has been made, doubts about whether or not one’s subsequent behaviour was ethical may remain.
As we continue to proceed with social research in applied settings, we can expect a growing wealth of documentation on the conditions under which certain interventions are successful in reducing certain social problems and on what side effects might be anticipated as a result of their implementation.
To proceed ethically it is important for social researchers to bear in mind that their first obligation is to those persons who cooperate with and participate in the research process, and that it is their interests that first must be considered during the preparatory stages of program development.

Introduction
Research refers to a systematic study aimed at making new discoveries or arriving at a dependable solution through an accurate gathering, analysis and interpretation of information. Research can be adventurous and fun because a researcher gets to learn so much and interact with new aspects and concepts which are previously unknown. However, researchers face numerous ethical issues whenever they are conducting research and this is the focus of this discussion.
Ethical Issues
One of the ethical issues that researchers face is getting participants in their research (Babbie, 2008, p.45). There is an ethical principle in social research known as voluntariness. This principle requires that any participant to a research must participate willingly without being coerced, forced or induced.
This is especially in cases where researchers would use prisoners or students in learning institutions for their researches. In line with this is a principle, it will no longer be possible for researcher to conduct any kind of research until those participating show willingness to do so without any kind of inducement such as monetary promises.
The other ethical issue when it comes to social research is the issue of informed consent. This simply means that social researchers and indeed any researcher must ensure that all their participants have a clear understanding of the kind of activity they are engaging in prior to them participating in the research. All participants should be well aware of the nature of the research and the likely consequences they are likely to face whether positive or negative.
The ethics that are applicable in social research also require that researchers take due caution and protect their participants from any potential harm or risk (Babbie, 2010, p.56).
The harm in this case refers to both psychological as well as physical. In ensuring that the participants in a research are fully protected, researchers are required to maintain a high level of confidentiality thereby ensuring that the information provided by the participants is not released to nay other person. Further, researchers can only use such information obtained only for the purposes of research only.
Social researchers are also required in some cases to ensure that their participants are anonymous. This means that their identity is not known and this is especially because of the nature of research which may involve release of highly confidential information. This ensures that participants in a research study are not later victimized based on the information they provided.

Ethical Dilemma
While there are well laid down ethical rules and standards which social researchers are required to observe when conducting their research, there are times that the need to e accurate and therefore obtain valid result may require the researcher to overlook some of the ethical standards (Kimmel, 1988, p.55). It is in this case that researchers face an ethical dilemma where one hand, they need to abide by the ethical standards while on the other hand, there is need to obtain accurate information regarding the study.
Conclusion
Ethics is about what is right or wrong, good or bad. In this case, social researchers are faced with challenges whenever there is a dilemma of observing the ethical standards and obtaining correct information. It may not be possible to give a specific position considering that ethics is wide. Therefore, one may have to deal with a specific issue depending on the circumstances of the case.
One aspect that I found quite interesting as far as research ethics is the fact that it is sometimes caught between a rock and hard place in the sense that there is a dilemma between wanting to protect those participating in the study while at the same time there is need to get accurate results.
It therefore becomes very tricky at times for researchers. What I found disturbing in research ethics is the fact that sometimes researchers flout the standards of ethics in an attempt to get accurate results. It therefore becomes quite disturbing as one wonders where a balance can be struck between getting accurate results and remaining ethical

Ethics is a part of every society and is entwined in every aspect of daily living, however the meaning of ethics or what is ethical differs. Ethics is commonly associated with morality and Webster’s New world Dictionary defines ethical as “conforming to the standards of conduct of a given profession or group.” Knowing what a particular society considers ethical and unethical is what contributes to living successfully in that society. This is the same for researchers; researchers need to be aware of what is considered ethical and unethical conduct of scientific inquiry.

From the time immediately after World War II until the early 1990s, there was a gradually developing consensus about the key ethical principles that should underlie the research endeavor; two events stand out as symbolic of this consensus. The Nuremberg War Crimes Trial following World War II brought to public view the ways German scientists had used captive human subjects as subjects in oftentimes gruesome experiments. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study involved the withholding of known effective treatment for syphilis from African-American participants who were infected.

Events like these forced the reexamination of ethical standards and the gradual development of a consensus that potential human subjects needed to be protected from being used as ‘guinea pigs’ in scientific research. There are several reasons why it is important to adhere to ethical norms in research. First, norms promote the aims of research, such as knowledge, truth, and avoidance of error. For example, prohibitions against fabricating, falsifying, or misrepresenting research data promote the truth and avoid error.

Second, since research often involves a great deal of cooperation and coordination among many different people in different disciplines and institutions, ethical standards promote the values that are essential to collaborative work, such as trust, accountability, mutual respect, and fairness. For example, many ethical norms in research, such as guidelines for authorship, copyright and patenting policies, data sharing policies, and confidentiality rules in peer review, are designed to protect intellectual property interests while encouraging collaboration.
Most researchers want to receive credit for their contributions and do not want to have their ideas stolen or disclosed prematurely. Third, many of the ethical norms help to ensure that researchers can be held accountable to the public. For instance, federal policies on research misconduct, conflicts of interest, the human subject’s protections, and animal care and use are necessary in order to make sure that researchers who are funded by public money can be held accountable to the public. Fourth, ethical norms in research also help to build public support for research. People are more likely to fund research project if they can trust the quality and integrity of research. Finally, many of the norms of research promote a variety of other important moral and social values, such as social responsibility, human rights, and animal welfare, compliance with the law, and health and safety.
Ethical lapses in research can significantly harm human and animal subjects, students, and the public. For example, a researcher who fabricates data in a clinical trial may harm or even kill patients and a researcher who fails to abide by regulations and guidelines relating to radiation or biological safety may jeopardize his health and safety or the health and safety of staff and students. We can’t solve our social problems until we understand how they come about, persist. Social science research offers a way to examine and understand the operation of human social affairs. It provides points of view and technical procedures that uncover things that would otherwise escape our awareness. Often, as it goes, things are not what they seem; social science research can make that clear.
Social research is often seen as an intrusion to people, as it is seen as a disruption in their normal daily activities. Social research examines a society’s attitudes, assumptions, beliefs, trends, stratifications and rules. Social research obtains personal information about people, information that might not be known by the people closest to them. The information obtained can then be revealed to other people such as lawyers and doctors and in the case of lawyers this information can then be revealed to their clients; therefore social researchers like to believe that the research will help all humanity. Popular topics of social research include poverty, racism, class issues, sexuality, voting behavior, gender constructs, policing and criminal behavior. Research can be conducted using surveys, reports, observation, questionnaires, focus groups, historical accounts, personal diaries and census statistics.
There are two types of research: qualitative research and quantitative research. Qualitative research is inductive, meaning the researcher creates hypotheses and abstractions from collected data. Most data is collected via words or pictures and mostly from people. Researchers are interested in how people make sense of their lives and in the research process itself. Quantitative research is the complete opposite and most often involves numbers and set data. Quantitative data is efficient but focuses only on the end result, not the process itself, as qualitative research does. Quantitative data is precise and is often the result of surveys or questionnaires. Voluntary participation is a major principle of research ethics and the same applies to social research.
Everyone participating should do so voluntary and should not be forced in any way. Participants should also be informed that there is no reward for participating in the research and they will not be penalized if they do not want to participate. Voluntary participation does however, raise scientific concerns, a major one being generalization. This is said because it is believed that only people with the same personality or same traits would volunteer to participate in a particular research therefore the results will not apply to the population as a whole.
There are instances where the researcher will not reveal they are doing a research because they will not want the subjects to be affected in terms of not wanting to participate. In these instances the subjects don’t get to chose if they want to participate, therefore the researcher has to ensure that they do not bring any harm to the subjects they are studying. Harm can be defined as both physical and psychological. There are two standards that are applied in order to help protect the privacy of research participants. Almost all research guarantees the participants’ confidentiality; they are assured that identifying information will not be made available to anyone who is not directly involved in the study. The stricter standard is the principle of anonymity which essentially means that the participant will remain anonymous throughout the study –even to the researchers themselves. The need to protect the subjects has been in part to violations against subjects by medical researchers, like the experiments performed on prisoners of war by Nazi researchers in World War II. Social research should never harm the subjects, no matter if it is voluntary or not. Social researchers should ensure that their research will in no way embarrass subjects or endanger their family life, jobs or anyone else they are associated with.
Social researchers have an obligation to protect their subjects, therefore they have to ask the subjects very personal questions about their behavior, income or anything else that may personal agony or harm to the subject. It is because of this that all participants must be informed of the risks involved in participating in research projects. Social researchers should also be careful when writing books or articles about their studies because the subjects often read the books or articles and if they see themselves in a negative way. The key to research whether it is, voluntary participation or avoiding harm, is sensitivity to the issues being researched and experience with applicants. Even when clear ethical standards and principles exist, there will be times when the need to do accurate research runs up against the rights of potential participants. No set of standards can possibly anticipate every ethical circumstance. Furthermore, there needs to be a procedure that assures that researchers will consider all relevant ethical issues in formulating research plans.

Alright, I've got these search results. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's an essay from UK Essays about ethics in social research. It talks about why ethics are important in research, mentioning things like ensuring knowledge is truthful, building trust among researchers, and maintaining public support for research. It also mentions that ethical standards help balance the goals of research with the rights and welfare of participants.

Then, there's a set of flashcards from Quizlet that seems to be summarizing some key points about ethics in social research. It mentions that focusing only on extreme cases of ethical breaches can be misleading because ethical concerns are pervasive in all social research. It also lists some forms of harm that participants might suffer, like physical injury or stress, and emphasizes the importance of keeping personal data confidential.

Next, there's an essay from IvyPanda about ethical issues facing social researchers. It discusses challenges like getting voluntary participants and ensuring informed consent. The author also talks about the dilemma researchers face when they need to choose between protecting participants and obtaining accurate data.

There's another source from PsycNET, which is probably a psychological database, discussing ethics in social and behavioral research. It seems to provide a comprehensive overview of research ethics in social sciences, including treatment of subjects, deception, and cross-cultural research.

Lastly, there's an essay from StudyMoose that delves into ethical issues in social research, emphasizing the importance of voluntary participation and avoiding harm to participants. It also touches on the tension between protecting participants and conducting accurate research.

Okay, so from these sources, I can see that ethical considerations in social research are multifaceted and crucial. Researchers have to navigate various ethical dilemmas to ensure that their work is both morally sound and scientifically valid.

So, to answer the question "Why is it argued that ethical transgression is pervasive in social research?" I need to synthesize the information from these sources.

First, the Quizlet flashcards mention that focusing only on extreme cases of ethical transgression can create a misleading impression, suggesting that ethical concerns are actually widespread in social research. This implies that even minor ethical lapses are common and not just rare outliers.

The UK Essays piece talks about how ethical norms are designed to protect participants and promote trustworthy research, but it also acknowledges that researchers might face pressures that lead them to cut corners ethically. For example, the desire for groundbreaking findings might tempt some researchers to overlook ethical guidelines.

The IvyPanda essay highlights the specific challenges researchers face in obtaining voluntary participation and ensuring informed consent. It suggests that these processes are not always straightforward and that researchers might sometimes compromise on ethical standards to get the data they need.

The PsycNET source provides a historical perspective, mentioning events like the Nuremberg trials and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which were egregious violations of research ethics. These cases led to the development of stricter ethical guidelines, implying that such transgressions were not uncommon in the past.

The StudyMoose essay emphasizes the potential for harm to participants and the need for researchers to balance this risk with the pursuit of knowledge. It suggests that the sensitive nature of social research, which often involves personal and confidential information, increases the likelihood of ethical transgressions.

Moreover, social research methods, such as surveys, interviews, and observations, can intrude into people's private lives and potentially cause distress or other forms of harm. Researchers might not always anticipate or adequately address these risks.

Additionally, the pressure to publish and the competitive nature of academia might encourage some researchers to bend ethical rules to achieve their goals. The quest for funding and recognition could lead to cutting corners in terms of participant protection.

Furthermore, the blurring lines between what is considered ethical and unethical in research can also contribute to pervasive transgressions. Different researchers may have varying interpretations of ethical standards, leading to inconsistent practices.

It's also worth considering that some ethical transgressions in social research might go unreported or unnoticed, especially if they are minor or unintentional. This could give the impression that such transgressions are more common than acknowledged.

In conclusion, it is argued that ethical transgression is pervasive in social research due to a combination of factors, including the sensitive nature of the research topics, the challenges in obtaining truly informed consent, the pressure to produce results, and the subjective interpretation of ethical standards. While there are established guidelines and regulations to protect participants, the complexity of social research and the human elements involved can lead to widespread ethical lapses.
