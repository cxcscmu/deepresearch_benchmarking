I'm trying to understand why there are so few women in Congress. This is a complex issue, and I know that it's not just about Congress but a broader problem in political representation worldwide. But let's focus on the United States for now.

First, I need to verify if it's accurate to say there are few women in Congress. Maybe things have changed, and I'm behind on the statistics. So, I should look up the current numbers.

A record number of women are serving in the 117th Congress
By Carrie Blazina and Drew DeSilver
Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives are sworn in by Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the first session of the 117th Congress on Jan. 3, 2021. (Erin Scott/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)
Women make up just over a quarter of all members of the 117th Congress – the highest percentage in U.S. history and a considerable increase from where things stood even a decade ago.
Counting both the House of Representatives and the Senate, 144 of 539 seats – or 27% – are held by women. That represents a 50% increase from the 96 women who were serving in the 112th Congress a decade ago, though it remains far below the female share of the overall U.S. population. A record 120 women are serving in the newly elected House, accounting for 27% of the total. In the Senate, women hold 24 of 100 seats, one fewer than the record number of seats they held in the last Congress.
This analysis counts voting as well as nonvoting members of Congress. Figures for the 117th Congress exclude two House seats that were vacant as of early January. It also excludes Sens. Kamala Harris, who is expected to resign her seat ahead of her inauguration as vice president on Jan. 20, and Kelly Loeffler, who lost a runoff election in Georgia earlier this month. Both are set to be replaced by men.
How we did this
Women make up a much bigger share of congressional Democrats (38%) than Republicans (14%). Across both chambers, there are 106 Democratic women and 38 Republican women in the new Congress. Women account for 40% of House Democrats and 32% of Senate Democrats, compared with 14% of House Republicans and 16% of Senate Republicans.
The 2020 general election sent just one new congresswoman to the Senate, Republican Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, making her the first female senator to represent that state.
Republican women made significant gains in the House in the most recent election cycle. Of the 27 newly elected representatives who are women, two-thirds (18) are Republicans. Between the 115th and 116th Congresses, the number of GOP women in the House fell from 25 to 15. That number doubled this year to 30, the highest total ever.
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat and the first female speaker of the House, is serving her fourth term as speaker after being reelected earlier this month.
The partisan gender division hasn’t always looked this way. Until the 1929 stock market crash, most of the dozen women elected to the House were Republicans, and for several decades afterward the two parties were generally close in numbers in that chamber. But the gap widened in the 1970s and has persisted, despite a temporary narrowing during the Reagan-Bush 1980s. Of the 232 women elected to the House in 1992 or later, 157 (68%) have been Democrats, as have 27 of the 42 women (64%) who have served in the Senate since 1992.
The history of women in Congress
Women have been in Congress for more than a century. The first, Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana, was elected to the House in 1916, two years after her state gave women the vote. But it’s only been in the past few decades that women have served in more substantial numbers. About two-thirds of the women ever elected to the House (232 of 352, including the newest members of the 117th Congress) have been elected in 1992 or later.
The pattern is similar in the Senate: 42 of the 58 women who have ever served in the Senate – including Lummis, the newest female senator – took office in 1992 or later.
The 19th Amendment, which extended the franchise to women across the nation, was ratified in 1920. That November, Alice Mary Robertson of Oklahoma became the first woman to defeat an incumbent congressman. (She lost the seat back to him two years later.) In 1922, veteran suffragist Rebecca Latimer Felton of Georgia was appointed to fill a vacant Senate seat; when Congress was unexpectedly called back into session, Felton was sworn in as the first-ever female senator, though she only served for a day.
While women remained scarce in the Senate well into the 1980s, their numbers gradually, though not consistently, increased in the House – generally paralleling the expansion of women’s roles in society more broadly. In 1928, seven women were elected to the 71st Congress, a record at the time, and two more joined them later via special election. But that trend plateaued during the Great Depression and World War II. It wasn’t until after the war that the upward trajectory of women in Congress resumed, with 18 women serving in the House in 1961-62.
Although the 1970s saw prominent figures such as Barbara Jordan, Elizabeth Holtzman and Bella Abzug enter Congress, women’s overall numbers didn’t change much until 1981, when their House caucus exceeded 20 members for the first time. The big jump, however, came in 1992 – later dubbed “The Year of the Woman” – when four new female senators and 24 new congresswomen were elected. Academics have offered various explanations for why 1992 was such a breakthrough year for women in Congress, including an unusually large number of open seats due to redistricting and backlash from the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.
‘Widow’s succession’ in Congress
Well into the 1970s, one of the most common ways for a woman to enter Congress was by succeeding her deceased husband or father, either by election or appointment. Of the 90 women who served in the House between 1916 and 1980, 31 were initially elected to their husband’s seat after he died; three were chosen to replace their husbands on the ballot when the men died before Election Day; and one, Winnifred Mason Huck of Illinois, was elected in 1922 to fill the last four months of her late father’s term. (Another early congresswoman, Katherine Gudger Langley of Kentucky, won her husband’s seat in 1926 after he resigned following his conviction for violating Prohibition laws.)
Like Langley, most of the holders of these so-called “widow’s succession” seats stayed in Congress for only a term or two. But some went on to distinguished careers on Capitol Hill. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, for instance, won a special election in 1940 to fill the last seven months of her husband’s term. Smith went on to win four full House terms on her own, then was elected to four terms in the Senate, thereby becoming the first woman to serve in both chambers. Lindy Boggs, who was elected to her husband’s seat in 1973 after he was presumed killed in a plane crash, served nearly 18 years. She later was named U.S. ambassador to the Holy See.
Six of the 14 women who served in the Senate before 1980 were either elected or appointed to fill their late husbands’ seats. Of those, only two (Hattie Caraway of Arkansas and Maurine Brown Neuberger of Oregon) subsequently won full terms in their own right.

Alright, so according to these sources, the number of women in Congress has been increasing over time, but it's still not very high compared to the overall population. For example, in the 117th Congress, women make up about 27% of all members, which is a record high but still far from parity. It's interesting to see that the number has increased by 50% in just a decade, but progress seems slow.

I also noticed that there's a significant difference between the parties. Democrats have a much higher proportion of women in their ranks—about 38% compared to Republicans' 14%. That's a big gap. I wonder why that is. Is it because Democratic parties are more supportive of women candidates, or is there something else going on?

Another point is that the increase in women in Congress has mostly happened in the past few decades. Before that, women were very underrepresented. The first woman in Congress was elected in 1916, and for a long time, their numbers didn't grow much. It wasn't until the 1990s that there was a significant jump, often referred to as "The Year of the Woman" in 1992. I should look into what factors contributed to that surge.

Maybe I should search for reasons why there are fewer women in Congress. There are probably multiple factors at play here.

Why There Are So Few Women In Congress
Less than 17 percent of Congress seats are held by women
By Elizabeth Flock

From: Women and Congressional Elections: A Century of ChangeBarbara Palmer & Dennis Simon
You'd think that since 1916—the year a woman was first elected to U.S. Congress—there would have been some serious progress.
Women in the workforce, after all, have been on a steady rise.
Not so in Congress, where women hold less than 17 percent of seats to this day, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics. In 2010, the number of women elected to the House actually declined.
[See: Latest political cartoons .]
"Politics is lagging behind society," says Barbara Palmer, associate professor of political science at Baldwin-Wallace College and co-author of the upcoming book Women and Congressional Elections: A Century of Change.
Palmer and Southern Methodist University professor Dennis Simon have been studying the political glass ceiling for over a decade. Voters, they said, mostly aren't to blame for the lack of progress. But they shared five other very real reasons more women aren't in Washington:
1. Incumbency.
Men were in office before women, and once a person is in office, they have serious advantages for reelection. Usually, the most "winnable" seats are already held by a man.
2. Women often run later in life, after they've had children.
That's only recently started to change. Palmer says that only eight women have ever had babies while in Congress, and half of those were in the last five years. Last week, women's site Jezebel profiled four women under the age of 36 who they said could change the face of Congress. "If the War on Women were a summer blockbuster, this would be the part where the good guys unveiled their Secret Weapon," Jezebel wrote.
3. Redistricting appears to target women.
When lines are redrawn, women often bear the brunt of it. Is it deliberate? Palmer and Simon said they aren't sure, but the numbers don't look good. Talking Points Memo recently gave the example of North Carolina, where 10 of 25 Democratic women lawmakers were either forced into a district with another incumbent, or redrawn into a primarily Republican district.
[See: Obama Urges Senate On Equal Pay Bill .]
4. The media coverage.
According to the Daily Beast, in media reports on women's issues—like abortion and birth control—men are quoted some five times more than women are. And that affects the coverage of women in politics. "We've come a long way. ... But it's still husbands and hemlines," Palmer said. The "war on women," she said, hasn't helped.
5. Lingering stereotypes.
Voters can take some of the blame, said Palmer, as many people automatically assume that a female candidate will be better on social issues—like women's rights or education, and a male candidate will be better on hard issues—like defense and the economy. With jobs on everyone's mind, 2012 could be another bad year.

Why do you think so few women and racial minorities have been elected to Congress? That is a question that can come with many different answers. In my opinion, I believe that there is a different reason between women and minorities for their lack of success in Congress. Both reasons involve the past, but in different ways.
The United States Congress is the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. There are 435 members in the House of the Representatives. The Senate has 100 members. Both senators and representatives are chosen through direct election.
The main reason why women and minorities are not popular in Congress is because of descriptive representation. Descriptive representation is a belief that constituents are represented effectively by legislators who are similar to them (Challenge of Democracy). The characters that qualify are race, ethnicity, religion, or gender. That is the main factor why there are so few women and minorities in Congress. Due to the past, the demographic characteristic is a white male.

As far as African American activity in government goes, a lot of progress has been made. In the past slavery kept blacks from being involved at all. They slowly made progress when they were counted as 3/5th of a person. Then they moved on to being free persons, and from then the African Americans moved on. There were many influential blacks to America. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks were two very important people. They changed America for the better and helped African Americans advance in life.
African Americans began serving in Congress during the Reconstruction Era after slaves were freed and granted citizen rights. Free black men gained political representation in the South. White Democrats took back political power and tried to return white supremacy. Legislatures lowered voting for blacks by passing tougher voter laws. As a result of the African American Civil Rights Movement, Congress passed laws to end segregation and protect civil rights and voting rights.
When Congress changed the Voting Rights Acts in 1982, the states made districts that put minorities together. They thought it would make it a better chance for African Americans and Hipics to be elected into office. They fixed the “make-up” of the districts.
Women were never seen as a necessity in the business world in the past. They were not useful when it came to farming in men’s eyes. They were always needed to do the household chores and making sure the kids were being taken care of. Men believed that women were not as strong as men. It was as if they were not as important as men. Women were not allowed to vote until 1920, and before then not many women were involved in the government (Women in Congress). If you could not choose who was going to make decisions for you, why would you even be concerned? There was only one state, New Jersey, who allowed women to vote for 17 years (1790-1807). The only way they could vote was if they fit the land requirements.
I believe though that the reason why there are so few women and minorities in Congress is because America is not ready to change. They are stuck on the way things were before and never trying new things. People are not willing to even give a woman the time of day, even if she has great ideas. It would be someone they brush off because women aren’t smarter than men.
Minorities are not even considered an option in Congress just because of their title as a “minority”. There are a minor amount of minorities and it is hard to find the ones that are determined to better themselves in life. It is almost as if they’ve given up on trying to become an image breaker. Everyone believes in the descriptive representation and that is why minorities are not involved in the government (Congress vs. Minorities).
As the years have progressed though there is one man that I must give credit to for making a huge advancement for minorities in government, Barack Obama. He had many obstacles to overcome to get there. There were many people that told him he didn’t stand a chance in the race. He was determined and he now is sitting in the office as President of the United States.
Demographic groups have always been a large role in Congress. The groups consist of race, gender, ethnicity, or religion. The groups vote for people that are in the considerable same group as them. For example, if a Catholic runs against a Jew, most Catholics would vote for the Catholic.
In 2050, there will be remarkably many different things going on in the world. There is a chance that a black woman will be the President. A Hipic male might be the Speaker of the House. Global Warming could be done for, and New Orleans could possibly be submerged underwater. All possibilities of what the world could be like in 40 years.
I believe that the world will have a new outlook on things and demographic groups will not exist so prevalently. I think people will be able to make decisions based on their own likings and not what their “group” is doing. People are becoming more independent in their choices in 2010, so 40 years from now the world’s mindset will be free.
To support my reasoning on people being independent now is through the example of Obama winning the presidential election. I believe that people stepped out of their demographic group on their voting choice. Yes, most African Americans voted for Obama, but even the African Americans affiliated with a different religion voted for him. White people stepped out of their religion and race to vote for Obama.
I still believe demographic groups will exist, just not so commonly. Those that are stuck to traditions and keeping things the way they were will still be apart of the group. They will consist of less people, but there will be enough to rock a vote. Hopefully, the demographic groups will just completely wipe out and let people use their minds.
I want Americans to be able to make their own decisions. The reason why there are so few women and minorities in Congress has to do with choices made my Americans. African Americans that want to run for a position in Congress probably find it pointless due to the demographic groups. They feel that they shouldn’t waste their time since they already know the outcome especially if they run against a white male. Hopefully having Obama in office will give other minorities and women incentive to pursue their dream to be involved in the government.
The entire controversy will continue for years though. These have just been my personal opinion mixed in with facts. The ideas for the future I have are very well thought out, and I hope to see the progress in the future. If African Americans can go from being slaves to running the United States; I think it is more than possible for people to become more independent in their own thoughts and decisions.

Why are there fewer women in Congress in comparison to men?
The problems that American women encounter in politics are primarily structural. Due to its single-member congressional zones, the U.S quintessentially trails other countries regarding women’s representation. It is deficient of a relevant statute or legislation that provides a gender quota for elective aspirants or offices. Critics reveal that it is tough to achieve parity without mechanisms for gender quotas or equal representation (Rhinehart & Crespin, 2020). Additionally, the lack of term limits and the two-party structure give undue advantage to the incumbent Congress members who, historically, have been men.
Consequently, women have been left to battle for the open-seat contests to have the likelihood of entering Congress. These electoral provisions generally mean that many election periods create limited opportunities for new aspirants and, by extension, women. American administration and politics also vary considerably from most democratic nations in the level of their social provision. A more liberal welfare state would invigorate public interest in stable maternal traits and, therefore, in women elected officeholders.

The continued under-representation of women in U.S. politics
2012 report from American University and Loyola Marymount University analyzes on women's performance and participation rates in politics.
by Katie Gleason | January 14, 2013 | inequality, women and work
Some 101 women were elected to Congress in 2012 — 20 in the Senate and 81 in the House of Representatives — making the 113th Congress the most diverse in history in terms of gender diversity. Still, the United States ranks well below many similar nations in the representation of women in national politics, and the stark gender gap at the highest levels — the House and Senate have a total of 535 seats available, after all — is similarly present at the state and local levels. Despite their under-representation, when women do run for office, research consistently shows that they perform as well, if not better, than their male counterparts.
A 2012 report from American University and Loyola Marymount University, “Men Rule: The Continued Under-Representation of Women in U.S. Politics,” analyzes why, if women perform well when they do participate in politics, they are still so severely underrepresented. Analyzing 2001 and 2011 survey data from thousands of “potential candidates,” both male and female, the researchers report a number of findings that help them attribute the dearth of women in American politics to a “gender gap in political ambition.”
The report’s findings include:
In both 2001 and 2011, women were “16 percentage points less likely than men to have thought about running for office.” Women’s interest in running for office at some point in the future decreased during the 10-year period — from 18% in 2001 to 14% a decade later. Additionally, among the respondents interested in a future run, women are more likely to express interest in local or community office, while men are more likely to express interest in state and federal office.
The authors identify seven primary factors that are related to women’s reluctance to pursue political office. Among these, there is a gender difference in the “perception of the electoral environment,” with women about 25% more likely to view local and congressional elections as “highly competitive,” as compared to men, and more likely than men to believe that women do worse than men when they do run for office.
“Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin’s candidacies aggravated women’s perceptions of gender bias in the electoral arena,” with 65% and 69% of women respondents reporting that Clinton and Palin received sexist media coverage, respectively. Additionally, 84% of female respondents felt Clinton “faced gender bias from voters in 2008.”
“Women are much less likely than men to think they are qualified to run for office,”and more than twice as likely as men to feel they are “not at all qualified” to run for office. These gender differences exist despite the roughly equal amounts of political and leadership experience possessed by women and men in the sample.
“Women are significantly less likely than men to report that they have the traits that are generally required of candidates for elective office,” including confidence, competitiveness and propensity for taking risks.
“Women react more negatively than men to many aspects of modern campaigns,” in particular the possibility of participating in a negative campaign, reduced time with one’s family and loss of privacy.
Women are less frequently encouraged to run for office at the suggestion of both those involved in politics and other personal contacts.
“Women are still responsible for the majority of childcare and household tasks.” Among the two-career families with children in the sample, women were “roughly six times more likely than men to bear responsibility for the majority of household tasks,” and “about 10 times more likely to be the primary childcare provider.” As an added caveat, “women in the sample are significantly less likely than men to be married and have children.”
In related research, a 2010 study published in American Journal of Political Science, “Gendered Perceptions and Political Candidacies: A Central Barrier to Women’s Equality in Electoral Politics,” also found that between men and women with comparable credentials, backgrounds, and experiences, women were substantially less likely than men to perceive themselves as qualified to seek office.
Further, a 2010 study from the University of Pittsburgh, “Valuing Diversity in Political Organizations: Gender and Token Minorities in the U.S. House of Representatives,” finds that certain structural dynamics around fundraising and leadership serve to create an implicit “glass ceiling” for women in Congress. Some research has also explored how political and legislative outcomes may differ when women are in decision-making roles.

Why Aren’t There More Women in Politics?
Sangyoub Park on April 28, 2016
NPR recently aired a story about female lawmaker’s representation state by state. According to the story, Colorado has the most women; female lawmakers make up 42% of that total. Wyoming had the least, with women only representing 13% of state lawmakers.
NPR’s experts suggested that term limits in Colorado and a female-friendly party leadership were behind their high number of female legislators, whereas a change in Wyoming from multi-member to single-member district in the 1990s was unfavorable to women (because voters have to pick only one and tend to lean toward men when they have to make hard choices). The story also mentioned voting rules and the difficulty of balancing home, work, and lawmaking responsibilities.
In fact, sociologists have been studying this issue in depth for some time and a few years ago Deborah Carr summarized the reigning wisdom on why women are less likely to be politicians. She highlighted six factors to explain the gender gap in the US Congress:
Women have to face sexism (e.g., glass ceiling – Nancy Pelosi used the term marble ceiling in her inaugural speech as Speaker in 2007), especially voters’ sex role stereotyping “what women can and should be.”
Women are not in the “pipeline,” suggesting that not enough women are in careers that have historically led to political office.
Because of gendered wealth and income inequality, women don’t as often have enough money to run multi-dollar campaigns, nor access to social networks full of big donors.
Women have different interests, focusing on “issues related to family and social welfare, rather than national defense and international relations.”
Women are less likely to be risk-takers than their male counterparts, perhaps explaining why women must be asked several times before they seriously consider launching campaigns.
Women opt out of politics because of family responsibilities.
To improve female participation in politics, we should promote more gender-neural political environments. Political parties should take further steps to recruit and support female candidates, as Colorado seems to be doing. We should repeatedly encourage women to run for office since they take a lot of encouragement before they seriously consider launching candidacies. More importantly, we need to seed the pipeline by encouraging young girls to get involved in student government and see governing as compatible with their interests and abilities.

I think you mean neutral, not neural...

I'm running a study on gender disproportion in politics. I'm starting simply by asking why there aren't as many women in politics as there are men. I found this article to be very helpful! And I think Deborah Carr got it right in her assessment of why this is. The question I have is: " Do you have a source indicating to what degree each of Carr's six points affect female representation in Government?" I worry that there is a tendancy to give more weight to sexism and wealth inequality, whereas other factors take back seat. I think there is a right way and a wrong way to approach the issue, quotas and such being the wrong way. (not to say there's no place at all for them) Anyways, any response would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! I hope one day we'll see equal representation.

So, from these sources, it's clear that women are underrepresented in Congress, and there are several reasons for this. Let's try to summarize them.

First, there's the issue of incumbency. Since men have been in office longer, they have an advantage in reelection, and the most winnable seats are often already held by men. This makes it harder for new women candidates to enter Congress.

Second, women often run for office later in life, after they've had children, which can limit their opportunities. Although this is changing, with younger women entering politics.

Third, redistricting can negatively affect women. When electoral boundaries are redrawn, women legislators may face more competitive districts or be paired with other incumbents, making it harder for them to get reelected.

Fourth, media coverage can be biased. Women are sometimes covered differently, with more focus on their appearance or personal lives rather than their政见和政策。

第五，性别刻板印象仍然存在。选民可能自动假设女性候选人更擅长处理社会问题，如妇女权利和教育，而男性更擅长处理经济和国防等硬性议题。这种观念可能影响选民的选择。

此外，资金也是一个重要因素。女性往往在筹集竞选资金方面面临更多困难，因为她们可能缺乏强大的社会网络和捐赠者关系。

还有研究显示，女性对自己的能力和资格往往不够自信，相比男性，她们更可能认为自己不适合担任公职。

最后，家庭责任也是阻碍女性参政的一个因素。女性通常承担更多的家务和育儿责任，这可能使她们难以平衡家庭和政治生涯。

总的来说，女性在国会中的代表性不足是多种因素共同作用的结果，包括历史遗留问题、结构性障碍、文化偏见和个人挑战。要提高女性在政治领域的参与度，需要从多个层面进行改革和努力，比如鼓励更多女性参选、提供更好的支持系统、改变媒体对女性候选人的报道方式，以及促进性别平等的文化和社会环境。

## 最终答案

由于历史、文化和社会结构的多重因素，女性在美国国会中所占比例相对较低。尽管近年来有所进步，但女性仍面临诸多挑战，包括性别偏见、资金筹集困难、家庭责任重压以及自我信心不足等问题。为了提高女性在政治领域的代表性和参与度，需要采取综合措施，如鼓励女性参选、改善支持体系、改变媒体对女性候选人的报道方式，并推动性别平等的文化和社会环境建设。
