Alright, I've been asked to consider why Confederate statues should be removed. This is a pretty sensitive and complex topic, so I need to approach it carefully and think through all the aspects involved. Let me start by understanding what these statues represent and the context surrounding them.

First off, Confederate statues are monuments that honor individuals who fought for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The Confederacy was formed by Southern states that seceded from the United States in order to preserve slavery. So, at their core, these statues are tributes to people who advocated for and fought to maintain slavery.

Now, the question is whether these statues should remain standing or be removed. To answer this, I need to consider the reasons behind their erection, their impact on different groups today, and the values they promote or detract from in our society.

Let me begin by looking into when and why these statues were put up. I have a feeling that many of them weren't erected immediately after the Civil War but rather during specific periods in history. Maybe there's a pattern there that could inform my thinking.

Confederate Statues Were Never Really About Preserving History | FiveThirtyEight
Confederate Statues Were Never Really About Preserving History
By Ryan Best
Confederate monuments by year dedicated
1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020 hover for details
This data, hand-collected by the Southern Poverty Law Center, excludes any monuments found on or within battlefields, museums, cemeteries or other places that are largely historical in nature. Monuments with differing dedication dates or sponsors are listed as separate entries in the data — including those that are located in close proximity to, or on the same plot as, another monument.
In recent weeks President Trump has railed against tearing down statues across the country — and has been particularly dogged in his defense of Confederate monuments. But his argument that they are benign symbols of America’s past is misleading. An overwhelming majority of Confederate memorials weren’t erected in the years directly following the Civil War. Instead, most were put up decades later. Nor were they built just to commemorate fallen generals and soldiers; they were installed as symbols of white supremacy during periods of U.S. history when Black Americans’ civil rights were aggressively under attack. In total, at least 830 such monuments were constructed across the U.S, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a comprehensive database of Confederate monuments and symbols.
The biggest spike in Confederate memorials came during the early 1900s, soon after Southern states enacted a number of sweeping laws to disenfranchise Black Americans and segregate society. During this period, more than 400 monuments were built as part of an organized strategy to reshape Civil War history. And this effort was largely spearheaded by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, who sponsored hundreds of statues, predominantly in the South in the early 20th century — and as recently as 2011.
Monuments sponsored by the United Daughters of the Confederacy
KKK founded 1865 UDC established nationally 1894 NAACP founded 1909 KKK resurgence 1915 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020
“The UDC was very focused on the future,” said Karen Cox, a historian, University of North Carolina at Charlotte professor and author of numerous articles and books on Southern history and culture, including “Dixie’s Daughters: The United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Preservation of Confederate Culture.” “Their goal, in all the work that they did, was to prepare future generations of white Southerners to respect and defend the principles of the Confederacy.” It wasn’t just Confederate monuments, either. They also rejected any school textbook that said slavery was the central cause of the Civil War; they praised the Ku Klux Klan and gave speeches that distorted the cruelty of American slavery and defended slave owners.
From around 1920 to the early 1940s, there was a second wave of statue building. Jane Dailey, professor of American history at the University of Chicago, said this period of construction coincided with more Black Americans’ fighting for civil rights and pushing back against widespread lynchings in the South. “You have Black soldiers who have just fought for their country [in World War I] and fought to make the world safe for democracy, coming back to an America that's determined to lynch them,” said Dailey. “[T]hose were very clearly white supremacist monuments and are designed to intimidate, not just memorialize.”
And a significant portion of those monuments were erected on courthouse grounds. According to Lecia Brooks of the Southern Poverty Law Center, placing these memorials on courthouse property, especially in the 1950s and ’60s, was meant to remind Black Americans of the struggle and subjugation they would face in their fight for civil rights and equal protection under the law.
Monuments built on courthouse grounds
WWI ends 1918 Anti-lynching bill fails to pass Senate 1922 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020
Black Americans have long understood the symbolism of those monuments. “I know what this statue means,” said Brooks. “It's a reminder to stay in my place.”
Not just statues were erected during this period, either. Following the landmark Brown versus Board of Education decision in 1954, which said maintaining racially segregated schools was unconstitutional, there was an uptick in the number of colleges and schools named after Confederate soldiers and generals: From 1954 to 1970, at least 45 were named after Confederates.
Schools and colleges named after Confederates
Brown v. Board of Education 1954 Little Rock Crisis 1957 Civil Rights Act 1964 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000 2020
“As soon as you get the federal government supporting Black students in schools,” said Brooks — including talk of busing and integrating segregated schools — then you had the reassertion of white supremacy, this time in the form of school names. “‘OK, we're going to name this school so, again, you can be reminded,’” she said.
But now the movement to memorialize the Confederacy has finally faced a period of reckoning — more than 80 statues have been either removed or relocated since 2015. That year, nine Black churchgoers were killed in Charleston, South Carolina, by an avowed white supremacist obsessed with Confederate symbology, sparking a public outcry to remove statues that celebrate the Confederacy. In total, at least eight statues were removed in 2015 and 2016, and 36 more were removed in 2017, the year a rally to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent. Already, at least another 26 have been taken down in 2020 in response to the police killing of George Floyd, which led to protests worldwide.
Monuments still standing versus those removed or relocated
Mother Emanuel church massacre in Charleston, SC 2015 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, VA 2017 Police kill George Floyd in Minneapolis 2020 1860 1880 1900 1920 1940 1960 1980 2000
However, this is still only a fraction of the more than 700 Confederate statues still standing in the U.S. Taking down these monuments is difficult, and their removal is often met with arguments that by doing so we are hiding from — or even changing — history, with some insisting that these statues simply celebrate Southern heritage. But a deeper understanding of their historical context paints a very different picture — these statues were meant to promote white supremacy and intimidate Black people, not just to pay homage to Southern pride. And, slowly but surely, as more monuments come down, this understanding seems to be gaining traction. “Now, the narrative has changed to telling history,” said Brooks. “Who have we left out of history? What history aren’t we telling through the veneration of Confederate leaders?”

Confederate Monuments History - Civil War Statues Were Built During Jim Crow
Most Confederate Monuments Weren't Built Until the Rise of Jim Crow
They largely symbolize a romanticized version of Antebellum racism, not the Civil War dead.
By Caroline Hallemann

Following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, some protesters are turning their attention toward removing Confederate monuments. Notably, after a group defaced a Confederate Soldiers & Sailors Monument in a public park in Birmingham, the mayor ordered its removal. In light of this movement, we're resurfacing a piece about the true origins of many of those statues that was written in the wake of the 2017 demonstrations in Charlottesville.
Over the weekend, hundreds of white nationalists descended upon Charlottesville, Virginia for two days of violent protests prompted by the city's plan to remove a monument to Robert E. Lee.
Those who argue in favor of keeping the larger-than-life depiction of the Virginian commander of the Confederate Army sitting atop his horse often cite Southern heritage and history as reasons to keep the monument. But like most Confederate war shrines, this oxidized green statue wasn't erected during Reconstruction as a way to honor those men who died in battle. Rather, it dates back to 1924, more than 50 years after the Civil War was over.
In 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center estimated that there were over 1,500 "symbols of the Confederacy in public spaces" in the United States. The majority of them are located, as one might expect, in the 11 states that seceded from the union, but as Vice aptly points out, some can be found in Union states  (New York, for example has three, Pennsylvania, four) and at least 22 of them are located in states that didn't even exist during the Civil War.
How can that be possible? Because largely, Confederate monuments were built during two key periods of American history: the beginnings of Jim Crow in the 1920s and the civil rights movement in the early 1950s and 1960s.
To be sure, some sprung up in the years following the Confederacy's defeat (the concept of a Confederate memorial day dates back to back to 1866 and was still officially observed by the governments of Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina, as of the publication of the Southern Poverty Law Center's report ), and some continue to be built— USA Today notes that 35 Confederate monuments have been erected in North Carolina since 2000.
But when these statues—be they historical place markers, or myth-building icons of Lee or Stonewall Jackson—were built seems to suggest these monuments have very little to do with paying tribute to the Civil War dead and everything to do with erecting monuments to black disenfranchisement, segregation, and 20th-century racial tension.
And in our current political climate, 150 years after the Civil War, it's no surprise these monuments find themselves back in the spotlight yet again. This time, the debate for many governments is how to lessen the hate, by removing the monuments or relocating them to museums with appropriate context. Baltimore, for example, took down statues of Confederate heroes in the middle of the night to avoid conflict. But the violence in Charlottesville last weekend is proof that they are not merely markers of a distant history but rather a symbol that we still have much to put right in the 21st century.

The Real Story Behind All Those Confederate Statues
Kevin Drum
Bio | Follow
Vox points me today to some data I was looking for last night. Thanks, Vox! It’s from the Southern Poverty Law Center, and it shows us when all those Confederate monuments and statues were erected:
This illustrates something that even a lot of liberals don’t always get. Most of these monuments were not erected right after the Civil War. In fact, all the way to 1890 there were very few statues or monuments dedicated to Confederate leaders. Most of them were built much later. And since I’m not an academic, I feel comfortable squeezing this history into a very short, oversimplified summary:
1861-1865: Civil War.
1865-1875: Reconstruction Era.
1875-1895: Reconstruction Era ends. Lynchings skyrocket. Blacks are steadily disenfranchised, allowing Southern whites to enact Jim Crow laws. In 1896, Jim Crow is cemented into place when the Supreme Court rules it constitutional.
1895-1915: With blacks disenfranchised and Jim Crow laws safely in place, Southern whites continue their campaign of terror against blacks. This era features continued lynchings, the growing popularity of “Lost Cause” revisionist histories, a resurgence of white supremacy organizations like the KKK, and the erection of Confederate statues and monuments in large numbers.
1915-1955: Jim Crow reigns safely throughout the South.
1955-1970: The civil rights era starts after the Supreme Court rules in Brown v. Board of Education that Jim Crow laws are unconstitutional. Southern whites mount massive and violent resistance, and start putting up Confederate monuments again.
Yes, these monuments were put up to honor Confederate leaders and soldiers. But the timing of the monument building makes it pretty clear what the real motivation was: to physically symbolize white terror against blacks. They were mostly built during times when Southern whites were engaged in vicious campaigns of subjugation against blacks, and during those campaigns the message sent by a statue of Robert E. Lee in front of a courthouse was loud and clear.
No one should think that these statues were meant to be somber postbellum reminders of a brutal war. They were built much later, and most of them were explicitly created to accompany organized and violent efforts to subdue blacks and maintain white supremacy in the South. I wouldn’t be surprised if even a lot of Southerners don’t really understand this, but they should learn. There’s a reason blacks consider these statues to be symbols of bigotry and terror. It’s because they are.
REAL QUICK, REAL URGENT
Minority rule, corruption, disinformation, attacks on those who dare tell the truth: There is a direct line from what's happening in Russia and Ukraine to what's happening here at home. And that's what MoJo 's Monika Bauerlein writes about in "Their Fight Is Our Fight" to unpack the information war we find ourselves in and share a few examples to show why the power of independent, reader-supported journalism is such a threat to authoritarians.
Corrupt leaders the world over can (and will) try to shut down the truth, but when the truth has millions of people on its side, you can't keep it down for good. And there's no more powerful or urgent argument for your support of Mother Jones' journalism right now than that. We need to raise about $450,000 to hit our online fundraising budget in these next few months, so please read more from Monika and pitch in if you can.

States with the most Confederate memorials
Seventy-three Confederate monuments were removed or renamed in 2021, leaving 723 such monuments standing in the United States. The Southern Poverty Law Center's “Whose Heritage?” data project counted more than 2,000 Confederate memorials throughout the country today, including statues, parks, schools, streets, highways, or practically any structure which, in one way or another, honors a Confederate figure or the whole coalition of seceded states.
Stacker analyzed the SPLC’s research and ranked states according to which have the most Confederate memorials, Data was last updated Jan. 21, 2022 (released Feb. 1).
Those in favor of keeping Confederal memorials in place cite the need to preserve American history when in fact, the vast majority of these monuments were erected long after the Civil War’s conclusion in 1865. The first half-dozen Confederate monuments were erected on the heels of the Civil War; but over the next four decades, six or fewer monuments went up yearly. Then, installations surged: In 1911 alone, 49 Confederate monuments were erected around the country, coinciding with peak Jim Crow laws designed to disadvantage Blacks and perpetuate segregation.
Other surges appeared throughout the first half of the 20th century, with pronounced increases in Confederate monuments going up throughout the civil rights movement and smaller increases at the turn of the 21st century and immediately following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008.
Dozens of Confederate memorials around the United States were taken down on the heels of a 2015 shooting by Dylann Roof at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, that killed nine Black parishioners including the church’s pastor. Two years later, in defiance of plans to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, hundreds of self-described neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally. Clashes at that rally with counter-protesters hit an apex when Alex Fields Jr. drove his car into a crowd of counter-protestors, injuring 19 people and killing one woman named Heather Heyer. At the end of the August event, three were dead, dozens injured, and the ongoing debate over whether Confederate monuments ought to be protected or removed remained unresolved.
The debate gained renewed fervor in 2020 following the May 25 murder of George Floyd. Protests in cities and small towns around the country and world included acts of civil disobedience such as covering Confederate monuments in graffiti or toppling Confederate statues and other monuments perceived as symbols of oppression and slavery. Across the United States, pressure mounted to take such monuments away and out of the public eye, with dozens of municipalities taking action to do so. In total, 157 Confederate memorials were removed throughout the country in 2020.
Various groups stand by claims that these memorials serve as important historical markers; others argue the memorials glorify white supremacists and ignore those who were hurt, enslaved, and killed by the scourge of racism in this country. Some historians suggest looking at how post-war Germany has handled its past: Concentration camps serve as museums that detail the horrors that occurred therein so people never forget what happened; with nary a Hitler or SS statue to be found. Instead, statues and monuments memorialize victims who were lost as well as those who survived.
Keep reading to find out where the most Confederate monuments still stand, and to learn about recent debates over what to do with them.

Indiana’s one Confederate marker stands in memory of the 11 men who were killed and 40 who were injured while fighting in “Morgan’s Raid,” Gen. John Hunt Morgan’s Confederate Cavalry Division that overwhelmed Union Troops during the Battle of Corydon on July 9, 186. It was the only battle fought in the state and was won by the Confederacy.
Gen. Morgan was known for his violent and chaotic raids, which included taking prisoners, stealing supplies, extorting money, burning buildings, and breaking telegraph and railroad lines in Union territories. Morgan’s Raid was the Civil War’s longest cavalry raid, carving a path of destruction across more than 1,000 miles.

A Confederate monument several miles from the Fort Craig National Historic Site in New Mexico was erected by the Texas Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1936. The monument purports to be in memory of Confederate soldiers known and unknown who died in the Battle of Valverde during the Civil War on Feb. 21, 1862.
The Confederacy won the Battle of Valverde, but not without 36 deaths, 150 injuries, and the loss of supply wagons that were burned. Confederate troops from that battle went on to capture Albuquerque and Santa Fe before being defeated by Union soldiers at Glorieta Pass March 26–28, 1862.
In addition to battles over Confederate monuments, Native Americans in New Mexico in June successfully pushed for the removal of two statues depicting Spanish conquistadors.

Two road markers installed in 1929 and 1930 (respectively) in McConnellsburg, Pennsylvania, pay homage to Confederate soldiers.
The marker on U.S. 522 commemorates Confederate soldiers who escaped to the town via the nearby mountain following a fire in nearby Chambersburg in 1864 that was authorized by Brigadier Gen. John McCausland. The Rebel officers hid out in a farmhouse in McConnellsburg and the soldiers stayed nearby while keeping watch for Union troops. On PA-16, a marker denotes where two Confederate soldiers were buried after being killed in 1863 in what was supposedly the first Civil War battle in Pennsylvania.
Both markers came under fresh scrutiny in 2017 following the Unite the Right Rally and its counter-protests in Charlottesville.

East Wenatchee, Washington, is home to Lee Elementary School, named in 1955 for Gen. Robert E. Lee at the same time other Confederate monuments and memorials were going up around the country in defiance of the civil rights movement. There was much debate in 2015 over whether to change the name, but the community opted to keep it as-is.
In Bellingham, Pickett Road was named for George Pickett, who resigned from the U.S. military when the Civil War broke out and became a colonel for the Confederacy. And just outside Ridgefield in Clark County, Jefferson Davis Park pays homage to the president of the Confederate States of America. The monuments there once marked the northern and southern points of State Route 99. The park is owned by a group called Sons of Confederate Veterans.
Following 2017's Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and related counter-protests, the Sons of Confederate Veterans said they had received multiple death threats along with calls to remove the monuments.

Several of the Confederate monuments throughout Maryland are hardly historic; with some dedicated in the 1990s and early 2000s. In June 2020, calls were renewed to remove Confederate memorials throughout Maryland, including a Civil War plaque that was installed in the State House in 1964.
Former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake in 2015 created a commission to review all Confederate monuments in the city and make recommendations including preservation in place, the addition of new signage, relocation, or removal.
Following the 2017 Unite the Right rally, four Confederate statues were removed from Baltimore and a statue in Annapolis depicting a Supreme Court justice who had defended slavery was taken down.

A number of Confederate memorials were removed from New York City following the 2017 Unite the Right rally. These included a plaque installed in 1912 denoting the location where Gen. Robert E. Lee planted a tree in Brooklyn, and sculptures of Lee (dedicated in 1923) and fellow Confederate Gen. Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson (dedicated in 1957) that stood in Bronx Community College’s Hall of Fame for Great Americans. In 2018, a statue in Central Park of J. Marion Sims —a famous 19th-century doctor and gynecologist who conducted experimental surgeries on enslaved women between 1845 and 1849—was also taken down.
Amid the swell of protests following the death of George Floyd, several other monuments throughout the city came under renewed scrutiny including the statue of President Theodore Roosevelt in front of the American Museum of Natural History. That monument, depicting the former president flanked by a Native American man and an African man, was finally removed in January of 2022.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in California announced in late June of 2020 that all references to Gen. Robert E. Lee would be removed from printed and online materials and exhibits. In Fort Bragg, proposals were put forth the same year to rename the coastal California town named after Braxton Bragg who enslaved more than 100 people. The town was named in 1857, before the Civil War. Before trading sides and becoming a Confederate general, Bragg had been a commanding officer in the U.S. military who fought in the Mexican-American War. Bragg was a controversial figure in the Civil War with a lasting reputation for his short fuse and inept leadership.

During the removal of a marble statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky state capitol in June of 2020, officials discovered a newspaper dated Oct. 20, 1936. The clipping underscores the fact that rather than being part of actual Civil War history, most Confederate monuments were installed more than a half-century after its end.
Two other Confederate monuments in Kentucky were relocated in 2019: one of Confederate Gen. John Cabell Breckinridge, who also served as secretary of war, and another of Gen. John Hunt Morgan.

It took three days for workers to remove the 8,500-pound column of granite beneath the statue.
In the same month, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lifted a moratorium established in 2015 that forbade changing the names of campus buildings and locations.

Georgia law prohibits moving monuments in most cases. One exception is the relocation of a monument in order to carry out planned construction. Seizing on this loophole, government officials in Athens-Clarke County in 2020 put forward a proposal for a crosswalk expansion in downtown Athens near the University of Georgia where a contentious monument honoring dead Confederate soldiers has stood since 1872. The location was a lightning rod for protestors, some of whom graffitied the monument, and clashes with police.

- Number of symbols removed since 1880: 107
Virginia, home to the most Confederate symbols in the United States, was a central focus of protests that erupted worldwide following the death of George Floyd. Protestors took it upon themselves to take down monuments to Confederacy President Jefferson Davis and Christopher Columbus.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in June of 2020 ordered the removal of a 60-foot monument of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that stood downtown for 130 years. The move came amid extensive protests and widespread defacing of the sculpture. Hundreds of photographs taken following extensive graffiti work done on that and other Confederate monuments throughout Richmond depicted families, dancers, couples, artists, and activists posing in front of the transformed symbols.

There are hundreds of Confederate monuments across the US — here's when they were built

After violence at a white supremacist rally led to the death of three people in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 12, a growing number of cities and civilians have started tearing down Confederate monuments across the United States.
Several government officials, including California Representative and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, have call ed to remove markers that celebrate controversial Civil War era figures from public spaces.
The Confederate States of America, which formed in 1861, argued that states should have the right to maintain slavery, while the Union fought to eradicate it. Conflicts between the two groups led to the American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865.
In the 150 years following the war, hundreds of Confederate monuments were been built in almost every state, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The nonprofit legal advocacy organization published a 2016 report that details the timeline of when states installed Confederate iconography (which it defines as statues, monuments, schools, parks, streets, and highways named after Confederate generals); the districts that celebrate Confederate-related holidays; the public buildings that feature Confederate flags; and the cities that issue commemorative license plates.
As you can see in the timeline below, the number of Confederate memorial installations peaked around 1910 — 50 years after the end of the Civil War and at the height of Jim Crow, an era defined by segregation and disenfranchisement laws against black Americans. Confederate installations spiked again in the 1950s and 1960s, during the Civil Rights Movement.

Alright, so from the search results, it's clear that most Confederate statues weren't erected right after the Civil War. There were actually two main periods when a lot of these monuments were put up: around the early 1900s and during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. That's interesting because those periods coincide with times when there was a lot of tension around race relations in the U.S.

So, let me think about this. If these statues were put up decades after the Civil War, during times when there was a push for civil rights and integration, maybe there's more to it than just honoring Confederate soldiers. Maybe these monuments were meant to send a message.

Looking back at the search results, one article mentions that the United Daughters of the Confederacy played a big role in sponsoring these monuments, especially in the early 20th century. It also says that these monuments were often placed on courthouse grounds, which seems symbolic. Placing them there could be a way to assert authority and intimidate certain groups, perhaps.

Another point is that many of these monuments were erected during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights Movement. Jim Crow was a time when there were strict segregation laws, and the Civil Rights Movement was fighting against those laws. So, putting up Confederate monuments during these times might have been a way to reinforce white supremacy and resist change.

Also, some of the monuments were named after Confederate generals or figures who were associated with slavery and oppression. For example, there's mention of a school named after Robert E. Lee, who was a prominent Confederate general. Renaming schools and other public places during the Civil Rights Movement seems like a deliberate act to honor those who fought against integration.

Moreover, there's a reference to the fact that some of these monuments were put up by groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which is a white supremacist organization. That certainly adds to the notion that these monuments aren't just about remembering history but about promoting a particular ideology.

Now, some people argue that these monuments are part of history and should be preserved as historical markers. But, considering the timing of when they were erected and the groups behind their creation, it seems like they serve a different purpose. They were likely erected to perpetuate a certain narrative about the Confederacy and to assert dominance over minority groups.

Furthermore, the recent events in Charlottesville, where a white nationalist rally was held to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, highlight the ongoing controversy surrounding these monuments. The fact that such rallies can turn violent and lead to loss of life underscores the sensitivity and importance of this issue.

So, in conclusion, I believe that Confederate statues should be removed from public spaces because they represent a painful chapter in American history marked by slavery and oppression. Their placement, especially in courthouses and other authoritative locations, suggests that they were intended to intimidate and assert white supremacy rather than simply honor historical figures.

Instead of keeping these monuments, perhaps they could be moved to museums where they can be properly contextualized and used as educational tools to teach about the past. This way, we can learn from history without glorifying those who fought to preserve slavery.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Confederate statues should be removed from public spaces because they represent slavery and oppression, and were often erected to intimidate and assert white supremacy rather than to honor historical figures.}} \]
