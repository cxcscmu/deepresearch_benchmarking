So I've got this question: "Will apps eventually make the web irrelevant? Why or why not?" Hmm, that's an interesting one. I'm not entirely sure about the answer, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First off, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about the future relationship between apps and the web. It's wondering if apps might become so dominant that the web becomes irrelevant. So, I need to consider the current roles of apps and the web, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they might evolve over time.

Let me start by defining what apps and the web are, at least in my understanding. Apps are software programs that run on devices like smartphones, tablets, or computers. They can be downloaded from app stores and often provide specialized functions or services. The web, on the other hand, is the global system of interconnected networks that allows access to information and services through browsers using HTTP and other protocols.

One thing I know is that apps have become incredibly popular in recent years, especially with the rise of smartphones. People use apps for everything from social networking to shopping, streaming media, and even banking. The web still exists, of course, but sometimes it feels like apps are taking over.

But is the web really becoming irrelevant? I'm not so sure. For one thing, the web is still where a lot of information lives. When I need to look up something quickly, like a fact or a definition, I usually turn to a search engine, which leads me to websites. Apps don't always have the same breadth of information that the web does.

Also, the web is more accessible because you don't need to download anything; you just need a browser. Apps require you to download and install them, which can take up storage space on your device. So, for someone who doesn't want to clutter their phone with lots of apps, the web might be more convenient.

Moreover, the web is platform-independent. You can access it on any device with a browser, whether it's a computer, smartphone, or tablet, and it mostly works the same way. Apps, however, are often platform-specific. An app designed for iOS might not work on Android, and vice versa. So, the web has an advantage in terms of compatibility.

On the other hand, apps often provide a more seamless and personalized experience. They can take advantage of device features like cameras, microphones, and GPS, which might not be as easily accessible through a web browser. Also, apps can work offline, which is something the web couldn't do until recently with the advent of progressive web apps.

Progressive web apps are interesting because they blur the line between traditional web applications and native apps. They can offer many of the features that native apps do, like push notifications and offline access, directly through the browser. So, maybe the web is evolving to compete more directly with apps.

Another factor to consider is user behavior. A lot of people nowadays prefer using apps because they're convenient and tailored to their needs. For example, instead of going to a news website, people might prefer to use a news app that curates content specifically for them. Similarly, social media apps are often more engaging than their web counterparts.

However, there are still scenarios where the web is preferable. For instance, when I'm at a friend's house and using their computer, I don't have access to my apps, but I can still browse the web. Also, for one-time use or for trying out a new service, it might be more hassle-free to use the web version instead of downloading an app.

I also think about how businesses and organizations present themselves online. Most still maintain a website, even if they have apps. The website serves as a central hub for information, while the app might offer more interactive or customized experiences for regular users.

Furthermore, the web has standards and protocols that ensure interoperability and accessibility. Apps, especially proprietary ones, might not adhere to the same standards, which could lead to compatibility issues or barriers for users with disabilities.

Speaking of standards, there's been a lot of development in web technologies lately, like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks, which have greatly enhanced what the web can do. So, the web is becoming more powerful and capable of handling complex applications.

I also recall hearing about the concept of "the appification of the web," where more and more web services are encouraging users to download their apps instead of using the web interface. But at the same time, there's a counter-movement towards "web apps" that can run in the browser with app-like capabilities.

Another angle to consider is the control that platforms have over apps. For example, Apple and Google control their respective app stores, which means they can dictate terms and conditions for app developers. This can be seen as a disadvantage compared to the web, where anyone can publish content without needing approval from a central authority.

Privacy is another concern. Apps often require permission to access personal data, whereas the web has its own set of privacy issues, like tracking and cookies. It's a complex landscape, and I'm not sure which is better in terms of privacy.

Let me try to summarize my thoughts so far. Apps offer convenience, personalization, and access to device features, which makes them attractive to many users. The web, on the other hand, provides accessibility, platform independence, and a vast array of information. Additionally, the web is evolving with new technologies that are closing the gap between web apps and native apps.

So, will apps make the web irrelevant? I don't think so, at least not entirely. The web has too many advantages and serves too many purposes to become completely obsolete. However, it's possible that certain aspects of the web might see a decline in usage if apps continue to dominate in areas like social networking, entertainment, and commerce.

Maybe a more likely scenario is that apps and the web will coexist, each serving different needs and preferences. Some people might prefer using apps for their familiarity and ease of use, while others might prefer the web for its openness and accessibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines will continue to blur, with web apps offering most of the functionalities of native apps, making the distinction less relevant.

I should probably look up some data or expert opinions on this topic to get a better perspective. Maybe there are industry trends or research studies that can inform my answer.

Let me try searching for some information.

What’s the Future of Apps?
11 Min Read
1 Comment
Apps are not something that our grandparents had when they were children but they’ve quickly become an integral part of our lives today.
Seeing the advancement of Apps over the past 10 years, we’re curious to understand where the Apps are headed and what the future looks like.
So, we asked the question:
What’s the Future of Apps?
This is what we learned…
Omer Kaplan, CMO at ironSource
“The in-app ecosystem offers an environment free from the brand safety issues plaguing the rest of the industry – simply because it is and always has been strictly regulated by Apple and Google. No non-compliant apps are allowed on to the store, meaning that the chances that a brand’s ads will appear next to terrorist or anti-semitic content are close to zero. Beyond the fact that time spent in-app continues to grow, apps also offer brands a naturally safe environment for their ads. We’ve already seen a marked increase in brands advertising in-app in the last few months, and with the current controversy and focus on brand safety with traditional display advertising, we expect that trend to escalate as brands look for a safe space in the wild west of digital advertising.”
Peter Hamilton, CEO of TUNE
“As the saturation of smartphones across our population climbs but people’s attention for new apps doesn’t scale, we will see inventory challenges for marketers. On the consumer side, mobile web provides instant, easy results for consumers. The industry will look to the open web in 2017 to provide more inventory, but unlike the web before apps, consumers will get web experiences that are higher performing, even native-like, using technologies like HTML5 and Google’s AMP. This will be driven especially by retail and commerce who seek to drive purchases regardless of the platform, nurturing customers over the long term to persuade consumers to download their app.
There will be extremely parity between native and browser capabilities. However, native apps will continue to have the edge on performance due to the speed of hardware development, and web will have the edge on discover and search as Internet connectivity continues to improve. What we will see in that future is a world where the customer journey is fully seamless across these environments, where companies can provide the best experience to each customer by navigating between web and app without even knowing it.”
Monte Zweben, Co-Founder and CEO of Splice Machine & Chairman of Rocket Fuel Inc.
“In the next 10-15 years, there are three trends to watch for with applications.
The first is that AI is maturing. A combination of cheap parallel computing, Big Data, and better machine learning algorithms have helped AI become a part of life. In fact, recent Accenture research found that, by 2035, the impact of AI technologies on business is projected to increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent and enable people to make more efficient use of their time.
The second is the growth of the Internet of Things. BI Intelligence has forecasted there will be 34 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2020, and nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next five years.
The third is the proliferation and rapid adoption of cloud infrastructure across all segments. The cloud is growing 7 times faster than the rest of IT, according to IDC.”
John Koetsier, Journalist, Analyst, Futurist & Mobile Economist for TUNE
“Apps are under assault from all directions.
First, web and apps are converging. From the web side, rich mobile websites are starting to approach app-like behavior and engagement, and from the app side, instant apps are starting to approach the instant availability of websites. Bots are definitely not the new apps, but are taking the place of apps in some narrow, well-defined niches, like appointment-setting or availability checking. Finally, intelligent agents like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant are going to do more and more of what single apps — and even what multiple integrated apps — currently do. Ordering tickets, making reservations, booking a flight … our agents will do all this and more.”
Supratim Dam, Marketing Specialist at Ready4SApps
“With over 1 billion smartphones and 179 billion mobile applications downloaded per year and more people getting onboard every hour, it’s definitely one of the most active and innovative sectors. The next generation of mobile apps will be built around connectivity, IoT, and smart objects. Though it will be challenging to entice new users to download apps, the achievement lies in the clear definition of the business vision and/or problem-solving. The day is not far when users can stream the functionality of the apps without having to download it first. In the next 15-20 years, mobile apps will no longer continue to be an extension of a marketing channel, but be at the core of delivering success of all businesses. The focus will shift towards Glocalization – solving a local problem whilst having a Global impact. Watch out for these keywords in the industry – Attention, User Experience, Performance Management.”
Gurjeet Singh, Co-founder & CEO of Ayasdi
“The future of the application is intelligence. From the app store to the enterprise, applications will either evolve to include intelligence or they will become extinct.
Our focus is on the enterprise and we are already seeing this evolution as applications make their way out of data science and into the hands of business users. An intelligent enterprise application has certain characteristics – of which all need to be present to rise to the standard. Those attributes are:
1) The capacity to discover patterns data unencumbered by preconceived notions.
2) The ability to accurately predict future outcomes based on current data.
3) The ability to justify its assertions. Justification and transparency build trust and are exceptionally rare features.
4) Intelligence must elicit action – either by a downstream process or software or by a domain expert (not a data scientist)
5) Finally, an intelligence application must have the capacity to learn and adapt.”
Diana Solatan, Managing Director of PLATFORM
“There will most likely be more virtual reality, more augmented reality, more video and more personalization. Apps will be less of an isolated experience and more interconnected. We will rely on them for more aspects of our daily lives. Self-quantification will be pervasive. They will have capabilities to dramatically enhance our lives by optimizing our diet or schedule choices, etc. What we do with that data is up to us. It’s an exciting time to be a designer. Today, we are designing mobile apps in ways that influence users to tap and slide in specific ways, but what about when NeuraLink implants devices that upload information directly to our brains?”
Derek Lee, Chief Architect & Co-founder of LG Fairmont
“Apps for real estate: Bots will be better engineered to improve how banks acquire new business by giving customers a better way to find the best service provider for their mortgage needs. If well architected, bots can be an elegant, cost-effective way to replace redundant information gathering (database populating) conversations. The game changes in higher-touch services like real estate and mortgage services when a wealth of personal information is being exchanged. When big life decisions are in play, today’s bots just won’t be able to match a human touch. The five-factor model of personality traits as applied to bots (agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion and openness) misses some of the most important in the real estate space: empathy and understanding. Looking ahead, we need to go beyond just conveying the right words, and better develop the capability to build trust in another human who is looking out for your best interests.”
Steve Mezak, Founder & CEO of Accelerance
“Interactive Development Environments (IDEs) used by developers will automatically insert source code to implement app functionality. The inserted code will comply with patterns of source code known to be efficient and maintainable. Similarly, ML algorithms will recognize patterns of code entered manually by developers and automatically correct or offer suggested improvements to the developer. I estimate artificial intelligence and ML tools to at least double the productivity of software developers. However, I do not expect AI techniques to impact UX design which will still be best handled by humans who will be interacting with the apps.”
Adam Fingerman, CXO & Co-founder of ArcTouch
“2017 will be the year of the Long Tail App – Many have pointed out that the app market is saturated, and there probably won’t be many more mass market winners. But this year and beyond will present the opportunity for companies and developers to create mobile applications that solve more specific problems for smaller groups of users.
Developers and businesses will realize that app fatigue is bogus – There have been lots of stories about app fatigue, citing data that the number of downloads from the app stores are down. But based on time spent and other engagement metrics, apps have never been more important. It will be realized that building apps for the sake of apps has run out of steam, but building apps that offer truly engaging experiences will be tremendously valuable.”
Siamak Farah, Founder & CEO of InfoStreet
“In the next 10-15 years, the future for apps will bring about the following changes:
* Simplified logic/coding that allows for users to customize app solutions for a perfect fit.
* Evolution of IOT (Internet of Things) into the following areas:
* Privacy of Things (PoT)
* A centralized privacy profile that can be applied across separate apps/devices.
* Security of Things (Sot)
* Securing the multitude of devices being used and offering central control over every device such as the TV, Fridge, Watch, Laptop….
* The development of “app <-> app” interaction, where applications will be able to pick proper data, apply proper logic, and provide the user with the desired results. Solutions like IFTTT are already doing this today. However, within a decade, centralized meta-languages will be built to take this one step further, allowing apps to talk between themselves to create an integrated environment that’s more user-friendly.”
Joshua I. Wilson, Partner & CIO at WorthPointe
“The future of the app industry looks a lot like the discount brokerage industry. Consolidation is ahead. The number of app developers in the world is now in the millions, yet most aren’t remotely profitable. As the space becomes crowded, it gets harder to get your app noticed, let alone downloaded or used. Though we are more dependent on smartphones, the storage space on our phones and their ability to keep up with the energy demands of many apps isn’t keeping up with consumer thirst for apps, and thus may be a bottleneck for app growth. My iPhone is barely a year old and I always find myself sacrificing lesser used apps on my phone to create more space. Due to these considerations, I think the next 10-15 years will bring us more consolidation in the app development industry in order to create the bandwidth needs to tackle these concerns.”
Mark Tuchscherer, President of Geeks Chicago
“I think there is going to be a much larger integration with AI and apps in the next 5+ years. We are already seeing services like x.ai which schedule meetings for you and is very human like. I feel like AI will become a common addition to most things we use in daily life and this includes most apps. I predict in the next ten years we will be telling our phone to start the car and map a route to Starbucks to pick up some coffee and all we will do is sit back as the car takes us to the drive-thru. Either the car manufacturer or a third party app will power this type of new service.”
Kevin Hayen, CTO at Let’s Be Chefs
“Apps are here to stay, the platform just might change. 15 years ago, it was all about the desktop, now it is about mobile, in 15 years it will probably be all about AR. But, at the end of the day, apps will be the primary way we interact with data.”

Progressive Web Apps and their Main Benefits
PWAs lie somewhere between mobile applications and traditional mobile websites, taking the best of both worlds. In their essence, these apps are websites with additional layers of development, which enable them to work as native apps. PWAs can be accessed practically from any device including mobile and desktop and can function within a browser.
Businesses and individual customers that use PWA can get a range of favors.
Universality. PWAs can serve any user regardless of the browser, as they are based on the main principle of progressive improvement.
Swift page loading. A significant benefit of PWA for users is 2 or even 3 times faster page loading compared to regular websites. This feature is attained through such functions as service worker caching, request processing, and more. Consequently, user experience improves, and conversion rates elevate.
A user has nothing to install or update. Functioning as a conventional website, PWAs require neither downloads nor updates. Unlike native apps, which need to be installed, PWAs can be opened through a browser.
Offline availability. PWA can work even when the internet connection is low to none, thanks to the caching information in the service worker file.
Little space occupied. PWAs are significantly lighter than native apps; therefore, occupy less space.
However, every advanced technology comes with certain caveats, and so do PWAs. Thus, PWA design has some limitations on platform and hardware support as well as limited access to the platform’s capabilities compared to native apps. Nevertheless, support and capabilities are continually developing to address these downsides.

According to the Mary Meeker internet trends report, 51% of the world (3.8 billion people) are internet users, an increase from 49% (3.6 billion) in 2017. Smartphones are the primary internet access point for many people across the globe; emerging markets in remote geographies are a mostly untapped market for tech companies.
New trends are emerging that are closely tied with the growing number of internet users. Some of these major trends were described by Hans Tung of GGV Capital at the 2019 Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference.
Here are my learnings and takeaways:
For the past 20 years the model coming out of Silicon Valley has been the “single purpose” app. As the name suggests, these apps are single purpose and focus on solving one consumer pain point and have a clear, easy to use interface. These apps are built to be scalable at the global level with architecture that enable them to expand globally without changing much.
However, over the last 5 years there has been a new trend of “Super Apps” coming out of China. China has a rapidly growing, high density, urban middle class population that has enabled tech companies to capitalize on a “leap frog” effect.
Consumers embrace companies that are able to provide a service with a clear and intuitive interface; that service is then augmented by adding other services/functions. This encourages other merchants to want to partner with the app and provide their services on the app as well. Chinese users are accustomed to seeing a busier interface and appreciate the “one stop shop”. Users will be very loyal to an app that is easy to use, friction free, functional, provides good services and allows for a multifaceted experience. An example of a Super App would be an app where you can order your groceries, book travel, and buy a concert ticket all in one place.
This “Super App” creates an ecosystem where the user’s time is monopolized and there is no need for them to use a variety of apps.  The Super App model is rapidly growing in emerging markets such as India, South America and Southeast Asia. The US/Silicon Valley model is to grow vertically and go global. The focus of these super app companies is to aggressively expanding horizontally and dominate a specific geography.
The emerging markets present the opportunity for digitally born companies to thrive. There is no outdated infrastructure to overcome in these markets – everything can be built and tailored to a new generation of internet users.
Many of these emerging markets (i.e. China) are densely populated areas which has spurred another new trend: the “group purchase model”. This has the potential to be a major macro trend and is worth looking into and understanding.
In developing urban areas (often in China in the 2 nd and 3 rd tier cities) there is an eruption of urbanization. You will see 20-30 buildings in a cluster, each building with 30-60 floors, each floors with 6-12 units per floors. This is an instant community of about 10,000 people. It becomes much easier to efficiently deliver goods to this one cluster (where there may be several thousand people receiving the same good). A dominant Super App enables the “group purchasing” model in these highly dense areas. Hans Tung from GGV articulates these trends in this video.
The developing super apps and “group purchasing” model trends are also spurring a new era in the payments space. In China it is nearly impossible to pay for anything with a credit card, everything is done through mobile payments. Anecdotally it has been said that beggars on the street in China will have a mobile payment QR code so donors can give charity via a mobile phone. Every mom and pop shop will have a mobile payments account set up. It is difficult to find anyone who wants to accept a credit card as payments as they do not want to incur the transaction fees. Legacy credit card companies such as AmEx, Visa, and MasterCard would be well served to consider how mobile payments may disintermediate their user base across all geographies. More smart mobile payment apps will continue to emerge with much lower transactional fees.
The world is becoming a smaller place as more and more people are becoming internet users. These developing geographies are untapped markets – digitally born companies who understand the needs of these consumers are racing to become to become category winners as larger legacy companies are too slow to meet the rapidly increasing demands of these markets.
As you consider your boards’ products, it would be very valuable to ask management to explain their plans to participate in these rapidly dominating new trends of group purchasing, digital payments, and emerging market Super App dominance.

The Future of Web Development – 9 Dominating Trends for 2021
The web development world is an ever-changing environment, which means developers need to stay constantly informed. Clients want state-of-the-art services, and they expect you to deliver them. So, if you want to stay ahead of your competitors, you need to focus on the latest trends and updates. Also, try to anticipate approaches that may be getting popular in the following year.
To help you keep up with what’s new in web development, we made a list of what we believe will be the most dominating trends of 2021. And with features ranging from artificial intelligence to motion design and cloud technology, we can speculate 2021 will be quite a challenging year for developers.
Table of Contents show
All in one place
Users want information, and they want it now. They don’t like to click and wait around for pages to load. This is why single-page apps and single-page websites are starting to gain a lot of attraction.
Single-page apps have been around for quite a few years, but have only recently become a popular choice among developers. They have been created with the purpose of streamlining communication to the server, thus providing both better performance and improved data protection.
As the name calls it, a single-page app is an app that works inside the browser. It does not require you to reload the page when you use it. Some examples are Gmail, Facebook, as well as Google Maps, and Twitter.
Some key advantages single-page apps provide:
Improved user experience in a native browser environment.
Uses less bandwidth.
Focuses more on API.
Setup and debugging are more accessible.

Artificial Intelligence
As you are probably expecting, artificial intelligence is still on the list, and it won’t go away anytime soon. Developers keep discovering new and improved ways AI can be integrated into the development process, precisely since the sector is growing so fast. The AI market was valued at $39.9 billion last year, and it is expected to reach $190.6 billion by 2025. That’s four times more, and then some.
“Consumer behavior shifts very fast, and businesses need to keep up to date. Here is where Artificial Intelligence can help most. Integrating AI in web development can help businesses make more accurate predictions about consumer behavior, and then use those predictions to improve their website and business.” – as nicely explained by Richard Fuessel, the Director of Salt & Fuessel, in one of his recent interviews.
You can gain access to information such as:
What consumers plan to purchase.
The time frame during which the purchase decision is made.
The type of products that attract customers most.
The type of products that customers keep away from.
Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
As we mentioned earlier, users want access to information in a reliable and easy way. This means applications that run smoothly are easy to navigate, load fast, and are reliable. If they also provide a user-friendly experience, then you have got yourself the definition of progressive web apps.
While progressive web apps are not new to developers, they are predicted to dominate the market in 2021. What drives developers to PWA is their ability to deliver a high-quality user experience. The fact that they are also very mobile-friendly will make the demand for PWA increase tremendously in the coming months.
Besides cross-device compatibility, here are some other advantages of PWA:
Improved user experience.
Reduced bounce rates.
Works offline as well.
Makes your app reliable.
Voice-search optimization
Hey Siri, Google, Alexa! Find the nearest restaurant.
The phrase above is all too common for every one of us, which makes voice-search optimization a must for 2021. Voice-oriented apps are not just for those who don’t have time to type in their question, but also for people who don’t have the ability to use the screen.
Voice search is already a big part of our lives, and it will continue to become an even more prominent feature for upcoming apps. It makes apps easy to use and allows us to multi-task – a skill much too needed in this hectic world. It makes for a good user experience, which is much appreciated by customers.
Some of the key benefits of voice-search optimization are:
Ease of use.
Improved user experience.
Intuitiveness.
Speed of execution.
Motion design
Motion design is going to be big in 2021, in both web development and web design. In fact, it is a trend that brings the two together and delivers stellar user experiences.
The trend revolves around minimalistic designs with engaging features integrated to catch the user’s eye. The name suggests motion design is all about animating elements, but in fact, it goes far beyond that. For motion design to be successfully integrated, it needs to be introduced ever since the user experience design stage.
This way, the animations are going to have a clearly defined purpose and won’t just be there to make the page load slower.
Pop-ups, charts, pull-down menus, and page header transitions are just a few of the elements motion design can be implemented.
Here is why you should consider motion design:
It simplifies navigation.
It hides slow loading times.
Reduces bounce rate.
Guides users through the sales funnel.

Chatbots integration
When consumers need help, they have to receive help as soon as possible. If not, they will go somewhere else where they will receive it. This is why chatbots have grown in popularity in the past few years and are going to be even more present in 2021.
Chatbot integration automates communication and makes things more accessible to users. Without needing human assistance, chatbots can use machine learning algorithms to respond to inquiries provided by customers. While for a more delicate situation the customer would still need to get in contact with a human to solve it, chatbots can help speed up the problem-solving process for a lot of simple problems.
Key advantages of using chatbots:
They will streamline communication.
Can be used in a variety of situations.
Easy to train and integrate.
Enhance the user experience.
Native apps
Experts say native apps are going to dominate the web development market in the following year. That’s because they provide reliability to users. One example is when you are working on something, but suddenly you have network connection errors. If the app you are using can’t work offline, it means you will lose valuable time waiting around for things to start working again.
Most native apps can be used without internet connections, with some exceptions, as they are installed directly on your smartphone. Keep expecting more and more clients to ask for this in 2021, in an attempt to deliver better products to customers and stay ahead of their competitors.
Native apps deliver a better user experience as well, as they are uniquely designed to fit the platform on which they are used. Compared to hybrid apps, they will provide much better performance.
The main advantages of native apps:
Can have broad functionalities.
User experience is much better integrated with the device’s OS.
More responsive and faster.
Can use push notifications.
Continuous integration
Speed plays a crucial role in the digital world, as well as in the business sector, and the web development industry is influenced by both. If you want to deliver good services, you need to be fast, reliable, and always up to date.
If you want to make clients stay, you need to work on improving your services, solving bugs, and updating the framework. This will improve the user experience and ensure you keep your applications up to date.
This is part of continuous integration, which englobes the process of automatically testing changes done to your codebase as early as possible. This ensures all possible errors are foundable in the early stages of development, and the product reaches the market faster, and with fewer issues.
Some key advantages of continuous integration are:
Small code changes are easier to do.
Finding and isolating problems quickly.
Increased productivity.
Improved testability.
Cloud technology
The cloud is going to be here for a long time. Both businesses and consumers are becoming more and more interested in it. This year alone, cloud services generated close to $40 billion in revenue. This means a 17% growth over the past year alone. If it continues to grow in a similar fashion, it could exceed $300 billion in total market value in just a year or two.
Looking at these figures is enough to determine that cloud technology is going to be a highly requested service in 2021. And this can only be a success for big cloud vendors such as Microsoft and Amazon.
No matter the industry, small and big businesses across the globe are migrating to the cloud. This trend is going to continue for the following years for sure.
Key advantages of cloud technology:
Great security and scalability.
Improved security for sensitive data.
Improved services for users.

Final Words
These are just a few of the trends that will dominate the web development market in the year 2021. Don’t forget to keep an eye on features such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, and virtual reality as well; they will also be important for the industry in the months to come. Remember that only by being up to date with the trends will you be able to deliver good products to customers.

Insight on Technology: Will Apps Make the Web Irrelevant? The vigorous development of smartphone industry has brought a series of personalized applications such as mobile transfer, e-mail, mobile payment, smart home, etc. These applications provide people with more convenience and better user experience. Today, smartphone users can choose and download various free mobile applications in application stores such as App Store (iOS smartphone) and Play store (Android smartphone. The objective of this case study is to know the benefits of apps over web and will the apps completely take over web in future.? There are many advantages and disadvantages when we are concerned about comparing web to mobile apps. Businesses that use apps to reach their customers often say how they place their own corner on a customer's device. This means that the app download gives them more control and presence on that significant device. This has to deal with the background settings that can
trigger location-based notifications. This background state gathers data about the customer's preferences and behaviors. Another advantage is how much easier it is to use an app in comparison to a mobile website. It only takes a single push on your screen instead of having to open a web browser and typing in a URL. This also means that an app will always work even when there is no internet connectivity as the app will mostly always have some sort of offline functionality which means that the use of apps is more widespread than a mobile site necessary to be connected to the internet. Research even shows that app users are more loyal than mobile site visitors simply due to the ease of use. Mobile sites have their own advantages over apps, when searching for a website you simply google it and you are directed to the website, an app can be harder as in case to locate as you need more precise keywords if you're trying to find something specific. Applications need to be downloaded before you can use them as on website you just need an internet and you can search and browse anything just on click without waiting for something to be downloaded first. Moreover, mobile site is more dynamic, as you can change the content or the design of your website with a simple push of a button instead of having to rework the entire application. I believe the apps will not completely take over the websites. I personally think that apps and the Web will co-exist together and will simply be attractive to different types of customers. They will gain in popularity and get more suppliers and users. I think however that the Web will stay around because we still use it to look things up. It collects all the app information on one platform. I think we're at a stage where apps are here to stay and will keep rising steadily, but the Web is already omnipotent that cannot be left behind. In conclusion, the vastness of the Web can't be replicated by apps right now, there is a possibility to create apps for example looking up information, buying things, playing games, etc. But the usage of apps does limit your possibilities. The Web allows you to use every possible site for it, once you download an app, you're more inclined to get information through this single app as it seems impractical to download multiple apps for different tasks that basically have the same functionality. This would overload your phone memory and it would be less efficient than simply using the Web as this gives you many more choices with less effort.

Alright, I have some search results here. Let's see what they say.

First, there's a document from futureofeverything.io about the future of apps. It has quotes from various experts discussing the future of apps, their relationship with the web, and trends in mobile technology. Some experts mention that apps offer better user experience and access to device features, while others note that the web is evolving with technologies like progressive web apps that are closing the gap between web apps and native apps. There's also a mention of brand safety in apps versus the web.

Next, there's a blog post from multi-programming.com about the future of PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) and web apps in 2022. It talks about the benefits of PWAs, such as universality, fast page loading, no need for installation, offline availability, and less space occupation. It also mentions some limitations, like platform and hardware support, and limited access to platform capabilities compared to native apps. The blog discusses current web app trends, such as the growth of the mobile app industry, increased mobile web traffic, and the partnership between Google and Microsoft to enhance PWA development and distribution.

Then, there's an article from Forbes about "super apps," which are multi-functional apps that offer a wide range of services within a single platform. The article mentions that this trend is emerging from China and is spreading to other regions like India, South America, and Southeast Asia. It contrasts the "single-purpose" apps from Silicon Valley with these super apps that aim to monopolize users' time by providing多种服务在一个平台上。文章还提到了“团购模式”在人口密集地区的发展，以及移动支付在这些市场中的重要性。

第四份文档来自rswebsols.com，标题是“未来网络开发趋势2021”，列出了当年预计会主导的九种趋势，包括单页应用程序、人工智能、渐进式Web应用、语音搜索优化、动态设计、聊天机器人集成、原生应用、持续集成和云技术。这些趋势反映了网络开发领域不断演变的方向，特别是对用户体验和效率的重视。

最后，来自coursehero.com的一份文档讨论了应用程序是否会让网络变得不相关。作者认为，尽管应用程序提供了便利性和个性化的用户体验，但网络仍然具有广泛性和动态性，允许用户轻松搜索和浏览各种信息，而不受应用程序限制。因此，作者认为应用程序不会完全取代网络，两者将共存，吸引不同类型的用户。

综合这些资料，可以得出以下几点：

1. **应用程序的优势**：

   - 提供更好的用户体验和个性化服务。

   - 访问设备的硬件功能，如相机、GPS等。

   - 离线访问能力。

   - 更快的加载速度和响应性能。

2. **网络的优势**：

   - 广泛性和开放性，无需安装即可访问。

   - 跨平台兼容性，可以在任何设备上通过浏览器访问。

   - 信息的多样性和丰富性，尤其是对于搜索和临时访问。

   - 开放标准和协议确保了互操作性和可访问性。

3. **发展趋势**：

   - 渐进式Web应用（PWA）正在缩小传统Web应用和原生应用之间的差距，提供更多的功能和更好的用户体验。

   - “超级应用”在某些地区流行，提供一站式服务，但可能不适用于所有市场和文化。

   - 人工智能、动态设计、聊天机器人等技术的集成增强了应用程序的功能，但也需要网络技术相应发展。

4. **未来展望**：

   - 应用程序和网络将共存，各自满足不同的用户需求和场景。

   - 随着技术的进步，两者的界限可能会进一步模糊，提供更多融合的功能。

基于以上分析，我的结论是：应用程序不会完全使网络变得不相关。虽然应用程序在某些方面提供了优势，如更好的用户体验和设备集成，但网络仍然扮演着至关重要的角色，特别是在信息的广泛可用性、访问的便捷性以及作为开放平台的支持方面。未来的趋势可能是应用程序和网络的进一步整合，以及通过新技术增强彼此的功能。
