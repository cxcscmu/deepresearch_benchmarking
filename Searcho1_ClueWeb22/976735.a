Illegal immigration is a controversial issue due to various reasons. Let me try to understand this step by step.

First, I need to define what illegal immigration is. Illegal immigration refers to the movement of people across national borders in a way that violates immigration laws. These individuals enter a country without proper authorization or stay beyond the period permitted by their visa.

Now, why is this a controversial issue? I think there are several factors at play here.

1. **Economic Impact:** One of the main争议 points is the economic impact of illegal immigrants. Some argue that they take jobs away from native citizens, especially in low-skilled sectors. Others argue that they fill jobs that citizens are unwilling to do, and they contribute to the economy by paying taxes and starting businesses.

2. **Public Services:** Illegal immigrants may utilize public services such as education, healthcare, and welfare without paying the required taxes. This can strain public resources and lead to higher taxes for citizens.

3. **National Security:** There are concerns that非法移民可能成为国家安全的风险，因为难以追踪和监控他们的活动。有些人担心他们可能会从事犯罪活动或恐怖主义。

4. **Cultural Integration:** Illegal immigration can pose challenges to cultural integration. Differences in language, customs, and values may lead to social tensions and difficulties in assimilating into the host country's society.

5. **Human Rights:** On the other hand, there are arguments based on human rights and morality. Some believe that treating illegal immigrants humanely and providing them with basic rights is essential, regardless of their legal status.

6. **Border Control:** Effective border control is a significant challenge for many countries. The debate revolves around how strictly to enforce immigration laws and what methods to use in doing so.

7. **Political Divisions:** Illegal immigration often becomes a politicized issue, with different political parties holding varying stances. This can lead to gridlock and inconsistent policies.

8. **Global Inequality:** Finally, illegal immigration is often a symptom of broader global issues such as poverty, conflict, and inequality. Addressing the root causes requires international cooperation and comprehensive strategies.

In summary, illegal immigration is a complex and multifaceted issue that touches on economics, politics, security, and ethics. The controversy arises from the competing interests and values involved, making it a persistent and challenging problem for nations to address.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Illegal immigration is a controversial issue due to its economic impact, strain on public services, national security concerns, challenges to cultural integration, human rights considerations, difficulties in border control, political divisions, and reflections of global inequality.}} \]
