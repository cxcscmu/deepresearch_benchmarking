So I have this question: "How did Socrates affect the world?" Hmm, I don't know much about Socrates, to be honest. I know he was an ancient Greek philosopher, but beyond that, my knowledge is a bit fuzzy. I need to figure out his impact on the world, which probably means understanding his ideas and how they influenced later thinkers and society.

First things first, I should probably learn who Socrates was and what he did. I think he lived around 2000 years ago, in Athens, Greece. He was known for asking a lot of questions and challenging people's thoughts and beliefs. Apparently, that got him into trouble eventually, but I need to look into that.

I should maybe start by searching for some basic information about Socrates. What were his main ideas? How did he contribute to philosophy? Why is he so important?

Let me try to search for "Socrates influence on the world." Okay, so from what I'm reading, Socrates is considered one of the founders of Western philosophy. His method of questioning people to help them discover the answers themselves is called the Socratic method, and it's still used in education today. That's interesting; maybe that's one way he affected the world—through teaching methods.

Also, Socrates developed the concept of moral philosophy. He believed that the moral values should be based on reason rather than on traditions or laws. He thought that virtue was knowledge, meaning that if you knew what was right, you would do what was right. That seems like a significant idea that could have influenced ethical thinking over the centuries.

Socrates also had ideas about the nature of the soul and the afterlife. He believed in the immortality of the soul and that philosophy was about preparing for death by living a virtuous life. These ideas might have influenced religious and philosophical thoughts about life and death.

Moreover, Socrates had many famous students, like Plato, who went on to develop their own philosophical systems based on Socrates' teachings. Plato, in turn, taught Aristotle, who also had a tremendous impact on Western thought. So, perhaps Socrates' influence is indirect through his students.

I should probably look into the Socratic method more deeply. How exactly does it work, and why is it still used today? Maybe searching for "Socratic method in modern education" would be helpful.

Okay, so from this search, I see that the Socratic method involves asking a series of questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas. It's used in law schools, medical schools, and other educational settings to encourage students to think deeply about the subject matter. So, Socrates' approach to teaching has had a lasting impact on education methods.

Additionally, Socrates' emphasis on questioning beliefs and seeking truth has been influential in the development of scientific thought. The scientific method, which relies on hypothesis testing and evidence-based conclusions, can be seen as an extension of the Socratic approach to seeking knowledge.

Socrates also faced trial and was sentenced to death for his teachings, which challenged the established norms and beliefs of Athenian society. His willingness to stand up for his principles, even unto death, has made him a symbol of free speech and intellectual freedom. This aspect of his life may have inspired others throughout history to speak truth to power and defend intellectual independence.

Perhaps another area to consider is Socrates' impact on political philosophy. His student Plato wrote about an ideal form of government in "The Republic," which was influenced by Socrates' ideas. Although Socrates himself didn't write anything, his thoughts as recorded by Plato have shaped political theories for centuries.

I should also think about how Socrates is portrayed in popular culture. Does he appear in movies, books, or other media? If so, that would indicate his持续影响世人的程度。

让我搜索一下“苏格拉底在流行文化中的表现”。看来他在一些电影、戏剧和文学作品中都有出现，比如柏拉图的对话录被多次改编，还有一些现代小说和戏剧以他为主题。这表明他的故事和思想仍然吸引着当代人。

此外，苏格拉底的名言，如“我知道我一无所知”（希腊语：γνώθι σεαυτόν，拉丁化：gnōthi seauton，即“认识你自己”），这些格言至今仍被引用和思考，说明他的智慧经久不衰。

也许我还应该考虑苏格拉底对伦理学的具体贡献。他提出了美德即知识的观点，认为所有的不善都是出于无知，如果人们真正知道什么是善，他们就会去做。这种观点影响了后来的道德哲学家，如伊曼努尔·康德，他强调理性在道德决策中的作用。

另外，苏格拉底还讨论了正义、勇敢、节制等美德的性质，这些讨论在他与学生的对话中被记录下来，成为了伦理学研究的基础。

也许我可以查找一些关于苏格拉底的次要文献，看看学者们是如何评价他的影响的。可能有一些书籍或者学术文章可以提供更深入的见解。

不过，由于时间有限，我可能需要集中于他的主要贡献：哲学方法、道德哲学、以及他对后世哲学家的影响。

总结一下，苏格拉底通过他的教学方法、对道德哲学的贡献，以及他对追求真理和自由思想的坚持，对世界产生了深远的影响。他的思想不仅塑造了西方哲学的传统，而且还影响了教育、伦理学、政治学等多个领域。

**最终答案**

\[ \boxed{\text{苏格拉底通过他的教学方法、对道德哲学的贡献，以及他对追求真理和自由思想的坚持，对世界产生了深远的影响。}} \]
