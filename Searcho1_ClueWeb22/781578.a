So I've been asked to talk about how our concept of gender identity has changed and broadened in recent years. I think this is an important and sensitive topic, so I want to approach it carefully and make sure I get accurate information. I know that societal views on gender have evolved over time, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, especially regarding recent changes. Maybe I should start by understanding what gender identity actually is.

From what I recall, gender identity is a person's internal sense of their own gender, which might be different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For a long time, society has operated under the assumption that there are only two genders: male and female, corresponding to biological sex. This is often referred to as the gender binary. However, increasingly, people are recognizing that gender is more complex than that and that there are more dimensions to gender identity.

I think it's important to note that this recognition isn't entirely new; various cultures throughout history have acknowledged genders beyond the binary. For example, some indigenous cultures have recognized third genders or gender roles that don't fit neatly into male or female categories. So, in a way, the broadening of gender concepts is also about rediscovering and valuing these diverse perspectives that have been marginalized or ignored in Western-dominated narratives.

In recent years, there has been more visibility and acceptance of transgender individuals, who identify with a gender different from their assigned sex at birth. This includes people who identify as trans men, trans women, and non-binary individuals. The term "non-binary" refers to those who don't identify exclusively as male or female and may see themselves as existing outside the gender binary altogether.

I also hear terms like "genderqueer," "genderfluid," and "agender" being used more frequently. Genderqueer is similar to non-binary and suggests a rejection of traditional gender norms. Genderfluid refers to a gender identity that changes over time, while agender means not identifying with any gender.

It seems like there's been a shift towards recognizing that gender is not just a binary but a spectrum. This idea of a gender spectrum allows for a wider range of identities and experiences. I think this change is partly due to increased awareness and education about gender diversity, as well as the voices of marginalized communities being heard more loudly and clearly in public discourse.

Social media and the internet have played a significant role in connecting people with similar experiences and facilitating the sharing of information and resources. This has helped to normalize discussions around gender identity and allowed for greater visibility of diverse gender expressions.

Moreover, there have been legal and policy changes reflecting this evolving understanding. Many countries and regions now recognize gender identity in their laws, protecting transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals from discrimination. Some places even allow for a third gender option on legal documents, acknowledging the existence of non-binary identities.

In education, there's been a push to include gender diversity in curricula and to create inclusive environments for students of all gender identities. This includes using inclusive language, providing gender-neutral facilities, and offering support services for gender-diverse students.

However, it's important to acknowledge that this broadening of gender concepts is not universally accepted. There are still many societies and communities where rigid gender norms persist, and individuals who deviate from these norms face discrimination, harassment, and even violence. So, while progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve true gender equality and acceptance.

I should also consider the intersectionality of gender identity with other aspects of identity, such as race, class, sexuality, and ability. These intersections can complicate experiences of gender identity and require a nuanced approach to advocacy and support.

In conclusion, our concept of gender identity has indeed changed and broadened in recent years, moving away from a strict binary model to a more inclusive understanding that recognizes a spectrum of identities. This shift is due to a combination of factors, including increased visibility of transgender and non-binary individuals, advances in social and cultural attitudes, and efforts to promote inclusivity and equality.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Our concept of gender identity has evolved from a strict binary model to a more inclusive understanding that recognizes a spectrum of identities, including transgender, non-binary, genderfluid, and agender identities. This change is attributed to increased visibility, education, and advocacy for gender diversity, as well as advancements in social and cultural attitudes. However, challenges remain in achieving universal acceptance and legal protections for all gender identities.}} \]
