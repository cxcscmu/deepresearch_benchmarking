Alright, so I have this question here: "How do culture and diversity directly and indirectly impact gender differences across cultures?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I think I can break it down. First off, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like it's about how culture and diversity influence how genders are perceived and treated differently in various cultural contexts. Both directly and indirectly, so that means there are obvious effects and also more subtle, perhaps unconscious ones.

I guess I should start by defining some terms to make sure I'm on the right track. What is culture? Culture is a set of shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that members of a society use to cope with their world and with one another, transmitted from generation to generation via learning. Diversity, in this context, probably refers to the variety of different cultures or subcultures within a larger society or across different societies.

Gender differences are the distinctions between men and women, which can be biological, psychological, or social. But since we're talking about culture and diversity, I assume the focus is on the social and cultural aspects of gender differences rather than biological ones.

So, directly, culture impacts gender differences by establishing norms, roles, and expectations for each gender. For example, in some cultures, men are expected to be providers and leaders, while women are expected to be caregivers and homemakers. These are direct influences because they are explicitly taught and enforced through socialization.

Indirectly, culture affects gender differences through more subtle mechanisms, like media representation, language, and unconscious biases. For instance, if a culture's media primarily shows men in positions of power, that can influence people's perceptions of gender roles without them even realizing it.

Diversity comes into play because different cultures have different norms and values regarding gender. So, in a diverse society, there might be multiple perspectives on gender roles and differences, which can lead to both conflict and enrichment, depending on how they interact.

I think it would be helpful to look at some specific examples to illustrate these points. Maybe compare gender roles in a patriarchal society versus a matriarchal one, or look at how gender fluidity is recognized in some cultures but not in others.

Also, I should consider how globalization and migration are affecting traditional gender roles. As people move between countries and cultures mix, there might be changes in how gender differences are perceived and enacted.

It might also be useful to look at academic research on this topic. There's probably a lot of sociology and anthropology studies that explore how culture shapes gender identities and relations.

Wait, maybe I should do a quick search to get some concrete examples and scholarly perspectives.

Culture Influences: Gender
Culture can be defined as the ideas, behaviours, attitudes, and traditions that exist within a large group of people. These are passed down from one generation to the next and are often resistant to change. In relation to gender, the effects of cultural influences can be seen by examining the differences in male/female from one culture to another. Margaret Mead (1935) conducted a classic study of cultural differences in Papua New Guinea. She examined three different tribes and found the Arapesh men and women to be gentle, responsive and cooperative; the Mundugumor men and women were violent and aggressive, seeking power and position; and the Tchambuli showed the opposite gender-role behaviours to those seen in most cultures, as the women were dominant, impersonal and managerial and the men were more emotionally dependent. Mead originally concluded that these differences highlight the impact of culture on gender.

Working Paper 27725
DOI 10.3386/w27725
Issue Date August 2020
This paper reviews the literature on gender and culture. Gender gaps in various outcomes (competitiveness, labor force participation, and performance in mathematics, amongst many others) show remarkable differences across countries and tend to persist over time. The economics literature initially explained these differences by looking at standard economic variables such as the level of development, women’s education, the expansion of the service sector, and discrimination. More recent literature has argued that gender differences in a variety of outcomes could reflect underlying cultural values and beliefs. This article reviews the literature on the relevance of culture in the determination of different forms of gender gap. I examine how differences in historical situations could have been relevant in generating gender differences and the conditions under which gender norms tend to be stable or to change over time, emphasizing the role of social learning. Finally, I review the role of different forms of cultural transmission in shaping gender differences, distinguishing between channels of vertical transmission (the role of the family), horizontal transmission (the role of peers), and oblique transmission (the role of teachers or role models).

Culture can be referred to as intellectual and artistic practices, such as literature, drama, music, and art, as well as referred to as a societal beliefs, traditions and practices. Human behavior has been studied in various aspects and across different cultures, as well as compared between cultures.  Through scientific studies, it has been shown that human behavior is directly linked to culture.  In fact, previous research has indicated that certain beliefs within a culture are based on historic cultural beliefs and that those historic beliefs are extreme factors in a culture’s decision making process. (Alesina et al., 2012) Multiple studies have also indicated that differences within cultures can be described either through historical origins or environmental factors or differences. One specific topic that is continually researched is the differences in gender roles between cultures. Since the United States of America contains multiple different cultures, this is an important topic to dissect in order to help establish female roles in our school system, as well as our society.
Gender identification and relations are important factors in a culture as they are shaped by a culture. Gender roles are shaped through the daily rituals that are lived by families and communities, as well as the workplace. Gender can also be compared to ethnicity because gender roles function on the cultural aspects applied to being either a male or female. The clearest example can be described through the division of labor given to male and females. For instance, the phrase, “women’s job” and a “man’s job”, are clearly defined in most societies both in the household, as well as in a community.  (Schalkwyk, 2000) In survey conducted, referred to as the “World Values Survey”, the respondents were asked to agree or disagree to the following statement, “when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women”. Results from Egypt indicated a 94.9% as “agree” with the statement.  (Alesina et al., 2012) In the current American society, it is a general understanding that women are allowed to be equals to males, such as obtaining employment outside of the domestic home; however, this is clearly not the case for some cultures. The current paper, therefore, describes the difference in gender roles of women as a result of human behavior in Caucasian American society and Egyptian society.
In Egypt, the society is characterized by distinct roles in regard to gender. For instance, Egyptian males are referred to as the authoritarian leaders over women. The male gender is in charge of fertility matters and emotional attachment to the spouse and children. In addition, the women are raised to be submissive to their spouse. The result of the role of gender for women in Egyptian society can be described through adolescent development. Adolescent behavior in Egypt is characterized by little rebellion or social context away from the parents in comparison to Western societies.  Furthermore, it has been found that adolescent Egyptians stay closer to home instead of trying to become independent. Males and females also experience this time in their life differently because female adult roles and male adult roles in Egyptian society are completely opposite.  Adolescent males spend their adolescent years creating social networks and how to become an independent adult.  Whereas, adolescent girls begin to undergo a halt in their independence as they enjoyed during their childhood. Adolescent girls are forced to remove themselves from social events, friends, etc., and show a more unassertive behavior towards others.  (Mensch, 2003)  For instance, as Egyptian children begin to increase in age, a difference in activities is seen between boys and girls. Boys are found conducting activities outside of the home and within the community; whereas, the girls are found in the household and not allowed to conduct activities outside of the home.  Schooling is the only activity in which girls are allowed to attend; however, the school year in Egypt is shorter in length compared to other areas. When school is over, girls developing out of the adolescent years are retracted from free time.  (Mensch, 2003)
Education is said to be a predictor of subsequent behavior, as well as an indicator of gender bias in cultures. In Egypt, school enrollment for boys is almost mandatory within households; however, girls are a huge disadvantage. It has been found that only 84% of girls attend elementary school, compared to 95% of boys. In addition, although there is only a 11% decrease between gender school enrollment, by the time a girl exits adolescence, the traditional behaviors put upon women in the Egyptian culture still remain. Why do women even attend school in Egypt? The psychological reasoning in the culture comes from beliefs that the girls will obtain more social awareness and social practice, in addition to the increased probability of finding a good mate; whereas, the boys are believed to obtain the right education for the workforce. This clearly indicates a gender bias between girls and boys in Egypt, thereby illustrating the behavioral differences that are shaping the Egyptian culture. (Mensch, 2003)
In regard to work, working Egyptian women is extremely low. In fact, the National Labor-Force survey indicated the employment rates for Egyptian women at only 16% of women. (Assad et al., 2000) Women receive high discrimination even if educated and trying to find a job.  Any type of decrease in economy results in the loss of women jobs. In addition, women who obtain a job and get married are expected to quit in order starting having children. The laws and regulations regarding maternity leave and working hours are not meaningful to working mothers in Egypt and are at high cost to the employer.
Historic American culture had clear defined gender identities and roles between males and females.  The traditional roles were obtained through immigrants settling from European countries. The husband was provided with the breadwinner role and the wife as the caregiver.
These roles were the basics of life and it was initially unheard of women entering the workforce, voting, going to college, and obtaining a job; however, the United States has proven to provide individuals with equal rights with the rise in Feminism during the 19 th century. During World War II, specifically, women’s roles changed and shaped women’s equality and rights for the future years.  With the men at war women took on the jobs to support the economy and during this time, women’s labor helped the country and consequently helped change female gender roles in the American culture. (Hawke, 2003)
Although the United States has made substantial progress in regard to women’s rights and equality, there are still some lingering issues that the United States is faced with as well. The United States has proven to have an increase in the education department with women entering college and using their education to obtain employment; however,
There are still issues for women who do enter the workforce, such as limited maternity leave benefits and childcare. The same issues in which face working Egyptian women. (World Economic Forum, 2005)
Previous studies have shown that there remains a gender gap in multiple countries worldwide, not just in Egypt. According to the World Economic Forum, there are five areas that have helped countries reach equality between men and women. These areas are as follows: economic participation, economic opportunity, educational attainment, health and well-being, and political empowerment. Over 50 countries were analyzed with multiple countries decreasing the gap between genders, particularly in the Nordic countries, such as Sweden. Some countries, such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom have out-competed the United States in decreasing the gender gap.  (World Economic Forum, 2005)  It can therefore be expressed that more and more countries have been aware of the benefits of the equality for women through the increase in economic and political status.  With such positive outcomes and increase in participation in women rights and equality in other countries, it is hard to believe that traditions and behavior with inequality towards women exists in countries such as Egypt.
Gender equality is part of human social behavior and development. It can be suggested that Egypt has yet accept the notion that allowing women the same rights and responsibilities as men, may increase their economic and political status. Instead, gender roles are solely based on whether someone is born male and female, with their role in society clearly written or established from birth on.

There are groups that help support the need for countries such as Egypt in changing their behavior and traditional gender roles. One program is known as the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).  The purpose of this group was to help countries mainstream genders and create equal opportunities for women and men. For instance, the goal of the program is to help develop policies, research, and society norms for women. Although these groups help change society norms, it is often difficult to change behavior in a household. (World Economic Forum, 2005) In regard to Egyptian culture, the traditions and norms for these families are to have the women stay in the home and not work. Part of the resistance of this culture for change could be religious aspects as well.  Religion could take and huge part in their traditions and fear of abandoning their faith could take a major role in the lack of willingness to change society views of gender roles.
Equality in gender roles seems to be a slow process. The United States began with equality movements in the 19 th century and equality issues still exist. The main focus should be helping other cultures see the benefits that women could provide to their society with changes to their traditions and beliefs. Expanding knowledge to each individual in a society can help educate the other cultures and obtain new ideas that could not only decrease the gap in gender roles, but keep an open mind and an understanding between cultures.

A culture where there are clear differences in men's and women's roles and power.
Egalitarian culture
A culture where gender roles are more flexible and equal.
Masculine culture
A culture which values stereotypical 'male' qualities such as independence or achievement.
Feminine culture
A culture which values stereotypical 'female' qualities such as cooperation.
Individualistic culture
Those that stress the needs of the individual over the needs of a group as a whole.
Collectivist culture
Those that emphasize the needs and goals of the group as a whole over the needs and wishes of an individual.
Mead (1930s)
Mead studied 3 tribes in New Guinea and found that gender roles were very different to those in Western societies. In the Arapesh tribe, both men and women fitted the feminine stereotype. In Mundugumar, men and women followed a masculine stereotype. In Tchambuli, the gendered behaviour was the opposite of that expected in Western society. Women were 'pratical' and 'robust', whereas men were 'flirtatious'.
Whiting and Whiting (1975)
Whiting and Whiting studied child rearing practices in 6 cultures: North America, Phillipines, India, Mexico, Kenya and Japan. Researchers integrated themselves within the communities and observed children on a daily basis (5 minutes per day). They found that parents' basic goals were the same - for children to survive, be attached to the family and be healthy. Parents were concerned that children learned appropriate social behaviours. Children's socialisation was influenced by how much work they were expected to do and what it consisted of. (For example NA = 2% and Kenyan = 41%.) In Kenya, sharp distinctions were made between males and females as they both had to work from a young age. North Americans did little work so gender roles were less defined.

Cultural influences AO2/3 Research Evidence
Medicine (1997) argued that the blurring of gender roles can be clearly seen in the Lakota society where they have a word 'winkte', meaing 'wants to be like a woman'. In Lakota society some males didn't want to be warriors and could be 'winkte'. Those labelled winkte excelled in women's crafts and preferred to take care of the children. Children were regarded as autonomous and it was acceptable to become winkte. The implication on parenting is that culture is crucial in influencing the extent to which gender roles are enforced: some cultures are more accepting than others. This supports this explanation as it shows that cultures differ in their understanding of gender roles which in turn impacts the extent to which individuals feel obliged to follow gender roles. HOWEVER we need to be careful when making generalisations, as the relationship is likely to be much more complex than these studies suggest. Gewertz (1981) observed the Tchambuli tribe in the 1970s and found males to be more aggressive than females. He argued that Mead studied these tribes when they were facing a transition in their lifestyle as Australian laws on violence forced them to behave differently than normal. This shows how important it is to consider the influence of a culture's historical context. In later years Mead actually questioned the role of culture and became more open to biological and evolutionary based arguments. This questions the impact of culture as it shows other factors can affect one's perception of gender roles. IN CONCLUSION cultural influences need to be considered when explaining gender roles but there are other factors which also play a part e.g. biological.
Cultural influences AO2/3 Nature vs Nurture
Nurture side of the debate.
Cultural influences AO2/3 Conflicting Explanation
Evolutionary approach. William and Best (1990) tested 2800 students in 30 countries and found gender similarities between cultures. Men were seen as more dominant and aggressive , whereas women were seen as more nurturing. Implication is evolutionary approach would explain these findings suggesting men are aggressive in order to warn off other rivals and because it indicates protection, an attractive quality from a female's perspective. PIT also suggests women invest more time into children as they're certain it is their own offspring, unlike men. Questions research into cultural influences as it offers an alternative explanation to gender roles. HOWEVER the wealth of differences found between cultures suggest it can't be evolutionary reasons alone. Leung and Moore (2003) found that both male/female English Australians showed masculine traits valued in individualistic cultures; whereas Chinese Australian males/females showed feminine traits valued in collectivist cultures. Questions evolutionary explanation and suggests cultural differences are due to socialisation because there's a clear difference in gender roles between cultures. IN CONCLUSION evolutionary approach explains gender roles to an extent but cultures are critical in determining our perceptions of gender roles.

Gender Roles in Society
Different cultures deal differently with gender roles in society.
There are so-called masculine cultures and there are feminine cultures.
The downside of these two names (masculine and feminine) is that there usually is an immediate association with gender.
In the original research work of Geert Hofstede , the intention was never there to trigger a strong association with gender-related issues in society.
But evidently, these associations are there and for a bigger part, they are not related.
So when it comes to culture and gender the words “ masculinity ” and “ femininity ” do not point to gender differences.
Culture and Gender Roles in Society
The cultural dimension Masculinity – Femininity says something about the expected behavior of men and women in any given society.
To simplify it: in high-scoring cultures, there seems to be relatively little role overlap; men are supposed to provide for their families, be the head of the family, and do manly tasks like taking the garbage out.
While in more feminine societies, there is more role overlap; here it is OK if a woman earns more than a man and the “ stay at home dad ” is more accepted than in masculine societies.
So when it comes to culture and gender this would be the closest link to gender differences and gender roles in society.
Take a look at the image below. This picture was taken during one of my trips to the Middle East (or read this article specifically about Dubai ). A sign like that would be impossible in a feminine country like Sweden, for instance.
What are the Gender Roles in Society Within one Culture?
In any country in the world, you will find so-called IntrA-cultural differences; differences within one country, say the American East Coast and the American West Coast. Or the differences between the North and the South of Spain.
Differences within one country are called IntrA-cultural differences.
Differences between countries are called IntER-cultural differences.
There are definitely differences in gender roles within one country. In other words, American women will be less masculine than their male countrymen.
The same will be true for the most feminine country in the world, Sweden; also there will men be more masculine than women.
A clear example is the following “ Word Cloud “, which illustrates the use of words in Social Media of English-speaking men and women.
What you can clearly see is that English-speaking men use more forceful language than English-speaking women.
However, when you compare English-speaking women with Swedish women, you will still see that there is a big significant difference is between those two countries/groups when you look at the scores of these countries on this masculinity and femininity dimension.

Okay, so from the search results, I've got a few documents that seem relevant. Let's go through them one by one.

The first document is from tutor2u.net, and it's about how culture influences gender. It mentions a study by Margaret Mead from 1935, where she looked at three tribes in Papua New Guinea and found different gender roles in each. The Arapesh had both men and women being gentle and cooperative, the Mundugumor had both being violent and aggressive, and the Tchambuli had women being dominant and men being emotionally dependent. This suggests that gender roles can vary widely across cultures, and it's not just about biological differences.

The second document is from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and is a working paper on "Gender and Culture" by Paola Giuliano. It seems quite academic, discussing how cultural values and beliefs affect gender differences in various outcomes like labor force participation and mathematical performance. It also talks about how these cultural factors can persist over time and how they might change through social learning and different forms of cultural transmission.

The third document is from essays.io and is a research paper example on "Gender Roles in Different Cultures." It compares gender roles in Caucasian American society and Egyptian society, highlighting how in Egypt, there are very traditional gender roles with men as authoritative figures and women as submissive. The paper discusses how these roles affect education, work, and adolescent behavior in Egypt, and contrasts this with the more egalitarian trends in American society, although it notes that some gender inequalities still exist there.

The fourth document is from Quizlet and appears to be flashcards on "Cultural Influences on Gender." It defines terms like traditional culture, egalitarian culture, masculine culture, and feminine culture. It also mentions studies by Whiting and Whiting, Chang, Guo and Hau, and Gewertz, which seem to explore how child-rearing practices and societal expectations shape gender roles in different cultures.

The fifth document is from culturematters.com and discusses "Culture and Gender Roles in Society," referencing Geert Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, specifically the masculinity-femininity dimension. It explains that in more masculine societies, there are clearer and more distinct gender roles, with men expected to be providers and women to be caregivers, while in more feminine societies, roles are more overlapping and egalitarian.

From these sources, I can see that culture plays a significant role in shaping gender differences across societies. Direct impacts include the establishment of norms and expectations about gender roles, which are taught and enforced through socialization. Indirect impacts might involve subtler influences like media representation, language, and unconscious biases that reinforce certain gender stereotypes.

Diversity comes into play because in societies with multiple cultures, there are varied perspectives on gender roles, which can lead to both conflicts and enrichments. For example, in a diverse society like the United States, there are ongoing debates and adjustments in gender norms as different cultural viewpoints interact.

Moreover, the persistence of these gender differences can be attributed to cultural transmission through generations, as seen in the way traditions and beliefs are passed down. The NBER paper mentions different forms of cultural transmission, such as vertical (family), horizontal (peers), and oblique (teachers or role models), which all contribute to maintaining or changing gender norms.

It's also interesting to note that while some cultures have rigid gender roles, others are more flexible. The Mead study shows that gender roles can vary significantly even within the same geographical area, depending on the specific cultural context.

Furthermore, globalization and migration are factors that can influence gender roles by exposing people to different cultural norms and sometimes leading to changes in traditional roles. For instance, women migrating from more conservative cultures to more egalitarian societies might adopt new roles and expectations.

In terms of education and work, cultural influences are profound. In some cultures, like Egypt as described in the research paper, there is a strong preference for men to be the breadwinners, with women's education and work opportunities being secondary or even discouraged. In contrast, in more egalitarian cultures, there is greater acceptance of women in the workforce and equal educational opportunities.

Adolescent development is another area where cultural influences on gender are evident. In some cultures, adolescents are socialized into traditional gender roles early on, with different expectations and restrictions based on gender. This can affect their behavior, aspirations, and future roles in society.

Overall, culture and diversity have both direct and indirect impacts on gender differences across cultures. Directly, through established norms and expectations, and indirectly through subtle influences like media and socialization processes. Understanding these influences is crucial for promoting gender equality and addressing disparities in different cultural contexts.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Culture and diversity directly and indirectly impact gender differences across cultures by establishing norms, roles, and expectations for each gender, as well as through more subtle mechanisms like media representation, language, and unconscious biases.}} \]
