Let’s get started.
What is Sales Force Automation (SFA)?
Sales Force Automation, also called sales automation, involves the use of software applications or programs to conduct sales management activities. It refers to the use of “sales automation software” to create automated sales management processes and workflows for the proper administration of a business' entire inbound and outbound sales.
For businesses, sales automation serves as an effective medium through which the entire sales process is simplified. Manual, repetitive, and time-consuming sales management activities are eliminated and sales representatives have more resources on their hands to be more productive.
With the help of Sales Force Automation, sales representatives focus on more important tasks and are more accurate in completing business deals and providing sales forecasts.

Sales Force Automation is very important for every point in the whole sales process. Inbound sales management activities prompting customers to make the first move in purchasing a product become easier to execute. With sales automation, your team works with dedicated software in convincing customers about the viability of your goods or services and converting leads into sales.
Outbound sales processes are not left out. Businesses needing to repeatedly push themselves out to their target audience may find the whole process difficult and tiring in the long run.
Sales Force Automation makes outbound sales processes easier. It involves you making use of specialized software applications to directly contact potential customers and take over the whole outbound sales process in the most effective and efficient of ways.
Nonetheless, no matter the type of sales process you wish to use this software for (outbound sales and inbound sales), you enjoy automated solutions dedicated to seamless and effective contact management, opportunity management, and sales task management.

The complete history of your customer profile updates and interactions are available in one centralized workspace. Sales Force Automation allows you to track sales leads, and enjoy prompt outbound reminders and notifications to maximize the profitability of your entire sales process.
Difference Between Sales Force Automation and CRM
When talking about Sales Force Automation, customers are the main focus. Whether outbound or inbound, the whole sales process majorly involves the acquisition and conversion of customers into sales.
In doing this, customer information is collected and customer relationships are established and managed. However, if this is the case, what makes Sales Force Automation (SFA) different from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) ?
The major difference between these two is simple. Sales Force Automation aims at acquiring more customers while CRM aims at keeping acquired customers satisfied.

Other differences between Sales Force Automation and CRM revolve around their major concern, the information provided, and automation.
1. Major Concern
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is majorly concerned with the management of customer relationships to keep them satisfied and interested in future dealings. It involves the centralized gathering of customer data and information sourced from different historical interactions, complaints, queries, meetings, and purchase history.
Data from each customer is analyzed and customer interactions are specially optimized towards giving each client a personalized experience in the hope of increasing satisfaction.
Alternatively, Sales Force Automation is mainly concerned with acquiring these customers through sales and pipeline management tools. With Sales Force Automation, the enticement of potential customers as well as the conversion of interested individuals are given priority.
2. Information Provided
Sales Force Automation (SFA) provides businesses with beneficial information about completed sales, past sales rep performance, and future sales prospects. Information about these is then used to spot weaknesses in the inbound and outbound sales process and make improvements on them.
SFA processes focus on tasks such as prospecting, scheduling, and organizing sales activities that fall outside the scope of a CRM. All these are implemented in a bid to boost the productivity of the whole sales process in attracting more customers and, eventually, more revenue for the business.
From the above, it could be said that Sales Force Automation occurs before any form of CRM activity is possible. It is why a lot of CRM software in the market today acts as an all-in-one solution to managing the whole sales process.
CRM tools go the extra step in integrating Sales Force Automation processes into their systems for the acquisition of customers. It provides businesses with beneficial information that helps retain and keep customers satisfied.
3. Automation
While all Sales Force Automation processes are automated, the same cannot be said of CRM activities.
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) involves every activity, both manual and automated software-assisted, aimed at managing customer relationships. Sales Force Automation only includes automated software-assisted processes used in acquiring new customers.

Benefits of Sales Force Automation
The benefits of Sales Force Automation include increasing your sales team productivity, automatically keeping records and collecting data, decreasing the cost of sales, and reducing your response time.
1. Increase Your Sales Team Productivity
According to ConvergeHub, Sales Force Automation can boost your sales productivity by up to 14% and increase your final deal closures by 30%. Sales Force Automation allows your sales teams to focus on the most important tasks and avoid wasting time on unproductive activities.
Making use of Sales Force Automation software means freeing up extra time for your sales team members to perform more administrative tasks. Your sales representatives leave the more basic tasks to the software and have more time to focus on other activities.
Manual, day-to-day tasks are left to the software for more productive activities like calling prospects, working on strategies, or setting up appointments that are likely to result in sales.
Eliminating repetitive, manual, and time-consuming tasks gives your sales team more room to focus on strategies for customer acquisition and maintaining relationships with existing customers. You also minimize the possibility of human error arising from consistently tedious workflows. Businesses can use Sales Force Automation to reduce their Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC).
With Sales Force Automation software, you avoid losing customers due to simple blunders like forgetting to contact a customer in time or omitting an important piece of information about a customer. All these processes are accurately automated, making your whole sales process more effective.
Some of the top Sales Force Automation software in the market also run on mobile devices. It means your team gets to manage the sales automation process and have access to important information for making important decisions from anywhere and at any time.
2. Automatically Keep Records And Collect Data
A lot of companies either manually store the records and data normally collected during the sales process or do not even keep track of it at all. It may be due to very tight work schedules or insufficient staff for record-keeping.
Sales Force Automation software gives such businesses a chance to keep a record of important sales process data without having to think of sparing extra time or costs.
Data is collected automatically through different sources and can be easily synced with a CRM system for proper customer management. Keeping track of data is important for any sort of business management activity.
3. Decrease The Costs Of Sales
As data is automatically collected from different sources, your sales team gains more information regarding your sales process. With Sales Force Automation software, you have access to a lot of important insights that help to improve the overall understanding of your business's unique sales process.
Insights from reporting and analytics tools allow you to know which activity is productive and which is not. With this, your business intelligence is improved and you get to effectively plan budgets targeted towards properly exploiting your future sales opportunities.
Your whole sales process is optimized with the most effective strategy and the costs accrued from unproductive, time-consuming manual tasks are totally eliminated. Sales are completed faster as you easily find customers that are more likely to purchase your product or services.
Sales Force Automation software does not only offer you a decrease in sales process-related costs. It also offers you a potential increase in sales performance and boosts your Return on Investment (ROI) as forecasts become more accurate and the process becomes quicker and more seamless.
4. Reduce Your Response Time
Sales automation can help to reduce the time used for sales administration. The Sales Force Automation software helps to immediately take care of the more basic sales process tasks. Thanks to the automation of these basic tasks, sales representatives have more time to respond to more complex sales tasks.
The more difficult processes such as the conversion of the problematic prospects are well taken care of. Representatives pay extra attention to response time and fast prospect servicing, increasing the chances of recording more sales.

Potential Risks of Sales Force Automation
Sales Force Automation tools majorly take care of the procedural or administrative tasks such as dialing, emailing, and voice mailing. The automation of these processes, however, is where all the risks abound.
1. No Personalization
According to LinkedIn's State of Sales report, 47% of key decision-makers hold that receiving specific information about them affects whether they choose to engage with a salesperson.
The same report states that 96% of decision-makers are likely to consider dealing with a business if sales representatives show an understanding of their specific business needs. Sales Force Automation does not guarantee this important personalized effect.
Sales Force Automation software can not be left to work all on its own. Your sales personnel need to work side-by-side with it and be as efficient and hardworking as the software itself.
A lot of prospects or potential customers want to know what they can specifically gain from dealing with your business. Sadly, solutions offered by Sales Force Automation software, like automated voicemails and automated emails, do not guarantee this customized outreach.
Even when contacts are split into collective groups, interactions are not personalized enough. Your sales team members are still required to have interaction with every prospect and create personalized strategies for a higher chance of enticing and converting them to sales.
2. Customer Perception May Be Affected
Another risk that arises from your sales team not being on the same wavelength as the Sales Force Automation software implemented is that your customer perceptions may be affected.
Auto dialing is one of the solutions offered by Sales Force Automation software to make the whole sales process more seamless. Contacts in your database are constantly dialed by the software until one of them is gotten on the line. This increases your chances of attracting and converting leads into sales.
But what happens when, after dialing a prospect, a salesperson is not immediately available to have a convincing discussion?
Having your prospect waiting on calls without them hearing anything does not do your sales efforts any good. If anything, it only affects how prospects view your company, especially because you are trying to attract customers you have not had business dealing with beforehand.
Dialed contacts could hang up or if a sales team member is not prepped up to give a very good pitch, that effort goes to waste.
Without consistent availability of prepared sales personnel, you stand a chance of ruining very good prospects, future dealings with them, and the overall perception of your service.
3. Money Could Be Wasted
According to a report by The Bridge Group, Sales development representative teams alone are reported to spend an average of $371 per month on sales automation tools.
Spending this amount of money per month is not the problem. The problem is the Return on Investment (ROI) you get from your sales efforts.
Automating all your prospect outreach activities means getting in touch with a lot of your contacts as fast as you can. Doing this through software may be easier but how many are you able to convert, considering these relationships are not organically built?
Subjecting all your contact outreach activities to SFA software may guarantee you contact with prospects but does not help you with converting even the most promising leads if proper measures are not taken. It is always important for sales teams to create lists of the most promising prospects and personally build relationships with them.
When you use Sales Force Automation software to contact multiple contacts, your email address could be blacklisted for spamming or contacting multiple invalid email addresses. You may even have to pay penalties for contacting individuals who have not opted in to your communications.
4. Undeveloped Sales Team
Your sales team only gets better at formulating sales strategies through experience. Constantly practicing pitching, identifying pain points, handling objections, and generally dealing with prospects, helps develop skill sets that make sales effort more efficient.
An over-automated sales process means this experience and eventual improvement of communication skills are done away with.
Without experience, your sales team suffers from a lack of preparation for more complex and difficult sales operations. Effective sales strategies are harder to come up with and your lead conversion rate eventually suffers a decline.
Key Sales Processes to Automate
Even though some sales processes are better managed manually than left to a software program, Sales Force Automation can be very beneficial for a handful of processes.
Source: Oberlo
Some of the key processes include prospecting, lead tracking, and scoring, scheduling, data collection from interactions, data management, emailing, and proposals and requests for proposals (RFPs).
1. Prospecting
Before making sales, customers need to be acquired and this could be very difficult, especially when there is not enough data to drive sales efforts. Sales Force Automation software allows you to seamlessly take care of this part of your sales operations.
A Sales Force Automation system provides you with enough data and information to easily seek out the right type of prospects that are more likely to be converted to sales. You get the best leads and gain relevant information about them for more effective and personalized sales efforts.
Your most promising leads can be set apart based on data recorded from their interactions with your company. This data includes the recorded actions they perform on your website or the behavioral trends inferred through AI-powered Sales Force Automation software features.
2. Lead Tracking And Scoring
After making contact, a Sales Force Automation system assesses your prospect’s needs and provides your sales team with the information they use to relate with them based on their specific needs.
A Sales Force Automation system automatically tracks your prospects’ actions on various integrated platforms as well as their engagement with your business.
Prospect tracking helps you determine the most appropriate time to reach out and talk to each prospect. AI-powered lead scoring capabilities also help you to know which prospect is more likely to be converted.
There are a lot of individuals that fit into the “target audience” description. However, not all these individuals will eventually become customers, and not taking precautions means wasting a lot of time and resources.
With data collected through prospect tracking, a Sales Force Automation software scores each lead and allows you to efficiently exploit your lead management opportunities.
3. Scheduling
Scheduling meetings and calls is a very important step while taking a personalized approach in relating with prospects. With Sales Force Automation software, it becomes a lot easier thanks to its integration with scheduling software .
Prospects get to see the daily calendar of your sales representatives right away and pick a time that is most convenient for them.
Where sales representatives are not present to receive calls, alerts or notifications are sent to inform the whole team of an incoming call or message. It ensures that your whole sales team is always available for any scheduled meeting.
4. Data Collection From Interactions
Data collection is one of the most time-consuming and tedious tasks in the sales process. It is most especially true when you have to take notes while interacting with prospects. There is a lot of room for making errors.
Sales Force Automation software helps you record and analyze data from interactions with your prospects in real-time. Through AI-powered technologies, Sales Force Automation systems help you to capture data about the prospect, store it for future reference sales and analyze it for immediate use by your sales team.
5. Deal Management
A Sales Force Automation system helps you with everything that has to do with managing deals; from contact management to order management.
Through Artificial Intelligence, your calls, emails, and meetings are automatically recorded and, when needed, insights into these past deals and interactions are provided. These insights help you determine the best deal for a customer and recommend potential offers you could present to prospects for an increased chance at conversion.
Manual data entry and analysis are exchanged for more time for your sales team to choose the best deals and strategies specific to each prospect.
6. Emailing
Another important part of an effective sales process is email campaigns and Sales Force Automation software helps with this. Your email campaigns are automated and, with proper actions from your sales team, they are made more profitable.
Certain personalized messages are sent to certain individuals once a trigger action is performed. The Sales Force Automation software collects and analyzes data about the prospect for your sales team to study. Once the first personalized email contact is made, subsequent interactions are automated and only require little monitoring from your sales team members.
A Sales Force Automation system also keeps track of your best emails and stores them. You can refer back to them and make use of the email templates that have proved to be effective in bringing in leads.
7. Proposals and Requests For Proposals (RFPs)
A Sales Force Automation system allows you to automate the process of seeking proposals from potential supply partners. You easily track the results you get from these RFPs through generated data and easily reuse effective templates for future requests.
Sales processes are made more seamless to manage and execute with the help of sales automation software. These are important processes that a sales team cannot do without.
Automating a business’ sales processes helps to reduce the amount of repetitive tasks sales personnel get involved in. When you use Sales Force Automation in close collaboration with team members, the whole sales process inevitably yields better results.

What Features Should You Look For in Sales Force Automation Software?
Not all sales force automation software available in the ever-growing software market is great for your business. There are several features you should look out for when choosing a sales force automation software to use to automate your sales process.
They include the scope of lead enrichment, communication automation and personalization capabilities, CRM integration, pre-formatted email templates, and automation, meeting scheduling, deal management automation, and automated led rotation and scoring.
1. Scope Of Lead Enrichment
Lead enrichment includes the process of collecting information about a particular prospect. The range of data sources which a sales automation software uses to gather information about a prospect is important.
Data gives you an up-to-date, comprehensive profile of your prospect and allows you to head into sales conversations with more insight. The more data you have about a prospect, either on company size, industry, solutions, responsibilities, or social media presence, the more personalized your sales efforts are.
With a lot of data, it becomes easier to personally connect with prospects and earn their trust. Top sales automation tools obtain information from hundreds or thousands of data sources and you should consider these before choosing one. Data and information are the most important elements in improving any sales process.
2. Communication Automation and Personalization Capabilities
Good sales automation software allows you to automate your communications with your prospects. It is one of the repetitive tasks that your salesperson would have to engage in.
When you have a lot of prospects, manually communicating becomes a difficult task to execute properly. With automated communication capabilities, you get to delegate a lot of this repetitive task to the software to handle.
Autoresponders make use of pre-fixed templates and scripts while communicating with prospects, meaning they could prove harmful for your sales efforts. It is the reason why you should not only go for software with automated chatbots but go for software with AI-powered chatbots that send personalized messages to prospects.
AI-powered chatbots make use of data collected from past interactions to personalize communications and provide the personalized effect needed to convert prospects.
3. CRM Integration
For an effective and comprehensive sales process, your sales automation software needs to work hand-in-hand with a CRM tool. CRM helps you improve on customer relationships and keep customers satisfied after your sales automation activities yield results.
Manually adding contact data from your sales automation is a daunting task and integration with CRM software only makes it easier.
With integration with a CRM tool, data from prospect interactions like webinar participation, surveys, email subscriptions, and Facebook Lead Ads, among others can be used to effectively improve customer relationships.
4. Pre-formatted Email Templates And Automation
Email campaigns are one of the most effective outbound sales operations in the whole sales process. Its vital importance means your sales team has to always deal with everything concerning it.
Choosing a sales automation software that offers you pre-formatted email templates, or even allows you to save your existing email content as email templates, helps you save time.
For instance, emails for prospecting, meeting confirmation, and follow-up usually do not vary much. Having effective email templates for these helps you save a lot of time. Even with this, the ability to personalize the content of these templates for your prospects is important.
Access to effective templates is one thing, having to send these personalized email templates to multitudes of prospects is another.
A sales automation software that allows you to automatically create and send personalized campaign emails to prospects is important. You choose when these emails are sent and also automate follow-up emailing tasks as well.
5. Meeting Scheduling
Another factor to consider is if the software allows you to automatically schedule meetings with prospects. Some sales automation tools automatically send your prospect a link to your work schedule and prompt them to choose any open time they are comfortable with.
Choosing a sales automation software that offers meeting scheduling features is important. You skip the need to repeatedly reach out to prospects to have real-time interactions just to book meetings.
6. Deal Management Automation
Having to repeatedly log information about contact profiles and interactions just for future reference while coming up with deals becomes stressful. It is especially true in the long run when there are a lot of prospects to manage.
As this is an inevitable task in the sales process, automating any deal-related activity is important. You should look for a sales automation tool that records your calls, meetings, and emails for future personalized interactions and automates follow-up tasks with these prospects.
7. Automated Lead Rotation And Scoring
Having the capability to automate your lead rotation is very important for your sales process. Manually assigning leads to their appropriate sales representative takes up precious time and even leaves you prone to losing a prospect due to human error.
A sales automation software with an auto-rotator feature allows you to automatically assign leads according to geographic territory, company size, or a combination of a lot of other criteria.
Automated lead scoring is also important as it helps you prioritize leads for more productive sales efforts. A top sales automation software considers demographic and behavioral data and determines how feasible converting the lead is.

Examples of Sales Automation
1. Alerts About New Developments With Prospects
While monitoring prospects, sales personnel may not be on-hand all the time to notice new developments and act promptly. As prospects have different schedules and objectives themselves, sales automation means you do not have to worry about missing any change in these.
A sales automation software immediately notifies your sales team about developments. Developments could be, for instance, a new product launch by a prospect company or availability and preferential claims by a prospect individual.
Knowing these as soon as possible means you never miss an opportunity to engage prospects in the right way. You contact relevant prospects whenever suitable, either through your sales representatives or the software itself.
2. Picking Up New Prospects
Another instance of sales automation is the registration of new prospects from platforms, businesses, or services you have an interest in.
For instance, when you target a prospect company through the Sales Force Automation software, you could immediately add the contact of new employees as soon as they are hired.
Your Sales Force Automation software automatically emails them with a welcome message, for example, and could send out surveys to them in the future or an immediate response is gotten.
An automated notification can be sent to one of your sales team members to call the new prospect and schedule a virtual meeting.
3. Tracking Customer Behavior On Your Website
Keeping track of prospect behavior on your website is especially important for your inbound sales operations. Your websites are there to boycott the rigid and direct outreach operations and build organic interest in your target audience. A Sales force Automation software helps you both improve on your websites and the whole sales process through website tracking.
Having insightful data about how your visitors navigate through your website helps you know how effective each website element is. You get to improve on weak elements that seem to be killing visitors' interest. Sales Force Automation software does this without enabling cookies or leaving any other form of digital footprint on your website.
A Sales Force Automation software also tells you where your website visitors are coming from, helping you to filter your target audience for more productive results.
For example, if a lot of visitors are coming from a particular company, you know that your products or services generate interest there. You can then execute an outbound sales operation by contacting the appropriate authority in that company.
4. Preventing Subscription Expirations
Alongside your general sales process, Sales Force Automation software can automate and simplify your subscription renewal with SaaS service providers so that you do not get disconnected from important services.
As a SaaS (Software as a Service) provider yourself, you can use sales force automation to inform users enjoying a free trial about a near expiration date. With this, you ensure that they are not disconnected from your service and are converted to paying customers.
Sales Process Automation Checklist
In the entire sales process, some elements or actions prove to be more important than others. Before implementing sales automation software, there are a few tips and sales operations you need to take care of.
1. Understand Your Sales Process
Every business has its own peculiar needs and problems that sales automation software helps to take care of. Without knowledge of this, even the most promising strategies, software, or sales efforts may prove ineffective for your own business.
2. Use a Lead Scoring Program
Using a lead scoring program is not just important for saving both the costs and time spent in pursuing prospects. A lead scoring SFA system helps you sort your prospects by how feasible it is to convert them. Your sales team then knows which prospects should be given due priority for better results.
3. Automate Responses, Deal Creation, and Data Recording from Deals
By automating your deal creation process, you never miss out on convincing your prospects no matter how much they are.
Manually negotiating with every prospect can be tiring, especially because not every prospect needs to be talked with. Automating this makes sure that you save your negotiation skills for the more difficult prospects while still dealing with other prospects.
Automating follow-up responses also keeps the conversation with prospects alive at all times. Personalization is also key and this is where automating your data generated from these interactions comes in. Your Sales Force Automation software personalizes interactions using this data collected from past deals.
Sales Force Automation software automates the whole process that follows after creating deals. It automates the scheduling of meetings, signing of documents, and payment processes.
4. Create Reminders
With this feature in place, you never miss important meetings or outbound operations. Sales automation tools let you know when you have an important meeting scheduled with prospects.
Executing all these ensures that your sales pipeline and the entire sales process are as seamless as required.

Lead management is an important part of sales. With lead building and management tools, you can generate leads simply by entering search criteria. You will also need lead scoring software to determine the readiness of a prospective client when finding new customers and prioritizing leads.
Use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to log customer data, preferences, and interactions. This data allows you to generate response templates in conversations with customers, allowing your communications system to run on autopilot until follow-ups and check-ins are needed.
Thirdly, you can make use of scheduling tools to set up sales meetings. Instead of having to go back and forth on a meeting time or run the risk of having two meetings clashing, a scheduling tool creates a calendar that shows customers convenient times to fix a meeting

What is Sales Force Automation?
Sales force automation (SFA) or sales automation means using sales automation software and creating workflows to make sales management smoother for everyone involved. The point of sales automation is to simplify the sales process and reduce the amount of manual, repetitive tasks for sales reps.
It makes contact management, opportunity management and task management easier by having the complete history and data of your interactions with a customer stored in one place. It also keeps track of sales leads and helps with setting up reminders and notifications.
But we’re only getting started here, so are you sitting comfortably? Grab a snack or two, and let’s dive into the world of sales automation.
What’s The Difference Between SFA and CRM?
Whether an SFA system and a CRM system is the same thing is a question that’s regularly searched on Google. SFA systems can be (and often are) incorporated into CRM (customer relationship management) systems, but don’t get the two confused.
CRM software helps you manage and analyze data and customer interactions throughout the entire customer lifecycle with the goal of keeping existing customers happy.
While a CRM is a system you use post-sale to retain and satisfy your existing customers, a sales force automation system is used for customer acquisition. We’ll get to all the details in just a minute, but let’s get the background stuff out of the way first.
Sales Automation In Outbound Sales
Mixing smart automation and people skills will help you smoothen your outbound sales process-whether it’s a large or small business. Even though contacting new prospects directly should never feel automated, getting rid of unnecessary repetitive tasks makes everyone’s life easier.
For example, your SFA software can help you send automatic emails to your prospects, either following a schedule or after certain pre-defined triggers, such as them downloading a piece of content from your website.
Great examples of automated emails in outbound sales include congratulations, welcome and onboarding emails as well as abandoned cart emails, referral emails, or milestone emails such as birthday wishes.
If you want to know more about email marketing, you should check out the study we did on cold emails.
Does Sales Force Automation Work For Inbound Sales?
Inbound marketing and sales involve sharing high-quality content like informational blog posts and use cases and and using effective SEO tactics. Inbound is a great way to grow organically as you’ll often bring in leads that convert easily.
When it comes to inbound sales, you don’t want to automate the entire process. Your content team should still work on creating original content and research what is actually relevant to your target audience, and publish the content at the right time to bring in relevant leads.
But an SFA solution can still help you guide your prospects through the sales pipeline once they find your company through inbound tactics.
Why Is Sales Force Automation Important?
Here’s a good rule of thumb: administrative tasks can and should be automated because they unnecessarily take up time and resources you could use for more important tasks. Sales automation can actually reduce the time taken up by sales administration by up to 14%.
Another good reason to automate sales management tasks: sales automation can boost sales productivity by up to 14.5% and increase deal closures by 30%, according to Instapage. And what do you get out of these numbers? More revenue.
In short: when done right, sales force automation will improve your company’s revenue, increase your sales rate and boost the productivity of your sales team. How, you might ask? Let’s see!
The Actual Benefits Of Sales Force Automation
Increase your productivity by simplifying the sales process
When you cut out all the manual work from your day-to-day sales tasks, you have much more time to focus on things like creating meaningful conversations with your prospects. Pretty magical, right?
We’ll soon get to the most important processes to automate, but by getting rid of some repetitive manual tasks you can focus on stuff like improving your customer acquisition process and maintaining relationships with your existing customers.
Some SFA systems can even be run on smartphones or other mobile devices to make using them extra convenient.
Decrease the costs of sales
Once you’ve got your sales force automation software up and running, you’ll quickly see a decline in sales process related costs. And what’s more, you can also expect a potential increase in sales performance and revenue when the process becomes quicker and more seamless.
The costs will decrease because time-consuming manual tasks are performed faster and without continuous input from a person. Your revenue will, in turn, increase because you’ll be able to find customers that are actually a good match for your company and close more deals faster.
Gain more data and information regarding your sales
SFA solutions offer a lot of interesting insights that can help you build your business intelligence and plan and target your sales efforts in the future.
For example, the system knows your customers’ purchase history and can predict future sales based on that, and also help your sales team and sales managers offer the most relevant products and services to the right customer at the right time.
Reduce your response time
You’ll have more time to focus on problematic areas such as customer complaints throughout the sales process. Paying extra attention to response time and being fast with customer service can help enhance your customer satisfaction and customer experience.
With an automated sales system, real-time replies are easy breezy.
Keep records and collect data
Your company has a CRM software solution, right? But how about the records and data you normally collect during the sales process? Right now, you’re probably entering all of that manually into the system, if at all.
Once you have your SFA system running, all of that can be done automatically, and conveniently synced with your CRM system.
Minimize the possibility of human error
Have you ever lost a potential customer due to a simple human mistake like forgetting to contact them in time? Yeah, we’ve all been there. An SFA system will remind you, and even contact that person for you, so mistakes like this will never happen again.
Potential Risks of SFA Systems
As we all know, nothing in life is perfect. Here are a few potential problems related to sales workflow automation to know about.
It won’t work if you don’t know what you’re doing
Unless you know exactly what should happen in each individual stage of your sales cycle, it’s impossible to automate it without making a mess. Before using an SFA system, you need a clear sales process.
The installation and maintenance can be quite expensive
Yep. You need to know what you’re doing with the software, and if not, it can be a good idea to hire a dedicated team for that purpose. It’s an investment but when done right, it will usually pay off in the future.
You’ll also want to make sure that your own sales team knows how the process and system work, and that all your integrated systems –SFA, CRM and others like your enterprise resource planning system (ERP) – are compatible.
Data entry and integration takes up a lot of time
When you get started, you’ll need to include all the relevant information regarding your sales process in the system, and preferably integrate it with your CRM solution. This is a time-consuming task that will take your big old bag of patience out for a rollercoaster ride. But don’t worry – it won’t last forever.
Integrating the SFA system with other management information systems can also be demanding and time-consuming at first.
It’s important to know and understand that you shouldn’t overlook the time and effort it may take to make all your automated systems work seamlessly together.
When used poorly, you might lose your personal touch
By automating the wrong parts of your sales process, you risk losing your personal touch and human connection with your customers.
For example, while some aspects of customer support can be automated, it’s a good idea to leave some of it to actual people since interacting with a human being is what makes a positive customer experience for many of your users.
The Go-To-Market Playbook for Revenue Teams
The disconnect between sales and marketing is legendary. Here’s how to align these two teams for the benefit of your buyers… and the bottom line.

8 Key Sales Processes to Automate
1. Client Prospecting
With an SFA system you can easily seek out the best new customers for your business, find the best leads and gain relevant information about them.
Another thing that you can do is filter out the most promising leads based on actual data that you gain from them and their interactions with your company. This data includes, for example, the actions they perform on your website.
Be sure to initiate a meaningful first contact with potential customers through automated marketing needs assessments. Your SFA system will be able to assess your prospect’s needs, and your sales team can then reach out to them accordingly based on their specific needs.
2. Lead tracking and scoring
An SFA system can automatically track your prospects’ actions and engagement with your business to tell you when the appropriate time is to actually reach out and talk to them.
Some platforms also offer AI-powered lead scoring and lead management opportunities that in turn help you evaluate and prioritize leads based on different specs like their company, role, location, and so forth. Some leads are simply more likely to close than others, and lead management tools help you keep track of your most promising ones.
3. Scheduling meetings and calls
Sales automation makes the process of scheduling meetings with potential leads a lot easier. Prospects can, for example, see your sales rep’s calendar right away and pick a meeting time that’s most convenient for them.
4. Data collection from meetings and calls
Let’s be honest – data collection is one of the most time-consuming, tedious tasks in the sales process. Lucky for all of us, some platforms help you save data and information throughout your sales process.
Some SFA tools use technologies (like AI) to capture data about the customer and their business, and put that data directly into the integrated CRM system.
5. Deal management
With an SFA system, you can easily handle contact management and order management, as well as recording calls, emails and meetings automatically. AI will keep track of previous deals in order to recommend potential offers. This way you can create the optimal deal for a specific customer.
By tracking opportunities within one automated dashboard, you can skip manual data entry while strengthening communication within your organization.
6. Email
Reduce the amount of work hours put into sending emails by automating email campaigns that send out certain messages to a certain individual once they perform a desired action.
Let’s look at an example: the action could be starting a free trial with your SaaS company. Your first automated email could be a simple welcome message. Then later you could follow up with another email and, say, give them a discount on their subscription for a month after the free trial has ended.
You set up the email campaign just once, and every time someone meets the predefined trigger, the emails will be sent automatically. It sounds easy because it is easy.
An SFA system will also keep track of your email templates and safely store them in one place, in case you ever need to make any edits to existing templates or create new ones.
Signature automation a.k.a creating a good automated email signature will make it as easy as possible for possible new customers to contact you. A good signature includes at least clear contact information, your company name and a link to your website.
You can certainly make it cooler with pictures and colors, but it’s a good idea to start with the essentials.
7. Proposals and requests for proposals (RFPs)
In an SFA system, you can automate the RFP process, communicate more easily within organizations, track the results you get and easily reuse RFP templates. An SFA system also lets you collect useful data from your RFP results.
8. Creating contracts and deals
Set up workflows with your automated sales and marketing software to automatically create and edit records for leads who meet a certain criteria or perform a desired task on your website.
For example, if a lead with a certain job title visits your website, you already have a suitable template ready to go.
Sales Automation Tools
Sales, Marketing And Service Combined
There are multiple platforms that offer a combination of sales, marketing and service systems, all integrated. These include services like HubSpot Sales, Leadsquared and Outreach.
Lead Generation
If you’re looking for a combination of lead generation software and tools, as well as a CRM system, you might want to check out Salesforce Hub.
Another nice option is Pega Sales Automation – it has has a built-in AI that guides your sales professionals to the best leads, opportunities and content, and then suggests best next steps.
Email Marketing

Invoicing & Contracts
LeadExec is a platform for capturing and routing inbound web leads and phone calls. PandaDoc offers a completely automated custom approval workflows that are designed to save time and make it easier to create, review, approve, and send documents. And lastly, companies like Keap offer an invoicing system for seamless payments.
Chatbots

Using intelligent chatbots in your sales strategy means being there for your potential buyers and customers on their terms, whenever they need you.
To learn more about why we love chatbots, you can read our comprehensive guide to all things chatbot!
Awesome Examples Of Sales Automation
Targeting New People At Interesting Companies
Each time someone is hired at a company you’re targeting, you can have the system automatically email them to say congrats, then later send them, for example, a survey about the future of marketing.
After this, an automated notification will let a salesperson in your team know to call the customer and schedule a meeting.
Notifications About New Developments
The SFA system can notify your sales team about any developments at a company you’re following. These developments can be things like a new product launch or anything your company is interested in.
When you are aware of these things happening, you can contact relevant people whenever suitable, or have the system contact them for you.
Keeping Track Of Customer Behavior On Your Site
Even without enabling cookies or leaving any digital footprint on your site, some platforms will give you the probability of a customer converting based on their behavior.
It can even tell you from what companies your website visitors are from, so that you can find out (for example through social media platforms like LinkedIn) who to contact from that particular company.
Making Subscription Renewal Easier in SaaS
In addition to helping with the sales process in general, you can automate and simplify subscription renewal within the system, and notify your sales professionals about upselling opportunities.
Like we mentioned before, contacting your customers via email after their free trial is about to end is a good example of using sales force automation in SaaS.
Sales Automation Process Checklist
To sum everything up here’s a checklist to help you get started with sales force automation:
Know your sales process
Identify your best leads with a lead scoring program
Automatically create deals and save the data you get from them
Automate responses to your prospects (don’t forget follow-up messages!)

What is Sales Force Automation And Why Is It Important?

What is Sales Force Automation?
Sales force automation means automating your sales process and making them more intelligent, efficient and error free. Using automation techniques to smooth out processes and give customers a better experience than ever before, you’ll be wondering why you haven’t been using automated systems forever.
It’s not about employing robots, or about building factories and production lines, nor is it about becoming fully impersonal and alert. It is about using technology to the full to give you and your team a competitive advantage over every other business in your market.
CRM…but better
There was a time when sales were made face to face, and a relationship was often built between buyer and seller. As time has progressed, sales have become more and more impersonal, and it’s hard to build a relationship between the two parties.
This relationship is important in both directions – the buyer needs to know that the seller is interested in the problem they need solving and can sell them a reliable solution. The seller needs to know that they are not wasting their time and that the buyer actually wants to buy something.
As businesses grew and communication was often not face-to-face but more likely to be over the phone or across the internet, Customer Relationship Management systems were developed. Noting down what the customer wanted, when they wanted it, what they had previously purchased, and so on – the only problem arose when the customer unexpectedly called, and you needed to find the right piece of paper.
CRM systems improved and became digital, and now it was just a matter of seeking out the right record on the computer system. With the advent of the internet, CRM systems moved online making it easy for multiple users to work with them and for the information to be accessed from anywhere.
There was still a problem though – every piece of information had to be entered by hand. Sales force automation takes this one step further by automatically entering information about your customers and leads for you.
Through various lead generation techniques and processes applied before a sales rep even comes into contact with a potential lead, a profile of the person can be built, and the information stored for later access.
This gives the sales force an almost psychic ability to know what the lead is interested in and what problems they may be trying to solve. But there’s more – the automation system can figure out which are the best leads for a sales rep to follow up, and will be able to automatically schedule this for the rep, as well as tracking all the communication that follows.
But what if the sales reps forget to contact someone or return a call? Simply, the sales force automation takes care of it – reminders and notifications are automatically generated, and if they are not acted on, the next person in the chain is notified. This can be another sales rep to take over the lead, or a manager to investigate what the problem is.
When no leads slip through the cracks, the business can function at its highest efficiency and generate the most revenue possible.
Contact management and information sharing have been taken care of, and precautions are in place to make sure nothing gets missed out. So, does this mean your sales force is fully automated? Far from it!
A Manager’s Dream
As a manager, the one thing you have to do is keep on top of your team of sales reps. You need to know who is doing well, who needs a push in the right direction, who is converting the most leads, and so on. You also need to know how the sales figures are looking.
It’s common practice for sales teams to send in their daily or weekly reports, or sometimes for the manager to run a report on these different aspects of the sales team. Unfortunately, for one reason or another, these reports don’t always come through on time. Maybe the rep is super busy and can’t spend the time logging in, running the report, saving it, emailing it, and so on.
Maybe the manager doesn’t have time to do it for every rep, and slowly but surely reports go missing, and sales figures start to drop. Targets are missed, and revenue is down, all because nobody could find the time to produce a set of reports.
With sales force automation, these reports can be generated automatically and sent to the people who need to know. It’s right there, waiting in the inbox, without having to lift a finger.
With the minimum of effort and interruption, the manager can evaluate employee performance and see a sales forecast analysis very easily. They can make changes as needed and not have to wonder why a particular report hasn’t been filed.
This builds confidence in the sales force and gives the manager a full set of information to work with. When key reports are missing, a manager is at best ineffective. When everything is produced and seen on time, the manager can function at full efficiency and bring out the best in their team.
Automating the rest of the sales process
Once the lead is in your sales pipeline, every step of the way can be aided by automation. Leads can be rated and ranked, and sales reps can see exactly where they are within the pipeline. Sales reps that are mobile and operate in different areas can be tracked and can be chosen to close deals based on their geographic location.
When a deal is closed, and an order is placed, notifications can be sent to everyone who needs to know.
This lets managers know that revenue is on the way, but also allows teams that sell physical stock to keep track of their inventory more easily as they will know instantly when something needs to go out.
Sales force automation is the ultimate in streamlining and efficiency while giving amazing advantages to both the sales force and the customer alike. If you haven’t already begun automating your business, you need to get started today.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered that sales force automation, or SFA, is about using software to automate and streamline sales processes. It seems like it's meant to make salespeople's lives easier by handling repetitive tasks, so they can focus on actually selling. Let me see if I can summarize what I've learned.

First off, SFA is different from CRM, which is customer relationship management. CRM is more about maintaining relationships with existing customers, whereas SFA is about acquiring new customers. So, SFA is more on the front end, trying to bring in new business, while CRM is about nurturing and retaining the customers you already have.

Now, in terms of how SFA affects salesperson productivity, it seems like it can have a really positive impact. By automating things like scheduling, data entry, and even sending follow-up emails, salespeople can save a lot of time. That time can then be used to make more sales calls, close more deals, and basically be more productive.

For example, instead of manually entering data into a spreadsheet or CRM system, the SFA tool can do that automatically. Or, if a salesperson is scheduling meetings, the SFA can handle sending out calendars and finding mutually convenient times. All of this frees up the salesperson to do what they do best: sell.

Moreover, SFA tools often provide insights and analytics that can help salespeople understand their performance better. They can see which approaches are working and which aren't, allowing them to adjust their strategies accordingly. This data-driven approach can lead to more effective sales tactics and higher productivity.

Moving on to marketing management, SFA can play a significant role here as well. Marketing and sales need to work closely together, and SFA can facilitate that collaboration. For instance, marketing can generate leads and pass them on to sales through the SFA system. Sales can then track these leads and provide feedback on their quality, which marketing can use to improve their lead generation strategies.

Additionally, SFA tools often include features for lead scoring and tracking, which can help marketing prioritize their efforts. By identifying the most promising leads, marketing can focus their resources on activities that are likely to generate the best returns.

Furthermore, SFA can provide valuable data on customer behavior and preferences, which marketing can use to create more targeted and effective campaigns. Essentially, SFA acts as a bridge between sales and marketing, ensuring that both departments are aligned and working towards common goals.

Lastly, regarding competitive advantage, SFA can give a business a significant edge in the market. By streamlining sales processes and making sales teams more efficient, a company can close deals faster and serve customers better. This can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Moreover, with better data and analytics, a company can make more informed decisions and stay ahead of the competition. They can identify trends and opportunities faster and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Also, by providing a better customer experience through timely communications and personalized interactions, a company can differentiate itself from competitors who may still be relying on manual, less efficient processes.

However, it's important to note that while SFA can bring about these benefits, it's not a silver bullet. Implementing an SFA system requires careful planning and execution. There can be challenges such as resistance to change, data accuracy issues, and the need for ongoing training and support.

But, if implemented correctly, SFA can definitely enhance salesperson productivity, improve marketing management, and contribute to a competitive advantage.

So, to wrap it up, sales force automation can positively impact salesperson productivity by reducing administrative tasks and providing valuable insights. It can strengthen marketing management by fostering better collaboration and data sharing between sales and marketing teams. And, it can give businesses a competitive edge by enabling faster, more efficient, and more personalized interactions with customers.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Sales force automation can enhance salesperson productivity by streamlining tasks and providing data insights, improve marketing management through better lead tracking and collaboration, and confer a competitive advantage by enabling faster and more personalized customer interactions.}} \]
