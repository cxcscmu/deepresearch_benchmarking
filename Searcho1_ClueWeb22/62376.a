I'm trying to understand how the interaction between Helmer and Nora advances the plot in "A Doll's House" by Henrik Ibsen. I need to think about their relationship and how their conversations and actions lead to the development of the story.

First, I should recall who Helmer and Nora are. Helmer is the husband, and Nora is the wife in the play. From what I remember, their relationship seems superficially happy, but there are underlying issues.

I think one key way their interaction advances the plot is through their conversations that reveal Nora's secret loan. She had to borrow money secretly to save her husband's life, and she's been struggling to pay it back without him knowing. Their interactions bring this secret closer to being revealed, which is a major plot point.

Also, Helmer's treatment of Nora as a doll or a pet seems to be a recurring theme. He calls her various endearments like "little squirrel" and "little featherhead," which suggests he doesn't see her as an equal. This dynamic contributes to the tension in their relationship and leads to Nora's eventual realization about her true position in the household and society.

Moreover, their interactions highlight the power imbalance in their marriage. Helmer holds the authority, and Nora is subservient. This inequality becomes more apparent as the play progresses, especially when Krogstad, the creditor, threatens to expose Nora's loan.

I think another important aspect is how Helmer reacts when he discovers Nora's secret. His initial anger and disappointment seem to stem from his pride and sense of honor rather than concern for Nora. This reaction pushes Nora to confront the reality of their marriage and her own identity.

Furthermore, their interactions lead to Nora's decision to leave Helmer at the end of the play. After realizing that Helmer doesn't truly understand or support her, and that their marriage is based on illusion rather than mutual respect and understanding, she chooses to exit in search of self-discovery and independence.

So, in summary, the interaction between Helmer and Nora advances the plot by revealing the secrets and inequalities in their relationship, leading to a climax where Nora decides to leave in order to find herself and seek equality.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The interaction between Helmer and Nora advances the plot by revealing the secrets and inequalities in their relationship, leading to a climax where Nora decides to leave in order to find herself and seek equality.}} \]
