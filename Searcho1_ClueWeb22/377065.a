I'm trying to think about why we should lower the voting age to 16. I know that in many places, including the United States, the voting age is 18, but some people argue that 16-year-olds should be allowed to vote too. I need to consider both sides of the argument and see what makes sense.

First, I should understand what voting is and why age restrictions exist in the first place. Voting is a fundamental part of democracy; it's how citizens choose their representatives and influence government decisions. Age restrictions are in place because society has determined that there's a certain age at which people are mature enough to make informed decisions about governance.

Traditionally, 18 has been seen as the age of adulthood, when people are considered capable of making serious decisions. But is 16 too young for that? Let me think about what 16-year-olds are like these days. They're finishing high school, some are driving, and many are quite knowledgeable about current events and social issues. In fact, recent political movements, like the youth climate movement led by Greta Thunberg, show that 16-year-olds can be very engaged and informed about global issues.

Maybe the argument for lowering the voting age is that if young people are interested and capable, they should have a say in how their country is run. After all, they'll be affected by the decisions made today for the rest of their lives. For example, policies on education, climate change, and healthcare will impact them more than older voters since they have longer to live.

But I also need to consider potential drawbacks. Some might argue that 16-year-olds aren't mature enough or don't have enough life experience to make informed voting decisions. They might be easily influenced by peers or media and not fully understand the consequences of their votes.

I need to look into whether there's any evidence to support lowering the voting age. Maybe there are countries or regions that have already done this, and I can see how it's worked out.

Let me try to find some information on this. I'll start by searching for "countries with voting age 16."

Legal Voting Age by Country - WorldAtlas
Legal Voting Age by Country
Being able to vote is a rite of passage in many places.
A voting age is the minimum legal age set by the law at which persons are allowed to engage in casting their vote on a public election day. This age is usually stated in a country’s constitution as the legal voting age. In as much as voting is compulsory in some countries, for most nations it is optional to vote.The voting ages vary from 16 to 25 in different countries of the world.
The legal voting ages
Countries Whose Legal Voting Age is 16
The legal voting age for Nicaragua, Scotland, Isle of Man, Guernsey, Ethiopia, Ecuador, Cuba, Brazil, and Austria is 16 years. However, this age has been criticized by most people due to the fact that youths of this age have not yet gotten into the world of employment, tax remission, and home ownership. Many election decisions are believed to revolve around these three issues. As such it is assumed that those at the age of 16 are not able to vote knowledgeably based on the leaders’ policies. However, other critics have observed low voter turn out for persons aged 18 and above due to the apparent lack of interest in politics. As such they suggest that youths of age 16 are able to turn up for elections in large numbers. During the independent referendum in Scotland in 2014, the inclusion of the youths aged 16 and 17 produced positive results. Most of them who felt inadequate to vote resolved to actively seeking information that enabled them to make informed decisions on the voting day. This informed the decision of Scotland to lower its legal voting age to 16 from 18. However, Austria was the first European nation to lower its voting age in 2011.
Countries Whose Legal Voting Age is 17
Countries whose legal voting age is 17 are Sudan, South Sudan, North Korea, Indonesia, Greece, and East Timor. Even though the voting age in Indonesia is 17 years old, married persons are required to vote regardless of their age.
Countries Whose Legal Voting Age is 18
The legal voting age for most countries is 18. Over one hundred nations are in this category including Afghanistan, China, Australia, Bahamas, Belgium, Botswana, Canada, Comoros, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Jamaica, Jordan, Lebanon, Marshall Islands, Macedonia, Mauritania, Kenya, Mongolia, Philippines, Saint Helena, Tanzania, United States, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Japan, and Italy among many others. The voting age for residents of Boznia and Herzegovania is also 18. However, employed persons aged 16 can vote. On the other hand, in Argentina the voting age is 18 but those aged between 16 and 18 may also vote. In addition to this, voting is optional for citizens aged 70 and above.
Countries Whose Legal Voting Age is 19
South Korea is the only nation in which the legal voting age for the citizens is 19 years.
Countries With Legal Voting Ages of 20 or Above
The countries whose legal voting age is 20 include Nauru, Taiwan, and Bahrain. On the other hand, those states who can vote when 21 years or older are Oman, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga, Singapore, Malaysia, Kuwait, Jersey, and Cameroon. The United Arab Emirates has the oldest legal voting age in the world. Citizens can only vote when they attain the age of 25 or older. Notwithstanding the legal voting age, voting is a constitutional right that needs to be exercised by all citizens of a country.

Votes at 16: what the UK can learn from Austria, Norway and the Crown dependencies
Twitter
Implementing the proposal in Ed Miliband’s party conference speech to lower the voting age would make Britain one of only a few countries to allow 16 year olds to vote. In this post, Democratic Audit asks leading democracy experts to share findings from nations that have introduced this change, focusing especially on Austria, Norway and,  from closer to home, a number of the UK’s Crown dependencies.
Professor John Wall, Departments of Philosophy, Religion, and Childhood Studies, Rutgers University
Labour leader Ed Miliband’s call to lower the UK voting age to 16 represents another step in a scattered but growing global movement to expand child and youth suffrage in modern democracies. Several countries now permit votes at 16 in national elections, including Brazil, Austria, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man, and parts of Norway; and other countries for local elections, including Germany and Israel. Approximately 30 nations have separate children’s parliaments in which minors from 6 to 17 elect representatives, propose policy changes, and in some cases control parts of budgets. The widest-ranging proposal, considered but shelved by the German parliament in 2008, was for suffrage to be granted to all citizens at birth, but exercised by a parent or guardian until deciding when to pass it on to each child. In addition, it should not be forgotten that the UK voting age was only lowered from 21 to 18 in 1969.
The main argument for lowering the voting age is that persons under 18 constitute a third of humanity yet lack representation in matters deeply affecting their lives. Lacking enfranchisement contributes to minors constituting most society’s poorest and least protected members. Research has shown in the US that 16 and 17 year olds are equally knowledgeable and competent to vote as young adults. Children’s parliaments have proven that children as young as 6 can be engaged, thoughtful, and effective voters. Like women and the poor in history, children may only appear unready to vote because they have so far lacked the opportunity to do so. From these perspectives, Miliband’s proposal continues a long historical struggle to democratize democracy.
Sarah Birch, Professor of Comparative Politics, University of Glasgow
Following Ed Miliband’s announcement that he believes the voting age should be lowered to 16, there has been speculation as to the likely effects of this proposal on turnout. The experience of other countries suggests that 16 and 17 year olds may actually be more likely to vote than 18 year olds, as more of them live with their parents and attend school.
When the voting age was reduced to 16 in Austria, turnout rates of 16 and 17 year olds were found to be comparable to those of the electorate at large. Moreover, turnout was found to decrease with age from 16 to 20, with older teenagers exhibiting less civic appetite than their juniors. In a trial that involved reducing the voting age in local elections to 16 in a selection of Norwegian municipalities, turnout among 16 and 17 year olds was also higher than is generally the case for first-time voters. (See further discussion below.)
Reducing the voting age to 16 could thus help to alleviate youth abstention. Furthermore, research shows that if people vote in the first election for which they are eligible, they are more likely to continue voting throughout their lives. Increasing turnout among younger voters could have a ‘booster effect’ on overall turnout levels in the medium to long term.
Stephen Williams, Member of Parliament for Bristol West
If Parliament had accepted my proposals in 2005 the UK would have set an example to the world. That’s no longer the case. One EU member state, Austria, has allowed 16 year olds to vote since 2007. Most German states, Lander and cities allow 16 year olds to vote. The Burgermesiter of Hannover, Bristol’s twin city, has to appeal to 16 year olds as well as 46 year olds. Brazil, one of the world’s largest democracies, has long allowed sixteen year olds to vote. Neighbouring Argentina has recently followed their example.
But it’s here in the British Isles that the most relevant change has taken place. In 2006 the Isle of Man lowered the voting age. Jersey and Guernsey followed in 2007. The Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly want to give their sixteen year olds the vote but need Westminster approval. Most compelling of all is the recent agreement by the UK government to allow the Scottish Parliament the right to set the franchise for the referendum on Scotland’s future with the UK, in 2014. So British citizens are already voting for their elected representatives in the Crown dependencies. Scots teens north of the border could hold the key to the future of the United Kingdom. The genie is now out of the bottle. It is time to trust all British 16 year olds with the franchise.
Eva Zeglovits, Department of Methods in the Social Sciences, University of Vienna and member of the demand side team in the Austrian National Election Study
Austria lowered the voting age to 16 for all elections and referenda in 2007. Evidence from Austria can help to check if arguments used in the debate on lowering the voting age hold true in reality, in particular turnout and the quality of the vote choice of newly enfranchised teenagers. Opponents doubt if 16 and 17 year olds are mature enough to be given the right to vote. Lack of political interest and knowledge, they argue, will lead to low turnout and an ill-qualified vote choice. On the other hand supporters presume that 16 and 17 year olds could be prepared for their first election by their parents and schools, and thus expect high turnout and a well informed vote choice.
Results from Austria show, that turnout of 16 and 17 year olds is in fact higher than turnout of older first time voters, and it is nearly as high as overall turnout. Moreover, although teenage voters are still less interested than adult voters, they are able to make an informed choice. The congruence between attitudes and the vote choice of teenage voters is comparable to adult voters. Austrian teenage voters seem to be mature enough to participate and to make a meaningful vote choice. In all, evidence from Austria by now encourages the supporters of the lowering of the voting age. Future elections will show if this is just a novelty effect or if the trends will be stable in the long run.
Dr Jo Saglie, Institute for Social Research, Oslo
At the 2011 local elections in Norway, the voting age was lowered from 18 to 16, as a trial in 21 municipalities. 58 per cent of the enfranchised 16 and 17 year olds voted. This was somewhat lower than the overall turnout level of 63 per cent in these municipalities, but much higher than the turnout among regular first-time voters (aged 18–21), which was 46 per cent. Two factors explain the high turnout. First, 16 and 17 year olds are more easily mobilised than their slightly older peers. They still go to school, live at home, and have not moved out of their local community. Second, the selected municipalities made considerable efforts to mobilise their young voters – this was also a prestige project.
A stated purpose of the trial was to increase the political interest and engagement among the participating 16 and 17 year olds, but research indicates that there was no such effect. Political maturity is an issue in the voting age debate in Norway, but may not be decisive. As political maturity gradually increases with age among adolescents, any age limit is to some extent arbitrary. Thus, the debate in Norway has also focused on normative and constitutional issues – such as consistency in age limits.
Democratic Audit also featured an earlier post in which experts debated the merits of the proposal to lower the voting age in the UK.

Whatever the arguments about turnout, the simple fact is that this Parliament made decisions which directly affected voters who were 16 and 17 at the time of the last election, notably in the form of increased tuition fees. If Britain is to matain credaibility as a modern democracy then 16 and 17 year olds must be allowed the right to vote, especially as a proportion who have managed to get jobs have to pay tax. No taxation without representation.

Nine Countries with the Lowest Voting Age • LegalScoops
Nine Countries with the Lowest Voting Age
International November 18, 2021 By Jacob Maslow
Before World War II, 21 years old was the required voting age for almost all countries. However, it wasn’t until the end of the 1900s that most countries decided to lower the voting age to 18, which most countries still use today.
Although most countries require citizens to be at least 18 years old to vote, several countries allow people to vote much younger. The voting age around the world ranges from 16 to 25 years old. Age requirements vary by country, but they vary based on the type of election being held.
Argentina
Currently, in Argentina, people can start voting when they turn 16 years old. One of the most interesting facts is that voting is considered optional between the ages of 16 to 18 years old, meaning that people can vote if they want, but they are not required to do so. However, once they turn 19 years old, voting is no longer optional. It is mandatory. They are required by law to vote in all local and national elections.
Austria
Austria is made up of nine constituent states, and in five of these states, citizens as young as 16 years old are allowed to vote. Interestingly enough, the participation of these 16-year-olds in these five states convinced the federal government to lower the age to 16 for all EU and national elections.
What Austria has found is that the younger voters participate at the same level as the older voters. One member of Parliament strongly believes that it’s essential to let young people vote and listen to what they have to say as they have different needs and wishes than their older counterparts.
Germany
Dating back to 1996, seven constituent states in Germany have allowed people as young as 16 to vote in local elections. Since then, many other constituent states have lowered the required voting age in regional and municipal elections.
Although 16-year-olds are only allowed to vote in local elections, some feel it is necessary to lower the voting age in all elections. Many people against reducing the voting age claim that younger people vote based on popularity or current trends, but research shows that younger voters don’t upset the political balance.
Brazil
In 1988, per the constitution, Brazil lowered the general voting age from 18 down to 16. The 1989 presidential election was the first one with the lowered voting age. In Brazil, people who are 16 to 17 years old are not required to vote. It is considered optional. To be eligible to vote, they must turn 16 years old before May 31 if it’s an election year. If they turn 16 after that date, they cannot vote until they turn 17. Once they turn 18 years old, until they are 70 years old, they must vote.
Cuba
The right to vote in Cuba is granted to all citizens who are 16 years old and up. The only people who are not eligible to vote in any Cuban elections have applied for emigration. All voting in Cuba is mandatory, and because of that, participation is on the high side. According to the government, there are some spoiled ballots even with the high number of voters, but the number is relatively small.
Scotland
Starting in October of 2007, Scotland adopted a policy that favored lowering the voting age to 16. This vote for this policy was unanimous, but this doesn’t mean that it took place right away because it had to be approved by the Scottish Parliament.
In June 2013, it was approved to lower the voting age to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum. In June 2015, the Parliament voted to lower the age to 16 for voting in the Scottish Parliament and all local government elections.
Ecuador
To vote in national elections in Ecuador, one must be at least 16 years old, a citizen of the country, or have lived in the country for a specified period. Non-citizens can vote in national elections if they have lived in the country for the last five years. While voting is optional for those 16 or 17 years old, it is required by law for 18 or older. Once a person turns 65 years old, they can quit voting.
Malta
The voting age was lowered to 16 for all local elections in November 2013. This proposal was widely supported throughout the country. In January 2018, the voting age for European Parliament, referenda, and the general election was also lowered to 16. It was in March 2018 that the Parliament voted to amend the constitution with the lower voting age.
Isle of Man
Of the three British Crown dependencies, the Isle of Man was the first to lower the voting age to 16 for all general elections. The House of Keys approved the lower age limit in July 2006 with a 19 to 4 margin. The other two British Crown dependencies shortly followed suit.

Votes for 16- and 17-year-olds – where else outside Scotland?
A move to lower voting age is expected to sail through the Scottish parliament. But where else in the world can under-18s can take part in elections?

Late last year, the UK government devolved the power to lower the voting age to 16 for Scottish parliamentary elections. The move followed the widely celebrated participation of 16- and 17-year-olds in Scotland’s independence referendum.
Today, the Scottish parliament is set to vote on the proposed changes. They are likely to sail through, enabling 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in local and Holyrood elections – and increase the country’s electorate by an additional 120,000 or so voters.
Although in most of the world the voting age is 18, Scotland won’t be alone in granting younger people the right to vote.
Countries where the voting age is 16
Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua
The voting age is 16 and above in Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina, but casting a ballot is not compulsory like it is for those aged between 18 and the upper age limit (70 in Brazil and Argentina, 65 in Ecuador), at which voting is optional again.
Austria is the only country in the EU where 16 years olds can vote in general elections. Turnout is roughly the same as in other age groups.
In some countries 16 year olds can vote if they’re employed or married. For example, in Hungary if someone gets married at 16 they become an adult with all the attached legal rights and responsibilities - including the right to vote.
Countries where voting age is 17
East Timor, Ethiopia, Indonesia, North Korea and Sudan
Counties were voting age is 18
Too many to list
Countries where the voting age is even higher than 18
South Korea (19), Bahrain, Cameroon, Japan, Nauru, Taiwan (20)
Explaining Japan’s higher voting age, a European commission report reads: “It should be noted that in Japanese culture the customary age at which an individual is considered to become an adult is 20, whereas in the west it is generally held to be 18.”
Kuwait, Lebanon (all men, but only women with an elementary education), Malaysia, Oman, Samoa, Saudi Arabia (males only, although women will be able to vote in local elections), Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tonga (21).
As Scotland is technically a regional parliament, rather than an independent nation in its own right, we perhaps have to look at this with a little more nuance.
The closest parallel is Germany, where there are several states that allow 16-year-olds to vote in their state election, including Brandenburg, Bremen and Hamburg. This is also true in the Swiss canton of Glarus, parts of Norway and, perhaps more relevantly, in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey (all semi-autonomous UK territories).
Italians have to wait till they are 25 to vote in senate elections, which is also the minimum voting age in the United Arab Emirates (where emirates select certain people in the electorate to vote, rather than extending the right to vote to everyone).
There is only one state in the world with a maximum voting age for its national election – the Vatican City, where only cardinals aged under 80 are allowed to cast a vote in papal elections.
Lowering the voting age to 16 is also one of the several debates currently surrounding the referendum on EU membership that the UK is set to hold by 2017.

Voting Age Around the World – BatchGeo Blog
Voting Age Around the World
The age at which a citizen of a country may cast their vote differs around the world. Before World War II, most countries set the minimum voting age at 21 years old. In 1946, Czechoslovakia became the first country to lower their minimum voting age to 20, and over twenty years later 17 countries too lowered their voting age. By the end of the 1900s, 18 had become the most common voting age, and it remains the same today. However, that doesn’t mean every country around the world subscribes to the same age. In fact, the minimum voting age around the world ranges from 16 to 25 years old. In some countries, citizens of eligible age are required by law to vote. However, for most countries, voting is optional. As you will see, there are many different minimum ages when it comes to voting.

Click around on the map above to discover for yourself the voting ages of over 235 countries, or read on to see what fascinating tidbits of information we’ve selected from the voting ages of countries around the world.
Most Common Voting Age
A glaring 86% of the 237 countries on our list have a minimum voting age requirement of 18 years old. However, the 205 countries that require their citizens to be at least 18 years old to vote are not all homogenous when it comes to exceptions to the rule and histories. Take Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example. The country has an 18-year-old voting age requirement, however, an exception to the rule is that 16-year-olds who are employed may also vote.
The legislative body of Iran can’t seem to make up its mind when it comes to Iran’s voting age. While currently Iran’s voting age coincides with the majority of the world’s countries, before 2007, Iran’s minimum voting age was just 15 years old. It was changed to 18 years of age in 2007 and then changed back to 15 years old in 2009 after just two years. In 2011, Iran’s voting age returned to 18 years old.
Japan has also experimented with changing its voting age as recently as 2016. Japan changed its minimum voting age from 20 years old to 18 years old.
The history of why 18 is the most common voting age lies in its connection to military enlistment. For most countries, 18 years old is the age when a citizen may enlist in the military. Logically, those who may be drafted or volunteer to fight for their country desire to cast their vote come election season.
Where Police and Military Members Cannot Cast Their Votes
Some countries disagree with allowing police and military members the right to vote. The Dominican Republic bars all members of its police and military forces from partaking in elections. The Dominican Republic is not the only country to do so, at least in the past. Peru used to ban all police and military members from voting in elections, however, a 2005 constitutional reform removed this law and now police and military members may vote.
The countries of Oman, Kuwait, and Indonesia have yet to express interest in allowing their police and military forces to vote. Guatemala also prohibits active duty members of the armed forces from voting, and those members are even restricted to their barracks on election day.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, in North Korea, members of the military may vote regardless of age.
Youngest Voting Age
The youngest minimum voting age is 16 years old. Eleven countries lay claim to this young national voting age or just 5% of all of the countries on our list.
These countries include:
Brazil
Ecuador
Austria
Cuba
Guernsey
Isle of Man
Jersey
Malta
Nicaragua
Scotland
Argentina
In Argentina, voting between the ages 16 to 18 is optional, but becomes compulsory after 18 years old.
Where Voting is Required
Voting may be optional for those aged 16 through 18 in Argentina, but once you hit 19, voting becomes mandatory. Argentina is not the only country in which voting is compulsory, meaning that eligible citizens are required by law to vote in national and or local elections. The following countries also mandate that their citizens vote:
Argentina
Brazil*
Luxembourg
Dominican Republic
Belgium
Peru
Paraguay
Bolivia
Ecuador*
Australia
While the above-listed countries may all be similar in that voting is compulsory, they are not exactly all the same. What differentiates the countries from each other is the different age ranges for which voting is compulsory. For example, in Brazil and Peru, all citizens from the age of 18 through age 70 must vote. In Luxembourg and Paraguay, citizens 18 years old or older must vote until they reach the age of 75 years old. Ecuador has the youngest age at which voting stops being compulsory at 65 years young.
In addition to compulsory voting, the Dominican Republic boasts a fascinating voting obligation: all married people regardless of age are required to vote. The same rule applies in Indonesia.
In some countries which require their citizens to vote, voting is optional for citizens who are illiterate. These countries include Brazil and Ecuador. However, the literacy rates in Brazil and Ecuador, over 92%, and over 94% respectively, don’t imply this is much of an issue.
Oldest Minimum Voting Age
Finally, the oldest minimum voting age is 25 years old. The only country to implement this is the United Arab Emirates. The UAE elects its officials with a 6,689-member electoral college. The electoral college members are appointed by the emirates and are required to be citizens of the emirate they are to cast their vote on behalf of and must be 25 years old or older, depending on the emirate. They must also be literate.
Is your country’s voting age the same as 86% of other countries at 18 years old or does your country share a voting age with less than 1% of the world with a voting age of 19 or 25? Whatever your country’s minimum voting age is, you can make your own map like the one above at batchgeo.com today.

Alright, I've got some information here about countries that have lowered their voting age to 16. It seems like a few countries have done this, including Austria, Scotland, and some others. I need to think about why this might be a good idea.

First, one of the main arguments is that young people are affected by political decisions, maybe even more so than older generations, because they have longer to live with the consequences. For example, climate change policies will affect them for much longer than they would affect someone who is already in their 50s or 60s. So, giving them a voice in how their country is governed makes sense.

Also, if 16-year-olds are mature enough to make important decisions like getting a job, paying taxes, or even getting married in some places, why shouldn't they be allowed to vote? It's about recognizing their growing autonomy and responsibility.

Another point is that starting to vote at a younger age could foster a lifelong habit of political engagement. If you start voting when you're 16, you might be more likely to continue voting as you get older, which could help increase overall voter turnout.

But, there are also counterarguments. Some people might say that 16-year-olds aren't mature enough to make informed decisions about complex political issues. They might be more influenced by their peers or by emotional appeals rather than by rational analysis.

However, the information from Austria suggests that 16 and 17-year-olds actually have higher turnout rates and make just as informed choices as older voters. So, maybe the concern about their maturity is unfounded.

Also, in Scotland, during the independence referendum, lowering the voting age seemed to have a positive effect, with young people becoming more engaged and informed about the issues at hand.

I guess another consideration is that if young people are educated about politics in school, giving them the right to vote could reinforce what they're learning and make it more relevant to their lives.

Moreover, in many countries, 16-year-olds can drive, work, and pay taxes, so it's consistent to give them a say in how the country is run.

On the other hand, some might argue that the voting age should be aligned with the age of majority, which is often 18, and that lowering it could set a precedent for other rights and responsibilities being shifted to younger ages.

But, as I saw in Argentina, voting is optional for 16 and 17-year-olds, which might be a way to compromise. They can choose to vote if they feel ready, but they're not forced to.

Overall, it seems like there are strong arguments in favor of lowering the voting age to 16, based on the evidence from countries that have already done so. Young people are capable of making informed decisions, and giving them the vote could lead to greater political engagement and a more representative democracy.

So, I think that lowering the voting age to 16 is a good idea.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Lowering the voting age to 16 is a good idea because it recognizes the maturity and responsibilities of young people, increases political engagement, and ensures their voices are heard on issues that will affect them for decades to come.}} \]
