So I have this question: "How did the Mexican Cession impact slavery?" Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let's see. First off, I need to remember what the Mexican Cession is. I think it has something to do with the land the US gained after the Mexican-American War. Yeah, that sounds right. So, after the war, the US got a bunch of land from Mexico, right? That's called the Mexican Cession.

Now, how did this affect slavery? Well, slavery was a big issue back then, especially in the 19th century. The US was expanding westward, and every time new territory was acquired, there was a debate about whether slavery would be allowed there or not. So, I guess the Mexican Cession would have been subject to the same kind of debates.

I recall that there were laws and compromises made to deal with the expansion of slavery into new territories. Like the Missouri Compromise, the Compromise of 1850, and stuff like that. Maybe one of these relates to the Mexican Cession.

Let me think about the timeline. The Mexican-American War was in the 1840s, right? I think it was from 1846 to 1848. And the Mexican Cession would have happened around that time, probably as part of the treaty ending the war. So, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, if I remember correctly.

Now, what about slavery during that period? Well, the US was deeply divided over slavery. The North was generally against it, while the South wanted to preserve it and even expand it into new territories.

So, when the US acquired all this new land from Mexico, there must have been a big argument about whether slavery would be allowed in those new territories.

I think the Compromise of 1850 had something to do with this. Let me see if I can recall what that was about.

I think the Compromise of 1850 addressed issues related to the Mexican Cession. It dealt with the status of slavery in the new territories acquired from Mexico.

Let me try to remember the key points of the Compromise of 1850. I think it included:

1. California was admitted as a free state.

2. The slave trade was abolished in Washington D.C.

3. The Fugitive Slave Act was strengthened.

4. And, regarding the territories, New Mexico and Utah were organized without restrictions on slavery, leaving it to be decided by popular sovereignty.

Wait, is that right? I might be confusing it with another compromise.

Alternatively, maybe it was the Missouri Compromise that dealt with slavery in new territories. But I think that was earlier, in 1820.

Hmm, maybe I need to look up some dates to get this straight.

First, the Mexican-American War ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ceded California and New Mexico to the US.

Then, in 1850, there was the Compromise of 1850, which seems directly related to dealing with the status of slavery in these new territories.

So, perhaps the impact of the Mexican Cession on slavery was largely mediated through the Compromise of 1850.

Let me consider that. The US had acquired a lot of new land, and needed to decide about slavery there. The Compromise of 1850 provided a set of laws that addressed these issues.

Specifically, it admitted California as a free state, which upset the balance between free and slave states in the Senate. To compensate the South, the slave trade was abolished in Washington D.C., but the Fugitive Slave Act was strengthened, making it easier for slave owners to recapture runaway slaves.

Additionally, the territories of New Mexico and Utah were organized under popular sovereignty, meaning that the residents of those territories would decide for themselves whether to allow slavery or not.

So, in a way, the Mexican Cession led to a situation where the expansion of slavery was debated and eventually somewhat contained by the Compromise of 1850.

But I'm not sure if that's the whole picture. Maybe there's more to it.

Let me think about the political context. At that time, there were powerful interests on both sides of the slavery issue. The South wanted to expand slavery into new territories to maintain their economic and political power, while the North wanted to限制 its spread.

The Mexican Cession brought a large amount of new land into the Union, and deciding the status of slavery in those lands was crucial.

I think the Wilmot Proviso was related to this. What was that again? I think it was an attempt to ban slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico, but I'm not sure if it passed.

Wait, I think David Wilmot proposed an amendment to an appropriations bill in 1846, stating that neither slavery nor involuntary servitude should exist in any territory acquired from Mexico. But I think it didn't pass in the Senate, or maybe it passed in the House but not the Senate.

Regardless, it shows that there was already debate about slavery in the territories even before the war ended.

So, the Mexican Cession intensified the debate over slavery's expansion.

Then, the Compromise of 1850 tried to settle these disputes by making a series of concessions to both sides.

But, in reality, it probably just delayed the inevitable conflict over slavery.

Looking back, the Mexican Cession added fuel to the fire of sectional tensions that eventually led to the Civil War.

Alternatively, maybe the impact was more nuanced. Perhaps the acquisition of Mexican territory also opened up non-slaveholding areas, which could have diluted the political power of the slave states.

But, on the other hand, the South was eager to expand slavery into new territories to maintain their influence in Congress.

So, overall, the Mexican Cession had a significant impact on the slavery issue, exacerbating the divisions between North and South and leading to political compromises that tried to hold the Union together.

I think that's about as far as I can go with this. Maybe I should try to summarize my thoughts.

The Mexican Cession, resulting from the US-Mexico War, brought a large amount of new territory under American control. This raised the question of whether slavery would be permitted in these new areas. The debate over slavery's expansion led to the Compromise of 1850, which attempted to resolve the issue by admitting some territories as free and others to be decided by popular sovereignty. However, this compromise only temporarily alleviated the tensions, which continued to build until the outbreak of the Civil War.

So, in essence, the Mexican Cession intensified the slavery issue and contributed to the growing polarization between the North and the South.

I think that's a reasonable conclusion.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Mexican Cession intensified the debate over slavery's expansion, leading to political compromises that only temporarily alleviated growing tensions between the North and the South.}} \]
