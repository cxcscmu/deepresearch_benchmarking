Alright, I need to figure out what the role of privacy legislation is from both the employer and employee perspectives. Hmm, privacy legislation— that sounds like laws that protect personal information and data. So, in the context of employment, these laws must regulate how employers can collect, use, and protect employees' personal and sensitive information.

First things first, I should probably understand what kinds of privacy legislations are relevant here. I know there are general data protection regulations like GDPR in Europe, but I'm not sure about specific ones for employment. Maybe there are national or state-level laws that address workplace privacy.

Let me think from the employer's perspective. Employers likely need certain information from employees to manage payroll, ensure compliance with labor laws, and administer benefits. But they also have a responsibility to protect that information from unauthorized access or breaches. So, privacy legislation probably sets guidelines on what data employers can collect, how they should store it, and who can access it.

From the employee's perspective, privacy legislation should protect their personal information from being misused or disclosed without consent. Employees might be concerned about their sensitive data falling into the wrong hands or being used against them in the workplace.

I wonder if there are specific areas where these perspectives might conflict or align. For example, employers might argue that certain data collection is necessary for managing the workforce efficiently, while employees might be apprehensive about oversharing their personal information.

Maybe I should look into some specific examples or case studies where privacy legislation has played a role in employment scenarios. That might help me understand the practical implications better.

Wait a minute, I should probably do some research here. I can't rely solely on my assumptions. Let me try to find some reliable sources that discuss the role of privacy legislation from both employer and employee viewpoints.

Workplace Privacy, an Increasingly Important Issue in the Information Age
Workplace privacy is a very complicated area of employment law and can arise in many different situations involving the collection, use and disclosure of private information. Some areas of dispute include employee medical information, the extent to which employers may monitor employees’ use of the internet or personal e-mail accounts at the workplace, and the appropriate degree of surveillance over employees at the workplace.
Controversy exists due to a clash of interests. Whereas employees wish to have their privacy rights respected and protected, employers want to ensure that activity in the workplace does not negatively impact their business interests. For instance, internet use could result in non-productive employees who use work computers to spend excessive amounts of working time on social networking sites. On the other hand, an employee who uses the internet during break periods may feel that the employer has no right to monitor the pages visited during non-work time.
How Workplace Privacy is Governed
Some provinces in Canada have their own statutory legislation to regulate and protect employee’s privacy rights. However, no specific legislation currently exists in Ontario, although the Occupational Health & Safety Act does provide some protection. Where provincial legislation is lacking, federal legislation does exist, and applies to all federally and provincially regulated employers in all such provinces in varying degrees. The federal legislation is entitled Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and it governs how personal information may be collected, used and disclosed. Common law also governs privacy law in Ontario.
Various court cases have also resulted in common law decisions that may serve as a basis for evaluating workplace privacy disputes. Employers may also have developed their own internal policies outlining the right to collect, use and disclose private information. However, the legal enforceability of such policies depends upon many factors, such as the extent to which:
the policy is consistently applied in the workplace;
employers regularly inform employees about the policy;
employees were involved in creating the policy;
all employees have a copy of the most updated policy;
employees are encouraged to read the policy on a regular basis.
Engaging the services of an employment lawyer provides the guidance and expertise that puts employers in a better position to develop policies that both protect business interests and safeguard against legal action associated with employee privacy issues.

National Summary
Privacy in the workplace requires a delicate balancing
act between the right of employers to control their workplaces and
employees’ expectation of privacy. Although many employees claim a
right to privacy for their individual workstations, computer files,
telephone conversations, and e-mail, employers often have the legitimate
right to monitor such activity and to inspect and review all related
records. In fact, for employers that are engaged in particularly sensitive
or competitive industries, such as the manufacture of drugs or the
development of national defense systems, monitoring and investigating
the workplace and after-hours activities of employees may be a compelling
and entirely lawful act. The increased role and use of computers in
the workplace have also presented employers with an entire set of
new problems to worry about in the form of identity theft and security
breaches.

Law on Privacy in Employment | Justia
Privacy in Employment
Privacy in Employment
Overview of Privacy in the Workplace
In 1928, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis observed that the right most valued by Americans was “the right to be left alone.” This is also known as the constitutional right to privacy. Although it is is very important to many individuals, privacy is not a right that is well protected in the workplace. Some state constitutions specify a right to privacy, and in those states you may have a slightly stronger claim to privacy in the workplace. Many employers advise in employee handbooks or other documentation that there will be no right to privacy in an employee’s desk or on the employer’s communications technologies.
Handbooks
Employee handbooks sometimes specify where an employee should not expect privacy, such as their office cabinets and drawers.
Employers have broad leeway, but there are some limits. Employees have the right to keep private facts about themselves confidential and the right to some degree of personal space. An employer that discloses private facts or lies about an employee may be held accountable in a civil action for invasion of privacy or defamation. Courts usually decide whether you had a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances and balance it against the employer’s reason to seek the information.
For example, if you have never been told that your briefcase or purse or a personal locker in an employee break area could be subject to inspection by your employer, and your employer was simply conducting a random search, you might be found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in these items.
What about private information in your personnel file or medical records? State laws govern who can access confidential information in an employee’s personnel files.
The Americans with Disabilities Act includes strict provisions about handling information obtained after an offer is made to a disabled employee. Employers covered by ADA have to keep medical records and related documentation confidential and separate from other personnel records. They should only be accessible by first aid workers, the employee’s supervisor when a reasonable accommodation is needed, government officials, and insurance companies that require a medical exam. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) also requires employers that provide group health plans to honor certain privacy obligations.
However, surveillance, drug testing, and lifestyle discrimination by employers are routine. There are limited remedies if you feel your employer has invaded your right to privacy in these areas.
Workplace Surveillance
Workplace monitoring and surveillance is common and not generally prohibited by federal law. Employers monitor numerous aspects of an employee’s work, especially with regard to communications technology owned by the employer, such as email, telephones, and Internet use. Many technologies leave “digital footprints,” so even if you try to delete them, they may be recovered by a curious or concerned employer with the help of the company’s IT person or department. Your employer usually cannot access your personal devices, unless you are using your employer’s Wi-Fi network.
In general, your employer has a right to monitor your workplace communications, and you should not expect that you have substantial rights to privacy in the workplace. Many employers require you to agree and adhere to an employee handbook that specifies the workplace policy with regard to communications technology.
Working From Home
Just because an employee is working from home does not mean that they are free from employer surveillance and inspection. An employee using their company’s technology, such as a computer, should expect their employer to monitor it — even if they are checking their personal email.
Although your employer can monitor your work-related calls, it must stop monitoring once it realizes that you are on a personal call. If your company gives you a work cellphone, it can look at your text messages, even though some may be personal. In most cases, your employer can videotape you, but courts have prohibited employers from videotaping employees in locker rooms and bathrooms. A small percentage of employees—usually government employees, senior executives, academics, athletes, and a few other types of workers who are represented by labor unions that have fought for their privacy rights—are better protected from invasions of privacy.
Drug Testing
Similarly, employers are given broad rights to require drug testing for job applicants. In most states, there are more restrictions on drug testing for existing employees than for job applicants. Although drug testing is a privacy issue in a few states, whether or not this is permissible in your case may depend on state statutes and local ordinances rather than federal law. Federal law covers drug testing only in certain industries, such as military contracting.
Lifestyle Discrimination
What about when you are away from the office? Some states have enacted “lifestyle discrimination” statutes to prevent employers from discriminating against employees based on off-duty actions.
Employers that engage in lifestyle discrimination are often concerned with how certain employees who engage in riskier behavior would affect their premiums for health care benefits. Employees who smoke, drink, or eat excessively in their off-hours are more likely to require more medical treatment, which increases premiums.
Most lifestyle discrimination statutes are narrow, applying to employees who smoke on their off-hours or offering protection based on sexual orientation. The broadest protection offered against lifestyle discrimination is found in the states of California, Colorado, New York, and North Dakota, which prohibit discrimination that is based on a lawful activity by an employee off-premises during non-working hours. Other states prohibit lifestyle discrimination that is based on an employee’s use of “lawful products” or “lawful consumable products” except in certain circumstances.

Privacy in employment law
Privacy in employment law
Bringing an employment action doesn’t mean “opening the kimono” at defendant’s whim
Alexis McKenna
2012 April
Plaintiffs’ attorneys who are inexperienced at employment law often express surprise at how boldly defense attorneys attempt to delve into a full array of the plaintiff’s private matters. I recently asked a defense attorney in one of my sexual harassment cases, an attorney who normally practices personal injury law, why he sought a number of matters in discovery that I know he does not seek in personal injury cases. He responded, quite sincerely, “Your client’s primary damages are emotional distress; so, I’m entitled to all this.” He had no further explanation, and he seemed to think he didn’t need one.
As with any plaintiff, plaintiffs in employment litigation most certainly still maintain some of their privacy rights, even those claiming severe emotional distress. Plaintiffs’ privacy rights have been well established through constitutional, statutory and case law, although many defendants seem to want to ignore this. This article will provide an overview of plaintiffs’ rights, focus on those issues which arise most often in employment cases, and explain how plaintiffs can maintain their privacy despite having brought an employment claim.
Right to privacy
Californians, including plaintiffs in lawsuits, have an “inalienable right of privacy” provided by Article I, section 1 of the California Constitution. (Britt v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-856.) In fact, this constitutional privilege has been held to operate even if a statutory privilege does not protect the matter in question. (Davis v. Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1014 (citations omitted).) Plaintiffs do not completely cast aside this constitutional right to privacy simply because they have brought a lawsuit. “Although there may be an implicit partial waiver, the scope of such waiver must be narrowly, rather than expansively construed....” (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at 1014 (citing to Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842) (emphasis added).) Moreover, the implicit partial waiver “encompasses only discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff’s claim and essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit.” (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at 1014 (emphasis added).)
In other words, the scope of relevancy normally applied in discovery – whether the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.010) – is not the standard applied when dealing with private matters. Courts consistently hold the scope of relevancy in discovery to be very broad. Information is considered reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of evidence if through reason, logic or common sense it could lead to admissible evidence. (Lipton v. Superior Court (Lawyers’ Mutual Ins. Co.) (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611 (citations omitted).) However, this sort of fishing expedition is not allowed when dealing with constitutionally protected, private matters. Rather, constitutionally protected information is treated like privileged information in the discovery process. “The party seeking the constitutionally protected information has the burden of establishing that the information sought is directly relevant to the claims.” (Tylo v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1387.) Further: “Even when discovery of private information is found directly relevant to the issues of ongoing litigation, it will not be automatically allowed ... The scope of any disclosure must be narrowly circumscribed, drawn with narrow specificity, and must proceed by the least intrusive manner.” (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at 1014.)
Various matters which the courts have found to be constitutionally protected include: personnel files (Board of Trustees v. Superior Court (1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 516, 528-530); educational records (Porten v. University of San Francisco (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 825, 829); medical records (Board of Medical Quality Assurance v. Gherardini (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 669, 678); mental health/ psychological history (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at p. 1013-1014); sex life (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 841); (John B. v. Superior Court (Bridget B.) (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1198;); marital relationship (Tylo v. Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379; 1387); and financial information (Moskowitz v. Superior Court (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 313).)1
Medical records
Defendants in employment cases will often seek the entirety of plaintiff’s medical records through subpoena, including his or her psychological history as well as physical medical condition, arguing that they are entitled to all of the records to see if some other factor may have caused the plaintiff’s emotional distress. They are trying to apply the typical relevancy standard, not that which applies to privileged information. They cannot do this.
A plaintiff’s medical and psychiatric records are protected not only by his or her privacy rights, but also by the physician-patient privilege and the psychotherapist-patient privilege. (See Evid. Code, §§ 990, et. seq.; 1012 et.seq.) Although Evidence Code section 996 provides an exception to the physician-patient privilege where the patient has put his or her medical condition in issue, and section 1016 provides an exception to the psychotherapist-patient privilege where the patient has put his or her emotional or mental state in issue, the privilege is broadly construed by the courts while any exceptions are narrowly construed. (Britt, supra, 20 Cal.3d, at p. 863); People v. Castro (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 390.)
The courts recognize that a person’s medical history is an especially private area, “infinitely more intimate, more personal in quality and nature” than other areas protected by the constitutional right to privacy. (Gherardini, supra, 93 Cal.App.3d at 678.) The purposes for zone of privacy surrounding medical records are (1) ‘to preclude humiliation of the patient that might follow disclosure of his ailments’ [Citations] and (2) to encourage the patient’s full disclosure to the physician of all information necessary for the effective diagnosis and treatment of the patient. (Citations.) (Ibid.) Both these purposes would be severely undermined if courts allowed litigants to overstep privacy rights by granting them unrestricted access to medical and psychiatric records.
The party seeking access to these privileged records may only have those directly relevant to those specific conditions the plaintiff has raised in the case. (Britt, supra, 20 Cal.3d, at p. 863-864.) A plaintiff’s right of privacy remains protected as to physical and mental conditions unrelated to the claim or injury sued upon. (See id. at p. 864.) Further, the burden is on the party seeking the discovery to demonstrate that the information sought is directly relevant. (Id. at 859-862.) Disclosure may only be ordered if it would serve a “compelling public interest.” ( Britt, supra, 20 Cal.3d at 855-856;
John B., supra, 38 Cal.4th at 1199.)
Accordingly, while your clients will have to understand that they are waiving their privacy rights with respect to those specific conditions they put at issue, they should not have to worry that their entire medical or psychiatric history will be disclosed. In fact, even if they believed they suffered a particular condition as a result of the conduct of the defendants, they are not required to claim every condition if they do not wish to have their prior history of that condition at issue. Plaintiffs certainly may narrow their claims in order to protect their privacy. In addition, they can claim “garden variety” emotional distress instead of severe emotional distress in order to further protect and narrow the scope of the discovery of any private matters. A “garden variety” emotional distress claim seeking damages for “pain and suffering” does not place plaintiff’s mental condition in issue. (Davis, supra, 7 Cal.App.4th at 1016 (in garden variety case, plaintiff’s right to privacy in his or her post-injury psychotherapeutic records outweighs any need for discovery of that information); see also Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840 (simple claims for having to endure an oppressive work environment or for lost wages normally will not place plaintiff’s mental state in controversy).2
Sexual history
In sexual-harassment cases, some defense attorneys also claim that they are entitled to delve into the plaintiff’s sexual history – it seems they wish to present a defense that implies that the plaintiff is sexually promiscuous and therefore was not offended by the harasser’s conduct, or he or she in fact invited the conduct.  In truth, plaintiffs most often do maintain their privacy regarding sexual history, even in sexual-harassment cases. Defendants must pass procedural safeguards in order to obtain any sort of discovery regarding a plaintiff’s sexual history in such cases. Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.220 provides:
…in any civil action alleging conduct that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, or sexual battery, any party seeking discovery concerning the plaintiff’s sexual conduct with individuals other than the alleged perpetrator shall establish specific facts showing that there is good cause for that discovery, and that the matter sought to be discovered is relevant to the subject matter of the action and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This showing shall be made by a noticed motion….
Further, evidence of “specific instances of plaintiff’s sexual conduct, or any of such evidence, is not admissible by a defendant in order to prove consent by the plaintiff or absence of injury to the plaintiff in a sexual harassment case.” (Evid. Code, § 1106(a).) “Sexual conduct” in Evidence Code 1106(a) is interpreted broadly to include “testimony about the plaintiff’s racy banter, sexual horseplay, and statements concerning prior, proposed, or planned sexual exploits.” (Rieger v. Arnold (2002) 104 Cal.App 4th 451, 462.)
The Court of Appeal has pointed out with respect to Evidence Code section 1106 that:
The purpose of this legislation, though probably self-evident, was eloquently stated by the Legislature: The discovery of sexual aspects of complainant’s lives ... has the clear potential to discourage complaints and to annoy and harass litigants. That annoyance and discomfort, as a result of defendant[s’] ... inquiries, is unnecessary and deplorable. Without protection against it, individuals whose intimate lives are unjustifiably and offensively intruded upon might face ... invoking their remedy only at the risk of enduring further intrusions into details of their personal lives in discovery, and in open ... judicial proceedings. The Legislature is mindful that a similar state of affairs once confronted victims in criminal prosecutions for rape.... The Legislature concludes that the use of evidence of a complainant’s sexual behavior is more often harassing and intimidating than genuinely probative, and the potential for prejudice outweighs whatever probative value that evidence may have. Absent extraordinary circumstances, inquiry into those areas should not be permitted, either in discovery or at trial.
(Knoettgen v. Superior Court (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 11, 13 (emphasis added.))
Simply put, defendants cannot inquire into a plaintiff’s sexual history, or attempt to introduce such evidence, merely by stating that they think she is promiscuous. The requirement of showing “extraordinary circumstances” will not easily be met, thereby providing plaintiff protection of his or her sexual privacy.
Defense attorneys in sexual harassment cases may further argue that they are entitled to, at the very least, information regarding the plaintiff’s sexual conduct in the workplace generally in order to show that he or she would not have been offended by the harasser’s conduct. However, plaintiffs do not waive their privacy rights regarding sexual conduct in the workplace or with co-workers other than those they accuse of the sexually harassing conduct. The scope of admissible evidence in employment cases is limited to “evidence about the plaintiff’s prior sexual conduct with the individual defendants, or others whose conduct plaintiff ascribed to the employer, regardless of whether it occurred in or outside the workplace.” (Rieger, supra, 104 Cal.App.4th at 465.)
Keep in mind, should your client wish to keep his or her sexual history and practices private, he or she must not, of course, open the door by claiming damage to his or her sex life as a result of the defendants’ wrongful conduct. Even if that is a damage, your client should consider not claiming it as a damage in order to prevent discovery on the topic, including any inquiry through a mental status exam, as explained further below.
Mental status exams
Defendants in employment cases sometimes attempt to circumvent the above privacy safeguards by insisting the plaintiff be subjected to a mental status exam, and thereafter have their examiner inquire into these private areas. However, a mental exam is also a discovery tool, and defendants may not use this tool to circumvent the privacy rights which otherwise apply.
Unlike a physical exam, the defense cannot just demand a mental exam, even though your client may be claiming emotional distress; defendants must bring a motion to the court and show good cause for such an exam. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2032.310; 2032.320(a).)3 If it fits within your case strategy, you should be able to avoid a mental status exam entirely. A defendant cannot compel a mental exam if the plaintiff claims no continuing injury; e.g., where plaintiff only alleges past but no present or future emotional distress. (Doyle v. Superior Court (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1878, 1886.) The Doyle Court explained: “Where a plaintiff alleges that she is not suffering any current mental injury but only that she has suffered emotional distress in the past arising from the defendant’s misconduct, a mental examination is unnecessary because such an allegation alone does not place the nature and cause of the plaintiff’s current mental condition “in controversy.” (Id. at 1887.) Further, barring “exceptional circumstances” a defendant cannot compel a mental exam if the plaintiff stipulates that (1) “no claim is being made for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated with the physical injuries claimed” and (2) “no expert testimony regarding this usual mental and emotional distress will be presented at trial in support for the claim for damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320(b)(c).)
The first part of that stipulation seems unclear in the context of most employment cases where, unlike other personal injury matters, “physical” injuries have not occurred. However, in the leading case on this issue, the California Supreme Court clarified the issue: “A simple sexual harassment claim asking compensation for having to endure an oppressive work environment or for wages lost following an unjust dismissal would not normally create a controversy regarding the plaintiff’s mental state” (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.) The Vinson Court held that the plaintiff in that case did put her mental state in controversy, and good cause was shown for an exam, because she claimed the conduct of the defendants caused her various ongoing mental and emotional “ailments”, i.e. severe emotional distress, and defendants pointed to specific justifying facts for the exam. (Id., at 840-841.)
Yet, even if your case is one where you wish to make claims of ongoing, severe emotional distress, and/or call an expert to testify about the plaintiff’s emotional distress, such that the plaintiff will be subject to a mental exam by the defense, that still does not mean that defendants’ examiner is allowed an unlimited scope for the examination. The Vinson Court made clear that even though it found the plaintiff in that sexual-harassment case could be subject to a mental status exam, she had not waived her right to sexual privacy. Thus, the examiner was prohibited from asking her about her sexual history, habits or practices. (Id. at 843-844.) In any case where your client will be subject to a mental status exam, any stipulation or court order should prevent the examiner from delving into your client’s sex life.
On-line privacy
An evolving issue in employment cases is the right to privacy regarding on-line communications and social media. The case law on these issues is still unclear, and thus far no California cases have dealt directly with the issue of whether defendants can subpoena plaintiffs’ social media accounts. The Court of Appeal has held, however, that the author of an article posted on MySpace had no expectation of privacy even though she removed the article after six days, and she did not use her last name. (See Moreno v. Hanford Sentinel Inc. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1125.) Notably, though, the Court of Appeal quoted M.G. v. Time Warner, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 623, 632, stating, “The claim of a right to privacy is not so much one of total secrecy as it is of the right to define one’s circle of intimacy – to choose who shall see beneath the quotidian mask. Information disclosed to a few people may remain private.” (Moreno, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at 1130.) But continuing, the Moreno Court stated, “Nevertheless, the fact that Cynthia [the author] expected a limited audience does not change the above analysis. By posting the article on myspace.com, Cynthia opened the article to the public at large. Her potential audience was vast.” (Ibid.)
Disturbingly, a trial court in New York, relying on Moreno, compelled a plaintiff to sign a consent form authorizing access to her Facebook and MySpace accounts, stating, “When Plaintiff created her Facebook and MySpace accounts, she consented to the fact that her personal information would be shared with others, notwithstanding her privacy settings. Indeed, that is the very nature and purpose of these social networking sites else they would cease to exist.” ( Romano v. Steelcase Inc. (N.Y. Sup.2010) 30 Misc.3d 426,434.) The court granted the requested order permitting the defendants “access to Plaintiff’s current and historical Facebook and MySpace pages and accounts, including all deleted pages and related information.” (Ibid)
The most favorable case for plaintiffs on this issue thus far seems to be an unreported decision from the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, Mackelprang v. Fidelity Nat’l Title Agency of Nevada, Inc. (2007 WL 119149 (d. Nev.)), ruling on a motion to compel e-mail communications on two MySpace accounts in a sexual- harassment case.
The plaintiff denied they were her accounts, but the court found the evidence suggested they did belong to the plaintiff. But the court also found the defendants were on a fishing expedition and denied the motion because the requests were overly broad. The court stated that the defendants could serve discovery requests “on Plaintiff to produce her Myspace.com private messages that contain information regarding her sexual-harassment allegations in this lawsuit or which discuss her alleged emotional distress and the cause(s) thereof.” However, the court said other private e-mails, such as those between the plaintiff and third parties that were sexually explicit or promiscuous, could not be obtained. (Id. at *8.)
This is an issue on which plaintiffs’ attorneys must keep a close eye, as cases may appear at any time. It does not help that Facebook seems to change its rules regarding privacy settings on a regular basis. Regardless, it is best to advise clients to set their social network settings to private, and of course refrain from discussing their case and their injuries on-line in any fashion.
Conclusion
The California right to privacy is not absolute, and plaintiffs do, to some extent, waive their privacy rights when they bring lawsuit. However, this waiver is not as broad as defense attorneys would like it to be. Plaintiffs in employment cases can, and should, be able to maintain the privacy of much of their constitutionally protected information.

What Are Employee Privacy Rights?
Employee privacy rights are the rules that limit how extensively an employer can search an employee’s possessions or person; monitor their actions, speech, or correspondence; and know about their personal lives, especially but not exclusively in the workplace. The nature and extent of these protections have become a greater concern in recent years, especially with the rise of the internet and social media. Many of these means of communication may seem private, but in truth, there is hardly any real privacy to be had with them. Employers can usually search through anything that appears on company computers, and they can conduct searches of social media and the internet, as well.
Employment law covers all the obligations and rights concerning the employer-employee relationship, regardless if one is a current employee, former employee, or job applicant. This type of law involves legal issues including wrongful termination, discrimination, workplace safety, taxation, and wages. Many of these issues are governed by applicable federal and state law. Where the employment relationship is based on a valid contract made between the employer and employee, state contract law alone may dictate the rights and duties of the parties involved. The rights of public employees, on the other hand, may differ from the rights of private employees.
Employees may have subjective expectations of privacy due to passwords, information segregation, or the use of electronic lockboxes, but an employer’s policies may eliminate any objective expectation of privacy, and some technology might simply not be considered private. Because laws related to employee’s privacy expectations have not caught up with the technology available to employers, privacy claims have to be evaluated carefully case-by-case within the workplace.
Employee privacy rights include an employee’s activities at work and personal information, but company policy will often dictate those rights. Technology lets employers keep tabs on many aspects of employee workplace activity. Numerous kinds of monitoring are legal, and most employers do monitor their employees’ activities on some level. Many technologies allow employers to observer their employees’ "digital footprints" and thereby gain insight into employee behavior. Nearly any activity on your office computer can be monitored, almost completely without regulation. The employer may watch, read, and listen to most of the employee's workplace communications. Employees should remember that when they use an employer's equipment, there expectations of privacy should be limited.
Internet and Email Privacy at Work
Private companies have the right to monitor the email, computer, and phone of their employees. Therefore, it is recommended that all policies regarding monitoring be documented, well-defined, and require written acknowledgement by employees. If there are email and computer monitoring policies, these need to state clearly that employees should not expect privacy when they use their employer’s resources or are on their employer’s property.
Since employers typically don't have the time or resources to monitor every employee, they often block access to websites deemed irrelevant to the work at hand or improper in general, or they use tracking software that alerts them to violations. Employers can also use various programs that let them see their employee’s screen in real time or what is in the employees' hard drives and computer terminals. Employers can also keep tabs on internet usage, including email, which includes private messages sent outside the context of work. While it may not be checked regularly, it is often archived in case it must be searched later. Additional monitoring includes technology that tracks idle time at the terminal and how many keystrokes an hour each employee performs, the latter of which can even show if employees are below or above the expected number of keystrokes.
Telephone Privacy at Work
Employers have the right to monitor telephone calls placed to and from their locations, although some limits do apply. The Electronics Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits employers from monitoring employees' personal phone calls even if the calls were made or received on an employer's property. The Act also requires the employer to disclose the fact that calls are being monitored and makes it a civil liability for employers to read, disclose, delete, or prevent access to an employee's voicemail. That said, employers may listen in on calls to customers or clients to monitor for quality control, but when a party receiving a call is in California, state law says they must be told that the call is being monitored or recorded. Numbers dialed from phone extensions can also be monitored with a pen register device. This lets employers view a list of phone numbers dialed through the extension and how long each call was. This information can be used to evaluate how much time an employee spends with clients.
Video Surveillance and Employee Privacy
Private companies have the right to monitor their employees by camera, including in a parking structure for both security and employee safety. However, employers are required to notify employees, customers, and all others in the range of the cameras that their property is under video surveillance. By law, video recordings must not include audio, as this violates federal wiretap law regarding oral communications. Furthermore, surveillance cameras must only be used where there is a legitimate business need to deter violence or theft (including internal theft) or to monitor employee productivity, and they generally may not be used in break rooms, restrooms, locker rooms, or other locations where it is reasonable to expect privacy. Additionally, The National Labor Relations Act (NLRB) prohibits employers' use of video surveillance to monitor the union activities of employees.
Drug Testing
Private companies have the right to test their employees for drugs and alcohol, but records of these tests cannot be legally released, and many states restrict an employer's ability to enforce drug screening of existing employees. There are a few exceptions, however, and they include:
Employees working in jobs that carry substantial safety or health risks for themselves or others.
Injured employees whose job-related accident is suspected to have involved the use of drugs.
Employees suspected of using drugs on the job, such as slurred speech or bloodshot eyes.
Policies regarding the when, how, and why of these tests do not fall under law enforcement. That said, any company should clearly state its drug policy to protect itself from lawsuits.
Employee Rights in the Workplace
Basic workplace rights extend to every employee, and these include the rights to freedom from discrimination, fair compensation, and privacy. Job applicants also have rights before they are hired, including the right to not have to face discrimination based on gender, age, race, religion, or national origin during hiring. Employees have a right to privacy in the workplace, as well. This right applies to the worker's personal items, which include briefcases or handbags, as well as storage lockers and private email accessible only by the employee. Other employee rights include:
Being free from harassment and discrimination of all types.
Being able to expect a workplace free of toxic substances, dangerous conditions, and other safety hazards.
Being free from punishment for making a complaint or claim against a company (sometimes known as "whistleblower" rights).
Being able to expect fair wages for one’s work.
Federal Regulations Regarding Employment Relationships
There are many federal laws regarding employment. A quick overview is as follows:
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
Applies to employers that have 15 employees or more.
Bars employers from discrimination during hiring based on color, race, national origin, religion, or sex.
The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA)
Defines a disability as a mental or physical handicap that greatly curtails one or more major life activities.
Bars discrimination against someone who has a qualified disability.
States that if a handicapped person can perform their essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation, they cannot face discrimination because of their disability.
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act
Prohibits employers from showing favoritism to younger employees at the expense of older ones.
This applies only to employees 40 years old or older in workplaces with 20 or more workers.
Does not prohibit an employer from preferring older workers over younger ones.
The Fair Labor Standards Act
Regulates the duration of workdays and how many breaks an employer must provide.
Governs overtime requirements and applicable salary as laid out by federal law.
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
Requires employers to let employees have up to 12 weeks of leave of for approved medical reasons.
Says that to meet the requirements for the leave, the worker must have worked for the employer for 12 months and for 1,250 hours in those 12 months prior to the leave.
Bars employers from replacing qualified workers during their leave.
Job References
Concerning job references, the law does not protect a private company’s employee information from being disclosed to a prospective employer. That said, it is not a good idea to give out employee information, including a worker’s full name, date of birth, Social Security number, pay level, or work schedule. It is also recommended that one document and researches those who request information and why they do so, and that an HR employee should handle the inquiry. Getting written authorization from the employee before releasing any information is also advised.
Personal Searches
Private companies can have a policy that lets them search for an employee, their workspace, or their property, including their car if it is on company property. However, a personal search may be cause for a variety of legal actions against an employer, and bodily searches run an especially high legal risk and should never be conducted by force.
GPS Tracking
In general, employers can use GPS to monitor employees while they are using company-owned vehicles, as well as place GPS on employer-owned equipment, where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. However, Minnesota, California, Texas, and Tennessee have laws barring employees from using GPS to track individuals, although such laws do not include barring the installation of GPS devices on company-owned cars. Cellphone tracking may be used by some employers to keep tabs on their employees’ locations.
Postal Mail
Generally, mail addressed to you at your office can be opened by your employer. Federal law bars mail obstruction, but once the mail arrives at the workplace, it is deemed delivered. The USPS Domestic Mail Manual has this to say regarding the topic:
“All mail addressed to a governmental or nongovernmental organization or to an individual by name or title at the address of the organization is delivered to the organization, as is similarly addressed mail for former officials, employees, contractors, agents, etc. If a disagreement arises where any such mail should be delivered, it must be delivered under the order of the organization's president or equivalent official."
After the mail is delivered by USPS to your company, it is up to them how it is distributed. There may be some limited situations where reading a worker’s mail may constitute an invasion of one’s privacy, but these would be very specific and guided by common law principles of tort law.
Monitoring of Social Media
Numerous companies have policies regarding social media that restrict what the employee can post about the employer on social networking sites. Compliance Building is a website that provides a database of social media policies for many companies. In some states, there are laws that bar employers from punishing an employee because of activity on social networking sites outside of company time, unless said activity can be shown to be damaging to the company. Generally, posts that refer to work can be considered damaging, and so should be avoided by employees.
The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has published many rulings regarding issues related to the social media policies of employers, and it provides the following guidance:
Company policies should not bar activity protected by federal labor law, like the discussion of working conditions or wages amongst workers.
A worker’s social media comments are generally unprotected if they are minor complaints not related to a group activity with employees.
Many states have passed laws protecting job applicants from organizations that insist they provide a password or username to access a social media account.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can find.

Looking at Doc 1, it's about employment privacy laws in Canada. Since the user didn't specify a jurisdiction, I'll assume they're interested in a general understanding applicable in most places, but it's good to know that in Canada, there's no specific legislation for workplace privacy, but federal legislation like Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) governs personal information handling.

Doc 2 is from HR.BLR.com and seems to be a resource for human resources and employment law topics, focusing on privacy in the workplace, especially regarding email and internet use. It mentions that while employees may claim a right to privacy, employers have the right to monitor activity on their systems, especially in sensitive industries.

Doc 3 is from Justia, a legal information website, and provides an overview of privacy in employment. It discusses various aspects like employee handbooks, workplace surveillance, drug testing, and lifestyle discrimination. It seems comprehensive and includes information on state laws and federal regulations.

Doc 4 is from Plaintiff Magazine and focuses on privacy rights in employment law from the perspective of plaintiffs, particularly in California. It delves into constitutional rights, medical records, sexual history, and mental status exams, providing a detailed look at how privacy rights are balanced against discovery in litigation.

Doc 5 is from UpCounsel and offers a broad overview of employee privacy rights, covering internet and email privacy, telephone privacy, video surveillance, drug testing, and other related topics. It seems to be more generalized and not specific to any particular jurisdiction.

Given that Doc 3 and Doc 4 provide detailed information on privacy legislation from both employer and employee perspectives, I'll focus on those for my answer.

From Doc 3, it's clear that privacy in the workplace is a delicate balance between employer needs and employee expectations. Employers often have the right to monitor communications and activities on their systems, but employees also have rights to some degree of privacy, especially regarding personal information and certain private activities.

Doc 4 emphasizes that even when bringing employment claims, plaintiffs maintain some privacy rights. The article discusses constitutional and statutory protections, particularly in California, and how these rights are balanced against the need for discovery in litigation.

So, to answer the question: "What is the role of privacy legislation from the employer and employee perspectives?"

From the employer's perspective, privacy legislation sets boundaries on how they can collect, use, and protect employee personal information. Employers need to comply with laws like PIPEDA in Canada or state-specific laws in the U.S. They must inform employees about data collection practices and ensure that personal data is handled securely. Employers also have responsibilities to protect employee privacy while maintaining operational efficiency and security.

From the employee's perspective, privacy legislation is crucial for protecting personal information from misuse or unauthorized access. Employees should be aware of their rights and understand how their data is being used by their employers. Privacy laws provide safeguards against invasive monitoring and ensure that personal information is handled responsibly.

In summary, privacy legislation serves to protect employee data and privacy while allowing employers to manage their operations effectively, ensuring a balance between these sometimes competing interests.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Privacy legislation balances employers' need to manage their workforce with employees' right to privacy, regulating how personal information is collected, used, and protected in the workplace.}} \]
