Alright, so I've been asked to look into why centers of excellence often fail. I'm not entirely sure what a center of excellence is, to be honest, so maybe I should start by understanding that.

Center of excellence
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see Centre of excellence (disambiguation).
The Auburn Performing Arts Center, Julie and Hal Moore Center for Excellence at Auburn High School (Alabama) is focused on performing arts.
A center of excellence (COE ), also called excellence center, is a team, a shared facility or an entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for a focus area.
Due to its broad usage and vague legal precedent, a "center of excellence" in one context may have completely different characteristics from another. The focus area might be a technology (e.g. Java ), a business concept (e.g. BPM ), a skill (e.g. negotiation) or a broad area of study (e.g. women's health ). A center of excellence may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives. [1] The term may also refer to a network of institutions collaborating with each other to pursue excellence in a particular area. [2] (e.g. the Rochester Area Colleges Center for Excellence in Math and Science ). In contrast, in the European defense community, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats is a response to hybrid warfare on its periphery; the COE seeks to inform, and also protect its non- NATO components, as well as its non- PESCO members.

Organizations[edit]
Within an organization, a center of excellence may refer to a group of people, a department or a shared facility. It may also be known as a competency center, or as a capability center, or as an excellence center. Stephen Jenner and Craig Kilford, in Management of Portfolios, mention COE as a coordinating function which ensures that change initiatives are delivered consistently and well, through standard processes and competent staff. [4] In technology companies, the center of excellence concept is often associated with new software tools, technologies or associated business concepts such as Service-oriented architecture or business intelligence.[5] [6]
Academia[edit]
In academic institutions, a center of excellence often refers to a team with a clear focus on a particular area of research; such a center may bring together faculty members from different disciplines and provide shared facilities. [7]
Australia[edit]
In Australia, the Australian Research Council (ARC) funds a competitive grant program for Centres of Excellence which link a number of institutions within the country and internationally in a specific field of research. [8] New centres are funded every three years and each run for seven years. [8]

Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, a center of excellence (COE) is a certification given by the Commission on Higher Education to departments within a higher education institution (e.g. a college within a university) which "continuously demonstrates excellent performance in the areas of instruction, research and publication, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications". Candidates for this certification are referred as centers of development (CODs) by the education body. [9]
Russia[edit]
Certificate of the Leading Scientific School of the Russian Federation (leader N. Kuznetsov ), 2018 year
In Russia, the Center of Excellence status (in Russian it is used notion Leading scientific school) is granted by the Council for Grants of the President of the Russian Federation since 1996. [10] To obtain the COE status, a group of scientists, usually based on a department at a university or a laboratory at an academic institute, and its leader should have a high scientific reputation and should submit an application, which presents a plan of scientific and educational work for the period of two years, to the Council. The Council issues a special certificate of the COE status to the leader of the group. [11]
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United KIngdom, schools and sixth forms specialising in an area of curriculum are known as specialist schools. These schools are recognised as centres of excellence in their specialist subject areas. [12] [13] Schools that attained Beacon status were also recognised as centres of excellence, [14] however this status has been discontinued. [15]
Business[edit]
Walmart is designating certain employee healthcare venues as Centers of Excellence. In 2013 several regions of the country (Dallas-Fort Worth; Northern Arkansas; Orlando, FL) Walmart is offering employees free treatment when they use the designated Centers of Excellence. Treatments are administered to covered employees, who travel to the Centers, along with a caregiver, for a course of treatment at the Center. Depending on the budgetary outcome, Walmart will be sharing its operational results with other employers, as a method of controlling its healthcare costs. [16]
Ford Motor Company has announced a battery center of excellence, meant to centralize a cross-functional team to accelerate the development of battery and battery cell technology. Electrical batteries would then serve as the basis for all-electric vehicles. The Center of Excellence is called Ford Ion Park. [17]
Northrup Grumman has invested in its Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence in Melbourne, Florida. This investment uses modeling and simulation tools at the Center of Excellence which predict the performance of its test-bed aircraft, as a method for reducing risk during the process of developing the B-21. [18]
Huntington Ingalls Industries is building out an Unmanned Systems Center of Excellence, which is working on Boeing's project for the Navy's Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle. [19]
Similarly Alliant Techsystems, Otis Elevator, Alcoa, Greatbatch, and GE have all used Centers of Excellence as organizational mechanisms to gain economies of scale, when discovering and sharing efficiencies of operation. [20]
On August 3, 2019 23 citizens of 3 countries —The United States of America, Mexico, and Germany— were gunned down in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. In solidarity with El Paso, the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence, Fort Bliss, presented a memorial memento to Walmart consisting of 23 chips each inscribed with the three national flags, as well as the flag which was flying over the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence at the moment of the mass shooting.
Healthcare[edit]
In the healthcare sector, the term often refers to a center that provides sufficient and easily accessible medical services to patients. [21]
In the British NHS, the term is almost always used sarcastically, following its popularisation by Dr Peter Gooderham on the Doctors.net.uk fora. [22] It can often be heard being used to describe tertiary centres by staff working in district general hospitals.
United States Army[edit]

What a Health Care Center of Excellence Means for You

These days we hear the term “center of excellence” more and more often. And while it likely evokes a certain level of confidence in a business or service, we may not fully understand what it means.
Becoming a center of excellence (COE) is not just a health care thing. It’s a quality milestone used across all types of industries and organizations. COEs are defined simply as a team, facility or organization that provides leadership, best practices, research and training for a focus area. That means companies that qualify as COEs, don’t just deliver quality goods or services; they do truly exceptional work — setting the bar for everyone else in their industry.
Since more goes into attaining this esteemed commendation than most of us realize, knowing what it can mean in terms of the quality of service you can expect — especially for medical care — can go a long way in helping you make the best possible decision on where you want to seek services. Get the details, so you know which health systems and specialty programs you can count on for the highest level of care.
COE-Designated Healthcare Programs Provide Advanced, Specialized Care
In health care, a center of excellence accreditation is awarded to medical programs that treat complex medical conditions while meeting the most rigorous quality, safety and patient experience standards. COEs most often include specialties like cancer care, heart care, neurology and orthopedics to name just a few. To become a COE, a health care program must:
Be committed to providing the highest level of care to every patient, every time
Conduct research that translates into improved treatment options and patient outcomes
Demonstrate quality differentiation of their services, equipment and technologies
Enact a culture of continuous improvement
Have a strong reputation in the medical community and the area it serves
These specialized programs offer concentrated expertise and resources to develop best practices, and the most effective treatments available. As a center of excellence patient, you can expect:
Access to World-Class Specialists
Seeking treatment from an accredited program means you’ll have access to world-class doctors, nurses and other professionals across many specialties — all working together to bring you the highest-quality, most comprehensive and specialized care possible. Each member of your center of excellence care team is specially trained and certified on your specific condition. In fact, these are the doctors entrusted to train our next generation of doctors.
A Full Range of Services
Each COE offers a full range of services tailored to meet patients’ needs, from wellness services and screenings to the most advanced care for the most severe cases.
An Exceptional Patient Experience
From the start of your healthcare journey through treatment and into recovery, you can count on your COE to be at your side every step of the way — whether that means helping you and your family better understand your condition, managing your symptoms and medications or simply praying with you.
Convenience
Managing the logistics of treatment when you have a complex medical condition — such as coordinating your appointments and traveling from office to office — can be quite a challenge.
Centers of Excellence have knowledgeable staff who can help make it easy for you during treatment. Our Orthopedic Care Navigator is your single point of contact who will guide you through the health care system and help you understand your options, overcome barriers, and make informed decisions about your treatment.
The Care Navigator will coordinate with your multidisciplinary team to help schedule your appointments, assist you through the surgical and rehab process, and answer all of your questions along the way.
Coordinated Care
When treating highly complex medical conditions, there are many benefits to having specialists work together. The coordination of care that happens at a COE allows your doctors to easily exchange information, learn from one another, and treat you more holistically.
Focused Expertise
Getting care from a COE team means that each member is focused solely on your specific disease. They focus on one thing — orthopedics for example — ALL of the time.
AdventHealth is an Orthopedic Center of Excellence
When you come to us for orthopedic care, you’ll have the same world-class orthopedic and sports medicine care we provide some of the nation’s finest athletes, with the same exceptional patient experience. Our highly expert and experienced orthopedic surgeons and nurses provide accurate diagnosis and the latest minimally invasive surgical and nonsurgical therapies for joint pain and musculoskeletal conditions such as fractures, ACL tears of the knee and shoulder dislocation.
Count on AdventHealth for exceptional orthopedic medical expertise, technological resources and a comprehensive, multidisciplinary environment. We can help you heal in body, mind, and spirit. Schedule an Appointment today.

How to Set Up a Center of Excellence
The term “Center of Excellence” is becoming increasingly popular among businesses and a number of organizations are setting up these departments. But what is the purpose of a Center of Excellence?

This guide will explain the 1) basics of a Center of Excellence and the 2) benefits of establishing one in your organization. We’ll also provide you a 3) detailed plan on how to set up a Center of Excellence in three steps to guarantee your organization will reap the benefits.
WHAT IS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (COE)?
The primary aim of any business is to become a successful enterprise that reaches goals efficiently. In order to do so, businesses often establish a set of pragmatic principles guiding the management team. However, striving for this type of excellence is often easier said than done.
To improve efficiency businesses have began setting up Centers of Excellence (CoE). These can also be referred to as “competency centers” or “capability centers”.
The definition of a CoE states that they are a group of people leading the organization and its different structures in a specific focus area towards pre-determined goals. Hence, the aim of a CoE is to improve expertise in a certain area and make the most of its resources to help the business to improve.
CoEs provide a focal point for knowledge management, with the overall goal being the ability to capture new knowledge and practices from inside and outside of the business.
Whilst in the corporate world, CoEs tend to be a single business unit, organizations working in the field of science and academia can set up CoEs as a cross-organizational project. For example, the Anna Freud Center of Excellence works in the field of youth mental health and involves a range of organizations, such as Yale and UCL.
It’s crucial to understand how a CoE differs from other business departments and centers, as the “excellence” term can be misleading.
CoEs aren’t supposed to be better than the other operational departments within the business. But instead of focusing on performing operational tasks, the aim of the CoE is to find the best practices and to disseminate them to the other departments.
Watch the below video the understand an example of setting up a CoE in the focus area of Business Process Management (BPM):

The core aspects of CoEs
There are three core aspects to CoEs: the team of the center, the particular focus area of the center, and the purpose of the center.
The team of the center
CoEs are built around a team or a group of people, who can be hired either from outside the company or be employees of the business. The team members can continue to hold other positions in the business and work in the role either full-time or part-time.
Therefore, CoEs can be either an on-going part of the business or a temporary setup. For instance, a business might choose to set up a CoE in the event of a new technology adaptation.
The particular focus area of the center
CoEs tend to be built around a specific focus area. This could be any area relevant for the company and of particular importance for the business.
The typical focus areas include:
Technology – the adaptation of a new technology system or simply the study of a new technology as a means to improve the business.
A business concept – the introduction of a business concept such as BPM.
Skill – improvement and utilization of a new skill such as certain management practices.
Other broad area of study – for example workplace equality.
The purpose of the center
Depending on the focus area of the CoE, it can have a wide range of purposes. The main goals and responsibilities of CoEs include the following:
providing research,
supporting the organization,
offering guidance,
providing training and oversight of the employees,
governing the organization through appropriate resource allocation.
In which cases do companies set up a CoE?
Let’s look at the events that might lead to a company implementing a CoE. The center can operate in a number of focus areas. Since the aim of CoEs is to lead the organization towards a better understanding of the particular area, the establishment often involves either:
the implementation, management and use of a new technology or
the adaptation, management and use of a new or particular skill or concept.
For example, a company might set up a CoE for business intelligence and use it as a means to gain insight into different areas, such as products, customers and market initiatives. The goal would be to conduct research on the best business practices, help the company implement them and ensure the organization takes full advantage of the new strategies.
On the other hand, a company might want to set up a CoE during the adaptation of new accounting software. The goal could be to find the best software, support the organization during the implementation process and provide training to employees.
Dig deeper into some use cases for which a center of excellence is set up.

The benefits of CoEs
Before venturing into the steps an organization must take in order to set up a CoE, it’s essential to understand the benefits of creating one. In short, CoEs can improve business practices and guarantee success.
Furthermore, the proper creation of a CoE can guarantee a company:
uses its resources in a more efficient way,
provides quality services and products to customers,
reduces the costs of running the business by eliminating inefficient practices and by cutting the time required for implementation of new technologies and skills.
Therefore, CoEs can be essential in the development and measurement of business success. It can help a company achieve consistency, as well as reduce complexity.
3 STEPS TO ESTABLISHING A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE
Business shouldn’t take the implementation of a CoE lightly, as mistakes during the setting up can lead to inefficient practices.
In order to gain the benefits of a CoE, organizations must take the time and follow these three steps.
Step 1: Define strategy and vision
The crucial part of creating success is to define the strategy and vision of the CoE. Without a clear strategy and a vision, it’s unlikely the CoE will improve the business.
In order to guarantee success, you should create a charter for your center. This would be the mission statement of your CoE. Therefore, you should:
Think about the purpose of the center. What is the reason for establishing the center? Are you building the center to focus on a technology, a business concept, a skill, or something entirely different?
Establish the purpose of the center before you move forward. This will help clarify the governance of the center, as well as the strategy.
Think about the goals of the center. What exactly is the center trying to achieve? Are you looking to ease the implementation of a new process, research a new method or perhaps improve the business practices of an area?
You should have a clear set of goals the center is moving towards. By having a set of tangible goals, you can better measure the effectiveness and success of the center and ensure it doesn’t slide off course.
Think about the scope of the center. What are the issues the center will deal with? How far-reaching is the research or study going to be? What budget will be required and how many employees need to be part of the team?
By defining the scope of the center, you place restrictions on projects to guarantee you focus on the key areas of importance.
Furthermore, keep in mind the vision of the CoE should always align with your overall business strategy. You want the vision for the center to match the vision you have for the business.
Every CoE requires a set of operational standards. Since the focus of the center is to improve the management and operations of other aspects of the business, it would be unwise to set up the CoE without having a clear framework. By defining how the center is supposed to operate and what is expected of each individual, you guarantee a clearer, leaner and more efficient functionality.
Finally, you should outline the role of the center within the greater organization. This means the way it approaches other CoEs, either within the organization or in other companies. You should also consider its place in the wider community of SMEs and other such organizations.
Step 2: Secure funding
The second step involves the other important aspect of launching a CoE: the funding. Badly designed CoEs can end up costing the business more money than they bring benefits, so it’s important to pay attention to the funding structure of the center.
You should understand that while CoEs can help to reduce operational costs of a business, running a successful CoE isn’t for free. In the long-term, the funding issues might become easier, but at the start, you’ll need quite a bit of capital to get going.
In many instances, the senior management of the business will need to support the process, not only in terms of time but also in terms of money. The main question is whether the business can self-sufficiently run the CoE or if outside funding is needed.
In most instances, businesses are required to look for outside funding. A good starting point is to find partners for the project. You can look for suitable options in areas such as technology, education or other such related sectors that fit to your CoE’s focus. Ensure these partners have aligned interests and goals in mind before you start dealing with them. You don’t want to form a partnership with a business or an organization expecting different results from the project.
There’s no reason for CoEs not to operate with other companies. For example, the CoE could be set up as a Joint Venture of two or more companies.
Furthermore, depending on the purpose of your CoE, you might be able to find public funding. For example, if you are setting up a CoE for environmental protection, the government or other environmental agencies might be able to provide extra funding. This is also available for certain academic and scientific purposes.
Before you start dealing with the operational issues, you therefore want to create a budget plan. Include estimations regarding the salaries of the staff and the operational expenses. Don’t add any benefits of CoE (such as cutting the cost of new technology implementation) to these calculations.
Step 3: Make the center operational
Once you have defined the strategy and vision of the center and managed to organize the funding, you can start focusing on the operational side of running a CoE.
Five key areas of focus must be sorted out in order to establish a CoE. These include: staffing, governance, marketing, measurement of the performance, and the position of the center within the community.
Staffing
The first aspect of operations naturally involves finding the right personnel for your CoE. As mentioned in the first section, CoEs can either be staffed full-time or part-time. In addition, you can either hire completely new personnel for the center or reassign existing employees from other business units. The right approach depends largely on the purpose of your center, as well as its scope.
You need to hire people who are highly qualified and skilled for the required positions. If possible, previous expertise in CoEs can always be beneficial. But the most important thing is to identify the key skills required in order to achieve the objectives you laid out during the first step.
Governance
The best CoEs are agile, innovative and well governed. Therefore, you need to place governance structures at the heart of the operations. CoEs should have as little red tape and bureaucracy as possible. The purpose of these centers is to find the best practices and this often requires a much more relaxed governance approach compared to operational units.
On the other hand, the center’s inner governance structure must be clearly laid out. There should be clear accountability and role structures in the center. This ensures employees are aware of the expectations and requirements they need to fulfill.
Ensure the center has plenty of support. Every member of the team must feel able to operate in an efficient and effective manner, without having to deal with operational problems and bureaucratic obstacles. It makes sense if a member of the board of directors is overseeing the center, in order to guarantee high level support within the organization.
Marketing
Businesses shouldn’t hide their CoEs from the public. In fact, you should be marketing the center at every opportunity, as this can help to achieve goals quicker and help to find additional funding.
Most key areas of CoEs can directly benefit other similar organizations. Just as you would ideally form partnerships with other companies, you should also market the center to these organizations while in operation.
The knowledge gained by the CoE can provide an organization an additional revenue source. As the following section on the importance of community will show, CoEs shouldn’t be viewed solely as an internal department, but an opportunity to increase external reach of the organization.
Measurement of the performance
It is crucial to measure the performance of the center at all stages. When you are defining the goals, you also want to figure out how to measure them.
Every process within the business should be identified and categorized. This allows the team to find the inefficient processes and make changes to them.
Define the metrics that matter the most to your business success and find the tools to measure them. Having a business intelligence dashboard in place will make it easier to measure success. In case you don’t achieve your pre-defined goals, don’t hesitate to wind up your CoE before it consumes more resources.
Furthermore, since CoEs often aim at helping the business to implement a new skill or technology, it’s important to measure the success of the skill or technology as well. This can provide essential information for future adaptations and help the business improve its operations as a whole.
Focus on the community
Finally, you also want to focus on the community. Businesses operate in a wider culture and as well as adapting to the changes within the organization, they need to focus on the changes taking place outside of the business. CoEs need to be aware of the cultural and operational environment of the community to ensure it can react to external changes.
For example, you want to pay attention to how people interact with the business and whether changes within the business result in changes in consumer behavior.
Since the focus of CoEs tends to be knowledge management, businesses can be wary of sharing this information with the community or other businesses.
Yet, Tableau pointed out in an example of a CoE at UBS that community can help to “deal with problems quickly and encourage people doing innovative work”. Therefore, a community shouldn’t be seen as a hindrance to a CoE, but rather an opportunity to learn more and benefit the wider business culture.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Whilst the term CoE can be overused in the corporate world, businesses shouldn’t think they are just another business fad. There are real tangible benefits of setting up a CoE and it can streamline your business processes in a variety of ways.
However, you shouldn’t take the process of establishing the center lightly. In order to guarantee the success of your center, you must properly define its vision and strategies.
Furthermore, ensure the center has appropriate financing by negotiating partnerships and through continuous marketing.
Finally, focus on creating a lean management structure that provides knowledge throughout the whole of your organization.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered that a center of excellence, or CoE, is essentially a team or a department within an organization that focuses on a specific area to drive excellence and best practices. It could be related to technology, business concepts, skills, or even broader areas like healthcare or education.

So, the question is about why these centers of excellence often fail. To answer this, I need to understand the common reasons behind their failure. Maybe there are certain pitfalls that organizations fall into when setting up or managing these centers.

First, I should look into what makes a CoE successful, and then perhaps identify the opposite factors that could lead to failure.

From the search results, I see that CoEs are supposed to provide leadership, best practices, research, support, and training in their focus area. They are meant to be centers where expertise is concentrated, and from there, knowledge and best practices are disseminated throughout the organization.

One of the documents mentioned that CoEs can be temporary or ongoing, depending on the focus area and the goals set for them. For example, a CoE might be set up to manage the implementation of a new technology, and once that implementation is complete, the CoE might dissolve. Alternatively, a CoE could be a permanent part of the organization, continuously driving excellence in a particular area.

Looking back at the question, I need to think about why these centers might fail. Perhaps there are common mistakes made in their setup or operation that lead to their ineffectiveness.

Let me consider the three steps outlined in one of the search results for setting up a CoE:

1. Define strategy and vision

2. Secure funding

3. Make the center operational

If any of these steps are not executed properly, it could lead to the CoE's failure.

Starting with the first step, defining strategy and vision: If the purpose of the CoE is not clearly defined, or if the goals are vague or misaligned with the organization's overall objectives, the center might struggle to make a meaningful impact. Lack of clarity in the center's role and responsibilities can lead to confusion among stakeholders and team members, resulting in inefficiency and ineffective use of resources.

Secondly, securing funding is crucial. Without adequate financial support, the CoE might not have the necessary resources to carry out its functions effectively. This could include insufficient budget for hiring skilled personnel, lacking essential tools and technologies, or not being able to invest in training and development programs.

Lastly, making the center operational involves several key areas, such as staffing, governance, marketing, measuring performance, and engaging with the community. Problems in any of these areas could hinder the CoE's success. For instance, poor governance structures could lead to mismanagement, while inadequate performance measurement could prevent the identification of areas needing improvement.

Moreover, from the search results, I see that CoEs are supposed to be agile and innovative, with a focus on knowledge management and dissemination. If the center becomes bureaucratic or isolated from the rest of the organization, it might fail to achieve its intended impact.

Another potential reason for failure could be resistance from other parts of the organization. If departments or teams feel threatened by the CoE or do not see the value it brings, they might resist adopting the best practices or integrating the center's initiatives into their workflows.

Additionally, the success of a CoE often depends on the caliber of its team members. If the center is not staffed with highly skilled and motivated individuals, it may not be able to drive the desired improvements.

Sustainability is another factor. Some CoEs are set up for specific projects or initiatives and may not have a long-term vision. Once the initial project is completed, without a clear path forward, the CoE might lose its purpose and dissolve, possibly before achieving its full potential.

Also, over time, the focus area of the CoE might evolve, and if the center does not adapt to these changes, it could become obsolete or less relevant.

Communication is key in any organizational initiative, and CoEs are no exception. Poor communication between the CoE and other parts of the organization can lead to misunderstandings, misalignment of efforts, and ultimately, failure to achieve the intended outcomes.

External factors could also play a role. For example, changes in the industry, technological advancements, or shifts in organizational priorities might render the CoE's focus area less critical, leading to its decline.

Furthermore, in some cases, CoEs might be perceived as redundant if similar functions are already being performed by other departments. This overlap can lead to confusion and inefficiency, potentially causing the CoE to fail.

In summary, there are multiple reasons why centers of excellence might fail, including unclear strategy, insufficient funding, poor operational setup, resistance from the organization, lack of skilled personnel, sustainability issues, failure to adapt to changes, communication breakdowns, and organizational overlaps.

To provide a more concrete answer, perhaps I should look for specific examples or case studies where CoEs have failed and analyze the reasons behind their failures.

10 Examples of Bad Architecture, and why
8 Mins Read
Vitruvius believed that “Good Architecture” was based on 3 principals that were essential for a successful structure. Firmitas defined the durability and longevity of a structure, Utilitas stressed on the need for a functional building that served its purpose and Venustatis indicated the aesthetics of the building and the beauty that had the power to astonish and delight its audience. While an Architect’s priorities may differ with their respective styles and preferences, all three elements are kept in mind and are essential while designing. Complete disregard of any of the 3 may result in undesirable consequences, incur unwarranted losses, and would be an example of a structure that has failed.
Given below are 10 examples of Architecture gone bad:
1. Lotus Riverside Complex, Shanghai
The Residential Complex built in the Minhang District of China originally consisted of 11 13-storeyed towers. Construction began in 2007 and was completed prematurely in 2009 due to the constant political agendas and economic pressures. The same year, block 7 of the complex collapsed, taking the life of a construction worker on site and around 120 families were shifted to hotels by the local government. Foundation failure was said to be the primary cause of the fall and investigations showed that an underground garage was being excavated on the south side of the building. The soil excavated was dumped on the north side which caused a sudden increase in soil pressure aggravated by heavy rainfall prior to the fall. The pile foundation that snapped caused the building to topple entirely but almost all windows remained intact.

2. Aon Center, Chicago
Aon Center, located in Chicago is the tallest marble-clad skyscraper in the world with 43,000 slabs of Italian Marble and stands at a height of 1136 ft. An aesthetically pleasing and ethereal structure, the building is known for its facade. But the facade is also the primary reason for its failure. A 350-pound slab of Carrara marble broke off during construction and punctured the roof of the adjacent Prudential Tower. The marble slabs used for the facade cladding were much thinner than the required thickness and a few years after its opening, numerous cracks were found on the slabs and the facade had to be redone using white Mount Airy Granite which proved to be very costly for the investors.

3. Ryugyong Hotel, Pyongyang
A quote by Brenda Laurel justifies the reason for the failure of Hotel Ryugyong. “A design isn’t finished until someone is using it”. Ryugyong Hotel holds the Guinness World Record for being the tallest structure in the world to remain unoccupied. Construction of this 1080 ft. tall pyramid-shaped hotel began in 1987 and was delayed multiple times due to political and economic crises. It was first scheduled to open in 2012 on the birthday of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung, but remains unopened to date. Now known as the “Hotel of Doom”, the structure is used as a grand backdrop for cultural functions and as a screen that displays propaganda messages with led lights.

4. Walkie Talkie, 20 Fenchurch Street
Commonly known as the Walkie Talkie Tower, due to its unique shape, this commercial skyscraper has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. It was awarded the Carbuncle Prize for the worst new building a year after its opening. Initially criticized for its aesthetics and planning, it was soon evident that the Walkie Talkie tower did not respond well with the weather conditions too. It was responsible for creating a strong draught on the street below and its concave shape created solar glare problems causing the body works of the cars to melt, hence giving it the name, “Fryscarper”. The much-awaited “sky garden” was also compared to an airport and was considered a disappointment.

5. Longaberger Company Offices, Newark
The Longaberger Company is known to sell and manufacture handmade maple wood baskets and other household products. It was the wish of the founder to have all his office buildings in the shape of a basket. Mimetic Architecture is not known for its popularity among architects and often leaves an odd impression on its visitors. The “Basket Building” was soon abandoned by its owners and they stopped paying property taxes. It was purchased by another developer who soon decided to put it up for sale but due to a lack of buyers, they decided to renovate it into a luxury hotel to salvage the structure.

6. Ray & Maria Stata Center, MIT
Gehry’s Academic Complex for MIT opened with mixed reactions from the critics and visitors. Some acknowledged the designer’s creative illustration and declared it to be one of Gehry’s finest works, others called it a disaster. Dangerously angled columns and walls looked like it would fall any minute and left its visitors with an uneasy feeling. Moreover, the random use of materials and geometry gave it an unfinished look that seemed like the designer did not put much thought into it. While An individual’s opinion on aesthetics can differ based on their preference, the building’s failure is based on its delayed timeline, inflated budgets and MIT’s lawsuit against the designer for faulty design decisions that continue to cause leakage and drainage issues.

7. Millennium Tower, San Francisco
The 58 storeyed Mixed-Use structure primarily used as a residential tower was reported to be sinking and tilting like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Investigation showed that the building had sunk 16-inches and had a 2-inch tilt at the base and a 6-inch tilt at the top. Several Lawsuits followed and within 2 years the building had sunk 2 inches deeper and tilted up to 14-inches. Residents complained of creaking and popping sounds and discovered cracks on windows that were supposed to be hurricane resistant. Underpinning was suggested as a solution and the renovations are estimated to reach around $ 100 million.

8. Zizkov Tower, Prague
The 709 ft. high Television Tower built in Prague was unanimously considered as one of the ugliest buildings in the world and with its hi-tech style and overpowering height, the locals resented it for disturbing their conventional traditional skyline. The tower is said to be located over a cemetery causing the locals to despise it more for disrespecting the buried. Several nicknames emerged that discredited the structure and it only gained back some reputation when 10 copper baby sculptures were added to it, which presumably made the structure more humane.

9. Kemper Arena, Kansas
The Kemper Arena, currently renamed as the Hy-Vee arena was a 19,500-seat sports arena before it got converted into a youth sports arena. It won several architectural awards and had multiple popular tenants but the roof of the stadium collapsed after heavy winds and rainfall. The collapse was caused due to miscalculation of the strengths of structural members and a sagging phenomenon caused due to drainage issues. The problems were rectified immediately after the disaster and reopened a year later.

10. John Hancock Tower, Boston
200 Clarendon Street also known as “The Hancock” is known for its elegant minimalistic features and structural failures. Problems emerged during the excavation stage itself, with warping walls and mudslides that damaged utility lines. Large window panes came crashing down due to oscillation and thermal stress. Residents of the upper floors suffered from motion sickness as the building swayed due to wind pressures. Seismic Dampeners and steel bracings were installed to avoid this and around 10,344 window panes were replaced to avoid further mishaps.

Failure to Greatness - 5 Examples of Learning from Mistakes - Curtin Careers, Employment & Leadership
Failure to Greatness – 5 Examples of Learning from Mistakes
October 20, 2015																by Curtin CEL Team
The following people view failure as a place to keep improving, to them the only way is up.
Steve Jobs
“Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.”
In 1985, Jobs was fired from the company he created. It gave him the opportunity to reassess and start from scratch with new projects such as NeXT and Pixar. Eventually, he re-entered Apple and became CEO, showing that passion can be stronger than failure.
Soichiro Honda
“My biggest thrill is when I plan something and it fails. My mind is then filled with ideas on how I can improve it.”
He was the first Japanese car manufacturer to be inducted into the Automobile Hall of Fame, but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. For more than four decades he battled with failures, adversities, and bankruptcy, even rejection from Toyota.
Oprah Winfrey
“Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another stepping stone to greatness.”
Oprah was fired as a television reporter then became one of the most successful women in television. She launched OWN network in January 2011, and after one year its very low ratings suggested the network might close. In 2012, OWN had a major brand shake-up and is still operating in 2015.
JK Rowling
“It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.”
JK Rowling was rejected 12 times before her hugely successful Harry Potter books were published. She says she was as poor as you could be without being homeless. Her hard work and devotion to her idea paid off and she is now one of the wealthiest women in the world.
Walt Disney
“When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable.”
Walt Disney was told that he wasn’t creative enough. His business Laugh-O-Gram went bankrupt. He essentially had hit rock bottom until he found success with Mickey Mouse in Steamboat Willie. His next success was with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; it was the first ever full length animated film and won eight Oscars.

5 Teams That Failed to Stay Afloat (And What Sank Them)
5 Teams That Failed to Stay Afloat (And What Sank Them)
Blog
5 Teams That Failed to Stay Afloat (And What Sank Them)
Business Leadership
Team Building
Cheating, failure to innovate, and heated conflicts.
These are just a few of the reasons behind some teams’ failure to thrive.
Inevitably, people will disagree and something will need to change, even on high-performance teams. However, if a business can lead its teams to find solutions rather than further discord, making it through the tough times (and learning from them) is more likely to lead to success than insolvency.
Here are five examples of formally high-performing teams that failed to thrive (and the reasons for their ultimate downfall).
1) LA Lakers
Let’s face it: Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant never hit it off. After the LA Lakers won three straight NBA championships from 2000–2002, these two uncompromising, Type-A players were paired up—and the team was never the same.
Unfortunately, the strained pairing was just the beginning of the LA Lakers’ slow demise. Bad trades were negotiated and good ones fell through. Players got injured and then healed too slowly. Coach clashes and backlashes took place over and over again. All of these situations resulted in a high turnover of both players and coaches.
A team simply can’t thrive in an environment of contention, frustration, selfishness, and uncertainty. It’s still possible to turn a team like this around, but only if cooperation, teamwork, and true leadership become the team’s true values once again.
2) Enron
Named “America’s Most Innovative Company” by Fortune Magazine for six years in a row, Enron was once a sweetheart of the Nasdaq.
The all-too-familiar story of greed and deception resulted in over 20,000 of Enron’s employees losing their jobs, their healthcare, and approximately $1.2 billion in 401k savings.
Since then, what has happened to those responsible for Enron’s remarkable fall from grace? Several of the top executives behind the scheme landed themselves in prison and one has died of a heart attack.
3) Borders Books
For years, Borders Books pretended the book industry wasn’t changing. Even when the company finally realized they needed to hop on the online-book-selling bandwagon, they relinquished control and redirected their customers to Amazon.com instead of starting their own online presence.
The need for online sales wasn’t the only realization that came too late for Borders Books. They also waited way too long to get their e-books to market and invested way too much into the CD-sales game—and just as digital music was coming of age. It seemed Borders was always lagging too far behind “the next big thing,” and when that was coupled with their high debt, they had no choice but to close their 659 stores and send their customers elsewhere.
4) Oldsmobile
Originally a true American icon, Oldsmobile was founded in 1897 and continued to manufacture its models for more than a hundred years. Considered GM’s innovation brand, Oldsmobile
Patented the first gasoline-powered vehicle
Was first to use chrome-plated trim
Introduced the fully automatic transmission
Had the first high-compression overhead valve V-8
Introduced front-wheel drive
Was the first to offer airbags as an option
After boasting all of these firsts, how exactly did Oldsmobile lose so much ground? Innovation halted. Design flatlined. And as both the American public and foreign auto companies began to prioritize fuel efficiency, Oldsmobile ignored it. When it comes right down to it, the company simply abandoned their core philosophy of revolutionizing the automobile.
5) Sears
We know it’s not dead yet, but Sears is in serious trouble. Fewer than 1,500 stores remain (out of the 2,073 in existence five years ago) and more are being considered for the chopping block. In fact, Sears Holdings has warned its investors that it can’t promise it will stay in business for the long term.
Decades before the internet, millions of Americans shopped from home using the Sears Catalog. However, in 1999, Sears began to suffer; low-price competitors and big-box home-improvement stores began to take their toll. And then, of course, came the online retailers.
Sears is not alone. Brick-and-mortar retail stores all over the U.S. are filing for bankruptcy. The CEO of Urban Outfitters, Richard Hayne, gives his opinion about why this is happening: “Our industry, not unlike the housing industry, saw too much square-footage capacity added in the 1990s and early 2000s. Thousands of new doors opened and rents soared. This created a bubble, and like housing, that bubble has now burst.”
So how did Sears respond to these challenges? Instead of investing in the Sears brand, they chose to cut marketing budgets and close stores.
What These Teams Needed
There are numerous ways each of these teams’ troubles could have been turned around well before tragedy struck. After all, their hardships are not unique among businesses. All they really needed to do was learn from the mistakes of others. But they didn’t.
For businesses to truly excel, executive-level leadership needs to foster a climate of high-performance teamwork, lead groups to solutions, and lead from a united, forward-thinking, and morally sound place. With those values at the forefront, leaders, teams, and companies will thrive.

5 Famous Buildings That Have Serious Architecture Failures
Nobody is perfect, and some of the world’s most famous architects are here to prove it. They have created architectural masterpieces that were So Unusual They Raised Controversy, but in other cases, the beauty faded, or in other words, failed. They should contribute to solving human problems and making architecture “Humane”.
It would seem that some architects tend to mess up on some basic yet serious flaws, on their way to creating unprecedented icons. While they believe they are achieving the closest thing to perfection, there comes the problem from the corner they would least expect. Sometimes the problem might even be one’s initiated by structural defects rather than architectural, but no one cares about the details. The building remains entitled to its designing architect, regardless if it is good or bad.
Here are Examples of Marvelous Architecture Designed by Famous Architects:
1.Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry
© Gehry Partners, LLP
Before Gehry was commissioned to design the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, he had designed the iconic Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Its lustrous titanium foldings were so attractive, that he proposed something similar for the Disney Concert Hall and it was accepted with much enthusiasm. However, sometime after the landmark was constructed, a problem that was not faced with Bilbao’s museum has surfaced. The curved metallic cladding that enveloped the concert hall was way too reflective.
The concave surfaces received the burning sun rays and reflected them to the neighboring houses, causing glare and a significant rise in temperature. The adjacent streets, also, suffered from glare which has raised risks for traffic accidents. After the problem was discovered, Gehry and his team had no option but to analyze the façade, spot the problematic panels, and sandblast them to prevent unwanted reflection.
That operation cost about $180,000. Also, The Los Angeles Philharmonic, Google Arts & Culture, and media artist Refik Anadol have partnered up to create digital art that will light up the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
2.Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright

That charming house that you have heard so much praise about as a student of architecture and thought how it looked like something out of a fairy tale, well, it was not ‘magical’, and here is proof. While a house hovering above waterfalls sounds so dreamy, the modernist pioneer seemed to neglect how destructive humidity can be. The owner of the house Edgar Kauffmann faced a serious mildew problem not long after the troublesome construction process was completed. The remarkable cantilever that extends above the waterfall started deforming before the construction was over, and 50 years later there was a plain obvious 7” deflection.
Also, two large cracks showed up on the parapet of the terrace as soon as the construction framework was removed. Now the house which is kept as a museum is being restored and conserved by the Pennsylvania Conservancy. Metal trusses were added to support its failing cantilever. Regardless of all its faults, Fallingwater remains a celebrated masterpiece of modern architecture.
3.Palau de Les Arts Reina Sofia by Santiago Calatrava
The Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia by Santiago Calatrava
The world’s highest Opera House in Valencia’s City of Arts and Sciences, is 74-meter-high, with fourteen floors above the ground and three below the ground, housing four auditoriums. Its complicated form that seems to be leaning towards one direction and the flying curve above reveal Calatrava’s distinct style. However, there has always been the argument that this very distinctive style tends to be disastrous at times, and this specific building, unfortunately, supports the argument.
The building’s first misfortune was when the performance stage of the main hall collapsed. That was followed later by water flooding the interior and ruining the electric equipment, and last but not least, the mosaics covering the roof started to fall out. After each and every one of these problems, the building had to be closed for safety issues, and the last problem had the authorities, finally, file a lawsuit against the Spanish starchitect.
4.Westside Bruennen by Daniel Libeskind
via Daniel Libeskind
The Westside shopping and entertainment center is an urban-scale project along a major highway, leading to the city of Bern. The project was designed by Libeskind to be a landmark and a celebrated gateway to the city. Its architecture is quite remarkable, indeed, just like all the Libeskind designs that seem to be soaring into the sky with the most peculiar angles. You would wonder at his genius, but deep down you would worry that the incredible building might just fall on your head— and this sort of happened in Westside Brunnen.
The gypsum board ceiling has collapsed twice, once above a fast food outlet and the other time above an indoor swimming pool, and unfortunately, that second time has resulted in three injuries.
5.Guangzhou Opera Center by Zaha Hadid
© Iwan Baan
We might need to relieve the late architect from the mistake here before we begin. Her masterpiece in the Chinese city of Guangzhou has dazzled all the viewers with ultra-modern grandeur, the intriguing geometry, and the starry-sky-like ceiling of the Opera House’s main auditorium. You have probably wished upon witnessing this delightful masterpiece to attend a concert there, but you might actually change your mind now. One year after the opening, the building has been facing a serious case of falling glass.
That is in addition to the surfacing of numerous cracks in the walls and ceilings. The problem here is probably the inappropriate choice of materials by the contractors—not entirely the architect’s fault. This might be a just predictable consequence of what might be called “mass production” in China; something that has extended to the field of construction and architecture, as well.
These are just a few examples of many other failures which prove that all those brand names that seem far from reach are after all humans. They are grounded by what ground you, and they definitely make mistakes. However, learning from these mistakes is how they come to rise.

Sameera,
Six Sigma never fails! It may be possible ,however, that the initiative fails to meet all its stated objectives. Now to expand my reply further:
Six Sigma can be and is used by organizations in three different ways- 1)At the tactical level 2) As a strategy (strategic level) and 3) To transform the organization completely (Cultural change)
Now all the great examples that you get to hear e.g. Motorola, Allied, GE and similar others are all examples of Six Sigma which started as a strategy (Motorola to reduce defects/ GE to increase customer focus and leadership development) and then became almost cultural for these organizations!
Some companies fail to continue the initiative beyond the tactical level whereby they train some staff, get some projects done and then falter on the way to convert the whole organization in Six Sigma way.
There are many and I have seen two myself from very close. (I would not like to mention their names as this would not be proper in  my view.) What we must look at though is to find out the key factors which are responsible for such occurences. In both the examples that I have witnessed the one and the main reason was that the Top Leader changed within a year of launch and the new leader did not take up Six Sigma as his top priority. There are many other factors and in case you are interested go over to the Culture Evolution section of this site and you will find a lot of info there!

One that springs to mind is Ford. Other automotive companies that have attempted SS with limited success are: Landrover and Jaguar.
By way of contrast, Toyota goes from strength to strength, although they recently expressed some concern that some of their ‘old hands’ are retiring soon.
More generally, it is well known that Motorola is in a bit of a mess and their mobile phones have one of the worst reputations for reliability.

I have to wonder what kind of measurement system was used, how was the hypothesis tested, and what’s the p value, etc. I don’t mean to be a stickler. I do it too. How do we balance the importance of using actual data vs the ease of recognizing what is obvious (to us)?

My little experience tells me that SS dramatically fails whenever its used only as career driver
This is typical of those organizations where SS is not introduced because of a precise need of improvement, but is imposed . This is typical f some multinationals towards their acquisitions
In many cases BB and MBB are chosen among those employees whose contribution to the office activity is not fundamental, and this happens when the managers are poorly trained and have never carried out a SS project
In these cases it is very easy to close meaningless projects where the focus is only on financial benefits that nobody will never be able to measure

Andy,
I’m curious about your assessment on Ford – what before/after metrics are you using to assess Ford a failure rating regarding Six Sigma?  They have been making improvement in current costs using SS, and the DFSS portion will only start to be reflected in the new products coming out in ’05.  Current business losses come from deeply ingrained management and process shortcomings that SS could not remove in the 5 short years since it started, so why do you call SS a failure so soon?  Do you have knowledge of Ford abandoning SS in any measurable way?

As Fer pointed out, anyone can claim cost savings; especially in processes where there is considerable autocorrelation. Put simply, a Ford car is not a quality product, as many previous customers have found out.
By way of contrast, a Toyota is worth every penny.

Six Sigma at Ford appears to be without the CEO’s involvement.  That itself spells out sort of failure.  Besides, there appears to be a rift between the Green Belt and Black Belts. At Ford, Six Sigma has been considered as a 5-step process improvement methodology comared to its 8-D process.  These are just soem symptoms.

Andy,
You didn’t answer my question with metrics.  You could say “limited success” like Jaguar, and I would buy that, but you can’t call the current on-going SS program at Ford a failure without defining failure and providing data.  Many automotive experts rate the Focus – which has the benefit of many SS projects – to be one of the best automotive values out there. Judge better when the new Mustang and Ford 500(the quality, not the styling) come out – they were born during the beginnings of SS, so they should be a better indicator of SS impact.You know, my last 2 GE major kitchen appliances, and my GE cordless phone were pieces of cr*p – that doesn’t make SS at GE a failure.

Hi
I was thinking about ford. And maybe Ford are deliberate building in defects with their products like their cars falling apart after five years or are out of date before they hits the streets using Six Sigma. Myth or truth? I was told a long time ago the some American companies build failure in their products after a number of years so the customer would have to buy again providing more revenue for the supplier.
I think one could use anti Six Sigma to achieve this revenue seeking goal.
I for my part have never owned American car only German and I am currently a BMW owner.

Jim,
Your point about metrics is well-taken. However, it seems to me that you are using a very tired SS argument – ‘just wait until you see the results of our programme.’
By way of contrast, Motorola’s ‘original’ Six Sigma program was not as pedantic or inflexible, and they achieved their goals in 1987 – in just three years – and just in time for Dr. Harry to take credit! The ‘original’ method included Shainin Techniques, Taguchi Methods, and Multivariate Data Analysis, and we did not suffer the ignominities of Y=F(X) or DPMO.
One of the reasons that Ford will not be successful is because the Ford Production System (sic) does not use the ‘one-by-one confirmation’ of TPS. This implies that component ‘matching’  will remain a problem – irrespective of any apparent process improvements and claims of ‘savings.’ (Jigging components into ‘matching’ groups is not consistent with ‘modern SS,’ so these are the types of defects will continue to underlie various ‘reliability’ problems.)
You might find the following links of interest:
http://www.auto.com/industry/iwirc5_20030305.htm ( you will have to read this carefully as it suggests ‘cost savings’ but admits poor quality
http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3165/is_2001_Dec_1/ai_80494687
With regard to Landrover, their difficulties have been described in the press recently, and Jaguar are suffering a similar fate.
Six Sigma is not a complete quality system and is in need of some improvement. Lean (TPS Jidoka) and Six Sigma (natural process capability) are the antithesis of each other, which is why we need to understand the apparent contradiction, rather than trying to blend to two together.

Andy

The last time I was in Munich, I met my friend’s downstairs neighbour – a very friendly German couple. She had recently been laid off by Siemens Balanstrasse and he from BMW, which was a really unfortunate as those apartments don’t come cheap.
Anyway, he told me that he used to work in the BMW ‘model shop’ – where they ‘shape’ new car designs. When I asked him how many employees were up there he told me 5,000. Well that bowled me over, and thinking that he might mean all departments on the site; I asked again and he confirmed the same answer!?

This was what I wanted to find out. The answer I got was that he didn’t, although he was familiar with the approach. What we jokingly agreed was that in a wind tunnel it was usually the shape of the radiator that determined the final shape of the whole car, which explains why so many different products have similar shapes.
Of course, since much of the design work is done on CAD, it is entirely possible that someone might use DOE.

Hi Andy
Thanks for your kindly response. The following is directed generally but feel free to answer.
If one were to use DOE in the design of a cars like BMWs, how many would there be? (Thousands?) And would you be able to use some off the other Six Sigma tools to manage the DOEs? Not just to manage the sheer volume also the relationship between DOEs and A macro view ensuring a good if not excellent design.

JP,
I’ve generally had a good experience using simulation. I am also an advocate of Taguchi Methods, which is just as well because that makes simulation straightforward, because one can use the ‘manufacturing variation’ as a combination noise design.
Let me give an example. One of the most successful projects I worked on was the design of a film handling system. This of course is what is known as a ‘sub-assembly.’ Therefore, my first step would be to breakdown a car into a number of ‘sub-assemblies and the investigate the ‘ideal function’ of each assembly. This corresponds to an investigation of energy transfer, or the transfer of work.
Now many argue that simulation is not accurate enough; but I believe that these days most software and even ‘cardboard models’ are accurate enough to investigate the technological fundamentals – especially when used in conjuction with DOE.
Once you have a design, one can always confirm a few cells with real sub-assemblies. This also offers the benefit of not having to run long and tortuous, mechanical MTBF studies. Once you know the ideal function, in my experience it can be tested relatively quickly. (We reduced a film handling system test time based on failure rates from six months to matter of weeks.)
In summary, breakdown the system into a number of sub-assemblies. Investigate the ‘ideal function’ of each sub-assmbly, and perform a ‘robust design’ on each sub-system – a condition where non-linearlity has been used to reduce variance transmission, and scaling has been used to minimise the proportion of variance.
If you choose this path, then you will not be unduly concerned about ‘sample size’ from the point of view of cost.

Andy

Dear Mr. Andy U, I agree with your (taguchi) approach. Your concise description of flow to be used is very clear.
Please, let me ask for your opinion on a different situation about Ford. Maybe you know that in EU Ford Focus was one of most awarded (reliability and design) and sold car of  last years (not so expansive) and Ford is now renewing it. Well, how do you explane, so different performances of different Ford’s branch ?

GC,
I believe that the Ford Focus came in second in class, behind Nissan’s Almera. The average repair bill for the Almera was £80 and £147 for the Focus, which tends to support your contention that the Focus is a good car.
It would certainly be interesting to find out what has contributed this its success – the implementation of SS, or the FPS.
I have seen some good work on breaking systems and other sub-assemblies by Ford engineers. My original comments were made to stimulate debate – do we really believe that SS is perfect and that all we have to do is gain senior executive support and then deploy it by ‘pushing’ it down people’s throats. I think not!

Andy

I’ve worked as a Tier 1 supplier product engineer for both Ford and the Honda/Toyota and I’d say myth.  Ford’s failures are a result of the way it develops and manufactures its products.
The difference between the two (from my experience) was that the Japanese had a much higher product standard than did Ford.  For example, the product supplied to the Japanese was required to pass a million cycles on a particular test, when we tried to market this same assembly to the American manufacturers, we were priced out of the market, because they only required 100,000 cycles.  Yet, the Japanese sold the vehicle at a profit, while Ford lost money on every unit of their competing product.
The product I worked on for Ford, for example, never passed its durability requirement, yet there was very little concerned expressed, because fixing the problem would drive up the cost.
The difference boils down to lowest possible cost, a lack of engineering discipline/attention to detail, short term thinking and a ‘hero culture’ on one hand and highly disciplined/regimented development with a focus on long term quality (making the best possible product will, in the long term, result in a competetive advantage and higher profitablility)on the other.
Don’t mean to trash Ford, just my experience.

Hi
An example of poor design in some of the earlier Ford models and may still apply to some current models I don¡¯t know, was the back door window would not roll all the way down making it extremely uncomfortable to rest ones arm on the open window. Even my Fathers small 1970 Toyota did not have that problem. Why would Ford cut corners like that? I noticed another problem in Ford Tempos was if you rolled down any window while traveling 60k plus any lose paper I.E. business documents would be sucked out the window. My friend learned the hard way when I was a passenger in his car I rolled the window down traveling on the busy 401 in Ontario and a pile of his critical documents shot out the window and became unrecoverable. He got very angry with me but I just said why did you buy a Ford? That would not happen in my VW Golf at any speed.
I suppose my question is how do Ford spec their VOCs and also how do they define the level of operability and functionality in their cars.

Having worked in the automotive industry, I think it is more accurate to say that all auto manufacturers build in obsolescence…and they build it in at different rates.  In my opinion, it is a stretch to say that they build in defects.  The technology exists to build cars (and parts) that could conceivably last 20 years with little maintenance, but the cost to design, engineer, and manufacture those cars (parts) would lead to a very small economic demand (who would pay $100k for a Focus?).  Parallel this with PC assemblers and PC reliability.
And yes, Ford’s success with Focus is due to both FPS and 6-Sigma.

How do you know that Ford’s success is due to FPS and 6-sigma? Do you have some inside information? The reason I ask is because I’m trying to figure out the relationship between GDT (geometric dimensional tolerancing) and 6-sigma design principles.
I am also curious why FPS requires 6-sigma, but TPS apparently does not? Is this likely to give Ford and advantage over Toyota sometime in the future. If so how?
Also, does the FPS use ‘one-by-one confirmation and does the line stop when a problem is found?
Thanks in anticipation.

Is it possible that Ford doesn’t want their vehicles to last more than say 100,000 miles?  Maybe they are banking on the fact that some customers don’t expect a car to last longer than 100K miles.  So why over design the vehicle?  Maybe the thought is that Ford feels there are still enough consumers out there that will only buy “American” so they can still get away with producing a less reliabel vehicle.
Just a thought…

Anyone care to bring the “Tucker” automobile into the picture?
My opinion, one of the major differences in the automotive industry is the way the VOC is perceived/accomplished.  While American companies want to rely on J D Powers statistics and looked at “style”, the Japanese and other Asians have listened for a long time to the real voice of what the real customer wanted, needed, and expected.  Proof of that, of course, was in the ’70s-’80s when the big three were still rolling “battleships” and “silk purses” off the assembly line and Toyota and Datsun began to take over the market with practical and reliable units, meeting the needs of the customer.
Preston Tucker was a visionary that set the stage for the future of automakers in the late ’40s, but was too eager to “force” his innovations into the marketplace.  Of course, the big three ate him alive then copied his “style” and introduced their versions when the time was right.
Ford, GM, and Chrysler still seem to “follow the leader” when it comes to innovation.  But they are still inept at understanding quality and reliability, opting for “sale-ability” instead.  The acquisitions, mergers, and joint ventures of the past few years have helped, but the “old dinosaurs” still have hard heads when it comes to major change in their thinking.
Of course, we can throw Lee Iococca into the mix as well…..
Just my opinion….. for what it’s worth…..

Andy U,
I know because I used to work at Ford – not on the engineering / mfg side of the house, but close enough to the people who were.  I will preface my remarks by stating that it has been several years since I was at Ford, so some of my comments may be out-dated.  I welcome corrections.
I can’t add much commentary to the GDT and 6-Sigma design – I’m much more familiar with Design than GDT.
It is my belief that FPS requires the 6-sigma addition because Ford does not have the extensive culture attached to continual improvement that Toyota does.  The TPS has had quality as a fundamental component to their processes for 40 years, Ford began it’s first real steps in the 80’s.  I don’t think the addition of 6-sigma into the FPS will give Ford an advantage.  The domestics are still playing catch-up in many areas – 6-Sigma will help Ford narrow the gap (if management stays out of the way), but it will not provide competitive advantage in the near future…in thte next 5-7 years anyway.  My rationale is that Ford management has not fundamentally committed to driving the appropriate metrics into the mfg and engineering worlds.  Most performance metrics are extremely heavy on the cost side, and the long-term implications continually dog their quality programs as a result.
FPS is flexible enough (in theory) to allow the line stoppages, but it is rarely ever done due to the ways in which plant managers are incentivized.

Thanks Ritz …
The only ex-Ford engineer I worked with tried to use SPC to monitor ‘process assembly times’ and sub-assembly defect categories!!! We dumped all that when we introduced Single-flow (Ikko Nagashi.)
More recently, I came across a company that manufactures plastic medical inhaler devices. Some of the components have to be formed with up to twenty four separate process steps, all dependent on the previous step. Then each of the components have to ‘match’ to obtain the correct interference and alignment. This is why I was interested in the relationship between GDT and SS. Although I like a challenge, I’m really glad that someone else got that contract!

So, from this search, I've found some examples of teams or companies that have failed, but I need to see if any of them are specifically related to centers of excellence.

Looking back at the first search results, I see that the concept of a center of excellence is broad and can be applied in various fields, including business, healthcare, education, and more.

Given that, I should look for examples of centers of excellence that have failed in their objectives. Unfortunately, the search results I have don't directly provide examples of CoE failures. Most of them discuss the benefits and how to set up a CoE, but not the failures.

Perhaps I need to adjust my search query to specifically look for cases where centers of excellence have failed.

Abstract and Figures
A BPM Center of Excellence (CoE) is a governance mechanism that is widely adopted by organizations aiming for a consistent and centralized roll-out of BPM initiatives. This Article debates and groups a list of services that could be offered by a centralized BPM Center of Excellence, and proposes three capability levels for the structured progression of the CoE offerings. The level of detail of analysis goes beyond previous proposals and facilitates the design of such a CoE according to different levels of BPM maturity.

Un BPM Center of Excellence (CoE) se puede definir como una unidad organizacional que presta servicios a las áreas gerenciales y de negocio para introducir mecanismos de gobernancia que permitan adoptar de manera consistente y centralizada las distintas iniciativas de BPM al interior de la organización [8] El equipo de profesionales que se enfrenta a un desafío de implementar un BPM CoE no necesariamente puede tener conocimientos en BPM y/o experiencia práctica en la implementación de este. Luego se vuelve una necesidad prioritaria disponer de una guía de trabajo o metodología que apoye su implementación y consolidación de la gestión de sus servicios hacia el interior de la organización.  ...
... Asím Akram, ejecutivo senior de Accenture's Process Architecture Group, describe el CoE como un puente importante entre las actividades de corto plazo de una estrategia y el largo plazo de una aproximación a BPM. Leandro Jesús, André Maciera, Daniel Karrer y Michael Rosemman [8] mencionan que "El análisis en detalle del framework para el BPM CoE, facilita el diseño de como este adquiere sus diferentes niveles de madurez en el tiempo. El uso del framework aún no tiene una validación empírica en la literatura consultada, sin embargo es un punto de partida para unidades de procesos, así como un modelo de referencia y benchmarking que cada organización debe adaptar a su realidad".  ...
... Para identificar la oferta de servicios que el BPM CoE desarrollará, se ha seleccionado el framework para BPM CoE de Leandro Jesús, André Macieira, Daniel Karrer y Michael Rosemann [8].

Effective BPG has to reinforce the strategic alignment among process management activities and business priorities (Jesus et al., 2009); therefore BPM practices are suggested to be aligned and integrated with the corporate governance and management systems (Doebeli et al., 2011). Based on these studies we assume BPG and ITG two distinct governance concepts, both a subset of the corporate governance of any given organization.  ...

Citicorp case study | Failure Case Studies
Citicorp case study
The case of William LeMessurier and the emergency repair of the Citicorp Center in New York City has been used by some as an example of ethical behavior by an engineer.   This point of view is described in:
Morganstern, J., The Fifty-Nine-Story Crisis, ASCE Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, Vol. 123, No. 1, Jan. 1997, also in the May 29, 1995, issue of The New Yorker
The abstract of the Morganstern paper states, “What’s an engineer’s worst nightmare?  To realize that the wind-bracing system he designed for a skyscraper like Citicorp Center is flawed – a hurricane season is approaching.  In 1978, William J. LeMessurier, one of the nation’s leading structural engineers, discovered after Citicorp Center was completed and occupied, conceptual errors pertaining to joint weakness, tension, and wind force.  Alarmed by the magnitude of the errors and the danger they presented, LeMessurier acknowledged the flaws, immediately drew up new plans and saw that all of the necessary changes to the braces were put into effect.  LeMessurier’s exemplary behavior – encompassing honesty, courage, adherence to ethics, and social responsibility – during the ordeal remains a testimony to the ideal meaning of the word, ‘professional.’ ”
The story is told much the same way at:
http://onlineethics.org/moral/LeMessurier/lem.html
Eugene Kremer takes a different view in his paper “(Re)examining the Citicorp Case: Ethical Paragon or Chimera” which may be found online at https://www.crosscurrents.org/kremer2002.htm
Kremer makes the following points, among others:
The Citicorp Tower should have been checked for quartering winds because building codes require consideration of the most severe loading case.
The decision to change welded joints to bolted joints was an important change that should have been considered more carefully.
LeMessurier had a duty to publicize the problem with the building.

Case Study - Creating a Learning Center of Excellence - The CARA Group
Our Impact
Creating a learning center of excellence
CARA helped a large insurance company architect a Learning Center of Excellence to ensure that agency training and development was aligned to critical business needs.
Challenge
The client, a large decentralized insurance firm, wanted to ensure more effective upskilling of its field-based agents. They also wanted to reduce redundant spending and duplication of efforts, modernize Learning and Development approaches, and leverage a consistent operating model. They needed to shift to a focus on results and relevance by developing new skills and capabilities, increasing knowledge retention, building communities, and improving agent performance.
Result
CARA provided a customized blueprint to achieve the goals of the organization. It provided a clear and detailed path forward for the client to create a modern, efficient and effective Learning Center of Excellence.
Solution
CARA’s solution included:
A recommended strategic direction and approach to launching a Learning Center of Excellence
Leading and benchmarked best practices and critical success factors to consider when launching these types of services within a large, distributed organization
Recommendations around strategy, structure, and processes
A learning measurement strategy that focuses on outcomes and application of learning on the job
An assessment of risks/issues and suggestions on how to manage them
A learning governance strategy to ensure alignment of efforts and return on investment
Operational process flows for executing the Learning Center of Excellence
Organizational Change Management Plan to ensure an effective implementation of the new department
The Story
A large insurance company was undergoing major shifts in its agency organization, including new roles and behaviors for agents, new processes and new technologies. Agencies didn’t have a single source to turn to for standardized training which resulted in redundant spending and wasted time. In addition, the corporate office was competing for the agents’ attention. With no clear structure for how or what they should learn, it was unclear how much the agents were learning and if the company was investing their training time and money wisely.
The head of agency training called CARA to get help figuring out how to approach these issues. One of CARA’s Learning Strategy consultants was assigned to the engagement. He began by working with the client to clearly define the goals and what they wanted the future state of a Learning Center of Excellence to look like.
Once the future state was defined, they met with key stakeholders, interviewed agents and took a deep dive into the processes that were in place to develop a good understanding of the current state. After the current and future state were defined, he was able to determine the gap that needed to be closed to get to the future state.
CARA’s consultant took a systematic approach to defining the steps to close the gap. He defined the critical elements for the Learning Center of Excellence and how they fit together. Creating this blueprint was like putting together a large jigsaw puzzle, making sure the elements fit together in a logical way. He had to constantly check the parts and make sure there were no overlaps or gaps in the approach and that the picture was clear to the client.
Not only did he create strategic guidance, he transitioned into the operational, creating process flows for how the Learning Center of Excellence would interact with the lines of business, including intake processes, design and development approaches, as well as review and results measurement.
Because this was an entirely new department for the client, the strategy also included key elements of an organizational change management strategy to identify the key stakeholders, understand what they needed to know and do to support the implementation of the department, and to ensure they were supported in being successful.
The CARA consultant finalized the project with a presentation to stakeholders that described a way to transform their Agency training operations into a modern, efficient and effective Learning Center of Excellence.

Hmm, none of these search results directly provide examples of centers of excellence that have failed. Most of them are about how to set up a CoE or case studies where CoEs have been successful.

I need to think differently. Maybe CoEs fail because of specific reasons, and understanding those reasons can help answer why they fail.

From the earlier search results, I recall that in one of the documents, it was mentioned that CoEs need strong leadership and support from the top management. If that support is lacking, the CoE might not succeed.

Also, in another document, it was suggested that CoEs can fail if there's resistance from other parts of the organization or if there's overlap with existing departments.

Perhaps I should look into these factors in more detail.

Let me try to find articles or case studies that discuss why CoEs might fail.

8 Reasons to Consider a Center of Excellence

8 Reasons to Consider a Center of Excellence
Change Management | Project Planning and Management | Intelligent Information Management (IIM)
In my practice over the last year, I’ve been doing a lot of work helping clients create and manage centers of excellence (COEs), that is, a cross-functional body that brings together a group of people to focus on a single process area, business activity, or capability. Although there are lots of reasons why you might want to consider a COE, these eight are the ones I see most frequently in my day-to-day work.
To reduce knowledge management risk.
The main knowledge management (KM) risk organizations face boils down to this: At any organization, a large percentage of critical business information lives either exclusively in employees’ heads or in locations only they know about (or can access easily).
COEs help organizations address this challenge and reduce their KM risk by fostering knowledge-sharing through the division of a responsibility for a particular process area, business activity, or capability among more than one person; they also encourage employees to document their knowledge and publish it to a wider audience in policies and procedures, process diagrams, best practices, etc.
To improve the quality of service delivery.
Lots of factors can have a negative impact on the quality of service delivery to internal or external customers. Some key ones are the lack of a consistent process, unpredictable timeframes or costs, poor communication with customers, and lack of transparency.
COEs help to improve service delivery quality by encouraging and providing the mechanism for sharing knowledge, documentation, processes and procedures, data, resources, experience, and best practices across an organization.

To develop a core competency around a strategic capability for the enterprise.
For all sorts of reasons, organizations find it necessary to develop or improve core competencies. New technologies; fresh competition; mergers and acquisitions; the opening, closing, or shifting of markets – all require that an organization identify gaps in its enterprise capabilities and do what it takes to close them.
COEs can help an organization develop strategic capabilities by fostering the intake of new knowledge and the sharing of that knowledge enterprise-wide, by bringing together a diverse collection of subject matter experts from different functional areas to work together, and by elevating the capability they are organized around from a collection of local, siloed, ad hoc efforts, to a coordinated, enterprise-level, strategic one.
To foster professional growth and development among employees.
Organizations in every industry face the challenge of hiring and retaining top talent. Providing opportunities for growth is part and parcel of a successful strategy for employee retention.
COEs can contribute significantly to an employee retention strategy. They bring together employees from around the organization across functional, reporting, and geographic lines, providing the opportunity for employees from different levels to work together closely on a range of initiatives. They also provide the organization with a way to discover and nurture talented employees.
To overcome an overly vertical or siloed organizational structure.
As organizations become increasingly complex, both in terms of sheer size and global reach, the ability to create linkages between and across functions, geographical areas, and reporting hierarchies is critical to success – and this is precisely what a well-designed COE does for an organization.
To improve the relationship between IT and the business.
There are a number of reasons why IT may have a poor relationship with its business stakeholders, but a frequent culprit is a poor engagement model.
COEs can help improve the IT engagement model and the problems related to it first by shifting the ownership of the IT engagement model onto the wider organization. A COE provides a framework of policies, procedures, and processes that support improved interactions between all stakeholders precisely because it’s coming from a cross-functional, enterprise perspective, rather than just the IT perspective.
Second, starting a COE gives an organization the chance to “get it right” in terms of the IT engagement model – at least for the process area, business activity, or capability defined as in scope for that COE. From the first point of contact with a business customer to the release of an application to production, every step of the engagement model can be retooled to improve service delivery and customer satisfaction.
To rationalize delivery timelines for IT solutions.
The challenge of rationalizing delivery timelines is closely related to Reason #6 because it reduces unpredictability – and unpredictability has an extremely negative impact on the relationship between IT and the business.
A COE can help IT rationalize delivery timelines in a number of ways. First, as we’ve seen, a COE helps to improve the IT engagement model, which plays a big part in delivery timelines.
Second, COEs are in a distinctive organizational position to gather and analyze data about service delivery. They can collect metrics from the supply-and-demand side of the equation and from stakeholders across the organization, and then bring it all together as an independent body, representing a larger perspective than simply IT or an individual business. This cross-functional perspective, combined with its focus on a narrow set of products and services, allows a COE to predict better how long it will take to deliver its products and services than would otherwise be possible.
Because they work.
A COE can be used to address a wide range of organizational challenges, from department-specific to enterprise-wide. But in the end, perhaps the most compelling reason to consider a COE is that it gets the job done: bringing together a cross-functional group of stakeholders from all levels of an organization, giving them the space to focus their talents and expertise on a single process area, business activity, or capability. Allowing them to do so for an extended period of time is a pretty simple formula for success, no matter the organizational context. There are pitfalls, of course, but when given the right level of executive support, when its members are allowed time to work on its projects and initiatives, and when it’s been undertaken to address a valuable organizational goal, a COE can be a powerful force for organizational change.

What is a Center of Excellence?
At some point in their life cycle, most companies find it beneficial to develop a Center of Excellence (COE). The priorities of a COE span several areas, with different sponsors, and are expected to change over time. Nonetheless, the fundamental principles of the COE group should be clear and consistent, as these are critical to the COE’s continuous success and evolution.
A Center of Excellence is a (typically small) team of dedicated individuals managed from a common central point, separate from the functional areas that it supports within a practice or organization. Sometimes referred to as a competency or capability center, the COE is often the team leading the way in exploring and adopting new technology tools, techniques, or practices.
This group is designed to operate across areas within the practice or organization, with a focus on:
Providing thought leadership and direction
Establishing and promoting best practices
Research and development, to provide appropriate recommendations
Support and education
Performing other similar functions in specific focus areas considered critical to the success of the overall organization or practice that the COE supports
In addition to its core focus areas, the COE can also add value by contributing to:
Optimizing the organization or practice by centralizing resources with high-demand and unique knowledge or skills and streamlining their contributions across a wide range of areas
Improving ROI through the identification and development of reusable assets
Reducing delivery times, development, and maintenance costs by increasing efficiencies and leveraging reusable asset
Identifying and reducing duplication of effort across initiatives within the practice or enterprise
Developing and maintaining a catalog of reusable assets will add tremendous, and tangible value, and enable project teams to rely on proven, predictable results while avoiding common pitfalls.
Center of Excellence Success
As a key to success, every Center of Excellence should have a set of clearly and concisely defined guiding principles that will provide its direction and focus. We suggest these five areas as a starting point for establishing and successfully evolving a COE:
Standardization
Leveraging assets
Measuring performance
Guidance and governance
Balance and subject matter experts
Let’s take a closer look at each.
1. Standardization
At its core, the main purpose of a COE is to define and develop standards and best practices. This includes developing and documenting templates, blueprints, and repeatable processes and methodologies for all significant work efforts such as:
Estimating level of effort
Standardizing format of documentation and deliverables
Quality assurance
Testing and validation
Technical architecture maintenance
Performance monitoring and optimization
Program coding (standards and style)
General project and resource planning
These best practices should consist of a blend of documented and generally accepted industry standards, along with the COE’s own practical experiences and successes. Prioritizing to begin with the most significant and ubiquitous work, all efforts and products should be reviewed by the COE team and then categorized. General questions the COE should ask include:
Have we solved this issue in the past? If so, how?
What worked or didn’t work? What lessons did we learn?
Is there an industry standard that we can use as a baseline for comparative purposes?
To be successful, members of the COE need to be steadily in tune with the latest industry trends, established practices, and emerging thought streams. All of the members of the COE should be self-starters, who are interested in continuous learning and improvement of their skills and expertise.
Lastly, any artifacts produced by the COE are to be considered living documents. These documents can and will evolve, change, and in some cases become obsolete and in need of replacement, based on the evolving needs of the industry, as well as the COE itself acquiring new knowledge and experiences.
2. Leveraging Assets
The Center of Excellence team should strive to identify all of the usable assets that exist within the organization and the COE itself. These assets can be physical or intellectual, and typically include:
Human Assets These individuals or designated teams possess very specific or unique skillsets, deep and/or broad experience, and exude qualities that characterize the organization. Additionally, these people should have demonstrated an interest in contributing to the COE’s initiatives, as well as have (or manage) the time and availability to do so.
Relationships It is beneficial to include individuals inside or outside of the organization who have an influence in the industry. These key relationships may consist of specific customer or stakeholder contacts, vendor relationships and memberships, partnerships, and organized groups.
Code This includes actual program code, models or modules, design patterns, algorithms (possibly expressed only in pseudo-code), templates, tools, and utilities developed by the organization. These will provide the basis for repeatable, consistent coding practices throughout the organization.
Artifacts These are documents describing policies, guidelines, advice, industry best practices, organizational best practices, constraints, and considerations. Additional artifacts include documented results of past brainstorming, troubleshooting, and post-resolution review sessions.
Some of these assets may be obvious and easy to recognize, while others may only be revealed during actual project work.
These assets – whether intellectual or physical – must then be harvested or developed by the COE for use within the organization, and if unique and meaningful enough, be branded and introduced to the industry at large to generate revenue directly through sales or indirectly by establishing recognition.
These assets will play a key role in simplifying and improving the efforts and processes of the organization that the COE supports and will directly affect cost. Because of this, the COE needs to have the ability and the authority to continually inspect all current and past projects and deliverables, looking for sharable assets that can be beneficially leveraged throughout the organization in one or more ways.
3. Measuring Performance
As with any successful endeavor, the COE must develop the ability to track, measure, and report on the performance of the team’s initiatives across all areas of its efforts, as well as specific metrics within the organization itself. This is critical to the growth and evolution of the COE, since clearly demonstrating success will be a major factor in buy-in and support from stakeholders throughout the organization, particularly upper management.
All measuring relies on having an established baseline against which to compare performance. At the start of an initiative, the COE team must immediately identify and establish baselines for the work efforts being performed or to be performed. These baselines can be developed from internal organizational experiences, industry-accepted and published standards, or both. For deliverables to internal stakeholders, the COE should establish Service Level Agreements (SLAs), to define clearly and concisely what targets and thresholds are to be used to define a successful endeavor.
Measuring performance allows the COE to set expectations for current and new work, thus providing answers to certain key questions such as:
Are our design or resource presumptions reasonable? How do we know when things are “good enough” (point of diminishing returns)?
What are our areas of confidence (where we may have opportunities to increase profits or speed-up delivery times)? What are our risk areas (where we may need to pay closer attention to avoid losing time or increasing cost)?
How do we demonstrate to our customers or stakeholders that we met or exceeded the contracted requirements (SLAs)?
How do our results compare to similar efforts across the organization? Across the industry?
Measuring performance also allows the COE to re-engineer weaker or deficient areas through training, research, soliciting expertise from subject matter experts, or other means, thus leading to an increase in the overall quality of the COE. By doing this, the COE can market its strengths both internally, by securing further funding and support, and externally by driving sales through the demonstration of its products and publication of its documented successes as industry experts.
4. Guidance and Governance
In order to provide useful input, the COE should be aware of all significant work efforts in which the organization is currently involved, or which it has an interest in pursuing. The level of COE involvement with individual organizational work efforts will vary based upon many factors including:
The level of complexity of the planned work
The level of success that the organization has had with similar work
Resource availability (this is very important)
Guidance
It’s important for project managers to understand that COE member involvement in organizational work efforts will not include any actual development activities. Even given the most aggressive deliverables, the COE team members cannot be considered for completing project work.
The involvement of the COE needs to stay focused primarily in the areas of project acceleration and risk mitigation by providing guidance on proven practices and (when applicable) reusable components (sharable assets already identified or opportunities for developing such assets as part of the current work effort).
Governance
When it comes to the general approach, structure, and style of work efforts, the Center of Excellence team should possess the ability to not only guide and suggest but also to “govern” the work. This means that the COE should be positioned as the authority entity that will cast the deciding vote on any and all significant development or methodology decisions
5. Balance and Subject Matter Experts
When establishing a COE, it’s reasonable to expect that most teams will not be appropriately balanced when it comes to experience and skill levels. This results in the under- or overutilization of specific team members and subsequent decreases in the effectiveness of the team, as well as a diminishing of the “health and happiness” of the individual team resources.
To stabilize and balance the team’s utilization, effectiveness, and happiness, team “competency charts” should be established and maintained by the COE. These will detail each team member’s functional and technical experience and skill levels. Competency charts will identify strengths and weaknesses across the team, identifying which team members are better suited for specific work at the current time. Additionally, it will highlight risks and opportunities in relation to current and developing market trends and define the anticipated needs of the organization, the team, and its individual resources.
Well-maintained competency charts should be considered during the recruiting process, individual resource career growth plans, and project planning and staffing requests. Along with COE roadmaps, competency charts should also be used to ensure that the team is composed of the proper mix of resources based upon anticipated market trends and organizational work needs.
Subject Matter Experts
To maintain an appropriate level of support across all of the organization’s work efforts, the COE will need to identify subject matter experts (SMEs) who can be leveraged where and when needed, based upon their specific skills and experience, relevant to project needs. SMEs can be industry experts from within or outside the organization, or could be members of the COE itself. SMEs will support, service, advise, and consult the organization and the COE team as needed. In addition, SMEs will often be asked to review, provide constructive feedback on, and approve project work as well as to provide guidance and thought leadership and direction. SMEs should focus on technologies or skills that are new or cutting edge to the organization and/or the industry.
Identifying a Subject Matter Expert
The following characteristics are indicators that an individual may be a potential COE SME:
Has deep or broad expertise in a specific market, category, business segment, or discipline Willing and enthusiastic about the opportunity to share expertise with others
Routinely catalogs knowledge and expertise for easy access by others
Significantly contributes to the development of new materials such as white papers, seminars, POV pieces, and other similar content, in their area of expertise
Actively seeks to remain updated on current and emerging industry trends and networks with industry leaders
Identifies opportunities to publicize and market their area of expertise
Has an established and active online presence within their area of expertise, including reading and posting to blogs and online publications, fostering online relationships with bloggers and other online influencers, and developing and maintaining profile pages on social networking sites
Many current (or potential) SMEs will most likely already exist within an organization. But in many cases, they will need to be identified, acknowledged, and nurtured by COE leaders, in order to leverage the value and potential of their contributions.
Get on the Path to Excellence
Specific approaches to implementing a Center of Excellence will vary based upon each organization’s needs, industry, resources, and level of maturity within their technical or functional space. Some may begin as informal or self-elected bodies composed of experienced and knowledgeable personnel from within the organization who may split their time between COE duties and other roles within the company, while others may require dedicated staff in full-time positions.
Over time, it is certain that the COE will evolve and become more formalized, and should receive appropriate authorities and funding to expand the scope of its operations – usually on the merit earned from successful accomplishments and contributions to the organization’s projects, operational or financial performance, and reputation within the industry.
While the road to success of the COE may look very different across different organizations, adhering to the fundamental principles discussed here is sure to provide the essential building blocks to get started in the right direction.

Center of excellence
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see Centre of excellence (disambiguation).
The Auburn Performing Arts Center, Julie and Hal Moore Center for Excellence at Auburn High School (Alabama) is focused on performing arts.
A center of excellence (COE ), also called excellence center, is a team, a shared facility or an entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for a focus area.
Due to its broad usage and vague legal precedent, a "center of excellence" in one context may have completely different characteristics from another. The focus area might be a technology (e.g. Java ), a business concept (e.g. BPM ), a skill (e.g. negotiation) or a broad area of study (e.g. women's health ). A center of excellence may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives. [1] The term may also refer to a network of institutions collaborating with each other to pursue excellence in a particular area. [2] (e.g. the Rochester Area Colleges Center for Excellence in Math and Science ). In contrast, in the European defense community, the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats is a response to hybrid warfare on its periphery; the COE seeks to inform, and also protect its non- NATO components, as well as its non- PESCO members.

Organizations[edit]
Within an organization, a center of excellence may refer to a group of people, a department or a shared facility. It may also be known as a competency center, or as a capability center, or as an excellence center. Stephen Jenner and Craig Kilford, in Management of Portfolios, mention COE as a coordinating function which ensures that change initiatives are delivered consistently and well, through standard processes and competent staff. [4] In technology companies, the center of excellence concept is often associated with new software tools, technologies or associated business concepts such as Service-oriented architecture or business intelligence.[5] [6]
Academia[edit]
In academic institutions, a center of excellence often refers to a team with a clear focus on a particular area of research; such a center may bring together faculty members from different disciplines and provide shared facilities. [7]
Australia[edit]
In Australia, the Australian Research Council (ARC) funds a competitive grant program for Centres of Excellence which link a number of institutions within the country and internationally in a specific field of research. [8] New centres are funded every three years and each run for seven years. [8]

Philippines[edit]
In the Philippines, a center of excellence (COE) is a certification given by the Commission on Higher Education to departments within a higher education institution (e.g. a college within a university) which "continuously demonstrates excellent performance in the areas of instruction, research and publication, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications". Candidates for this certification are referred as centers of development (CODs) by the education body. [9]
Russia[edit]
Certificate of the Leading Scientific School of the Russian Federation (leader N. Kuznetsov ), 2018 year
In Russia, the Center of Excellence status (in Russian it is used notion Leading scientific school) is granted by the Council for Grants of the President of the Russian Federation since 1996. [10] To obtain the COE status, a group of scientists, usually based on a department at a university or a laboratory at an academic institute, and its leader should have a high scientific reputation and should submit an application, which presents a plan of scientific and educational work for the period of two years, to the Council. The Council issues a special certificate of the COE status to the leader of the group. [11]
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United KIngdom, schools and sixth forms specialising in an area of curriculum are known as specialist schools. These schools are recognised as centres of excellence in their specialist subject areas. [12] [13] Schools that attained Beacon status were also recognised as centres of excellence, [14] however this status has been discontinued. [15]
Business[edit]
Walmart is designating certain employee healthcare venues as Centers of Excellence. In 2013 several regions of the country (Dallas-Fort Worth; Northern Arkansas; Orlando, FL) Walmart is offering employees free treatment when they use the designated Centers of Excellence. Treatments are administered to covered employees, who travel to the Centers, along with a caregiver, for a course of treatment at the Center. Depending on the budgetary outcome, Walmart will be sharing its operational results with other employers, as a method of controlling its healthcare costs. [16]
Ford Motor Company has announced a battery center of excellence, meant to centralize a cross-functional team to accelerate the development of battery and battery cell technology. Electrical batteries would then serve as the basis for all-electric vehicles. The Center of Excellence is called Ford Ion Park. [17]
Northrup Grumman has invested in its Manned Aircraft Design Center of Excellence in Melbourne, Florida. This investment uses modeling and simulation tools at the Center of Excellence which predict the performance of its test-bed aircraft, as a method for reducing risk during the process of developing the B-21. [18]
Huntington Ingalls Industries is building out an Unmanned Systems Center of Excellence, which is working on Boeing's project for the Navy's Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle. [19]
Similarly Alliant Techsystems, Otis Elevator, Alcoa, Greatbatch, and GE have all used Centers of Excellence as organizational mechanisms to gain economies of scale, when discovering and sharing efficiencies of operation. [20]
On August 3, 2019 23 citizens of 3 countries —The United States of America, Mexico, and Germany— were gunned down in a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. In solidarity with El Paso, the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence, Fort Bliss, presented a memorial memento to Walmart consisting of 23 chips each inscribed with the three national flags, as well as the flag which was flying over the NCO Leadership Center of Excellence at the moment of the mass shooting.
Healthcare[edit]
In the healthcare sector, the term often refers to a center that provides sufficient and easily accessible medical services to patients. [21]
In the British NHS, the term is almost always used sarcastically, following its popularisation by Dr Peter Gooderham on the Doctors.net.uk fora. [22] It can often be heard being used to describe tertiary centres by staff working in district general hospitals.
United States Army[edit]

Everything You Need to Know About Centers of Excellence
Access to Expertise is More Important Than Ever
Center of Excellence Definition: What is a COE?
Today’s enterprises face unprecedented pressure from more nimble startups, volatile market trends, and a global health crisis. Those that thrive will be hyper-focused on driving value in the long term, innovating and adapting to changing conditions faster than their competitors.
However, most organizations simply aren’t built to succeed this way. A recent PwC Survey found that leaders are extremely concerned about their organization’s rate of innovation. In fact, 44% of CEO’s felt their speed of technological change was insufficient, and 32% did not possess the availability of key skills. KPMG found that 57% of CEOs are concerned that their organizations don’t have innovative processes to respond to rapid disruption, and in a separate study PwC discovered that 61% of companies say the solution to reaching strategic goals is collaborating more across functions, paired with faster decision-making.
It is clear that organizations are failing to innovate rapidly because they lack fast access to expertise. Gartner learned in one study that 75% of organizations will fail to achieve the full potential of the internet of things (IoT) due to lack of access to data scientists and another 80% of companies that expected to employ AI by 2019 failed for similar reasons. Meanwhile, McKinsey found that only 20% of companies have maximized their potential and achieved advanced analytics at scale, even while most companies understand the importance.
Even beyond leading-edge technologies, access to expertise remains a challenge for enterprise leaders. In 2018, McKinsey found that organizations that move top talent to high-priority initiatives quickly were 2.2X more likely to return shareholder value than their slower counterparts.
Centers of Excellence Streamline Access to Expertise
Centers of Excellence were designed to improve the reach of critical expertise throughout the organization, agnostic of geographical location or business unit. For functions like IT or Operations, centers of excellence already have a strong track record of success.
Gartner shows that 95% of organizations that establish a Cloud Center of Excellence will deliver measurable cloud transformational success through 2021. McKinsey learned that 60% of top-performing companies in advanced analytics have a “center of gravity” to drive their analytics efforts forward, and in a separate study Garter found that 50% of organizations with more than three AI projects will establish a Center of Excellence for AI by 2022.
So what is a Center of Excellence, how can you stand one up in your organization, and what are the benefits they deliver to the bottom line? Read on to learn everything you need to know about Centers of Excellence.
Center of Excellence Definition: What is a COE?
A COE (Center of Excellence) is a centralized unit of dedicated people with a mission to streamline access to scarce, high-demand capabilities for rapid execution across the business. This group hones expertise in a specific subject area, standardizes best practices for wide-scale adoption, and provides thought leadership & direction in their area of expertise.
According to Gartner, COEs exist to “concentrat(e) existing expertise and resources in a discipline or capability to attain and sustain world-class performance and value.” These virtual or physical centers combine learning and oversight in a specific area, driving the organization to shift across multiple disciplines together.
For instance, you may have the heads of various marketing-related functions from across different product lines gather in a COE around implementing best-in-class social customer care for their customers, with shared customer history, multiple types of customized content, and more relevant content production. Therefore, the COE would focus on providing training, best practices, and resources for all of these different teams, while also gathering the data and learnings from all of the teams to create a positive feedback loop.
Six Requirements for a Successful Center of Excellence
In order to successfully stand up a COE, organizations must take a multi-part approach to development and implementation. In working with clients that have effectively deployed COEs throughout the organization we have identified the six requirements necessary for long-term COE success:
Strategy-Work Alignment & Prioritization
Standardization of Execution Paths
Effective Resource Management
Value Management, Capacity Planning & Coordination Across Teams
Demand Management, Risk Mitigation & Continuous Improvement
Centralized Tracking, Auditing, & Reporting to Enterprise Management
Center of Excellence Defined
We use the term Center of Excellence as a blanket term for groups that optimize the ways work gets done. However, businesses will use many names for these groups, including:
Shared Services Center/Shared Services Organization
Global Business Services/Multifunctional Shared Services
Global Insourced Center
Global Shared Services Organization
Center of Excellence (COE)
Competency Center/Global Competency Center
Capability Center
These groups and names can overlap between three core mission areas: Run the Business, Grow the Business, and Transform the Business.
The Center Of Excellence Model: Purpose, Intent and Value Proposition
COEs have evolved to have different missions, some more tactical and some more strategic. Their three primary mission areas are: Run the Business, Grow the Business, and Transform the Business.
Run the Business: Run the Business COEs are focused on enterprise efficiency and driving bottom-line impact. These efficiencies can be found in reducing administrative transaction costs or enhancing operational decision support. Examples with the Finance unit include A/P, A/R, expense reporting, and tax accounting. Within HR these can be payroll or benefits and for IT they can include service desks, network infrastructure, and ops.
Grow the Business: The shared services of a Grow the Business COE affect change in enterprise effectiveness, working to make productivity improvements. They will be tasked with improving enterprise competitiveness and cost optimization, as well as optimizing internal service delivery. These types of COEs can take the form of integrated business services, analytics services, or application development. App development for ERP and other specialty competency centers would be another example, as well as internal consulting organizations.
Transform the Business: A Transform the Business COE looks at enterprise transformation through strategic contribution and alignment. They will drive innovation at the business as well as uncovering new strategic capabilities, markets, products, and/or business models. These COEs manifest as innovation centers or specialized R&D groups.
Types of Centers of Excellence
As we can see Centers of Excellence can touch a wide array of business units throughout an organization. Due to their specialized nature, COEs can vary widely in subject matter. Examples include:
Internal Consulting
Continuous Improvement
Operational Excellence
Supply Chain
Quality Assurance
Business Analytics
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Internet of Things (IoT)
Advanced Digital
Finance and Accounting
HR
Agile Development
Innovation and R&D
Center Of Excellence Framework: Where Does it Lie in an Organization?
One important distinction to remember is that Centers of Excellence are separate from the business units they serve. This is by design to ensure maximum agility in deploying the COE across an organization. When visualizing an organization chart the COE often lies within the Corporate Strategy Office, above respective business units.
Where Center Of Excellence resides in an Organization
Center of Excellence Implementation
Now that we understand where the Center of Excellence lies within an organization we can look at the primary stakeholders involved in forming and running the COE. Executive sponsorship and ongoing support are essential for success, because the perception of the COE is critical for wide buy-in and adoption; not to mention the need for ongoing funding from executive-level strategic planning and budgeting processes.
While broad, collaborative, cohesive support is key, the cross-functional team that is ultimately responsible for governance will depend heavily on the underlying purpose of the COE, which will vary from case to case. For example, a COE for robotic process automation likely has broad representation in supply chain, manufacturing, operations, and IT. Alternatively, a COE for customer experience likely has representation in marketing, business intelligence/analytics, customer service, and delivery teams.
The make-up of the actual COE generally includes internal and external subject matter experts, as well as internal stakeholders with a nuanced view of the business (processes, functional groups, product lines, etc.) In addition, high-potential employees with interest in the subject area and enthusiasm for the mission with a proven ability to learn and deliver can be included.
How COEs Drive Value for Organizations
Centers of Excellence can add value to organizations in myriad ways across all business units due to their specialized subject matter expertise and operational agility. Let’s look at four major ways in which COEs have driven value:
More efficient use of resources: By centralizing scarce, high-demand capabilities like knowledge, skills, and experiences COEs are able to widen the reach of those capabilities and streamline their access across the organization.
Faster delivery: COEs are able to eliminate bottlenecks by streamlining access to critical capabilities which in turn increases speed of delivery, development, and maintenance of critical business processes.
Cost optimization: COEs eliminate inefficient practices and decrease costs by streamlining processes, creating reusable assets, and reducing redundancy.
Increased quality of services and products: By standardizing best practices across the organization COEs enable uniformity of service and product delivery, along with tight, end-to-end customer experiences.
Example: The Belts Program at Anheuser-Busch InBev
One example of a large organization successfully implementing a Center of Excellence is the Belts Program at Anheuser-Busch InBev. The name of the program, and the community of internal consultants that staff it, is derived from the Six Sigma Black Belt certification. The program was created to drive operational excellence and continuous improvement across the business.
AB InBev has a global network of ~2,500 employees trained in Lean Six Sigma methodology that makes up this Belts community. This community of internal consultants allows leaders across AB InBev to tap into the expertise of these resources, who sit across various functions and geographies.
The Belts Program at AB InBev is designed to advance and transform our business. The projects we lead drive results, develop leaders, and improve our company. Ideal engagements should be high-profile opportunities for the expert to apply their skills and drive business value.

How the Catalant Platform Enables COE Success
The Catalant platform helps Centers of Excellence thrive in several ways. Catalant empowers COE leaders to manage strategic objectives, workstreams, and resource allocation from a single, easy-to-use digital system. The software also comes with fast access to more than 70,000 independent consultants who can help fill in gaps in expertise.
Our customers stay competitive with best practices that collectively enable getting from strategy to execution faster and more efficiently. Partnering with more than 30% of the Fortune 100 has taught us how high-velocity companies execute strategy and deploy Centers of Excellence.
In our experience working with these organizations, the minimum requirements for successful strategy execution include:
Making certain that ongoing work is aligned with strategic initiatives and objectives
Having reliable data on what work is being done, the capabilities required to execute it, and who has those capabilities
Being able to dynamically access and deploy resources with the right capabilities, from both inside and outside the organization
Having real-time visibility into what work is happening, who is doing it, and the progress of work
Being able to effectively intervene, when needed, by reallocating resources or altering the course of work
Getting actionable insights into how work and resources are collectively contributing to strategic initiatives and objectives
But how does the Catalant Platform enable an organization to run an effective COE with respect to each of these minimum requirements? If we look at the Six Requirements for a Successful Center of Excellence from earlier, we can map them to these six minimum requirements.
Aligning Work and Business Objectives
The Catalant Platform helps COE leaders align work with corporate strategic objectives, including prioritization of high-impact work in the face of high demand from business units. COEs can use the platform to set strategic objectives and align execution of work with key metrics.
Standardization of Execution Paths
Catalant helps COE leaders to standardize how they engage with their internal clients and provide an understanding of the work to be done and resources available to do the work. COEs can use the Platform to define, break down, and organize work to identify the capabilities needed to execute.
Effective Resource Management
The Platform will help the COE to access and deploy capabilities against a changing slate of work. Because COEs can have variable volumes of work, they need elastic resources and often need to leverage external resources to do the work. The Platform allows the COE to access these external resources seamlessly in conjunction with internal resourcing.
Value Management, Risk Management & Coordination Across Teams
The platform helps the COE to gain visibility into how work is impacting its top objectives, ensuring accountability to stakeholders across the organization. The Platform gives COEs visibility into how bodies of work contribute to business objectives and KPIs.
Demand Management & Continuous Improvement
Catalant helps the COE to identify execution gaps and areas for greater investment, enabling resource reallocation to get work back on track and improving pipeline management. The Platform allows the COE to see the skills and expertise that the business needs and where gaps exist. It can then reallocate resources as needed.
Centralized Tracking, Auditing & Reporting to Enterprise Management
The Platform will help the COE to uncover insights from completed work to increase operational efficiency and forecast ROI with greater accuracy over time. COEs get visibility into performance trends, and can drill down into how work and resources affect growth and efficiency targets.

How to Set Up a Center of Excellence
The term “Center of Excellence” is becoming increasingly popular among businesses and a number of organizations are setting up these departments. But what is the purpose of a Center of Excellence?

This guide will explain the 1) basics of a Center of Excellence and the 2) benefits of establishing one in your organization. We’ll also provide you a 3) detailed plan on how to set up a Center of Excellence in three steps to guarantee your organization will reap the benefits.
WHAT IS A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (COE)?
The primary aim of any business is to become a successful enterprise that reaches goals efficiently. In order to do so, businesses often establish a set of pragmatic principles guiding the management team. However, striving for this type of excellence is often easier said than done.
To improve efficiency businesses have began setting up Centers of Excellence (CoE). These can also be referred to as “competency centers” or “capability centers”.
The definition of a CoE states that they are a group of people leading the organization and its different structures in a specific focus area towards pre-determined goals. Hence, the aim of a CoE is to improve expertise in a certain area and make the most of its resources to help the business to improve.
CoEs provide a focal point for knowledge management, with the overall goal being the ability to capture new knowledge and practices from inside and outside of the business.
Whilst in the corporate world, CoEs tend to be a single business unit, organizations working in the field of science and academia can set up CoEs as a cross-organizational project. For example, the Anna Freud Center of Excellence works in the field of youth mental health and involves a range of organizations, such as Yale and UCL.
It’s crucial to understand how a CoE differs from other business departments and centers, as the “excellence” term can be misleading.
CoEs aren’t supposed to be better than the other operational departments within the business. But instead of focusing on performing operational tasks, the aim of the CoE is to find the best practices and to disseminate them to the other departments.

The core aspects of CoEs
There are three core aspects to CoEs: the team of the center, the particular focus area of the center, and the purpose of the center.
The team of the center
CoEs are built around a team or a group of people, who can be hired either from outside the company or be employees of the business. The team members can continue to hold other positions in the business and work in the role either full-time or part-time.
Therefore, CoEs can be either an on-going part of the business or a temporary setup. For instance, a business might choose to set up a CoE in the event of a new technology adaptation.
The particular focus area of the center
CoEs tend to be built around a specific focus area. This could be any area relevant for the company and of particular importance for the business.
The typical focus areas include:
Technology – the adaptation of a new technology system or simply the study of a new technology as a means to improve the business.
A business concept – the introduction of a business concept such as BPM.
Skill – improvement and utilization of a new skill such as certain management practices.
Other broad area of study – for example workplace equality.
The purpose of the center
Depending on the focus area of the CoE, it can have a wide range of purposes. The main goals and responsibilities of CoEs include the following:
providing research,
supporting the organization,
offering guidance,
providing training and oversight of the employees,
governing the organization through appropriate resource allocation.
In which cases do companies set up a CoE?
Let’s look at the events that might lead to a company implementing a CoE. The center can operate in a number of focus areas. Since the aim of CoEs is to lead the organization towards a better understanding of the particular area, the establishment often involves either:
the implementation, management and use of a new technology or
the adaptation, management and use of a new or particular skill or concept.
For example, a company might set up a CoE for business intelligence and use it as a means to gain insight into different areas, such as products, customers and market initiatives. The goal would be to conduct research on the best business practices, help the company implement them and ensure the organization takes full advantage of the new strategies.
On the other hand, a company might want to set up a CoE during the adaptation of new accounting software. The goal could be to find the best software, support the organization during the implementation process and provide training to employees.

The benefits of CoEs
Before venturing into the steps an organization must take in order to set up a CoE, it’s essential to understand the benefits of creating one. In short, CoEs can improve business practices and guarantee success.
Furthermore, the proper creation of a CoE can guarantee a company:
uses its resources in a more efficient way,
provides quality services and products to customers,
reduces the costs of running the business by eliminating inefficient practices and by cutting the time required for implementation of new technologies and skills.
Therefore, CoEs can be essential in the development and measurement of business success. It can help a company achieve consistency, as well as reduce complexity.
3 STEPS TO ESTABLISHING A CENTER OF EXCELLENCE
Business shouldn’t take the implementation of a CoE lightly, as mistakes during the setting up can lead to inefficient practices.
In order to gain the benefits of a CoE, organizations must take the time and follow these three steps.
Step 1: Define strategy and vision
The crucial part of creating success is to define the strategy and vision of the CoE. Without a clear strategy and a vision, it’s unlikely the CoE will improve the business.
In order to guarantee success, you should create a charter for your center. This would be the mission statement of your CoE. Therefore, you should:
Think about the purpose of the center. What is the reason for establishing the center? Are you building the center to focus on a technology, a business concept, a skill, or something entirely different?
Establish the purpose of the center before you move forward. This will help clarify the governance of the center, as well as the strategy.
Think about the goals of the center. What exactly is the center trying to achieve? Are you looking to ease the implementation of a new process, research a new method or perhaps improve the business practices of an area?
You should have a clear set of goals the center is moving towards. By having a set of tangible goals, you can better measure the effectiveness and success of the center and ensure it doesn’t slide off course.
Think about the scope of the center. What are the issues the center will deal with? How far-reaching is the research or study going to be? What budget will be required and how many employees need to be part of the team?
By defining the scope of the center, you place restrictions on projects to guarantee you focus on the key areas of importance.
Furthermore, keep in mind the vision of the CoE should always align with your overall business strategy. You want the vision for the center to match the vision you have for the business.
Every CoE requires a set of operational standards. Since the focus of the center is to improve the management and operations of other aspects of the business, it would be unwise to set up the CoE without having a clear framework. By defining how the center is supposed to operate and what is expected of each individual, you guarantee a clearer, leaner and more efficient functionality.
Finally, you should outline the role of the center within the greater organization. This means the way it approaches other CoEs, either within the organization or in other companies. You should also consider its place in the wider community of SMEs and other such organizations.
Step 2: Secure funding
The second step involves the other important aspect of launching a CoE: the funding. Badly designed CoEs can end up costing the business more money than they bring benefits, so it’s important to pay attention to the funding structure of the center.
You should understand that while CoEs can help to reduce operational costs of a business, running a successful CoE isn’t for free. In the long-term, the funding issues might become easier, but at the start, you’ll need quite a bit of capital to get going.
In many instances, the senior management of the business will need to support the process, not only in terms of time but also in terms of money. The main question is whether the business can self-sufficiently run the CoE or if outside funding is needed.
In most instances, businesses are required to look for outside funding. A good starting point is to find partners for the project. You can look for suitable options in areas such as technology, education or other such related sectors that fit to your CoE’s focus. Ensure these partners have aligned interests and goals in mind before you start dealing with them. You don’t want to form a partnership with a business or an organization expecting different results from the project.
There’s no reason for CoEs not to operate with other companies. For example, the CoE could be set up as a Joint Venture of two or more companies.
Furthermore, depending on the purpose of your CoE, you might be able to find public funding. For example, if you are setting up a CoE for environmental protection, the government or other environmental agencies might be able to provide extra funding. This is also available for certain academic and scientific purposes.
Before you start dealing with the operational issues, you therefore want to create a budget plan. Include estimations regarding the salaries of the staff and the operational expenses. Don’t add any benefits of CoE (such as cutting the cost of new technology implementation) to these calculations.
Step 3: Make the center operational
Once you have defined the strategy and vision of the center and managed to organize the funding, you can start focusing on the operational side of running a CoE.
Five key areas of focus must be sorted out in order to establish a CoE. These include: staffing, governance, marketing, measurement of the performance, and the position of the center within the community.
Staffing
The first aspect of operations naturally involves finding the right personnel for your CoE. As mentioned in the first section, CoEs can either be staffed full-time or part-time. In addition, you can either hire completely new personnel for the center or reassign existing employees from other business units. The right approach depends largely on the purpose of your center, as well as its scope.
You need to hire people who are highly qualified and skilled for the required positions. If possible, previous expertise in CoEs can always be beneficial. But the most important thing is to identify the key skills required in order to achieve the objectives you laid out during the first step.
Governance
The best CoEs are agile, innovative and well governed. Therefore, you need to place governance structures at the heart of the operations. CoEs should have as little red tape and bureaucracy as possible. The purpose of these centers is to find the best practices and this often requires a much more relaxed governance approach compared to operational units.
On the other hand, the center’s inner governance structure must be clearly laid out. There should be clear accountability and role structures in the center. This ensures employees are aware of the expectations and requirements they need to fulfill.
Ensure the center has plenty of support. Every member of the team must feel able to operate in an efficient and effective manner, without having to deal with operational problems and bureaucratic obstacles. It makes sense if a member of the board of directors is overseeing the center, in order to guarantee high level support within the organization.
Marketing
Businesses shouldn’t hide their CoEs from the public. In fact, you should be marketing the center at every opportunity, as this can help to achieve goals quicker and help to find additional funding.
Most key areas of CoEs can directly benefit other similar organizations. Just as you would ideally form partnerships with other companies, you should also market the center to these organizations while in operation.
The knowledge gained by the CoE can provide an organization an additional revenue source. As the following section on the importance of community will show, CoEs shouldn’t be viewed solely as an internal department, but an opportunity to increase external reach of the organization.
Measurement of the performance
It is crucial to measure the performance of the center at all stages. When you are defining the goals, you also want to figure out how to measure them.
Every process within the business should be identified and categorized. This allows the team to find the inefficient processes and make changes to them.
Define the metrics that matter the most to your business success and find the tools to measure them. Having a business intelligence dashboard in place will make it easier to measure success. In case you don’t achieve your pre-defined goals, don’t hesitate to wind up your CoE before it consumes more resources.
Furthermore, since CoEs often aim at helping the business to implement a new skill or technology, it’s important to measure the success of the skill or technology as well. This can provide essential information for future adaptations and help the business improve its operations as a whole.
Focus on the community
Finally, you also want to focus on the community. Businesses operate in a wider culture and as well as adapting to the changes within the organization, they need to focus on the changes taking place outside of the business. CoEs need to be aware of the cultural and operational environment of the community to ensure it can react to external changes.
For example, you want to pay attention to how people interact with the business and whether changes within the business result in changes in consumer behavior.
Since the focus of CoEs tends to be knowledge management, businesses can be wary of sharing this information with the community or other businesses.
Yet, Tableau pointed out in an example of a CoE at UBS that community can help to “deal with problems quickly and encourage people doing innovative work”. Therefore, a community shouldn’t be seen as a hindrance to a CoE, but rather an opportunity to learn more and benefit the wider business culture.
THE BOTTOM LINE
Whilst the term CoE can be overused in the corporate world, businesses shouldn’t think they are just another business fad. There are real tangible benefits of setting up a CoE and it can streamline your business processes in a variety of ways.
However, you shouldn’t take the process of establishing the center lightly. In order to guarantee the success of your center, you must properly define its vision and strategies.
Furthermore, ensure the center has appropriate financing by negotiating partnerships and through continuous marketing.
Finally, focus on creating a lean management structure that provides knowledge throughout the whole of your organization.
