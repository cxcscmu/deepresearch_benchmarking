Alright, so I need to figure out why oil prices are rising. I don't know much about economics or oil markets, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I should probably understand what factors affect oil prices in general.

I think oil prices are determined by supply and demand, right? So, if there's more demand for oil than there is supply, prices go up. Conversely, if there's plenty of supply and not much demand, prices go down. That makes sense based on basic economics.

But what causes changes in supply and demand for oil? Let me think about demand first. Who uses oil? Well, lots of people and industries use oil. For example, the transportation sector uses oil for gasoline and diesel. Airlines use jet fuel, which is also derived from oil. Additionally, many industrial processes use oil as a raw material or energy source. So, if more people are traveling, or if industries are producing more, that would increase demand for oil, leading to higher prices.

On the supply side, oil is extracted from the ground by oil companies. The amount of oil they can produce depends on various factors, such as the availability of oil reserves, the capacity of extraction facilities, and geopolitical situations that might affect oil production or export. If there are disruptions in oil production, like strikes, conflicts, or natural disasters, that could reduce supply and drive up prices.

Also, I've heard about OPEC, which is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. They sometimes make decisions to cut production or increase production, which can influence global oil supplies and, consequently, prices.

Another factor might be speculation in the oil market. Since oil is traded on global markets, investors buy and sell oil futures contracts, trying to predict future price movements. If many investors expect oil prices to rise, they might buy more futures contracts, which can actually drive up the current price of oil.

Furthermore, global economic conditions play a role. When the economy is growing, there's usually more demand for oil because industries are producing more, and people are traveling more. Conversely, during economic downturns, like recessions, demand for oil decreases, leading to lower prices.

Recently, there's been a lot of talk about renewable energy and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. This might affect oil prices if more people and countries shift towards using alternative energy sources, reducing the demand for oil.

Also, currency fluctuations can impact oil prices since oil is typically priced in US dollars. If the dollar strengthens, oil becomes more expensive for countries with weaker currencies, which might affect demand.

Let me try to summarize: oil prices rise when demand increases or supply decreases, or both. Factors affecting demand include economic growth, transportation needs, and the adoption of alternative energy sources. Factors affecting supply include production decisions by oil-producing countries, especially OPEC, geopolitical events, and the cost of extracting oil.

But to answer the specific question of why oil prices are rising now, I need to consider current events and trends.

Maybe I should look up some recent news about oil prices to get a better understanding.

Wait, in this format, I can perform a search. Let me try that.

here is concern as oil prices have been increasing, with one barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, rising to as much as 80.69 dollars last month. That was the first time it had passed the 80 dollar mark since October of 2018.
Demand fell and prices fell during the coronavirus lockdown, but now that the world economy is getting back to normal the demand is rising and supply cannot keep up.
What has caused the surge in oil prices in October 2021?
There are various factors behind the current rise in the price of oil. Here comes a list of several of the main reasons:
Economies around the world are back up and running and looking to make up for lost time, thereby increasing demand.
Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas damaged US oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico.
Coal shortages in Asia have seen countries on that continent use more oil than they used to.
A surge in natural gas prices has increased demand for oil.
The natural gas price rise is a major factor in the parallel situation with oil. "Crude oil rallied to seven years high on strong fundamentals on higher demand with global power shortage and lower supply worries," explained Tapan Patel, a senior analyst for HDFC Securities. "Crude oil prices rallied on substitute demand from gas and coal consumers over rising prices. The recent surge in natural gas and coal prices globally has increased demand for crude oil to meet power demand. Crude oil prices are expected to trade up with resistance at $83 and support at $80 per barrel. MCX Crude oil October has support at 5,990, resistance at 6,180."
While some of the reasons for the current crisis are temporary, others are not and this has to be a concern for consumers. The inflation could keep continuing as economic trends around the world change.

Multiple reasons behind the oil price rise
Oil prices went up significantly last week.
Multiple reasons behind the oil price rise
MERLIN FLOWER | 2010/03/11
In the U.S. there is an over-supply of crude oil in the market, at present.  Not that it definitely should but, obviously, the price of oil should slide, right? Well, last week the oil prices closed at $81.79 a barrel.  There reason? There isn't one but many. Before that let us look at some data:
First, the industry report from the American Petroleum Institute. API report showed:
More than expected crude inventories due to more imports. An increase of 2.7 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories increased by 909,000 barrels
Distillates dropped by 4.1 million barrels
Following is the data from Energy Information Administration (EIA) :
Increased crude oil stockpiles on the back of strong imports. The stockpiles increased to 341.6 million barrels, a climb by almost 4.1 million bbl (for week ended February 26). The expected rise was about 1.3 million barrels only. So, this is about three times the estimated increase-a surprise.
Distillate fuel inventories fell 900,000 bbl to 151.8 million bbl due to high demand.
Gasoline inventories rose by 700,000 bbl to 231.9 million bbl instead of the expected 300,000 bbl.
Clearly, there is more crude oil in the market. According to analyst from Raymond James & Associates Inc, total petroleum storage is now at 765.3 million bbl or 16 million bbl above the storage levels, same time last year.  Oil supplies in the U.S. West Coast increased, with the stockpiles there jumping by 2.31 million barrels contributing to the overall increase in oil -341.6 million bbl. Still, oil managed to override this supply excess and touch the $80 a barrel mark.
The reasons for the oil price rise:
While there are many reasons for the increase, some significant ones are:
According to the U.S. Energy department, refinery utilization in the U.S. rose to 81.9%, an increase by 0.7% for the week ending February 26. The refinery operating rates were the highest since October. For its part, the high refinery cost has compensated for any possible decrease in the price of oil. In addition, the US fuel demand was at 19.3 million barrels for the last four weeks an increase of 3% from last year-according to the department.
Amid this, there were reports of rebel groups attacking oil installations in Nigeria.  As Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, investors feared for the oil exports from the region. The reports of the attacks are yet to be confirmed, but, still, helped increase the oil prices .
U.S. jobs report showed lower than expected unemployment figures. The report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics department showed unemployment rate unchanged from the January rate of 9.7%.  Investors took this as a sign of economic revival with the U.S. President Obama describing the jobs report as "better than expected". As soon as the Labor department came up with the news, dollar fell increasing the oil prices. And how did that happen?
Higher oil price increases the export bill leading to trade deficits and weak dollar
Dollar-denominated commodities become cheaper with a weak dollar, in turn increasing the price of oil.
Moving on, there were optimistic signs on the manufacturing font in the U.S. The U.S. Commerce department announced that factory orders rose 1.7% in January mainly due to increased aircraft orders.  There was 2.6% increase in durable goods orders. Confidence of the businesses showed as the Inventories continued to increase.
In addition, there emerged positive signs from the world's second biggest oil consumer, China. Last Friday, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao set an economic target of eight percent for this year. Fair enough since a good economy means better fuel demand.
Other reasons
Heating oil demand from the Northern hemisphere
Signs from the Middle-East: Seizure of a Saudi Arabian oil tanker by pirates in the Gulf of Aden too worried the investors. As did the Iraqi parliamentary election due March 7.
Greece's austerity measures to rein in the debt problem
Oil prices in the coming weeks:
So, will oil manage to climb up, even further? Well, major groups like IEA and EIA have projected strong demand for oil in the near future.  According to Barclays oil prices were likely to rise to $80-$90 range. Quoting data from Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI), which said that the Asian demand for oil was increasing by more than 2 million barrels per day, Barclays analysts Paul Horsnell said, "If Asian demand can grow at such rapid rates when prices are in the $70 to $80 range, then prices cannot stay in that range for much longer".
In China, for a change, the oil stocks are higher than the demand. So, China's largest producer, supplier and refiner of oil, Sinopec is said to be introducing a subsidy of 130 yuan or $19 per ton, in an effort to increase the export of oil.  The subsidy is expected to be in place till the demand and supply are balanced.
And, OPEC is meeting on March 17. Analysts predict that there would be no changes in the output quotas. Iraqi Oil Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said "Despite the fact the global economy is gradually recovering, demand has not increased significantly enough to make us reconsider our production ceiling".
Correctly forecasting the price of oil is a science in itself. The situation in the Middle-East should be kept in mind. So, read the reasons, analyse the pointers and make your own judgment before investing.

Why are oil prices surging right now?
Why are oil prices surging right now?
July 12, 2021

Oil prices have risen roughly 50 percent since the start of the year to about $75 per barrel, contributing to sharply higher prices for essential fuels such as gasoline. That's a dark cloud at a time when the global economic recovery is still fragile. One reason for the price spike is higher demand in North America and Europe, where successful COVID vaccination campaigns are allowing countries to lift their lockdowns and get their economies roaring again. But there's more to the story. We asked Eurasia Group analysts Henning Gloystein and Ayham Kamel to explain.
What's behind the oil price spike?
It's an interesting situation. While demand for oil is rising, especially in the US and Europe, globally it's still below pre-pandemic levels. That's largely because restrictions on international aviation remain in place, meaning there's very little demand for jet fuel, one of the main products made from crude oil.
In fact, the recent oil price rise has more to do with production restraint from major oil producers, especially the members of the OPEC cartel.
How does OPEC fit into the story?
This group, under the de facto leadership of Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has traditionally tried to strike a balance: keeping oil prices high enough for producers to enjoy strong export revenues but not so high that they cause economic damage around the world that chokes off consumption. Since last May, OPEC has acted in concert with non-OPEC producers like Russia and a few Central Asian states to maintain that balance, even as markets have seesawed between bouts of recovery and renewed lockdowns. But with demand now showing signs of sustained improvement, everyone is seeing dollar signs and coordination among them has broken down.
Why has intra-OPEC coordination fallen apart?
When oil prices rise, consensus within OPEC tends to grow weaker as everyone tries to cash in. Specifically, they are — as usual — arguing over the national production quotas that each OPEC member agrees to as part of the cartel. This time around, the UAE, OPEC's third biggest producer behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq, wants its current quota of 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to be raised by around 500,000 bpd, to reflect its recent investments in new oil production capacity. But the Saudis have rejected this demand. They are worried that if one member is allowed to increase its quota, all the others would want to do the same. That could result in too much oil production, leading to lower prices for everyone.
Sort of a prisoners' dilemma, it seems. So what is the near-term outlook for prices then?
If there's a compromise in the coming weeks within OPEC, in which its members agree to produce more oil, that would bring down prices, but probably not before they breach the $80-per-barrel mark. On the other hand if there's no movement from OPEC and no increase in supply, that may lead to a bigger price surge — we wouldn't rule out $100 per barrel. That, however, would probably only be a temporary price spike, because at that level there is a serious risk that higher prices would cause demand to fall, particularly in emerging markets which are much more sensitive to higher prices. Finally, there's a slight chance that OPEC's system of agreed upon quotas falls apart entirely: if that happens, they'll all start producing as much as they can, resulting in a wave of unneeded oil hitting the market, crashing prices fast.
OK, for those of us planning a road trip, how does all this translate into gasoline prices?
Oil refiners are the critical piece here. They are the ones who buy crude oil and process it into the fuels we all use: including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. So when the cost of crude oil rises, the refiners' margins shrink. The easiest and most common solution for them is to simply pass on those higher costs to consumers via increased gas prices at the pump. If they overdo it, however, that can kill off consumption. This is especially the case in emerging markets, where most households simply cannot afford sharp increases in fuel prices. When prices surge, people simply stop driving their motorbikes or using taxis, though the governments of some countries try to shield consumers from the increases by giving fuel subsidies to households or by forcing refining companies to eat the costs themselves. Even in wealthier countries such as the US, if fuel gets too expensive, people simply drive less, especially during the summer driving season.
How does climate policy affect the longer-term outlook for oil demand and prices?
The green energy transition is accelerating, and analysts now think the point at which global oil consumption starts to fall will come sooner than expected. Previously, most didn't expect that to happen until 2030 or even 2040. Now some think we may already have crossed that point in 2019, just before the pandemic hit. What is certain is that electric vehicle growth is already exponential in most major economies, and this is a major blow to the fossil fuels industry. By 2030, and perhaps earlier, the majority of cars sold in Northeast Asia, Western Europe, and in North America will be electric. By that point, the oil industry will have to rely increasingly on sales to emerging markets, where the energy transition is further behind. But if these countries also manage a rapid electrification of transport, then oil demand will enter a sustained decline. And looking beyond electric vehicles, at some point, fossil fuels will also be eliminated from bigger vessels such as cargo ships or even airplanes, possibly by hydrogen fuel cells or liquid ammonia.

The price of oil has risen by more than 70% over the last 12 months, from 45 dollars per barrel of Brent in June 2017 to nearly 80 dollars in May 2018. So, after three years of low prices, crude oil has returned to levels not seen since late 2014. What are the forces behind this rise in oil prices? Could it compromise the growth of the global economy? We analyse this question below.
The factors behind the rise in oil prices
In early 2017, the oil market was in a situation in which supply persistently exceeded demand and, therefore, a significant buffer of crude oil stocks had accumulated (see first chart). However, the price of Brent oil had recovered from the declines seen in 2014 and 2015 and it had stabilised at around 55 dollars per barrel. On the one hand, this recovery was a result of the agreement reached between OPEC and other large producers, such as Russia, in November 2016 to cut production. 1 On the other hand, the accumulated stocks provided a buffer which reduced the volatility of the oil price, isolating it (partially) from the episodes of geopolitical instability.
From June 2017, however, oil prices began to increase sharply, driven by factors related to both supply and demand. On the supply side, the first chart shows how the agreement reached between OPEC countries and their partners to cut production succeeded in containing, and even reducing, the global oil supply. What is more, the cuts in oil production have clearly exceeded those agreed, as shown in the second chart. 2 As this reduction in the supply pressured prices up, US crude oil production was expected to surge and thus contain the price of Brent oil between 50 and 60 dollars. However, in the last few quarters, the US oil infrastructure has been constrained by bottlenecks and has not been able to offset the impact of the OPEC cuts. 3
To add to the restriction of supply, on the demand side global economic growth surprised on the upside and led to a significant upward revision of growth forecasts. In fact, the third chart shows a very clear association between the increase in the price of oil and the improvement in the outlook for global GDP. Finally, the combination of these dynamics of supply and demand led to a substantial depletion of the buffer in crude oil stocks, which would explain the increased volatility in the price of oil and its renewed sensitivity to geopolitical risks. Following on from this, it is likely that the recent reintroduction of economic sanctions on Iran has also contributed to the rise in the price of oil (not only through the direct impact it will have on the country’s oil exports, but also by increasing the risk of geopolitical conflicts in the Persian Gulf region).
Despite the fact that there is consensus on the role played by all of these factors, their relative importance is not clear and quantitative estimates on this matter vary considerably depending on the methodology used. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York breaks down oil price fluctuations into factors related to supply and demand, based on their relationship with a whole range of financial variables. Its results, which we reproduce in the fourth chart, indicate that demand is responsible for nearly 50% of the price increase, while supply would explain 20% of the increase (the model attributes the remaining 30% to other factors it cannot explain). On the other hand, based on the analysis of production and consumption of oil in the past and of the accumulation of stocks (which reflect expectations about the future balance between supply and demand), the ECB has recently estimated 4 that supply factors are responsible for slightly more than 60% of the surge in price, while 30% of the increase is down to global demand, and the depletion of stocks would have tended to push prices slightly downwards.
Consequences for growth
The impact of higher oil prices on global growth will depend on two elements: i) the factors responsible for the movement (supply, demand, or others) and ii) the balance between the positive impact on oil-exporting economies and the negative impact on importers of crude oil. Traditional estimates, such as those by the IMF which we share in the fifth chart, implicitly assume that the negative consequences on importers of oil (with a higher marginal propensity to consume) have far outweighed the positive effect on the income of oil exporters. However, whereas these estimates have focused on analysing the consequences of a reduction in oil supply, we have just seen that factors related to demand have also played an important role in the recent trends and, therefore, can mitigate the negative impact of the rise in the price of oil. In this regard, the 2014 empirical study by Cashin et al.5 shows that an increase in the oil price due to factors related to demand is associated with increases in economic activity in both oil-exporting and oil-importing economies, since it is the result of a positive momentum in the global economy.
Finally, in addition to the mitigating effect of demand, there have been other changes in the traditional transmission mechanisms. Firstly, oil has become less important in the global supply chain, both due to GDP being less energy-intensive and due to oil accounting for a smaller portion of the total energy consumed. Secondly, the oil-exporting economies currently have smaller fiscal buffers, meaning that their propensity to spend the additional revenues generated from oil may be greater. Finally, the irruption of the shale sector in the US has resulted in much of the US economy now benefiting from higher oil prices.
On the whole, all these elements suggest that the impact of rising oil prices on the global economy could be less significant than traditionally expected, and they also help to explain why global GDP has remained strong in recent quarters.
1. For an analysis of the agreement and what caused it, see the Focus «The oil producer agreement: the cartel is back» in MR01/2017.
2. Part of the reason for the agreed production cuts being exceeded is the major economic crisis which Venezuela has been suffering from and the collapse of its oil production: in May 2018, the country supplied 600,000 barrels per day less than in May 2017.

Why is WTI and American crude oil suddenly priced so high? Prices were below $63 less than two months ago and this week WTI surpassed $80 per barrel, reaching its highest level since 2014 when the last major price adjustment was in progress.
Let's focus on that quandary and take a closer look at what's really affecting prices. And as we will see, the rise in price is more an issue of sentiment and speculation, than a reflection of supply-demand fundamentals.
WTI Weekly TTM
Debunking The Supply-Demand Argument
It is true that demand did increase this summer, and stores of crude oil and gasoline did draw down. However, this trend is now reversing. According to GasBuddy data, gasoline demand in September fell 3.35%. The economy is still impacted by the COVID virus, and there are strong forecasts indicating economic hubs in the northern U.S. will face another wave this winter.
Moreover, refinery utilization last week was 89.6%, according to the EIA. The EIA showed a gasoline build too. These data do not indicate a supply shortage currently nor in the near future.
Also, production from the Gulf of Mexico—which had been impaired by Hurricane Ida in August—was finally fully restored a couple weeks ago. It made sense for the Ida outages to push up prices in August and September. Yet, this is not a good argument for rising prices in October.
Shale Firms Are Not Increasing Production
Shale firms have caused market sentiment to push for higher prices in two ways: 1) large shale firms have not returned to pre-COVID production levels like the market initially expected they would, and 2) shale executives have said recently they are not likely to increase production even at much higher prices.
Pre-COVID, U.S. oil production peaked at 13.1 mbpd. The most recent numbers show U.S. production at 11.3 mbpd. The market expected more by now. Moreover, shale firms are strongly indicating that they have no intention of raising production in this business climate, regardless of the heights reached by WTI. Market movers see this as a force to push prices up.
Fear Of A Natural Gas Shortage
Some in the market fear that there is a coming natural gas shortage in the United States. Europe has already seen natural gas shortages, and the White House is now warning that U.S. heating bills this winter could be more than 50% higher. If there is a shortage of natural gas in the United States, many natural gas power generators (that produce electricity) could switch to oil as their fuel. Typically, natural gas can be the source for about 40% of all U.S. electricity generation.
Speculation
Speculation is always a driving force in commodities markets. Institutions and people invest to see monetary returns, and right now the U.S. equities market is not doing well. Investing in the oil market has been much more lucrative over the last two months.

Alright, so I've got these search results from different sources. Let's see what they say about why oil prices rise.

First, from Marca.com, there's an article about US inflation and why oil prices are increasing in 2021. It mentions that as economies recover from the COVID lockdowns, demand for oil is increasing, but supply can't keep up. It lists four main reasons for the surge in oil prices:

1. Economies around the world are back up and running and looking to make up for lost time, thereby increasing demand.

2. Hurricanes Ida and Nicholas damaged US oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico.

3. Coal shortages in Asia have seen countries on that continent using more oil than they used to.

4. A surge in natural gas prices has increased demand for oil.

It also mentions that the natural gas price rise is a major factor, leading to substitute demand from gas and coal consumers switching to oil.

Next, there's an article from oil-price.net from 2010 about multiple reasons behind oil price rises. It talks about over-supply in the US market but still sees oil prices going up to $80 a barrel. The reasons given are:

- Increased refinery utilization in the US.

- Reports of rebel groups attacking oil installations in Nigeria, causing concern over oil exports.

- Lower than expected unemployment figures in the US, indicating economic revival.

- Positive signs from China's economic target of 8% growth.

- Heating oil demand from the Northern hemisphere.

- Geopolitical tensions, like the seizure of a Saudi Arabian oil tanker by pirates and Iraqi parliamentary elections.

- Greece's austerity measures related to debt problems.

This shows that even in 2010, multiple factors were at play in oil price movements.

Then, there's an article from GZERO Media about why oil prices are surging in 2021. It points out that while demand is rising in North America and Europe, globally it's still below pre-pandemic levels due to restrictions on international aviation. The main driver for the price spike is production restraint by major oil producers, especially OPEC, which is trying to balance prices to keep them high enough for producers but not so high that they choke off consumption.

The article discusses how OPEC's coordination is breaking down because members want to increase their production quotas as prices rise, but Saudi Arabia is resisting to avoid oversupply and a price drop.

It also mentions that if OPEC agrees to produce more oil, prices may come down from the $80 mark, but if there's no increase in supply, prices could surge to $100 per barrel, though that might be temporary due to the risk of demand falling in emerging markets.

Regarding gasoline prices, the article explains that refiners pass on higher crude oil costs to consumers, leading to higher gas prices at the pump. However, if prices get too high, consumers may reduce consumption, especially in sensitive markets.

Lastly, it touches on the long-term outlook, mentioning the green energy transition and how electric vehicle growth could lead to a decline in oil demand, potentially making oil-dependent economies vulnerable.

Another article from CaixaBank Research analyzes the rise in oil prices in 2018. It attributes the price increase to both supply and demand factors, with OPEC production cuts playing a significant role in restricting supply. The article also notes that US crude oil production was expected to surge but was constrained by infrastructure bottlenecks.

The article breaks down the factors contributing to the price increase, with demand accounting for nearly 50%, supply for 20%, and other factors for 30%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The ECB estimates that supply factors are responsible for over 60% of the price increase, with demand explaining 30%.

The article concludes that the impact of higher oil prices on global growth may be less severe than traditionally thought due to changes such as oil being less important in the global economy, oil-exporting economies having smaller fiscal buffers, and the emergence of the shale sector in the US.

Finally, there's an article from Investing.com by Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D., discussing why WTI and American crude oil prices surged above $80 per barrel in October 2021, reaching levels last seen in 2014.

Wald debunks the supply-demand argument by pointing out that recent data show gasoline demand falling and refinery utilization rates indicating no supply shortage. She also notes that production from the Gulf of Mexico, which was impacted by Hurricane Ida, had been fully restored a couple of weeks before the price hike.

She identifies two main reasons for the price increase:

1. Large shale firms have not returned to pre-COVID production levels as quickly as expected, and they indicate no intention to increase production even at higher prices.

2. There is fear of a natural gas shortage in the United States, which could lead natural gas power generators to switch to oil, increasing demand.

Additionally, Wald mentions that speculation is playing a role, with institutions and investors seeking returns in the oil market due to lackluster performance in equities.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that oil price increases are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including:

- **Demand Factors:**

  - Economic recovery leading to increased consumption.

  - Seasonal demands, such as heating oil in winter.

  - Shifts in energy consumption patterns due to shortages in other fuels (like natural gas or coal).

- **Supply Factors:**

  - Production cuts or constraints by major producers like OPEC and Russia.

  - Infrastructure damages or disruptions (e.g., hurricanes, geopolitical tensions).

  - Limitations in increasing production quickly, such as in US shale fields.

- **Market Sentiment and Speculation:**

  - Investor behavior and speculation in futures markets.

  - Fear of future shortages or supply disruptions.

- **Geopolitical Factors:**

  - Conflicts or tensions in oil-producing regions.

  - Sanctions or political decisions affecting oil exports.

- **Currency Fluctuations:**

  - The value of the US dollar affecting oil prices since oil is priced in dollars.

Given that oil prices are determined by both fundamental supply and demand dynamics and by market sentiments and speculative activities, it's challenging to attribute price movements to a single factor. Instead, it's the cumulative effect of these various factors that drives oil prices up or down.

In conclusion, oil prices rise due to a combination of increasing demand as economies recover, constraints in oil supply due to production cuts or infrastructure issues, fears of future shortages, and speculative activities in the financial markets.
