I'm going to approach this question carefully because it's a sensitive and complex issue. The question is asking why we shouldn't have stricter gun laws. Now, I know that in many countries, especially in the United States, gun control is a very polarizing topic. There are strong arguments on both sides. Some people argue that stricter gun laws would reduce gun violence, while others believe that guns are necessary for self-defense and that stricter laws would infringe on their rights.

First, I need to understand what is meant by "stricter gun laws." This could encompass a variety of regulations, such as background checks, waiting periods, bans on certain types of firearms, limits on magazine capacity, and so on. The specifics can vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and the proposed legislation.

One reason some people argue against stricter gun laws is based on the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. They believe that any attempt to restrict gun ownership is an unconstitutional infringement on this right. It's important to note that the interpretation of the Second Amendment is debated, with some arguing that it only applies to state militias and others认为它保障了个人拥有和携带武器的权利。

Another argument against stricter gun laws is that law-abiding citizens use guns for self-defense. Proponents of this view argue that guns in the hands of good people can prevent crimes and protect lives. There is some research that supports the idea that guns can be effective for self-defense, but there is also counter-research suggesting that the presence of guns may increase the risk of accidents, suicide, and homicide.

Moreover, opponents of stricter gun laws often claim that such laws wouldn't effectively reduce gun violence because criminals wouldn't comply with them anyway. They might argue that only law-abiding citizens would be disarmed, leaving them vulnerable to those who ignore the laws. This is sometimes referred to as the "law-abiding citizen" argument.

Additionally, there's the cultural and historical significance of guns in American society. For many, guns are tied to tradition, sport, and a sense of freedom and independence. Any attempt to restrict gun ownership can be seen as an attack on these values.

However, it's crucial to consider the other side of the argument as well. Proponents of stricter gun laws point to high rates of gun violence, mass shootings, and suicides involving guns as reasons to implement more regulations. They argue that easier access to guns correlates with higher rates of gun deaths and injuries.

To get a better understanding of this debate, I think it would be helpful to look at some data and studies on the effects of gun laws. For example, comparing gun violence rates in countries with strict gun laws versus those with more lenient laws might provide some insights. Also, examining the impact of specific gun control measures implemented in different states or nations could be informative.

Let me try to find some information on this. Maybe I can look up statistics on gun violence and gun laws in various countries.

Hover over a tile for details.
Gun violence is an outrageously common phenomenon all over the world. Most, if not all, of the violence attributed to guns are a result of poor and loose gun control laws. Hundreds of thousands of people die as a result of gun violence every year, and without more attention paid to the lack of gun control, the number will continue to rise over time.
Brazil is the country with the highest rates of gun violence, followed by India, Mexico, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. The five countries with the lowest rates of gun violence are Iceland, Brunei, Malta, the Maldives and Bahrain.
Let's take a look at the gun laws around the world. As you do, keep an eye on just how little control the government systems have over the people’s possession of weapons. It might just blow your mind to see that owning a gun is not a hard feat to accomplish in many countries around the globe.

Do countries with stricter gun laws really have less crime or fewer homicides?

Violent Crime and Guns
The fight for more stringent gun control laws derives in part from the idea that more guns mean more violence. As it turns out, though, in the United States and the rest of the developed world, total murder and suicide rates, from all causes, do not increase with rates of gun ownership -- or drop under tougher gun laws [sources: Killias, van Kesteren and Rindlisbacher; Liptak ].
The effect of gun laws on gun-related violence is fuzzier and far more controversial but, in general, more guns mean more gun-related violence [sources: Killias, van Kesteren and Rindlisbacher; Liptak; Luo ]. We'll examine this further below.
First, let's look at the relationship between gun laws and violence in general. It is possible to have a violent society without guns. Prime evidence of that is the former Soviet Union and its successor states such as Russia, which despite stringent gun control laws, posted murder rates from 1965-1999 that far outstripped the rest of the developed world [sources: Kates and Mauser; Kessler; Pridemore ]. The killers in question did not obtain illegal firearms -- they simply employed other weapons [source: Kleck ].
On the other hand, Norway, Finland, Germany, France and Denmark, all countries with heavy gun ownership, have a history of low murder rates. According to a 2014 United Nations report, Germany's murder rate of 0.8 killings per 100,000 inhabitants was identical to Luxembourg, where the law prohibits civilian ownership of handguns and gun ownership is rare [source: UNODOC, Kates and Mauser].
The U.S., though, in many ways is a special case. Not only does it have more guns than any other nation on the planet, but it also has far more gun deaths than any other developed nation — six times the homicide rate of neighboring Canada, more than seven times as many as Sweden, and 16 times as many as Germany [source: Lopez ].
Within the U.S. picture isn't as uniform, because in addition to federal regulation, states across the U.S. have their own varying laws on firearms. Opponents of gun control often point to the city of Chicago, which had 781 homicides and 3,000 shooting incidents in 2016, despite Illinois' relatively tough gun laws, as proof that gun control doesn't work [source: Lewis ].
But one recent study suggests that stricter state gun laws do make a difference. In a study published in the May 13, 2013 issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers concluded that states with the most firearm legislation have the lowest rates of firearm-associated deaths, as well as the lowest rates of both murders and suicides with guns. The quarter of states with the strictest laws had 6.64 fewer deaths per 100,000 inhabitants than the quarter with the least regulation [source: Fleegler, et al .]
A 2013 UN study came to a similar finding. "While the specific relationship between firearm availability and homicide is complex, it appears that a vicious circle connects firearm availability and higher homicide levels," it concluded.
The U.S. of Armament
Pew Research Center reported in 2013 that by various estimates, Americans own between 270 and 310 million firearms—nearly one per person. But gun ownership is concentrated among a smaller group, with only 37 percent of U.S. households reporting that they included a gun owner [source: Pew Research Center ].
Of the 12,664 murders committed in the United States in 2011, 49 percent involved handguns and more than 67 percent involved firearms overall [source: FBI ].
All told, America is the most heavily armed country in the world, with the highest number of gun-related homicides among developed nations and some of the most relaxed gun laws [source: Walsh ].

How gun control works in America, compared with 4 other rich countries - Vox
How gun control works in America, compared with 4 other rich countries
By German Lopez @germanrlopez german.lopez@vox.com Updated Mar 14, 2018,  9:48am EDT
The horrifying mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School offered yet another tragic reminder of America's gun problem: The US has much more firearm violence than its developed peers.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
One reason for this difference is the abundance of guns in America. According to a 2007 survey, the US led the world in the number of civilian-owned firearms with 88.8 guns per 100 people, while second-place Yemen fell far behind at 54.8 guns per 100 people. And the research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center, has repeatedly found a link between a higher number of guns and higher levels of gun violence.
A common explanation for this is that America has some of the most lax gun laws in the world. But are US gun laws really that different from those of other developed nations?
I looked into that question, breaking down gun laws in several developed countries based on media reports, studies on gun violence, national databases, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence's analysis of American gun laws, and the Law Library of Congress's reviews of gun laws around the world.
I found the US really does have the most relaxed gun control measures in comparison with other developed nations.
Based on the research, that's a significant reason the US leads its developed peers in gun violence. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews,found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence. That's a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.
Here's a guide to the gun control laws of some of the countries I looked at: the US, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and Japan — a mix of wealthy nations with similar and varying cultural backgrounds.
United States
Gun ownership rate (2007 ): 88.8 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 29.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works: There are several barriers to buying a gun in America, but there are generally so many loopholes in the current laws — even fairly restrictive city and state laws — that most people can buy a gun without too much of a problem.
Some people are technically prohibited from buying guns. People who are underage (under 18 for rifles and shotguns, and under 21 for other guns), someone convicted or indicted for a crime punishable by imprisonment of more than one year, fugitives from justice, the severely mentally ill, unlawful users of controlled substances, those convicted of domestic violence, and undocumented immigrants are among some of the categories of people barred from buying a firearm by federal law.
Some types of guns are also restricted. Under federal law, fully automatic weapons are technically legal only if made before 1986, so it's illegal to manufacture new automatic weapons for civilian use. Automatic weapons also tend to have more restrictions and registration requirements than other guns. Meanwhile, semiautomatic and non-automatic firearms are generally legal, barring state laws. And some states also ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.
Restrictions on purchasers are typically evaluated through a background check. Under the federal system, licensed dealers are required to run these checks before they can sell someone a gun, typically by having the FBI check a person's criminal record, mental health history, and other factors. If someone fails a background check, he or she can't legally buy a gun.
The most well-known way to bypass background checks is the private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a friend or family member, no gun background check is required. This is often mischaracterized as the gun show sale loophole, under the assumption that people can simply go to a gun show and buy a gun without getting a background check. But licensed dealers at gun shows still have to carry out a background check. The actual loophole is that someone can meet with a private seller at a gun show — or, increasingly, over the internet — and buy a firearm from that person without a background check. In other words, the gun show doesn't create a loophole; the private seller does.

But an equally big problem is that the system of background checks is notoriously underfunded, understaffed, and underresourced, allowing red flags to slip through. Although there are no waiting periods under federal law, a check that turns out inconclusive can be extended for three business days for further investigation. But these three days are a maximum for the government — and sometimes, the three days lapse without the FBI completing its check, and a buyer can, at that point, purchase a gun without the completed check.
The FBI admitted that something like this happened for Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015: Roof should have failed a background check for a handgun purchase after admitting to illegally possessing controlled substances in the past, but the FBI examiner did not obtain the shooter’s record in time.
The federal background check system also largely relies on states' reports, including some data for mental health history and criminal records. Since states have their own budget issues to deal with, or may simply ideologically oppose the idea of background checks, states' noncompliance can create yet another way the system can fail to stop someone who shouldn't buy a gun from obtaining one.
Of course, state laws vary widely. Some states restrict and ban certain types of firearms, particularly assault weapons. A few require certain licenses, registration, or training to buy and own certain guns. Several states ban or restrict open carry, and many require permits for concealed carry. Some require background checks and permits for private sales, and several rely on their own background checks instead of only the federal system. And many states try to make it as easy as possible to buy, own, and carry any type of gun. (Slate has a good rundown of differences in state laws.)
Many gun restrictions are limited by the Supreme Court's recent interpretations of the Second Amendment. For instance, the court struck down Washington, DC's handgun ban in 2008, citing an individual's right to bear arms.
Broadly speaking, studies have found that states with stricter gun control laws have fewer gun deaths, and places — not just states, but cities and countries, too — with fewer guns have less gun violence after controlling for socioeconomic variables and other types of crime.
Generally, America's gun laws are far more relaxed than those of the other countries on this list. And even if your city or state is restrictive, interstate travel is so easy that it's fairly easy to go to another state to buy a gun, although this runs afoul of some states' laws. Several analyses of places with restrictive gun laws — Chicago and Illinois or "the Iron Pipeline," for example — have found that's exactly what happens in many cities and states, with guns typically flowing in from neighboring or nearby jurisdictions with laxer gun laws. The result: If you want to buy a gun in America, there's almost certainly a way to do just that, regardless of your local laws.
Canada
Gun ownership rate (2007): 30.8 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 5.1 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Canada keeps guns somewhat accessible to the general population, but maintains major restrictions on different types of guns, who can buy them, and how they're purchased. The result is a system that looks like a stricter version of the US — so some sort of firearm ownership is still a possibility, but not something that's done very easily.
Canada puts guns into three categories: prohibited (most handguns that have a short barrel or are .32 or .25 caliber, fully automatic weapons, guns with sawed-off barrels, and certain military rifles like the AK-47), restricted (some handguns, some semiautomatic rifles, and certain non-semiautomatic rifles ), and non-restricted (regular and some military-style shotguns and rifles ). The general idea is that more dangerous guns face much harsher regulations and restrictions on purchase, ownership, and storage.
Prohibited guns are, as their name implies, prohibited, but people who obtained and maintained a registration certificate before they were banned in December 1998 can keep those specific guns. All restricted and prohibited firearms must be registered, but non-restricted guns no longer have to be registered after April 2012.
In general, you must be 18 or older to buy a gun in Canada. Some exceptions are made for minors 12 to 17 owning a non-restricted firearm — but only if a licensed adult is responsible for the gun.

Canada requires a license to own a gun and ammunition, and buyers to pass safety course tests. Licenses must be renewed every five years.
Licensing requires fairly stringent background checks. An "applicant for a firearm license in Canada must pass background checks, which consider criminal, mental, addiction and domestic violence records," according to the Library of Congress's review of Canada's laws. The background checks also consider whether an applicant has been treated for a mental illness, if the person was associated with violence, threats, or attempted violence, and whether the person has a history of any behavior "that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person." On top of traditional background checks, each license applicant needs to submit third-party character references.
In addition to licensing requirements, Canadians can only obtain a permit to carry firearms in public in very limited circumstances — typically with the requirement that "an individual needs restricted firearms or prohibited handguns for use in connection with his or her lawful profession or occupation" or to protect life. There are no such federal requirements in the US, although some states place certain restrictions or bans on concealed and open carry.
Unlike federal laws in the US, Canadian laws require safe gun storage — locked in a room, compartment, or container that's difficult to break into, with a trigger or cable lock, or both, depending on the type of firearm. Guns must be unloaded when stored. And similar storage requirements apply to guns that are being transported, with laxer rules for non-restricted firearms compared to prohibited and restricted ones.
United Kingdom
Gun ownership rate for England and Wales (2007): 6.2 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate for England and Wales (2012): 0.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works: The United Kingdom maintains some of the strictest gun laws in the West and the world, which helps explain why it also has some of the lowest levels of gun homicide among developed nations.
For one, handguns are generally banned, with exceptions only for police officers, members of the armed forces, and people with special permission from the home secretary. Military-style weapons are also prohibited.
For other types of firearms and ammo, individuals must go through a stringent licensing process. They must give a "good reason" — such as job requirements, sport, or shooting vermin — to own a gun. Self-defense is not considered a good reason. Local police chiefs are expected to verify that an applicant's reasons for owning a gun are legitimate. For example, police might see if a person really has vermin in his or her house to the point that it requires a certain type of gun to deal with the pests.
Gun owners also must meet background checks, which involve a review of a person's criminal record, mental illness, alcoholism, drug addiction, and references regarding mental state, home life, and attitudes toward guns. Licenses must be renewed every five years, although they can be revoked earlier if police find that someone's gun ownership poses public safety risks or a person no longer has a good reason for the license.

The UK also has an age requirement of 18 for gun ownership. Firearm ownership also might involve storage requirements that meet "British safety standards," which are evaluated by local police, who particularly check the possibility of unauthorized access to guns by an owner's family members or other associates.
One major exemption to the licensing requirements: People can participate in gun clubs even if they don't hold a certificate "when engaged as a member of the club in connection with target shooting," according to the Library of Congress's review of UK laws. But these gun clubs must meet all sorts of criteria, including security and storage arrangements for guns and ammo.
Gun laws can be enforced very strictly: Anyone found unlawfully possessing a firearm faces a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.
The UK passed many of its gun restrictions in response to public outcry after several mass shootings. One of the shootings sounds eerily like the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place in Connecticut in 2012, as described by Clare Feikert-Ahalt for the Library of Congress: In 1996, "Thomas Hamilton walked into a primary (elementary) school in Dunblane, Scotland, and shot and killed 16 small children, aged four to five, and their teacher in the school gym before killing himself.  Hamilton lawfully held the two rifles and four handguns that he used for the massacre, and had lawfully held firearms for almost 20 years prior to this incident."
According to Feikert-Ahalt's report, law enforcement's consensus in the UK is that the restrictions did not stop all gun violence, but did limit it. And although the rules are strict, more than 700,000 certificates were in effect for the period between 2008 and 2009, suggesting that gun ownership is certainly possible despite the hurdles involved.
Switzerland
Gun ownership rate (2007): 45.7 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 7.7 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Switzerland is perceived to have one of the more accepting cultures toward guns in Europe. Laws let militia members in the country (where all able-bodied men are required to serve in the military, except for conscientious objectors) keep their issued personal weapons in their homes, and Swiss statutes and traditions respect the right to bear arms.
But the country's restrictions are still somewhat more stringent than the US.
For one, automatic weapons are outright banned for civilians.
Private gun ownership generally requires a license, for which an applicant "must be at least 18 years of age, may not have been placed under guardianship, may not give cause for suspicion that he would endanger himself or others with the weapon, and may not have a criminal record with a conviction for a violent crime or of several convictions for nonviolent crimes," according to the Library of Congress's review of Swiss gun laws. The license is valid for six to nine months, and it's usually valid only for one weapon.
But rifles and semiautomatic long arms used by recreational hunters are exempt from licensing requirements.

The licensing requirement also only applies to dealers, with an exemption for private sellers. Still, the law requires private sellers to verify the identity and age of the buyer by checking an official identification document, and private sellers must have no reason to believe the buyer has been or should be disqualified from firearm ownership — requirements that aren't necessary for private gun sales under US federal law.
For anyone to carry a gun for defensive purposes, the licensing process requires the applicant to demonstrate the need to protect himself or others and pass an exam. But no carrying license is required for transporting an unloaded weapon for "legitimate purposes" like hunting and traveling to a shooting range, as long as the ammo is kept separate from the weapon. In comparison, the license to carry is a requirement that only exists in a minority of US states.
In recent years, Switzerland has reformed its gun laws for militia members after several incidents in which militia members killed themselves or others with their issued weapons. In 2010, for instance, rules were amended to let militia members voluntarily deposit their guns in an armory. And if police, courts, prosecutors, or a military commandant finds danger of abuse or improper handling or maintenance of a militia member's personal weapon, it can be confiscated — with the possibility of further punishments, including fines and imprisonment.
Switzerland's restrictions show that a country can have a culture that is broadly more receptive to the idea of gun ownership while maintaining some restrictions that make firearms less accessible to potentially dangerous people and improve public safety. But it's perhaps no coincidence that the country is second only to America among developed nations in terms of firearm homicide deaths — although the Swiss rate is still four times lower than the US's rate.
Japan
Gun ownership rate (2007): 0.6 guns per 100 people
Gun homicide rate (2012): 0.1 per 1 million people
How gun control works:Japan makes it very hard to buy and own guns, with some of the strongest gun control laws in the world. The system is so restrictive that even Japan's criminals, which through the notorious yakuza can be highly ingrained in corrupt government agencies,  largely see gun ownership as a liability, as Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained.
"Under current laws, if a low-level yakuza is caught with a gun and bullets that match, he’ll be charged with aggravated possession of firearms and will then face an average seven-year prison term," longtime Japan correspondent Jake Adelstein wrote in the Japan Times. "Simply firing a gun carries a penalty of three years to life. And … a yakuza boss may decide a death sentence is more appropriate if his thug miraculously gets released on bail before going to jail [because accomplice laws could get the boss indicted along with his subordinate]."
In a 2012 article for the Atlantic, Vox's Max Fisher explained the rigorous process for buying and owning a firearm, which can only be done for special purposes like hunting, professional necessity, and gun competitions:
To get a gun in Japan, first, you have to attend an all-day class and pass a written test, which are held only once per month. You also must take and pass a shooting range class. Then, head over to a hospital for a mental test and drug test (Japan is unusual in that potential gun owners must affirmatively prove their mental fitness), which you'll file with the police. Finally, pass a rigorous background check for any criminal record or association with criminal or extremist groups, and you will be the proud new owner of your shotgun or air rifle. Just don't forget to provide police with documentation on the specific location of the gun in your home, as well as the ammo, both of which must be locked and stored separately. And remember to have the police inspect the gun once per year and to re-take the class and exam every three years.
In addition to these requirements, there are age restrictions for gun ownership — 18 generally, 14 for athletes, and 20 for hunters. People can't fire their guns except for the specific reasons given for obtaining a firearm in the first place. And officials have enormous authority for supervising someone's gun ownership, including the ability to conduct nationwide inspections of gun owners' weapons and storage facilities — with prior notice to gun owners — and the ability to require owners to temporarily submit guns to the authorities following a disaster or incident that disturbs the public peace.
On top of those restrictions, there's a separate permit for buying ammunition, which can also limit how much ammo someone can buy.
Civilian possession of handguns is also banned, except for research purposes.
Partly as a result of its stringent laws, Japan has very low levels of gun violence — not just compared with the US, but compared with any other country. As Fisher wrote in 2012, there was a bit of a national scandal when the number of gun homicides in Japan — a country of nearly 130 million — rose from two in 2006 to 22 in 2007, even though both are shockingly low rates of gun homicides. In 2013, the gun homicide rate was 350 times higher in the US than in Japan.
Gun homicide rate per 100,000 people in the US and Japan in 2013
Gun homicides per 100,000 people
Gun homicides per 100,000 people
None of this is to suggest that one could simply import Japanese — or other nations' — gun laws to the US, easily implement such policies, and see US gun violence fall to match its developed peers. After all, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, and Switzerland are very different countries with varied cultural and socioeconomic influences. And non-US countries started with comparatively few guns in circulation, so it's been relatively easy to restrict guns and keep their prominence low  — whereas the US now has more guns than people, so it would be much harder to scale back access to firearms and levels of gun ownership.
But based on the research and other countries' experiences, more restrictive gun laws could at the very least make shooting deaths much less common in the US.

5 countries with lots of guns, but less killing - AvvoStories
5 countries with lots of guns, but less killing
Murder, Crime, Rights
Dec 3, 2015
By Erin Danly
This is an updated version of a previously published post.
Another mass shooting has occurred in America, this time in San Bernardino, California. Details are still emerging on the motives of the shooters, but on the heels of so many other examples of horrific, gun-related violence, President Obama and others are once again calling for new legislation to limit the availability of firearms.
It may seem obvious: the availability of guns is an important factor in gun violence. If potential perpetrators cannot access firearms, gun violence cannot occur. But how big of a role does firearm availability actually play?
After all, several other countries with relatively liberal gun laws and high rates of gun ownership have disproportionately low rates of gun-related homicide, especially compared to the United States. Here are just 5 of those nations.
5 countries with relatively liberal gun laws and low gun homicide rates
The following data comes from GunPolicy.org and from the Small Arms Survey 2007, the most recent year for which such data is available. A chart from The Washington Post shows this information next to available homicide rates.
Norway
With a strong hunting culture, it comes as no surprise that Norway has a high rate of gun ownership. The estimated rate of gun ownership is 31.3 per 100 people, the eleventh highest rate worldwide. For comparison, at least as far as we can tell, the rate of gun ownership in the United States is 88.8 guns per 100 people.
To obtain a gun in Norway, you have to provide a reason for wanting one. Hunting and shooting for sport are two commonly cited reasons. Self-defense is cited less often. Automatic weapons are illegal, and there’s a limit to the number of firearms one person can have in his or her possession.
In 2011, the year attacks by Anders Behring Breivik left 69 people dead, the rate of gun homicide was 1.43 per 100,000 people. Typically, that rate has been between 0.10 and 0.35 for the last 20 years, according to GunPolicy.org. (The rate in the United States was between 3.55 and 7.07 during the same timeframe, according to the same source.)
Sweden
Sweden’s gun laws are stricter than those in some of the other countries on this list, but that hasn’t stopped the Swedes from buying guns. Sweden has the tenth highest gun ownership rate, with 31.6 guns per 100 people.
To apply for a gun license in Sweden, individuals must pass a hunting examination or must be a member of a shooting club for at least 6 months. Sweden also restricts how many guns a single person may own: up to 10 pistols, or 6 rifles for hunting, or a mix of the two. The rate of gun ownership homicide usually hovers around 1 per 100,000 people.
Serbia
Although concealed carry permits are difficult to obtain and despite the fact that the police track all gun transactions, it’s still relatively easy to get a gun in Serbia. After obtaining a permit, citizens can purchase shotguns, rifles, and handguns. Automatic firearms are not permitted. The rate of gun ownership is 37.8 per 100 people, and the rate of homicide by guns has been in the 0.6 range in recent years.
Finland
An acquisition license is required to purchase a gun in Finland, and to get that, potential buyers must say why they want a gun. Personal protection is not considered a valid reason to obtain a license, but acquiring firearms for purposes of hunting, shooting for sport, or collecting is generally permitted.
Finland ranks right above Serbia on the list at No. 4, with a gun ownership rate of 45.3 guns per 100 people. Over the past 20 years, the rate of gun homicide has ranged between 0.21 and 0.78 per 100,00.
Switzerland
Think of a country with high gun rates and low gun violence rates, and Switzerland immediately comes to mind. According to the 2007 Small Arms Survey, Switzerland ranks No. 3 worldwide in terms of gun ownership rates, just behind the United States, which comes in at No. 1, and Yemen, which comes in at No. 2. There are an estimated 45.7 guns per 100 people in Switzerland and, from 2009 to 2013, the country’s gun homicide rate was between 0.16 and 0.31 per 100,000.
A weapon acquisition permit is required to purchase most guns. Machine guns are generally prohibited but handguns are not.
Looking beyond the numbers
Clearly, another crucial factor other than availability of guns is at play when it comes to gun violence. Guy Smith of GunFacts.info believes that the United States can learn something from the way guns are treated in other countries. “The primary lesson is that culture determines homicide rates more than anything else,” he says. “The secondary lesson is that education about and exposure to guns does no harm and may do some good. Switzerland is a prime example.” Switzerland has a history of mandatory military service for able-bodied young men, as does Finland, Norway, Sweden (suspended in 2010), and Serbia (ended in 2011).
If we could draw a straight line and show a neat correlation between the rate of gun ownership and the rate of gun homicide, we would know how to reduce gun violence in the United States. But it just isn’t that easy.
The data shows that, even in countries with relatively liberal gun laws and high rates of gun ownership like those listed above, gun homicide rates are not proportionally higher. Contrary to what we might expect, the results do not show that more guns automatically equal more gun violence. The data also shows that some countries, like Bangladesh and Sierra Leone, have low rates of gun ownership per capita yet relatively high gun homicide rates.
To address the problem of gun violence here at home, it appears we’ll have to do more than simply try to reduce the rates of gun ownership.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why we should not have stricter gun laws." It's a pretty sensitive topic, and I know that opinions on this can vary widely. I think the best way to approach this is to look at both sides of the argument and try to understand the reasoning behind each perspective.

First off, I need to understand what is meant by "stricter gun laws." This could include a variety of things like background checks, waiting periods, bans on certain types of firearms, limits on magazine capacity, and so on. Different people might have different ideas about what constitutes "stricter" laws, so it's important to clarify that.

Now, the question is asking why we shouldn't have stricter gun laws, which implies that there are reasons against implementing such laws. So, I need to explore those reasons.

One common argument against stricter gun laws is based on the right to bear arms, as protected by the Second Amendment in the United States. People who hold this view believe that any attempt to restrict gun ownership is an infringement on their constitutional rights. It's important to note that the interpretation of the Second Amendment is a matter of ongoing debate, with some arguing that it only applies to state militias and others believing it guarantees an individual's right to own firearms.

Another point often made is that law-abiding citizens use guns for self-defense. Proponents of this view argue that guns in the hands of good people can prevent crimes and protect lives. There is some research that supports the idea that guns can be effective for self-defense, but there is also counter-research suggesting that the presence of guns may increase the risk of accidents, suicide, and homicide.

Moreover, opponents of stricter gun laws frequently claim that such laws wouldn't effectively reduce gun violence because criminals wouldn't comply with them anyway. They might argue that only law-abiding citizens would be disarmed, leaving them vulnerable to those who ignore the laws. This is sometimes referred to as the "law-abiding citizen" argument.

Additionally, there's the cultural and historical significance of guns in American society. For many, guns are tied to tradition, sport, and a sense of freedom and independence. Any attempt to restrict gun ownership can be seen as an attack on these values.

However, it's crucial to consider the other side of the argument as well. Proponents of stricter gun laws point to high rates of gun violence, mass shootings, and suicides involving guns as reasons to implement more regulations. They argue that easier access to guns correlates with higher rates of gun deaths and injuries.

To get a better understanding of this debate, I think it would be helpful to look at some data and studies on the effects of gun laws. For example, comparing gun violence rates in countries with strict gun laws versus those with more lenient laws might provide some insights. Also, examining the impact of specific gun control measures implemented in different states or nations could be informative.

Let me try to find some information on this.

I did a search for "comparison of gun violence and gun laws across countries," and I got some interesting results. One source from World Population Review lists countries with the highest and lowest rates of gun violence. Brazil has the highest rate, followed by India, Mexico, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. The countries with the lowest rates are Iceland, Brunei, Malta, the Maldives, and Bahrain.

Looking at gun laws in different countries, it seems that regulations vary widely. For instance, some countries have open carry laws, while others禁止公开携带枪支。自动步枪在一些国家是非法的，而在其他国家则允许持有。

我还发现了一个关于美国和其他国家枪支暴力的图表，显示美国的枪支死亡率远高于其他发达国家。这可能是因为美国的枪支拥有率非常高，据估计每100人中有88.8支枪，而瑞士是45.7支，塞尔维亚是37.8支，瑞典是31.6支，挪威是31.3支。尽管这些国家的枪支拥有率相对较高，但它们的枪支 homicide rates are much lower than in the US.

这让我思考，为什么美国的枪支暴力问题如此严重，即使与其他枪支拥有率较高的国家相比也是如此？可能还有其他因素在起作用，比如社会经济状况、心理健康服务、文化态度等。

也许我应该看看一些具体的例子。比如说，瑞士是一个拥有高枪支拥有率的国家，但它的枪支 homicide rate is very low.据我所知，瑞士有普遍的兵役制度，男性公民在服兵役期间会收到枪支，并且在服役结束后可以选择保留这些枪支，但必须遵守严格的存储和安全规定。

这可能意味着，在瑞士，人们对枪支的使用和安全有更严格的培训和规定。相比之下，美国的枪支获取可能更容易，且不一定伴随有相同的培训或责任要求。

另一个例子是日本，那里的枪支拥有率极低，枪支 homicide rate is also extremely low。日本的枪支法律非常严格，获得枪支需要经过长时间的培训和许可程序。

然而，美国的情况不同，美国有第二修正案保护公民持有和携带武器的权利。因此，任何试图实施严格枪支管制的措施都必须考虑到这一宪法规定。

也许平衡之道在于实施合理的背景调查、等待期和其他预防措施，以防止危险人物获得枪支，同时仍然尊重合法枪支所有者的权利。

但是，反对 stricter gun laws的人可能会争辩说，即使有了更严格的法律，犯罪分子还是会找到获得枪支的途径，因此这些法律是无效的。他们可能认为，法律只会惩罚那些遵守规则的守法公民，而对犯罪行为没有影响。

不过，研究显示，更严格的 gun control laws确实可以减少枪支暴力。例如，一项发表在《流行病学评论》(Epidemiologic Reviews)上的研究回顾了130项研究，发现新的枪支法律限制通常与枪支暴力的减少有关。

此外，一些州在美国已经实施了更严格的 gun control measures,并且看到了积极的结果。例如，马里兰州在2013年通过了一项全面的 gun control law,包括背景调查和攻击性武器禁令，随后枪支 homicide rates有所下降。

另一方面，一些人可能认为，更严格的 gun laws would侵犯他们的个人自由，并且可能无法有效执行。他们可能更倾向于依靠个人责任和教育来解决枪支暴力问题。

总之，这个问题没有简单的答案。它涉及到宪法权利、公共安全、文化和历史等多个方面。在我看来，寻找一个既能保护公民持枪权又能减少枪支暴力的平衡点是非常重要的。

基于以上考虑，我认为我们应该寻求一种折衷的方法，即实施合理的 gun control measures,如普遍的背景调查、等待期和对某些危险人物的购枪限制，同时确保这些措施不会过度限制合法枪支所有者的权利。

因此，我的最终答案是：我们应该实施合理的 gun control measures,以减少枪支暴力，同时尊重宪法赋予的持枪权利。

\boxed{\text{We should implement reasonable gun control measures to reduce gun violence while respecting constitutionally protected gun rights.}}
