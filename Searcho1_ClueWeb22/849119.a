Alright, so I need to understand how scientific knowledge changes over time. This seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First off, science is all about understanding the natural world through observation and experimentation. So, scientific knowledge is essentially what we've learned about how the world works through scientific methods.

Now, I know that science isn't static; it evolves over time. But how exactly does that happen? I think one key aspect is new discoveries. As scientists conduct experiments and make observations, they sometimes find things that don't fit with existing theories. When that happens, they might need to adjust or even replace those theories to account for the new evidence.

Let me think of an example. Like, in the past, people believed that the Earth was flat, but over time, through observations and experiments, we came to understand that it's actually round. That's a pretty dramatic shift in scientific knowledge. But that might be an oversimplification because, actually, I think most educated people knew the Earth was round even back in ancient times. Wait, maybe I need to fact-check that.

Generally speaking “ancient people” did not believe that. We have known since the time of the ancient Greeks that the earth was a sphere. The only real argument was about how big it was. Stupidity and the denial of reality is a modern condition.

Why did ancient people believe the Earth was flat?
They didn't.
Usually, when we talk about ancient people, we mean the Greeks and Romans.
About 200 years before Christianity, Eratosthenes, a Greek scholar, measured the circumference of the Earth and got a value that is only about 10% different from the currently accepted value. That's a very good result, especially when you know that it depended on measuring the distance (about 800 km) between Alexandria and Syene in Egypt by getting a man to walk from one to the other counting steps.
From that time on almost noone, and noone with any education,

Depends what you define as “ancients”. Early maritime nations such as Greece realised thousands of years ago that the things they observed on the ocean could only happen on a globe earth. They didn’t have the knowledge to understand why that was so, but they were smart enough to understand what they were seeing. Just seeing the sun rise and set at different times depending on where they were and being able to navigate north to south using the sun was a practical example. The ancients also had plenty of time on their hands at night so they observed the stars and knew they appeared to rotate con

Once they did, yes, but when that changed varied from place to place. Most sea-faring people had the general idea of the Earth not being flat, and the traditional explanation is that the Ancient Greeks got the idea of the Earth being spherical about 2,600 years ago. By around 2,300 years ago, they had sufficient evidence and logic for Aristotle to be quite sure it was approximately spherical. By around 2,100 years ago, Eratosthenes was able to work from that knowledge to calculate its approximate size.
But what did ancient people really think about the Earth? What do the earliest religions say

Question: Why did people in antiquity believe the World was flat?
It is important to define “antiquity”. Eudoxus of Cnidus lived some 2.400 years ago (Εὔδοξος ὁ Κνίδιος, Eúdoxos ho Knídios; c. 390 – c. 337 BCE) and he proposed, after careful observations, the sphericity of Earth (and, by the way, of other bodies in the space).
However, non educated (or poorly educated) people did not learn of such facts for, say, several centuries.

They have some old representations of the world as being flat, but that’s true of our maps as well.

Long enough ago, sure.
Thales of Miletus was surprisingly scientifically minded for his time ( a long way from science though), but he imagined a flat earth floating on a giant sea.
Aristotle a little later was sure it was a sphere though.
In somebplaces (such as China) it was not as obvious that the earth was spherical (the ancient Greeks were a sea borne “empire”, where it was obvious. China is mostly land). In these areas the belief in a flat earth continued much later.

Not so much flat earth, but a confused perception of how space worked.
I was 4 years old in temple pre-school, when the teacher showed us an image of the Earth, telling us how the astronauts used to go down and land in the sea; and ships would pick them up.
I thought this meant that they landed at the bottom of the picture; and I wondered how that worked; i.e. if there were oceans down there, with ships sailing on them.

But people like Ross “Iron Horse” Thatcher are either trolls who just like to stir things up or they are truly unable to accept the world as it is.

Part of Aristotle's argument involved  the position of  the stars, but not the mere fact that their apparent position changed. That can be easily explained by positing that the stars are fixed to a rotating, trans

Did Medieval People Believe in a Flat Earth?

Robert Wilde
Updated on July 21, 2019
There is a piece of 'common knowledge' about the Middle Ages we have heard repeated over and over again: that medieval people thought the earth was flat. In addition, there's a second claim we've heard a few times: that Columbus faced opposition to his attempt to find a western route to Asia because people thought the earth was flat and he'd fall off. Widespread 'facts' with one very, very big problem: Columbus, and many if not most medieval people, knew the earth was round. As did many ancient Europeans, and those since.
The Truth
By the Middle Ages, there was a widespread belief among the educated that the Earth was a globe. Columbus did face opposition on his voyage, but not from people who thought he’d drop off the edge of the world. Instead, people believed he’d predicted too small a globe and would run out of supplies before he made it around to Asia. It was not edges of the world people feared, but the world being too big and round for them to cross with the technology available.

People in Europe probably did believe that the earth was flat at one stage, but that was in the very early ancient period, possible before the 4th century BCE, the very early phases of European civilization. It was around this date that Greek thinkers began to not only realize the earth was a globe but calculated the precise dimensions of our planet.
There was much discussion about which competing size theory was correct, and whether people lived on the other side of the world. The transition from the ancient world to the medieval one is often blamed for a loss of knowledge, a “move backward”, but the belief that the world was a globe is evident in writers from across the period. The few examples of those who doubted it have been stressed instead of the thousands of examples of those who didn’t.
Why the flat Earth myth?
The idea that medieval people thought the earth was flat appears to have spread in the late nineteenth century as a stick with which to beat the medieval Christian church, which is often blamed for restricting intellectual growth in the period. The myth also taps into people’s ideas of “progress” and of the medieval era as a period of savagery without much thought.
Professor Jeffrey Russell argues that the Columbus myth originated in a history of Columbus from 1828 by Washington Irving, which claimed that theologians and experts of the period opposed funding the voyages because the earth was flat. This is now known to be false, but anti-Christian thinkers seized upon it. Indeed, in a presentation summarizing his book ‘Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians,’ Russell states :
No one before the 1830s believed that medieval people thought that the Earth was flat.

The flat Earth model is an archaic and scientifically disproven conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk. Many ancient cultures subscribed to a flat Earth cosmography, including Greece until the classical period (323 BC), the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Near East until the Hellenistic period (31 BC), and China until the 17th century.
The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in ancient Greek philosophy with Pythagoras (6th century BC), although most pre-Socratics (6th–5th century BC) retained the flat Earth model. In the early 4th century BC, Plato wrote about a spherical Earth, and by about 330 BC his former student Aristotle had provided strong empirical evidence for this. Knowledge of the Earth's global shape then gradually began to spread beyond the Hellenistic world.[1] [2] [3] [4]
Despite the scientific fact and obvious effects of Earth's sphericity, pseudoscientific [5] flat Earth conspiracy theories are espoused by modern flat Earth societies and, increasingly, by unaffiliated individuals using social media.[6] [7]

Imago Mundi Babylonian map, the oldest known world map, 6th century BC Babylonia
In early Egyptian [8] and Mesopotamian thought, the world was portrayed as a disk floating in the ocean. A similar model is found in the Homeric account from the 8th century BC in which "Okeanos, the personified body of water surrounding the circular surface of the Earth, is the begetter of all life and possibly of all gods." [9]
The Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts of ancient Egypt show a similar cosmography; Nun (the Ocean) encircled nbwt ("dry lands" or "Islands"). [10] [11] [12][full citation needed]
The Israelites also imagined the Earth to be a disc floating on water with an arched firmament above it that separated the Earth from the heavens. [13] The sky was a solid dome with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars embedded in it. [14]
Greece
Poets
Both Homer [15] and Hesiod [16] described a disc cosmography on the Shield of Achilles.[17] [18] This poetic tradition of an Earth-encircling (gaiaokhos) sea (Oceanus) and a disc also appears in Stasinus of Cyprus, [19] Mimnermus,[20] Aeschylus,[21] and Apollonius Rhodius.[22]
Homer's description of the disc cosmography on the shield of Achilles with the encircling ocean is repeated far later in Quintus Smyrnaeus' Posthomerica (4th century AD), which continues the narration of the Trojan War. [23]
Philosophers
Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map [24]
Several pre-Socratic philosophers believed that the world was flat: Thales (c. 550 BC) according to several sources, [25] and Leucippus (c. 440 BC) and Democritus (c. 460–370 BC) according to Aristotle. [26] [27] [28]
Thales thought that the Earth floated in water like a log. [29] It has been argued, however, that Thales actually believed in a round Earth. [30] [31] Anaximander (c. 550 BC) believed that the Earth was a short cylinder with a flat, circular top that remained stable because it was the same distance from all things. [32] [33] Anaximenes of Miletus believed that "the Earth is flat and rides on air; in the same way the Sun and the Moon and the other heavenly bodies, which are all fiery, ride the air because of their flatness". [34]Xenophanes of Colophon (c. 500 BC) thought that the Earth was flat, with its upper side touching the air, and the lower side extending without limit. [35]
Belief in a flat Earth continued into the 5th century BC. Anaxagoras (c. 450 BC) agreed that the Earth was flat, [36] and his pupil Archelaus believed that the flat Earth was depressed in the middle like a saucer, to allow for the fact that the Sun does not rise and set at the same time for everyone. [37]
Historians
Hecataeus of Miletus believed that the Earth was flat and surrounded by water. [38] Herodotus in his Histories ridiculed the belief that water encircled the world, [39] yet most classicists agree that he still believed Earth was flat because of his descriptions of literal "ends" or "edges" of the Earth. [40]
Northern Europe
The ancient Norse and Germanic peoples believed in a flat Earth cosmography with the Earth surrounded by an ocean, with the axis mundi, a world tree (Yggdrasil ), or pillar (Irminsul) in the centre. [41] [42] In the world-encircling ocean sat a snake called Jormungandr.[43] The Norse creation account preserved in Gylfaginning (VIII) states that during the creation of the Earth, an impassable sea was placed around it: [44]
And Jafnhárr said: "Of the blood, which ran and welled forth freely out of his wounds, they made the sea, when they had formed and made firm the Earth together, and laid the sea in a ring round. about her; and it may well seem a hard thing to most men to cross over it."
The late Norse Konungs skuggsjá, on the other hand, explains Earth's shape as a sphere: [45]
If you take a lighted candle and set it in a room, you may expect it to light up the entire interior, unless something should hinder, though the room be quite large. But if you take an apple and hang it close to the flame, so near that it is heated, the apple will darken nearly half the room or even more. However, if you hang the apple near the wall, it will not get hot; the candle will light up the whole house; and the shadow on the wall where the apple hangs will be scarcely half as large as the apple itself. From this you may infer that the Earth-circle is round like a ball and not equally near the sun at every point. But where the curved surface lies nearest the sun's path, there will the greatest heat be; and some of the lands that lie continuously under the unbroken rays cannot be inhabited.
East Asia
Further information: Chinese astronomy
In ancient China, the prevailing belief was that the Earth was flat and square, while the heavens were round, [46] an assumption virtually unquestioned until the introduction of European astronomy in the 17th century. [47] [48] [49] The English sinologist Cullen emphasizes the point that there was no concept of a round Earth in ancient Chinese astronomy: [50]
Chinese thought on the form of the Earth remained almost unchanged from early times until the first contacts with modern science through the medium of Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century. While the heavens were variously described as being like an umbrella covering the Earth (the Kai Tian theory), or like a sphere surrounding it (the Hun Tian theory), or as being without substance while the heavenly bodies float freely (the Hsüan yeh theory), the Earth was at all times flat, although perhaps bulging up slightly.
Illustration based on that of a 12th-century Asian cosmographer
The model of an egg was often used by Chinese astronomers such as Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) to describe the heavens as spherical: [51]
The heavens are like a hen's egg and as round as a crossbow bullet; the Earth is like the yolk of the egg, and lies in the centre.
This analogy with a curved egg led some modern historians, notably Joseph Needham, to conjecture that Chinese astronomers were, after all, aware of the Earth's sphericity. The egg reference, however, was rather meant to clarify the relative position of the flat Earth to the heavens: [48]
In a passage of Zhang Heng's cosmogony not translated by Needham, Zhang himself says: "Heaven takes its body from the Yang, so it is round and in motion. Earth takes its body from the Yin, so it is flat and quiescent". The point of the egg analogy is simply to stress that the Earth is completely enclosed by Heaven, rather than merely covered from above as the Kai Tian describes. Chinese astronomers, many of them brilliant men by any standards, continued to think in flat-Earth terms until the seventeenth century; this surprising fact might be the starting-point for a re-examination of the apparent facility with which the idea of a spherical Earth found acceptance in fifth-century BC Greece.
Further examples cited by Needham supposed to demonstrate dissenting voices from the ancient Chinese consensus actually refer without exception to the Earth being square, not to it being flat. [50] Accordingly, the 13th-century scholar Li Ye, who argued that the movements of the round heaven would be hindered by a square Earth, [46] did not advocate a spherical Earth, but rather that its edge should be rounded off so as to be circular. [50] However, Needham disagrees, affirming that Li Ye believed the Earth to be spherical, similar in shape to the heavens but much smaller. [52] This was preconceived by the 4th-century scholar Yu Xi, who argued for the infinity of outer space surrounding the Earth and that the latter could be either square or round, in accordance to the shape of the heavens. [53] When Chinese geographers of the 17th century, influenced by European cartography and astronomy, showed the Earth as a sphere that could be circumnavigated by sailing around the globe, they did so with formulaic terminology previously used by Zhang Heng to describe the spherical shape of the Sun and Moon (i.e. that they were as round as a crossbow bullet). [54]
As noted in the book Huainanzi,[55] in the 2nd century BC, Chinese astronomers effectively inverted Eratosthenes' calculation of the curvature of the Earth to calculate the height of the Sun above the Earth. By assuming the Earth was flat, they arrived at a distance of 100 000 li (approximately 200 000 km ). The Zhoubi Suanjing also discusses how to determine the distance of the Sun by measuring the length of noontime shadows at different latitudes, a method similar to Eratosthenes' measurement of the circumference of the Earth, but the Zhoubi Suanjing assumes that the Earth is flat. [56]

Greece: spherical Earth
Semi-circular shadow of Earth on the Moon during a partial lunar eclipse
Pythagoras in the 6th century BC and Parmenides in the 5th century stated that the Earth is spherical,[57] and this view spread rapidly in the Greek world. Around 330 BC, Aristotle maintained on the basis of physical theory and observational evidence that the Earth was spherical, and reported an estimate of its circumference.[58] The Earth's circumference was first determined around 240 BC by Eratosthenes.[59] By the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy had derived his maps from a globe and developed the system of latitude, longitude, and climes. His Almagest was written in Greek and only translated into Latin in the 11th century from Arabic translations.
Lucretius (1st century BC) opposed the concept of a spherical Earth, because he considered that an infinite universe had no center towards which heavy bodies would tend. Thus, he thought the idea of animals walking around topsy-turvy under the Earth was absurd. [60] [61] By the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder was in a position to claim that everyone agreed on the spherical shape of Earth, [62] though disputes continued regarding the nature of the antipodes, and how it is possible to keep the ocean in a curved shape.

The Vedic texts depict the cosmos in many ways. [63] [64] One of the earliest Indian cosmological texts picture the Earth as one of a stack of flat disks. [65]
In the Vedic texts, Dyaus (heaven) and Prithvi (Earth) are compared to wheels on an axle, yielding a flat model. They are also described as bowls or leather bags, yielding a concave model. [66] According to Macdonell: "the conception of the Earth being a disc surrounded by an ocean does not appear in the Samhitas. But it was naturally regarded as circular, being compared with a wheel (10.89) and expressly called circular (parimandala) in the Shatapatha Brahmana ." [67]
By about the 5th century CE, the siddhanta astronomy texts of South Asia, particularly of Aryabhata, assume a spherical Earth as they develop mathematical methods for quantitative astronomy for calendar and time keeping. [68]
The medieval Indian texts called the Puranas describe the Earth as a flat-bottomed, circular disk with concentric oceans and continents. [66] [69] This general scheme is present not only in the Hindu cosmologies, but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. [66] However, some Puranas include other models. The fifth canto of the Bhagavata Purana, for example, includes sections that describe the Earth both as flat and spherical. [70] [71]
Early Christian Church
During the early period of the Christian Church, the spherical view continued to be widely held, with some notable exceptions. [72]Athenagoras, an eastern Christian writing around the year 175 CE, said that the Earth was spherical. [73] Methodius (c. 290 AD), an eastern Christian writing against "the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians" said: "Let us first lay bare ... the theory of the Chaldeans and the Egyptians. They say that the circumference of the universe is likened to the turnings of a well-rounded globe, the Earth being a central point. They say that since its outline is spherical, ... the Earth should be the center of the universe, around which the heaven is whirling." [73] Lactantius, a western Christian writer and advisor to the first Christian Roman Emperor, Constantine, writing sometime between 304 and 313 CE, ridiculed the notion of antipodes and the philosophers who fancied that "the universe is round like a ball. They also thought that heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of the heavenly bodies. ... For that reason, they constructed brass globes, as though after the figure of the universe." [74] [73] Arnobius, another eastern Christian writing sometime around 305 CE, described the round Earth: "In the first place, indeed, the world itself is neither right nor left. It has neither upper nor lower regions, nor front nor back. For whatever is round and bounded on every side by the circumference of a solid sphere, has no beginning or end ..." [73]
The influential theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Western Church, similarly objected to the "fable" of antipodes: [75]
But as to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the Earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed that this has been learned by historical knowledge, but by scientific conjecture, on the ground that the Earth is suspended within the concavity of the sky, and that it has as much room on the one side of it as on the other: hence they say that the part that is beneath must also be inhabited. But they do not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical form, yet it does not follow that the other side of the Earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture, which proves the truth of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its prophecies, gives no false information; and it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man.
Some historians do not view Augustine's scriptural commentaries as endorsing any particular cosmological model, [76] but while the view that Augustine shared the common view of his contemporaries that the Earth is spherical, in line with his endorsement of science in De Genesi ad litteram,[77] is still occasionally challenged, [78] most scholars agree that "Augustine’s acceptance of the earth’s spherical shape [is] a well-established fact". [79]
Cosmas Indicopleustes' world view – flat Earth in a Tabernacle
Diodorus of Tarsus, a leading figure in the School of Antioch and mentor of John Chrysostom, may have argued for a flat Earth; however, Diodorus' opinion on the matter is known only from a later criticism. [80] Chrysostom, one of the four Great Church Fathers of the Eastern Church and Archbishop of Constantinople, explicitly espoused the idea, based on scripture, that the Earth floats miraculously on the water beneath the firmament.[81] Athanasius the Great, Church Father and Patriarch of Alexandria, expressed a similar view in Against the Heathen.[82]
Christian Topography (547) by the Alexandrian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes, who had traveled as far as Sri Lanka and the source of the Blue Nile, is now widely considered the most valuable geographical document of the early medieval age, although it received relatively little attention from contemporaries. In it, the author repeatedly expounds the doctrine that the universe consists of only two places, the Earth below the firmament and heaven above it. Carefully drawing on arguments from scripture, he describes the Earth as a rectangle, 400 days' journey long by 200 wide, surrounded by four oceans and enclosed by four massive walls which support the firmament. The spherical Earth theory is contemptuously dismissed as "pagan". [83] [84] [85]
Severian, Bishop of Gabala (d. 408), wrote that the Earth is flat and the Sun does not pass under it in the night, but "travels through the northern parts as if hidden by a wall". [86] Basil of Caesarea (329–379) argued that the matter was theologically irrelevant. [87]
Europe: Early Middle Ages
Early medieval Christian writers in the early Middle Ages felt little urge to assume flatness of the Earth, though they had fuzzy impressions of the writings of Ptolemy and Aristotle, relying more on Pliny. [88]
9th-century Macrobian cosmic diagram showing the sphere of the Earth at the center (globus terrae)
With the end of the Western Roman Empire, Western Europe entered the Middle Ages with great difficulties that affected the continent's intellectual production. Most scientific treatises of classical antiquity (in Greek) were unavailable, leaving only simplified summaries and compilations. In contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire did not fall, and it preserved the learning. [89] Still, many textbooks of the Early Middle Ages supported the sphericity of the Earth in the western part of Europe. [90]
12th-century T and O map representing the inhabited world as described by Isidore of Seville in his Etymologiae (chapter 14, de terra et partibus)
Europe's view of the shape of the Earth in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages may be best expressed by the writings of early Christian scholars:
Bishop Isidore of Seville (560–636) taught in his widely read encyclopedia, the Etymologies, diverse views such as that the Earth "resembles a wheel" [91] resembling Anaximander in language and the map that he provided. This was widely interpreted as referring to a disc-shaped Earth. [92] [93] An illustration from Isidore's De Natura Rerum shows the five zones of the Earth as adjacent circles. Some have concluded that he thought the Arctic and Antarctic zones were adjacent to each other. [94] He did not admit the possibility of antipodes, which he took to mean people dwelling on the opposite side of the Earth, considering them legendary [95] and noting that there was no evidence for their existence. [96] Isidore's T and O map, which was seen as representing a small part of a spherical Earth, continued to be used by authors through the Middle Ages, e.g. the 9th-century bishop Rabanus Maurus, who compared the habitable part of the northern hemisphere (Aristotle 's northern temperate clime) with a wheel. At the same time, Isidore's works also gave the views of sphericity, for example, in chapter 28 of De Natura Rerum, Isidore claims that the Sun orbits the Earth and illuminates the other side when it is night on this side. See French translation of De Natura Rerum.[97] In his other work Etymologies, there are also affirmations that the sphere of the sky has Earth in its center and the sky being equally distant on all sides. [98] [99] Other researchers have argued these points as well. [88] [100] [101] "The work remained unsurpassed until the thirteenth century and was regarded as the summit of all knowledge. It became an essential part of European medieval culture. Soon after the invention of typography it appeared many times in print." [102] However, "The Scholastics – later medieval philosophers, theologians, and scientists – were helped by the Arabic translators and commentaries, but they hardly needed to struggle against a flat-Earth legacy from the early middle ages (500–1050). Early medieval writers often had fuzzy and imprecise impressions of both Ptolemy and Aristotle and relied more on Pliny, but they felt (with one exception), little urge to assume flatness." [88]
Isidore's portrayal of the five zones of the Earth
St Vergilius of Salzburg (c. 700–784), in the middle of the 8th century, discussed or taught some geographical or cosmographical ideas that St Boniface found sufficiently objectionable that he complained about them to Pope Zachary. The only surviving record of the incident is contained in Zachary's reply, dated 748, where he wrote: [103]
As for the perverse and sinful doctrine which he (Virgil) against God and his own soul has uttered – if it shall be clearly established that he professes belief in another world and other men existing beneath the Earth, or in (another) sun and moon there, thou art to hold a council, deprive him of his sacerdotal rank, and expel him from the Church.
Some authorities have suggested that the sphericity of the Earth was among the aspects of Vergilius's teachings that Boniface and Zachary considered objectionable. [104] [105] Others have considered this unlikely, and take the wording of Zachary's response to indicate at most an objection to belief in the existence of humans living in the antipodes. [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] In any case, there is no record of any further action having been taken against Vergilius. He was later appointed bishop of Salzburg and was canonised in the 13th century. [111]
12th-century depiction of a spherical Earth with the four seasons (book Liber Divinorum Operum by Hildegard of Bingen)
A possible non-literary but graphic indication that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth (or perhaps the world) was a sphere is the use of the orb (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested from the time of the Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the Reichsapfel was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word orbis means "circle", and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west until that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire "world" or cosmos.[112]
A recent study of medieval concepts of the sphericity of the Earth noted that "since the eighth century, no cosmographer worthy of note has called into question the sphericity of the Earth". [113] However, the work of these intellectuals may not have had significant influence on public opinion, and it is difficult to tell what the wider population may have thought of the shape of the Earth, if they considered the question at all.

Hermannus Contractus (1013–1054) was among the earliest Christian scholars to estimate the circumference of Earth with Eratosthenes' method. St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), the most widely taught theologian of the Middle Ages, believed in a spherical Earth and took for granted that his readers also knew the Earth is round. [114] Lectures in the medieval universities commonly advanced evidence in favor of the idea that the Earth was a sphere. [115]
Illustration of the spherical Earth in a 14th-century copy of L'Image du monde (c. 1246)
Jill Tattersall shows that in many vernacular works in 12th- and 13th-century French texts the Earth was considered "round like a table" rather than "round like an apple". "In virtually all the examples quoted ... from epics and from non-'historical' romances (that is, works of a less learned character) the actual form of words used suggests strongly a circle rather than a sphere", though she notes that even in these works the language is ambiguous. [116][verify]
Portuguese navigation down and around the coast of Africa in the latter half of the 1400s gave wide-scale observational evidence for Earth's sphericity. In these explorations, the Sun position moved more northward the further south the explorers travelled. Its position directly overhead at noon gave evidence for crossing the equator. These apparent solar motions in detail were more consistent with north–south curvature and a distant Sun, than with any flat-Earth explanation. The ultimate demonstration came when Ferdinand Magellan's expedition completed the first global circumnavigation in 1521. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the few survivors of the voyage, recorded the loss of a day in the course of the voyage, giving evidence for east–west curvature.
Middle East: Islamic scholars
Further information: Spherical Earth § Medieval Islamic scholars
The Abbasid Caliphate saw a great flowering of astronomy and mathematics in the 9th century AD. Muslim scholars of the past believed in a spherical Earth. [117]
The Quran mentions that the Earth (al-arḍ) was "spread out". [118] Prior to the introduction of Greek cosmology into the Islamic world, early Muslims tended to also view the Earth as flat, and Muslim traditionalists who rejected Greek philosophy continued to hold to this view later on while various theologians held different opinions. [119] For example, a tafsir on Qur'an 13:3 saying that God stretched out the Earth was commented on by Al-Mawardi as being written "in response to those who claim that it is round like a ball". [120] The same argument against a spherical Earth was made in a tafsir by Al-Qurtubi in the 13th century. [121] which he said was the opinion of the scholars of the law. [122]
Beginning in the 10th century onwards, some Muslim traditionalists began to adopt the notion of a spherical Earth. For example, regarding the Qur'anic statements about the Earth spreading, the 12th-century commentary, the Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi) by Fakhr al-Din al-Razi states: "If it is said: Do the words 'And the Earth We spread out' indicate that it is flat? We would respond: Yes, because the Earth, even though it is round, is an enormous sphere, and each little part of this enormous sphere, when it is looked at, appears to be flat. As that is the case, this will dispel what they mentioned of confusion. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 'And the mountains as pegs' [an-Naba' 78:7]. He called them awtaad (pegs) even though these mountains may have large flat surfaces. And the same is true in this case." In the 11th century, Ibn Hazm claimed that "Evidence shows that the Earth is a sphere but public people say the opposite." He added: "None of those who deserve being Imams for Muslims has denied that Earth is round. And we have not received anything indicates a denial, not even a single word."
Ming Dynasty in China
A spherical terrestrial globe was introduced to Yuan-era Khanbaliq (i.e. Beijing) in 1267 by the Persian astronomer Jamal ad-Din, but it is not known to have made an impact on the traditional Chinese conception of the shape of the Earth. [123] As late as 1595, an early Jesuit missionary to China, Matteo Ricci, recorded that the Ming-dynasty Chinese say: "The Earth is flat and square, and the sky is a round canopy; they did not succeed in conceiving the possibility of the antipodes." [50]
In the 17th century, the idea of a spherical Earth spread in China due to the influence of the Jesuits, who held high positions as astronomers at the imperial court. [124] Matteo Ricci, in collaboration with Chinese cartographers and translator Li Zhizao, published the Kunyu Wanguo Quantu in 1602, the first Chinese world map based on European discoveries.[125] The astronomical and geographical treatise Gezhicao (格致草) written in 1648 by Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇) explained that the Earth was spherical, not flat or square, and could be circumnavigated. [124]
Myth of flat-Earth prevalence
Main article: Myth of the flat Earth
Beginning in the 19th century, a historical myth arose which held that the predominant cosmological doctrine during the Middle Ages was that the Earth was flat. An early proponent of this myth was the American writer Washington Irving, who maintained that Christopher Columbus had to overcome the opposition of churchmen to gain sponsorship for his voyage of exploration. Later significant advocates of this view were John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White, who used it as a major element in their advocacy of the thesis [126] that there was a long-lasting and essential conflict between science and religion.[127] Some studies of the historical connections between science and religion have demonstrated that theories of their mutual antagonism ignore examples of their mutual support. [128] [129]
Subsequent studies of medieval science have shown that most scholars in the Middle Ages, including those read by Christopher Columbus, maintained that the Earth was spherical. [130]
Modern flat-Earthers
Main article: Modern flat Earth beliefs
In the modern era, the pseudoscientific belief in a flat Earth originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham with the 1849 pamphlet Zetetic Astronomy. Lady Elizabeth Blount established the Universal Zetetic Society in 1893, which published journals. Other notable flat Earthers in the 19th and early 20th centuries include William Carpenter, E. W. Bullinger, John Jasper, Paul Kruger, and Wilbur Glenn Voliva. In 1956, Samuel Shenton set up the International Flat Earth Research Society (IFERS), better known as the "Flat Earth Society" from Dover, England, as a direct descendant of the Universal Zetetic Society.
In the Internet era, the availability of communications technology and social media like YouTube, Facebook [131] and Twitter have made it easy for individuals, famous [132] or not, to spread disinformation and attract others to erroneous ideas, including that of the flat Earth. [6] [7] [133]
To maintain belief in the face of overwhelming contrary, publicly available empirical evidence accumulated in the Space Age, modern flat-Earthers must generally embrace some form of conspiracy theory out of the necessity of explaining why major institutions such as governments, media outlets, schools, scientists, and airlines all assert that the world is a sphere. They tend to not trust observations they have not made themselves, and often distrust or disagree with each other. [134]
Cultural references
The term flat-earth-man, used in a derogatory sense to mean anyone who holds ridiculously antiquated or impossible views, predates the more compact flat-earther.  It was recorded in 1908: "Fewer votes than one would have thought possible for any human candidate, were he even a flat-earth-man." [135] According to the Oxford English Dictionary flat-Earther's first use is in 1934 in Punch magazine: "Without being a bigoted flat-earther, [Mercator] perceived the nuisance ... of fiddling about with globes ... in order to discover the South Seas." [136]

"When therefore thou beholdest not a small pebble, but the whole earth borne upon the waters, and not submerged, admire the power of Him who wrought these marvellous things in a supernatural manner! And whence does this appear, that the earth is borne upon the waters? The prophet declares this when he says, 'He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared it upon the floods.' And again: 'To him who hath founded the earth upon the waters.' What sayest thou? The water is not able to support a small pebble on its surface, and yet bears up the earth, great as it is; and mountains, and hills, and cities, and plants, and men, and brutes; and it is not submerged!"

15th century adaptation of a T and O map. This kind of medieval mappa mundi illustrates only the reachable side of a round Earth.
The idea of a flat Earth is that the surface of the Earth is flat (a plane ). Belief in a flat Earth is found in the oldest writings. Early Mesopotamian maps showed the world  as a flat disk floating in the ocean.
This was a common belief until the Classical Greeks began to discuss the Earth's shape about the 4th century BC. Eratosthenes (276 BC –194 BC) calculated the circumference of the Earth quite well. [1] From then on, few educated people ever believed in its being flat. [2] People first started having the thought that the Earth is round in around 6th century BC. Then, Aristotle proved the Earth was round in around 330 BC.
The large-scale shape of the Earth only matters when considering large distances. Therefore in the Ancient world only sailors, astronomers, philosophers, and theologians would have cared about the Earth's large-scale shape.
The following authors argued for a spherical or ball shaped earth: King Alfred of the Anglo-Saxons, Hildegard von Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Snorri Sturluson, Marco Polo, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus
Portuguese people explored Africa and Asia, Columbus sailed to the Americas (1492) and Ferdinand Magellan 's circumnavigated (sailed all round) the earth (1519-21). This proved finally, in a practical way that the Earth is a globe .
During the 19th century, the Romantic ideas about a European "Dark Age" made the Flat Earth model look much more important than it ever had been in history .
The Flammarion woodcut.  Flammarion wrote, "A missionary in the Middle Ages tells that he has found the point where heaven and Earth meet..."
The widely circulated woodcut is of a man poking his head through the firmament of a flat Earth to see the machines working the spheres.  It was made in 16th century style but cannot be traced to an earlier time than Camille Flammarion 's L'Atmosphère: Météorologie Populaire (Paris, 1888, p. 163). The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a missionary in the middle Ages claimed that "he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met".  That story may be traced back to Voltaire, but not to any known source in the Middle ages. The original woodcut had a decorative border that places it in the 19th century; in later publications, some claimed that the woodcut dated from the 16th century and the border was removed. According to an unproved story Flammarion ordered the woodcut himself; certainly no source of the image earlier than Flammarion's book is known.
An early mention in literature was Ludvig Holberg 's comedy Erasmus Montanus (1723). A great many people disagree with Erasmus Montanus when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants believe it is flat. He is not allowed to marry his fiancée until he cries "The earth is flat as a pancake". In Rudyard Kipling 's The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat, the main characters spread the rumor that a Parish Council meeting had voted in favor of a flat Earth.
An old map of the world made in Amsterdam in 1689
The spherical Earth seen from Apollo 17, disproves the flat Earth model. The Flat Earth Society believes that images like these have been edited by NASA as part of a conspiracy.
Fantasy fiction often imagines a flat Earth. In C. S. Lewis' The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the fictional world of Narnia is "round like a table" (i.e., flat), not "round like a ball", and the characters sail toward the edge of this world. Terry Pratchett 's Strata and Discworld novels (1983 onwards) are set on a flat, disc-shaped world resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle.

They ascribed to a peculiar cosmology that was popular at the time, which included a flat earth. However, this flat earth did not have edges. Instead, it continued into infinity, but there was only a finite amount of land on which people could live. If you went out far enough there would be nothing but uninterrupted ocean.
The notion of “planets” hadn’t yet been conceptualized yet. To people back then, the earth was the whole of the universe, and open ocean was the closest thing to nothingness that they could imagine (as seen in many contemporary creation myths, which had a primordial ocean exi

Originally Answered: Did the ancient Egyptians believe the Earth was flat?
Bear in mind that ‘Ancient Egypt’ extends over a couple of millennia.
The Egyptians knew that the North point in the sky was between two stars that were some distance apart, so the pyramids are not perfectly aligned, but they are pretty close!
At some point the Goddess Nut was depicted arching over the Earth with stars all over her. While Nut had her hands and feet at the cardinal points, everyone knew the stars moved all night, so they moved over her, as did the planets and the Sun during the day. She took in and protected the dead, which may be a basis for the idea that heaven is in the sky. H

Yes. They believed that a barge carrying the sun flew out of a cave in the farthest east. This barge carried the sun across the sky, then descended into a cave in the farthest west at sunset. This cave entrance led to the underworld, known as the Twelve Hours of Night. Every night, the sun god would do battle with the demons of the underworld so the barge could reach the eastern horizon in time for dawn.

There is no record that could show a prove that The Egyptian People were theorizing that the Earth was not flat. In fact, the heavy religiously-controlled environment that ruled over Egypt for centuries were the key fact why sciences did not proliferate in Egypt as in other Nations. The content of the ancient Egyptian writings that survived until our days are a clear evidence that although there was certain knowledge in Egypt, The Egyptians were not highly Knowlegeable.

Was there any ancient civilization that actually believed the earth was flat?
You are asking about ancient civilizations. All civilizations knew the world to be quite flat …
And then you have to question what we are told in Wikipedia:
“The Greeks believed the earth a sphere as early as 300 BC?”
This makes no common sense because the first globe wasn’t even made until 1492 AD. I believe this is when the monolithic conspiracy was created — to fool the world with a globe (foolery), keeping us from crossing to the new untouched lands beyond the southern ring.

Were ancient Egyptians aware that the Earth is a sphere?
Egyptian mythology had a flat earth. There is no evidence this was ever rejected.
The Greeks were the first people known to have rejected the notion. But we don’t know when or how:
Though the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered. A plausible explanation is that it was "the experience of travellers that suggested such an explanation for the variation in the observable altitude of the pole and the change in the area of circumpolar stars, a change that was quite drastic between Greek set

What are some proofs based on which ancient people believe the Earth to be flat?
They didn't have any.
Basically, beliefs weren't based on evidence or “proofs" or anything like science. They were based on what you saw, or what your parents told you was real.
And when people looked around, they said “looks flat to me."
Much like modern flat Earthers in fact…though at least they noticed the Sun, stars and Moon set and rose below the horizon. Modern ones can't even get that right.

Why do modern scholars insist the ancient people believed the world was flat when it was known that it was a globe from the very beginning?
No, it was not known it was a globe from the very beginning.
In the beginning of humans, around 300,000 BCE, they thought their world was the small flat piece they lived on. It would be a long time for that to change.
The ancient Israelites, for example, thought the earth was flat as described in the Bible books written between 950 BCE and 600 BCE.
Even more ancient than the Israelites were the civilizations of Mesopotamia who held the same idea of flatness that they passed on to later civilizations.

While it may seem easy to determine the shpericity of the earth, historical data indicate otherwise.
There is no record of a belief in a spherical earth until sometime after 600 b.c. by the Greeks, and this belief was unsupported by convincing evidence until Aristotle around 330 bc.  About 100 years later, Erasthophenes provided the first reasonable calculation of the earth's diameter.
Part of Aristotle's argument involved  the position of  the stars, but not the mere fact that their apparent position changed. That can be easily explained by positing that the stars are fixed to a rotating, trans

Why do historians still teach that all ancient cultures thought the Earth was flat when many old cultures actually knew it was round?
As the kids say, citation needed. Which historians currently teach this? Who are they? I’ve never heard an actual living historian say this, and I don’t think this is actually the case.
Now, there may be, say, primary and secondary school teachers who teach this, but most of those are trained as teachers for children first and specialists in some subject matter second, if at all.

It's a common rebuttal to flat earthers that the Ancient Greeks proved the earth was round in the 3rd Century BC. Do we know how they conceptualised Space? What did they imagine the round earth was *in*?
I don’t imagine they went that far. They knew that the Earth hung in space. They thought that the sun, moon and planets also rotated about the Earth on a complicated construction of Crystal spheres. They conjectured that the stars were on a fixed sphere that enclosed everything. I don’t think they knew that the atmosphere didn’t fill all that volume. But they knew that there were things that they didn’t know, and while I am sure that individuals has conjectures, there was no consensus.

But considering that Moses was with his natural family long enough to know his history, it was likely between 4 to 5 years old. Why? Sarah nursed Isaac till he was five. Since Moses’ family taught him, he had knowledge about the condition of his people and when the Egyptian was beating an Israelite, it moved Moses to act. He was 40 at the time.

Is the model proposed by the Flat Earth Society the same as what used to be believed by some in olden days? The idea that Columbus 'proved' the Earth was round would suggest that some thought there would be an 'edge' at the end of the Atlantic Ocean.
At the time of Columbus it was widely known that Earth is round. If every illiterate sailor knew it I am not positive.
Genuine flat earth cultures assumed that the sun after setting in the west travels through the underworld and rises in the east. That was not stupid, because it matched their observation. It was just wrong.
Modern flat earthers believe that the sun is always hovering above the earth disc. That model was invented in the 19th century by a crank named Samuel Rowbotham. It is stupid, because it does not match observation. The builders of Stonehenge would have laughed them out of tow

Ancient Buddhists may have believed in a flat earth because the buddha was never very specific if the earth was flat or not he just said some things concerning the places with life.

Why do ancient Egyptians hate Hebrew people?
There are many possible answers to this question, but the most reliable stem from the fact that the Hebrews were sheep herders and that they wore woolen clothes that often had a disagreeable odor (Genesis 43:32). Genesis 46:34 shows that they had a distaste that stemmed form an association of shepherds with the barbaric nomadic people on Egypt's north-eastern border. Exodus 8:22 might show that they disliked the fact that Hebrews burned portions of animals sacrificed to God. All this is speculation, but perhaps the reason is even simpler for the period in which Egypt was ruled by Hyksos pharao

Question: Why did people in antiquity believe the World was flat?
It is important to define “antiquity”. Eudoxus of Cnidus lived some 2.400 years ago (Εὔδοξος ὁ Κνίδιος, Eúdoxos ho Knídios; c. 390 – c. 337 BCE) and he proposed, after careful observations, the sphericity of Earth (and, by the way, of other bodies in the space).
However, non educated (or poorly educated) people did not learn of such facts for, say, several centuries.
Even today, for well educated people, Earth seems flat (at the scale of everyday business, such as a piece of land to build a hou

How do we know that ancient people really believed 2000-1000 years ago that the earth and its surface was flat like paper and is the maps really the best proof of this, 'cause they drew their maps to flat and not as spheres?
Um, he wrote down his experiments.
Earth's circumference was first accurately measured more than 2,000 years ago by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, who at the time lived in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. He had heard that in the nearby town of Syene midday sunlight shines straight down to the bottom of deep wells on the same day each year, indicating that the Sun was directly overhead in Syene. In Alexandria, however, sunlight on that date never reached the bottoms of wells, but instead fell upon the sides.
Eratosthenes reasoned that the difference in the angle of incoming sunlight was due

Until what time in history did people believe that the earth was flat?
In Europe the question was settled before 3rd century B.C.E., when a guy called Eratosthenes measured the size of the spherical Earth.
Notice this is different from proving Earth is spherical, because it’s the assumption you have to make in order to start the measurement at all. We know that by that time, the shape of the Earth was no longer in question. This is a few decades after the death of Alexander the Great, during the rise of the Republic of Rome.
In China, Earth was believed to be square and flat until the 16th century C.E., when European explorers came to China and introduced Western a

I've seen a lot of flat Earthes using this image to "support" what they are saying. So could someone tell me when these civilizations stopped believing that the Earth was flat?
What is the source for EACH of these images? They do look quite modern, absolutely NOT original.
The Greeks already considered Earth to be spherical long before they actually CALCULATED the size of the spherical Earth, with great accuracy, around 350 BC.
The Romans? The Romans considered Earth spherical, just like the greeks.
Flat Earthers give you phony images.
“ Many Roman authors such as Cicero and Pliny refer in their works to the rotundity of the Earth as a matter of course. [57] Pliny also considered the possibility of an imperfect sphere "shaped like a pinecone". [58] ”

Why do we think that ancient people thought the Earth was flat?
It would be the logical assumption.
If you live on the plains of Africa and look around, you will see the Earth as flat. Before you start using compasses, you will use directions as “towards the mountains” or “towards the rivers”, direction descriptions we see in some languages even today.
When we start moving around and making ships, we started to observe additional features in the surroundings. Discovering that load stones was pointing I specific directions.

Did the ancient scholars of Islam believe the Earth was flat?
I would assume not. North Africa, the Balkins, the Iberian Peninsula, and the northern part of the Middle East all believed that the Earth was round since the BC era. All of them have been parts of the Islamic world for hundreds of years.

Did the ancient Romans think the Earth was flat or round?
Flatly, most ancient Romans didn’t care. Those that were educated (perhaps 1 percent) knew that the Greeks had determined it was round, a globe, but the average citizen was not well educated and simply went by what their parents told them regardless of how stupid it was.
The common folk had absolutely no means of figuring things like this out, and because it didn’t affect them in any manner, they simply went on and believed what they were told. Hercules or Ajax holding up the sky, Gods in Mount Olympus, unicorns and so forth.
Most people of the time couldn’t even read or write.

If people had already known the Earth was round since ancient times, where did the "Flat Earth" misconception come from? How did it manage to spread?
Not exactly sure but I know it was taught in our public school system for quite some time . My great grandmother was taught that in school , a public school in New York . Around 1910 to 1920 .

Blame Samuel Rowbotham.
Samuel Rowbotham - Wikipedia
English charlatan (1816-1884) Samuel Birley Rowbotham (; [1] 1816 – 23 December 1884, in London) was an English inventor, writer and utopian socialist [2] who wrote Zetetic Astronomy: Earth Not a Globe under the pseudonym Parallax . His work was originally published as a 16-page pamphlet (1849), and later expanded into a book (1865). Rowbotham's method, which he called zetetic astronomy , models the Earth as a flat disc centered at the North Pole and bounded along its perimeter by a wall of ice, with the Sun , Moon , planets, and stars moving only several thousand miles above the surface of Earth. Life and career [ edit ] Rowbotham started out as an organiser of an Owenite community at Manea in The Fens , where he formulated his ideas about the Earth. After measuring a lack of curvature on the long straight drainage ditches of the Bedford Levels in his first Bedford Level experiment , he was convinced of the flatness of the Earth and began to lecture on the topic. He took a little time to learn his trade, running away from a lecture in Blackburn when he couldn't explain why the hulls of ships disappeared before their masts when sailing out to sea. [3] However, as he persisted in filling halls by charging sixpence a lecture, his quick-wittedness and debating skills were honed so much that he could "counter every argument with ingenuity, wit and consummate skill". [4] When finally pinned down to a challenge in Plymouth in 1864 by allegations that he wouldn't agree to a test, Rowbotham appeared on Plymouth Hoe at the appointed time, witnessed by Richard A. Proctor , a writer on astronomy, and proceeded to the beach where a telescope had been set up. His opponents had claimed that only the lantern of the Eddystone Lighthouse , some 14 miles out to sea, would be visible. In fact, only half the lantern was visible, yet Rowbotham claimed his opponents were wrong and that it proved the Earth was indeed flat so that many Plymouth folk left the Hoe agreeing that "some of the most important conclusions of modern astronomy had been seriously invalidated". [5] In 1856, Rowbotham married for a second time and had two children, one of whom died in infancy. In 1861 when he was 46, Rowbotham married a 15 year old girl (with whom he was living at the time of the marriage) and settled in London, producing 15 known children, of whom only four survived. He was named in numerous cases of wrongful deaths, including a "death by misadventure" for accidentally poisoning one of his own children. He was named responsible for other deaths using his quack cures of phosphorus. He was also alleged to be using the name "Dr. Samuel Birley", living in a beautiful 12-roomed house, selling the secrets for prolonging human life and curing every disease imaginable. [6] Augustus De Morgan refers to him as S. Goulden. [3] He patented a number of inventions, including a "life-preserving cylindrical railway carriage". He is not known to have held any medical degrees and his professions ar
