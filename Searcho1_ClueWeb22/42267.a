So I have this question: "How did a war to preserve the Union become a war to end slavery?" It's about the American Civil War, right? I know that it started as a conflict over whether the United States should stay together or if states had the right to secede, mainly because of disagreements over slavery. But somewhere along the way, it seems like ending slavery became a major goal too. I need to understand how that shift happened.

First, I should probably recall some basic facts about the start of the Civil War. Fort Sumter was attacked in 1861, which is often considered the beginning of the war. At that point, President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union. So initially, the war aim was clearly to preserve the Union.

But slavery was definitely a underlying issue. The Confederate states seceded largely because they wanted to maintain slavery, and they feared that the Republican Party, which was against the expansion of slavery, would eventually eliminate it altogether. So, slavery was a root cause, but the immediate reason for secession was states' rights, particularly the right to own slaves.

Now, I need to think about how the war goals evolved. I remember that in 1862, Congress passed the First Confiscation Act, which allowed Union forces to confiscate property, including slaves, being used to support the Confederate war effort. Then, in 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. That seems like a big shift towards ending slavery.

But why did this happen? What changed between 1861 and 1863? I think it's important to consider the progression of the war and the political climate at the time.

Let me try to outline some possible reasons:

1. **Military Necessity:** As the war dragged on, the Union needed more soldiers. Allowing slaves to fight for the Union could provide much-needed manpower. Also, freeing slaves would deprive the Confederacy of their labor force, which was crucial for their war effort.

2. **Moral and Political Pressure:** There was growing abolitionist sentiment in the North. People were starting to see the war as not just about preserving the Union, but also about ending slavery. Lincoln himself had always been against slavery, even if he didn't make it the primary goal at first.

3. **International Diplomacy:** Britain and France were considering recognizing the Confederacy. But both had abolished slavery, and public opinion there was against slavery. If the Union made ending slavery a war aim, it would make it harder for these countries to support the Confederacy.

4. **Economic and Social Changes:** The war was causing massive disruption, and emancipation could be seen as a way to permanently weaken the South and reshape society.

I need to look into these points more deeply. Maybe start with the timeline of events leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation.

Let me consider the First Confiscation Act of 1861. It allowed Union armies to seize property, including slaves, being used to support the rebellion. Then, in 1862, the Second Confiscation Act went further, allowing for the seizure and liberation of slaves from rebels. This shows a gradual shift in policy towards emancipation.

Also, in 1862, Lincoln met with slave-owning border states and tried to persuade them to accept gradual emancipation voluntarily. Although they resisted, this indicates that Lincoln was moving towards making slavery an issue in the war.

Then, in September 1862, after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. It declared that slaves in Confederate-held areas would be free as of January 1, 1863. It's important to note that this proclamation didn't free slaves in the border states that remained loyal to the Union, or in Confederate areas already under Union control.

So, why did Lincoln choose that moment to issue the proclamation? Perhaps because the Union had just achieved a significant victory, which gave him the momentum to make such a bold move. Also, perhaps he saw that the war wasn't ending quickly, and he needed to change the war's purpose to gain more support.

I should also consider Lincoln's letter to Horace Greeley, where he famously said, "If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that." This suggests that his primary goal was preserving the Union, and emancipation was a means to that end.

But over time, emancipation seemed to become a goal in itself. Maybe because people began to see that slavery was the root cause of the conflict, and that eliminating it was necessary for lasting peace.

I should also think about the role of enslaved people themselves. Many slaves escaped to Union lines, seeking freedom. Initially, they were often returned to their owners, but as policies changed, they were allowed to stay and even enlisted in the Union army.

The use of black soldiers was significant. It not only strengthened the Union forces but also changed the nature of the war. By allowing former slaves to fight for their freedom, the war became more explicitly about ending slavery.

Additionally, the Confederacy's adoption of policies like General Order No. 111, which threatened to enslave captured black Union soldiers, hardened Northern opposition to slavery. It showed the moral bankruptcy of the Confederate cause.

I think another factor was the evolution of Lincoln's own views on slavery. While he started out willing to tolerate slavery in the existing states if it meant preserving the Union, he gradually came to see that ending slavery was necessary for the nation's future.

His Gettysburg Address in 1863 redefined the war as a struggle for democracy and equality, saying that the nation was dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. This was a departure from his earlier focus solely on preserving the Union.

So, it seems like a combination of military strategy, political pressure, moral considerations, and perhaps even Lincoln's own growth led to the transformation of the war's purpose.

Maybe I should look into some specific events or documents to get a better understanding.

Let me consider the Crittenden-Johnson Resolutions of 1861. These resolutions, passed by Congress, stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union, not to end slavery. This shows that at the beginning, there was an explicit commitment to limiting the war's goals to preserving the Union.

Contrast that with the Militia Act of 1862, which allowed African Americans to enlist in the Union army and navy, and the Emancipation Proclamation a year later. These actions indicate a clear shift towards making slavery a central issue of the war.

Also, the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery entirely, was a direct outcome of the war and reflected the changed goals.

I think it's also worth considering the perspectives of key figures. For example, Frederick Douglass was a prominent abolitionist who pressured Lincoln to make emancipation a war goal. His writings and speeches likely influenced public opinion and pushed Lincoln to act.

Similarly, Radical Republicans in Congress were pushing for stronger action against slavery. Their influence grew as the war progressed, and they played a role in shaping legislation that targeted slavery.

On the Confederate side, their insistence on maintaining slavery as a cornerstone of their new nation only served to highlight the issue and make it more difficult for the North to compromise.

I should also think about the impact of border states. States like Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware were slave states that remained loyal to the Union. Lincoln had to be careful not to alienate them by pushing for immediate emancipation, which is why the Emancipation Proclamation didn't apply to them.

However, over time, even in these states, there was movement towards emancipation. For example, Maryland abolished slavery in 1864, and Missouri followed suit in 1865.

So, the war created a dynamic environment where public opinion, military needs, and political maneuvering all interacted to push the country towards ending slavery.

Perhaps another way to look at it is through the concept of "revolutionary war aims." Sometimes, in protracted conflicts, the goals expand beyond the initial objectives as the belligerents seek to fundamentally alter the status quo.

In this case, the Union's goal evolved from merely restoring the pre-war status quo to transforming American society by eliminating slavery.

I should consider the concept of "hard war" or "total war," where the war is not just fought between armies but also targets the enemy's economy and social structure. In this context, emancipation can be seen as a strategy to undermine the Confederacy's foundation.

Also, the idea of "self-emancipation" is important. Many slaves freed themselves by fleeing to Union lines, and their actions forced the Union to confront the issue of slavery.

I think it's also relevant to consider the role of religion and moral fervor in the North. Many Northerners saw the war as a crusade against the sinful institution of slavery, which gave them a sense of purpose and justified more radical measures.

Moreover, the success of Union armies in certain theaters, like the capture of New Orleans and the Mississippi River, allowed for the implementation of emancipation policies in those areas.

I should also think about the contraband slaves—slaves who escaped to Union lines and were initially considered contraband of war. Over time, their status changed, and they were put to work for the Union cause, which blurred the line between slavery and freedom.

Additionally, the Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862 freed slaves in the District of Columbia and provided compensation to their owners. This was a试点, showing that gradual compensated emancipation was possible, though it wasn't scalable to the entire South.

Comparatively, in the Confederacy, there were discussions about arming slaves in exchange for their freedom, but this idea was rejected until the very end of the war, when it was too late to make a difference.

In contrast, the Union embraced the use of black troops, which totaled around 180,000 men by the war's end. This not only strengthened the Union forces but also committed the nation to the cause of emancipation.

I think it's also important to consider the psychological and ideological impact of making slavery a central issue. For many Northerners, the war took on a higher purpose, which boosted morale and support for the war effort.

Furthermore, the international dimension cannot be overlooked. Britain and France were considering recognizing the Confederacy, but the Emancipation Proclamation made that much less likely, as it aligned the Union's cause with anti-slavery sentiments in Europe.

So, in summary, the war's goals shifted from preserving the Union to includes ending slavery due to a confluence of factors: military strategy, moral and political pressure, the actions of enslaved people themselves, and international diplomacy.

I should probably organize my thoughts into a more coherent narrative.

Perhaps I can structure it like this:

1. **Initial War Aims:** The war began as a conflict to preserve the Union, with slavery being a underlying cause but not an explicit war goal.

2. **Gradual Evolution:** As the war progressed, pressures from abolitionists, the need for additional troops, and strategic considerations led to incremental steps towards emancipation, such as the Confiscation Acts and the Emancipation Proclamation.

3. **Moral and Political Shift:** Public opinion in the North increasingly saw the war as a struggle against slavery, and political leaders, including Lincoln, responded to this shift.

4. **Military Utility:** The use of former slaves as soldiers strengthened the Union's military position and further entrenched emancipation as a war aim.

5. **International Factors:** Making slavery a central issue helped prevent foreign intervention by powers opposed to slavery.

6. **Legislation and Amendments:** The passage of the 13th Amendment solidified the end of slavery as a permanent outcome of the war.

By tracing these steps, I can show how the war's purpose expanded over time to include the abolition of slavery.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I need to present this in a clear and logical manner.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The American Civil War initially aimed to preserve the Union, but evolved to include ending slavery due to military necessities, moral and political pressures, actions of enslaved people, and international diplomacy, culminating in the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment.}} \]
