I've been given this question: "Why do women earn less than men?" It's a complex issue, and I need to approach it thoughtfully. I know that there's a gender pay gap, where women generally earn less than men, but I don't know all the reasons behind it. I think I should start by understanding the current statistics and then look into the factors that contribute to this disparity.

First, I should find out the extent of the gender pay gap. I recall hearing about "equal pay for equal work," but I'm not sure how that relates to the overall earnings difference. Maybe I can look up some recent studies or reports on this topic.

Gender Pay Gap Statistics (2020) « CareersWiki.com
Unfortunately, not all is equal in the professional world. Despite major improvements in recent years, there is still a gender pay gap that negatively affects women.
Given how important this issue is, we put together this list of the 25 most important gender pay gap statistics of 2020 that your business needs to know.
A quick note: when people talk about the “gender pay gap” they are most often referring to three disparities that are closely linked:
Disparities in Payment;
Disparities in Employment;
Disparities in Education;
All three of these factors contribute to the gender pay gap and we will note some statistics from each category.

Gender Payment Gap Statistics
1. Women Earn 79 Cents for Every Dollar Men Earn
Let’s start with a commonly cited statistic. Averaging the gross income for all women and men in the county, women on average earn 79 cents for every dollar a man makes.
This figure does not control for education and qualifications [1].
2. When Controlling for Specific Employment and Qualifications, Men and Women Make About the Same
The previous figure did not take into account the specific jobs and qualifications of men and women.
When controlling for these two variables, the gender pay gap shrinks to about 98 cents for women per every dollar men make. That is still a gap but much less than the uncontrolled figure [1]
3. The Gender Pay Gap Has Shrunk in the Past 40 Years
In 1979 the median salary for women was 62% of the median salary for men. As of 2018, women’s median earnings were now 81% of men’s median earnings.
That is a good sign but there is still more progress to be made on that front [2]
4. But the Rate of Shrinking Has Stalled in the Past 15 Years
Even though the gender pay gap has substantially decreased in the past 20 years, this rate of decrease has stalled in the past 15 years.
Women’s median earnings have hovered around 80% of men’s since about 2004 [2]
5. Utah Has the Highest Current Gender Pay Gap
As of 2018, Utah is the state with the most significant uncontrolled pay gap.
Women in Utah have a median income that is 57% of the median earnings of men. Washington D.C. has the lowest gender pay gap at 89% [2].
6. The Gender Pay Gap Is Relatively Small Between Single Men and Single Women
When comparing the median earnings for single men and single women who have no children, single women make about 94% of single men’s median earnings.
This stat reflects the fact that raising children is often a barricade for women’s professional advancement [2]
7.  Women’s Entry Into the Labor Force Has Caused the Gender Pay Gap to Shrink
There is a positive correlation between the number of women in the workforce and a lessening of the pay gap.
In 1965, only about 40% of adult women were part of the full-time work-force. The entry of women in the labor force likely has a lot to do with the decreasing pay gap in the past few decades [3].
8. Women Perform More Unpaid Labor Than Men
Even though more women participate in the workforce nowadays, they are still more likely to spend more time than men performing unpaid labor like childcare or household tasks.
This unpaid labor most likely erodes their earning potential. Women spend about double the time taking care of children than men do and spend about 50% more time doing household activities like cleaning or cooking [3].
9. The Gender Pay Gap Is Largest Between White Men and Black Women
When uncontrolled for education and qualifications, black women make only 71% of every dollar men make.
Even when controlled for education and qualification, this gap shrinks to only 91%, still a higher gap than that between white women and white men [4].
10. Given Current Trends, the Pay Gap Should Be Eliminated by 2040
If current trends extend into the future, experts believe that the gender pay gap should effectively be closed by 2040.
This is an optimistic projection, other more conservative estimates hold that it will take until 2070 to close the gap [1].
11. The Gender Pay Gap Exists All Over the World
Disparities in payment based on gender are not unique to the US. No country has succeeded in eliminating the gender pay gap.
According to the most recent data, Iceland is the country with the lowest gap and the US is ranked 51st, below countries like Cuba, Rwanda, Switzerland, Norway, Bolivia, and South Africa [5].
Gender Employment Gap Statistics
12. 57.1% of Women Participate in the Labor Force Compared to 69.1% of Men
Women make up a smaller proportion of the labor force.
As of 2019, about 57.1% of women over the age of 16 were in the labor force. This figure is compared to 69.1% of men. [6].
13. Women Are Underrepresented in Science and Tech-Related Positions
It is probably not surprising but women are underrepresented in the science and tech sectors.
As of 2015, women make up less than a quarter of employees in STEM-related fields [7].
14. Only 13% of Engineers Are Women
The disparity between men and women in the workforce is the highest in the fields of engineering.
Among engineering fields, mechanical engineering has the greatest gap with only 6% of mechanical engineers being women.
The lowest disparity among engineering fields was Industrial engineering (24.3%) [8].
15. Women Are Overrepresented in Health and Social Services Positions
On the flip side, women make up the majority of those employed in the health and social services field.
Women make up approximately 79% of the workforce in the health and social services field.
In general, women are overrepresented in the nonprofit and public service industries [9].
16. Women Are More Likely to Work Part-time Jobs
In addition to disparities in specific sectors of employment, women, in general, are more likely to work part-time jobs than men.
In 2013, approximately 30% of working women were employed in part-time positions as compared to 16% of employed men [10].
17. Women Take Longer To Progress in Their Careers
Women, in general, tend to climb the career ladder at a slower pace than men. By ages 30-44, about 47% of male employees are in managerial positions or higher compared to only 40% of women.
By late career, these numbers jump to 57% and 41% for men and women respectively. Only 3% of women in late-careers have risen to the level of executive, compared to 8% of men [4].
18. Women Spend More Time Out of the Workforce and Incur Harsher Salary Penalties
When workers temporarily leave the workforce they usually incur a salary penalty when reentering.
Women are both more likely to take gaps in their employment and take longer gaps than men.
As such, they get hit harder with salary penalties upon reentering the workforce. This effect is most pronounced when a woman takes time off to have a child [4].
19.  Men Are Severely Underrepresented in Early Childhood Education and Childcare Positions
Gender gaps in employment cut both ways. Men are overwhelmingly under-represented in positions relating to early childhood education and childcare.
Men make up only 2.3% of all preschool and kindergarten teachers and make up only 6% of all childcare occupations. Men make up about 20% of elementary school teachers and around 41% of secondary school teachers.
This statistic is likely the result of childcare occupations typically being regarded as “women’s work” [11].
20. Women Are Judged As Less Competent Than Their Male Coworkers
Inequalities in employment extend to within jobs themselves.
More than 64% of women in the workplace report having to provide more evidence of their competence than male colleagues and are more likely to be judged as making mistakes or lacking knowledge.
Black women are the most likely to have their judgment and competency questioned [12].
Education Gap Statistics
21. Women Earn More Degrees Than Men
As of 2017, women outearn men in college and graduate degrees. In 2017, women earned more than half of all conferred bachelor’s degrees (57.3%), master’s degrees (59.4%) and doctorate degrees (53.3%)
The fact that women earn more degrees than men but are nonetheless underpaid compared to men is another symptom of the pay gap [6].
22. Women Earn Fewer STEM Degrees
Despite the fact that they earn the most amount of degrees, women only earned about one-third (35%) of conferred STEM degrees in 2016.
Among these fields, women had the highest representation in the biological and life sciences, in which they actually outnumber men (59.9%) [7] .
23. Women Collectively Have More Student Debt
Women on average have to put themselves more into debt to get an education than men.
Almost two-thirds of the outstanding national student debt is held by women (~$929 billion). As a result, women have less disposable income compared to men after graduating and have to spend a longer time paying off student debt [13].
24. Women Have Higher Graduation Rates But Still Earn Less Than Men
In general, women are more likely to complete a degree than men.
Approximately 63% of women who pursue a bachelor’s degree complete it within years compared to 57% for men. Nonetheless, women still earn less out of college than men [14].
25. Globally, Women Are Still Behind in Education
Although women have made great leaps and bounds in several developed countries over the past 100 years, women as a global population are still undereducated compared to men.
Women make up more than two-thirds of the world’s illiterate population and women in most countries have lower school enrollment rates than men [15].
Conclusions
The gender pay gap is likely not attributable to one specific factor but man overlapping and reinforcing ones.
Employers not only have an ethical duty to lessen disparities that cause the inequities in pay, employment, and education, there is evidence that more diverse workplaces are more productive and generate higher than average returns [16].

Essential Wage Gap Statistics You Need to Know in 2022
July 4, 2021
Wage gap statistics show some improvements compared to previous years, yet figures on women in the workplace indicate severe racial and gender discrimination. Even though more and more women have essential business roles, there is still much to do to achieve financial equality.
The discrepancy between men’s and women’s salaries is vast, revealing that female workers have lower pay than male workers, even when they have the same qualifications and job roles. The stats below illustrate the wage gap, shedding light on the issue.

Women make $0.82 to every dollar men make when the gender pay gap is uncontrolled
During the pandemic, women have lost 5.4 million jobs
Lesbian women earn 12% less than heterosexual women
Women in executive positions earn $0.94 to every $1 their male colleagues earn
The wage gap has been closing by half a cent per year since the Equal Pay Act of 1963
According to 46% of men, the gender pay gap is a myth
Black women in the controlled pay gap group make $0.97 to every $1 men make
Throughout a 40-year career, women stand to lose $850,000 due to the gender pay gap
Gender Pay Gap Statistics
1. Women make $0.82 to every dollar men make when the gender pay gap is uncontrolled.
(PayScale)
The uncontrolled pay gap measures the median salary that men and women earn regardless of their job role or seniority. Recent data on the uncontrolled pay gap reveals that female workers earn $0.82 for every dollar male workers make. This is one cent more than they made in 2020. The slight improvement might be driven by the increased number of women who left the workforce due to family care or layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Women in the controlled group make $0.98 for $1 men earn.
(PayScale)
The controlled gender pay gap measures equal pay for equal work. Gender pay gap facts from reputable sources point out that women still make two cents less than men without any legitimate reason despite doing the same job and having the same skills. This gender pay gap has been closing slowly but steadily at 1% annually. Since 2015, it has decreased by $0.01.
3. Women who were laid off due to COVID-19 earned $0.79 for every dollar that men earned.
(PayScale)
Gender wage gap statistics show that the uncontrolled pay gap is wider for women who were laid off due to the COVID-19 crisis. They earned $0.79 compared to $1 that men made. The controlled pay gap is less significant—women who were laid off earned $0.98 for every $1 that men made.
4. The wage gap has been closing by half a cent per year since the Equal Pay Act of 1963.
(Pay Equity)
Since the Equal Pay Act, statistics on the wage gap have shown an incredibly slow improvement year after year. For example, in 1963, women made $0.59 for every $1 earned by men. In 2010, female workers earned $0.77, and now, they earn $0.82 for every $1 men earn. That means that in the past 40 years, the median earnings of female workers have been $700,000 to $2 million less than the earnings of male workers.
5. Gender pay gap statistics show that women make $850,000 less than men throughout their 40-year careers.
(PayScale)
Supposing that the wage gap remained the same and that employees got a standard 3% pay raise every year, women’s average earnings over 40 years would amount to $3,830,000. However, if women’s earnings were the same as men’s, the sum would increase substantially, amounting to $4,600,000.
These gender wage gap facts and figures suggest that the average income by gender differs significantly. The entire sum of money earned throughout women’s careers is $850,000 less than men’s. When the pay gap is controlled, women make $80,000 less than men for doing the same job. That means that women have to work more than one year longer to earn the same as men.
6. Men’s median salary is around 18% bigger than women’s median salary.
(PayScale)
Gender wage gap data reveals that women’s median pay is $50,700 when the pay gap is uncontrolled and $61,000 when the pay gap is controlled. Compared to men, the average difference in earnings for women in the uncontrolled group is $11,400 and $1,100 in the controlled group.
7. Women have lost 5.4 million jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
(Center for American Progress)
The latest pay gap statistics reveal that women have lost 5.4 million jobs during the pandemic—about 1 million more than men. In addition, approximately 2.4 million women have dropped out of the labor force during the pandemic to respond to child care demands due to school closures. In turn, only 1.8 million men have done the same.
8. According to 46% of men, the gender pay gap is a myth.
(Time)
Overall, 62% of Americans believe men earn more than women for doing the same job. However, nearly half of men see the men and women pay difference as a made-up notion “to serve a political purpose” and don’t consider it a legitimate issue. Additionally, 24% of men aged 18–34 say that media reports about unequal pay are fake news. Furthermore, out of surveyed men, only 48% characterized unequal pay as “very unfair,” while 58% said that the factors that made it harder for women to get ahead in the past no longer exist.
9. Women in executive positions make $0.94 to every $1 men make.
(PayScale)
According to recent gender wage gap stats, women in executive positions make $0.94 for every $1 men make. Compared to 2020, this is only a $0.01 improvement. Female executives earn $0.70 to men’s $1 within the uncontrolled pay gap group, an improvement of $0.01 from 2020. These numbers indicate that the wage gap widens as women progress and men’s wages increase significantly faster.
Discouraging Racial Wage Gap Statistics
10. American Indians and Alaska Natives earn $0.69 to every dollar white men earn.
(PayScale)
All men outrank women in the workforce within their ethnic group, even men of color who generally earn less than white men. American Indians and Alaska Natives experience the most significant uncontrolled pay gap. Women in this group earn $0.69, whereas men make $0.85 for every dollar white men earn. The gap has worsened by $0.06 for women since 2020.
11. Black women in the controlled pay gap group make $0.97 to every $1 white men make.
(PayScale)
Unequal pay is one of the most frequent and reported types of discrimination in the workplace. The pay gap rate is significant for black women in the controlled pay gap group. Black women’s median pay is $73,000 compared to $75,000 that white men make for the same job. That means that the pay disparity is $2,000 a year, which can amount to millions of dollars throughout black women’s careers.
12. Latinas are paid $0.55 for every $1 white, non-Hispanic men make.
(National Partnership for Women & Families)
Despite the importance of diversity in the workplace, women as members of minority groups are still discriminated against and earn significantly less than white, non-Hispanic men. The median pay for Latinas in the US is $36,110 compared to white men’s median salary of $65,208. That’s a difference of $29,098 a year, as gender pay gap data indicates.
13. Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid $0.52 for every dollar white men make.
(National Partnership for Women & Families)
Asian American and Pacific Islander women experience a shocking gender pay gap. A typical Asian American woman earns a median annual salary of $56,807. That’s $8,401 less on a yearly basis than white, non-Hispanic men’s median salary, which is $65,208.
LGBT Facts About the Wage Gap You Shouldn’t Neglect
14. Lesbian women make 12% less money than heterosexual women.
(NBCNews)
Regardless of the company or position, lesbian women make less money than their heterosexual colleagues, even though there’s a general notion that lesbian women make more money than heterosexual women. On average, they make $45,606 a year, while straight women make $51,461 a year. The wage gap is even more significant between gay and straight men—$56,936 and 83,469, respectively.
15. On average, gay men make 11% less than straight men.
(Daily Beast)
Unfortunately, gay men don’t fare any better than lesbian women. As wage gap stats uncover, they make around 11% less than their straight counterparts, even after controlling for occupation, experience, skills, marital status, and location.
16. The average household income for same-sex couples amounts to $107,200.
(The US Census Bureau)
According to the latest research, same-sex married couples account for 1% of all households in the US. The median married couples income of same-sex families is $107,200, which is higher than heterosexual households that make $96,930. The median income of same-sex female married couples is $95,720, significantly less than same-sex male couples that earn $123,600.
17. The poverty rate for transgender people is 29.4%.
(Williams Institute)
According to the LGBT wage gap statistics, the poverty rate is different for same-sex marriages and different-sex marriages (6.6% and 5.6%, respectively). If we observe groups, 21.6% of LBGT people and 15.7% of cisgender people live in poverty. However, the biggest poverty rate can be seen in the transgender population—more transgender people live in poverty than lesbian, gay, or bisexual people. Transgender men have the highest poverty rate (33.7%), followed by transgender women (29.6%).
Eye-Opening Gender Pay Gap Stats by Industry
18. Finance and insurance have the biggest uncontrolled pay gap of 77 cents for $1.
(PayScale)
The wage gap statistics show that differences in pay are more obvious in specific industries. Undoubtedly, the biggest uncontrolled wage gap is seen in finance and insurance ($0.77). Agencies and consultancies come next at $0.83, followed by healthcare at $0.86. Transportation and warehousing have a pay gap of $0.87, while retail and customer service, nonprofits, energy and utilities, and engineering and science each see a gap of $0.88. The slightest uncontrolled pay gap is found in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industries ($0.96). Similarly, real estate and rental have a pay gap of $0.94.
19. Male athletes make from 15% to almost 100% more than female athletes.
(Adelphi University)
The pay rate varies from sport to sport, but generally, women are paid significantly less than men. The gender pay gap in sports statistics show that the average player compensation for a male athlete in basketball is $8.3 million, whereas women earn $75,181. When it comes to softball/baseball, the gap is even wider—men make on average $4 million compared to women who make only $6,000. The gap exists in golf ($1.2 million vs. $48,993), soccer ($410,730 vs. $35,000), and tennis ($335,946 vs. $283,635).
20. Women holding education, library, and training positions make 71 cents for every dollar men make.
(PayScale)
Even though 74% of educators, trainers, and librarians are women, the wage gap percentage is vast. To illustrate, they make only $0.71 to $1 their male counterparts make. Although women account for 70% of the overall education workforce, they mainly teach in elementary schools. Men, on the other hand, have the privilege to teach in high schools.
21. Female employees in the healthcare sector make 96 cents for every dollar that male employees make.
(PayScale)
Although women dominate the healthcare sector, women’s pay gap facts indicate they earn less. Even though men account for only 15% of healthcare workers, they still earn more than their female colleagues. The statistics on the average income by gender show that women in healthcare earn $0.96 for every $1 earned by men.
22. The controlled pay gap between university and high school degrees is $0.98.
(PayScale)
Having a higher education doesn’t mean women are paid the same as men. Recent wage gap data reveals that the controlled pay gap between higher education and high school degrees is $0.98. Furthermore, the controlled wage gap for MBAs and health professional doctorates is $0.96, whereas bachelor’s degrees see a pay gap of $0.99. On the other hand, women with MBAs in the uncontrolled pay gap group make $0.76 for every $1 that men with the same degree make.
23. Female legal and social service professionals make $1 for each $1 that men make when data is controlled.
(PayScale)
As per statistics on the wage gap, there’s a closing of the controlled pay gap for legal service professions. Women employed in these two sectors make one dollar for one dollar that men earn. On the other hand, maintenance, installation, and repair positions witness the widest controlled wage gap—$0.94. The wage gap in construction and extraction is $0.96, while food preparation and serving, management, and protection services have a pay gap of $0.97.
24. The wage gap exists even in industries where both men and women have the same qualifications and do the same job.
More pay gap facts indicate that the issue is more significant in male-dominated industries, but that is not always the case. The following list involves 10 occupations where men make more money for the same job:
Sales representatives and related occupations – $0.90
Emergency management specialist – $0.89
Police officers – $0.89
Gaming supervisors – $0.88
Drivers – $0.86
Waiters and waitresses – $0.86
Fashion designers – $0.85
Computer operators – $0.85
Farm and other agricultural managers – $0.84
Anesthesiologists – $0.83
25. Female producers and directors make 6% more than their male counterparts.
(Business.org)
Surprisingly, facts about the gender pay gap reveal that some occupations favor women. Female producers and directors make 6% more than their male counterparts.
Additionally, women in office and administrative support roles make 5% more than men. Female bus drivers, wholesale and retail buyers, and fast food and counter workers make 2% more than men who do the same jobs. Such a slight advantage in favor of either gender is reasonable, considering that the pay gap among sales agents and real estate brokers is vast—women make only 69% of the amount men make.
The Bottom Line: Effects of Gender Pay Gap
The wage gap doesn’t only affect finances, but it also has an adverse effect on workers’ mental health and physical well-being. Even though the level of discrimination and wage gap is significantly reduced compared to previous decades, it’s still present across various industries.
Employees who face pay, gender, and racial discrimination often feel exhausted and frustrated. These physical and mental states may even result in depression or anxiety disorders. Considering that women are expected to work and take care of their families at the same time, it’s not surprising that their mental health is in danger.

Global gender pay gap 2015-2020
Published by M. Szmigiera , May 5, 2021
The difference between the earnings of women and men has shrunk slightly over the past years. Considering the controlled gender pay gap, which measures the median salary for men and women with the same job and qualifications, women earned two cents less. By comparison, the uncontrolled gender pay gap measures the median salary for all men and all women. In 2021, women earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men.

This article provides a brief overview of gender pay gap (GPG) statistics, including the unadjusted gender pay gap used to monitor imbalances in earnings between men and women. The unadjusted gender pay gap is defined as the difference between the average gross hourly earnings of men and women expressed as a percentage of the average gross hourly earnings of men. It is calculated for enterprises with 10 or more employees.

2020 Gender Pay Gap Report Shows that Women Still Earn Less
The 2020 Gender Pay Gap Report Reveals that Women Still Earn Less for Equal Work

PayScale is pleased to announce the launch of the Gender Pay Gap Report for 2020. This is one of our most popular and extensive reports of the year, focused on the difference in earnings between men and women when comparing equal pay for equal work (when the data are controlled for compensable factors) as well as holistically (when the data are uncontrolled).
Between January 2018 and January 2020, nearly 1.6 million people took PayScale’s online salary survey, providing information about their industry, occupation, location and other compensable factors. They also reported demographic information, including age, gender, and race.
PayScale launches the Gender Pay Gap Report in advance of Equal Pay Day, which occurs on March 31, 2020 for the United States. Equal Pay Day was started by the National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE) in 1996 to highlight the gap between men and women’s wages and raise awareness of how far into the year the average women must work to earn what the average man earns in the previous year.
The Findings: Statistically, Women Are Still Paid Less
PayScale’s Gender Pay Gap Report shows that men and women still aren’t receiving equal pay for equal work, as women are making $0.98 to every $1 that a man makes when all factors that influence compensation (position, job level, years of experience, etc.) are controlled. This figure has remained unchanged since 2016. When data are not controlled, women are shown to make $0.81 to every $1 a man makes, demonstrating that more women occupy lower paying positions than men. This figure has increased 2 percent since our Gender Pay Gap Report last year, progress which is significant but underwhelming given the attention that has been put on the gender pay gap in recent years following the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that began in 2017 and 2018 respectively as well as several pay equity lawsuits being fought be some of America’s biggest companies.
The agonizingly slow close of the gender pay gap is more disconcerting considering that The Equal Pay Act — a law enforced by the EEOC requiring that men and women be given equal pay for equal work — was signed into law in 1963, almost 60 years ago. In 1963, women made $0.59 for every $1 a man made. Progress in closing the gender wage gap was made initially. However, progress has slowed. Since 2015, the uncontrolled gender pay gap has only decreased by $0.07.
Why the Gender Pay Gap is Important
Not everyone believes the gender pay gap exists. According to a survey by SurveyMonkey of 8,566 American adults in 2019, 46 percent of men and 30 percent of women believe that the gender pay gap is “made up to serve a political purpose” and is not a “legitimate issue”.
Part of the confusion lies in misuse of the term “gender pay gap.” The media sometimes reports the uncontrolled gender pay gap figure of $0.81 to $1 and then uses the phrase “equal pay for equal work.” This is inaccurate, as “equal pay for equal work” applies only to the controlled gender pay gap, which is currently $0.98 to every $1 earned by a man.
Doubtless, the difference of 2 cents seems insignificant to many. While the controlled wage gap may seem small, it is a gap with statistical significance and represents a difference in pay between men and women for reasons that cannot be attributed to compensable factors. In other words, women are paid 2 percent less than men due to no attributable reason other than gender. In addition, what often gets lost in translation is what the uncontrolled wage gap truly represents — that women are less likely to hold high-level, high-paying jobs than men. In terms of impact on earnings over a lifetime, PayScale’s analysis found that women stand to lose $900,000 on average over the course of a 40-year career for the uncontrolled group and $80,000 for the controlled group.
Detractors often claim that the difference in wages between men and women is explained by life choices rather than discrimination. In particular, it is claimed that women choose to work part-time or work in less demanding jobs with more flexibility in order to have children and care for families and that this reality negates the importance of a gap in wages between the genders.
While this is somewhat true, the conclusion that the gender pay gap doesn’t matter or that women’s choices negate the existence of systemic barriers to opportunity is false.
It is true that more women choose careers in part-time or lower paying occupations. But this is evidence of occupational segregation. The uncontrolled gender pay gap is useful for demonstrating the impact of women being under-represented in higher paying occupations or failing to be promoted to more senior roles. What it suggests is that the opportunity for women is narrower than it is for men or that the encouragement given to women to pursue high paying occupations is lacking, especially in occupations that break standard gender norms.
The data also show that women are paid less than men even in lower paying occupations. For example, according to PayScale’s 2020 Gender Pay Gap Report, waitresses make $0.86 compared to every $1 male waiters make even when all data are controlled. Women who assemble electronics make $0.84 to every $1 men in the same occupation make. Women artists make $0.89 to every $1 made by male artists. Women in higher paying occupations also make less, such as women anesthesiologists, who are shown to make $0.83 to every $1 a man makes. This is evidence of women not earning equal pay for equal work.
It is also true that women experience a drop-in compensation as a result of having children. The Motherhood Penalty is a well-documented phenomenon showing that women with children earn less than women without children. Men with children, however, sometimes make more than men without children. According to Equal Pay Today, mothers make $.70 to every $1 fathers make.
All of this is to demonstrate the gender pay gap is very real and suggestive of penalties levied against women for stepping out of gender norms, or in anticipation of women fulfilling gender norms by eventually becoming mothers and caretakers. However, the gaps experienced by women vary by occupation. They also vary by other factors.
Women of Color Experience a Wider Gender Pay Gap
Women of color face additional barriers in getting fair pay and advancing in the workplace compared to white women. In the 2020 Gender Pay Gap Report, we took a close look at the intersection of gender and race and examined how the gender wage gap differs for women of various races.
In the United States, the gender pay gap for women varies by demographic. In 2020 for the uncontrolled group, compared to each $1 earned by a white man:
American Indian and Alaskan Native women earned $0.75
Asian-American women earned $0.95
African and Black American women earned $0.75
Hispanic women earned $0.75
Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander women earned $0.80
White women earned $0.81
The 2020 Gender Pay Gap report also examines the opportunity gap and found that women across all races and ethnicities were more represented in the individual contributor group than white men, showing that women, and especially women of color, have more difficult advancing to managerial and executive roles than white men.
Impact of the Coronavirus on Women’s Earnings
Given the significance of the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020, PayScale also looked at the impact of the gender wage gap on occupations most vulnerable to financial risk. For example, women elementary school teachers and flight attendants make $0.92 for every $1 a man makes when all compensable factors are controlled. These occupations are currently under threat of furloughs, unpaid time off, or layoffs given school closures and travel bans to flatten the curve during the pandemic. Women also make up a greater percentage of the labor force in occupations such as Community & Social Services, Education, Library & Training, Office & Administrative Support, and Personal Care & Services. All of these occupations are likely to suffer in this time of economic uncertainty.
The Gender Pay Gap can also be felt among healthcare practitioners. Female family doctors (GPs) make $0.94 for every $1 a male family doctor makes. Meanwhile, nurses – which are 90 percent female – make $0.98 to every $1 a male nurse makes. Again, this is when all compensable factors are controlled, meaning that there is no discernible reason for the differences in compensation other than gender.
Why the Gender Pay Gap Matters to Employers
Most employers want to pay women fairly in comparison to men. The obstacles that result in the gender pay gap are often unintentional and invisible. They can be driven by unconscious bias, outdated compensation practices that rely on past salary history, or negotiation tactics or expectation of self-advocacy for raises and promotions that favor men.
Employers should care about the gender pay gap because paying workers fairly is the right thing to do – for men as well as women. Employers should also care about compliance with federal and state laws and take active steps to manage pay equity as part of standard compensation planning for all employees. Any woman making less than any man doing the same job that can’t be justified by documented, compensable factors can log a complaint with the EEOC or sue for pay equity under the Equal Pay Act. It is therefore in an employer’s best interest to make sure compensation practices are strategic and to monitor internal pay equity regularly for issues.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why do women earn less than men?" It's a big topic, and I know there's something called the gender pay gap, but I'm not exactly sure what causes it. I think I should start by understanding what the current statistics say about the gender pay gap.

From the first search result, it says that women earn 79 cents for every dollar men earn, but that's without controlling for things like education and job type. When you do control for those factors, the gap closes to about 98 cents on the dollar. So, that means that when men and women have similar jobs and qualifications, women still earn a bit less. But the bigger gap comes from the fact that women tend to be in lower-paying jobs or have fewer opportunities for advancement.

Another search result shows that the gender pay gap has been closing slowly over time, but it's still significant. There are also differences based on race, with black women facing a larger gap. That makes sense because there are intersecting issues of gender and racial discrimination.

I also saw that the gender pay gap exists in many countries around the world, not just in the US. So, it's a global issue.

Now, I need to think about why this happens. There are probably many reasons contributing to this gap. Let me try to list some possible causes.

First, maybe women choose lower-paying jobs. A lot of care-related professions, like nursing or teaching, tend to pay less than fields like technology or finance. If more women are in these care professions, that could pull down the average earnings for women.

But, wait, another search result says that even within the same profession, women earn less than men. For example, female doctors earn less than male doctors, even when they have the same qualifications and experience. So, it's not just about the choice of profession.

Maybe women are less likely to negotiate for higher salaries or promotions. There's some research that suggests that women face social penalties when they negotiate aggressively, whereas men are rewarded for it. So, perhaps women are holding themselves back in asking for what they're worth.

Also, there's the issue of work-life balance. Women often bear more responsibility for childcare and household duties, which can lead to them working fewer hours or taking time off to care for family. That could affect their earnings over time.

But, I remember reading that even when controlling for hours worked and time off, there's still a gap. So, there must be other factors at play.

Perhaps unconscious bias plays a role. Employers might unconsciously favor men for higher-paying positions or give them more opportunities for advancement.

Discrimination could also be a factor. Even if it's not overt, subtle forms of discrimination can accumulate over time and affect women's earnings.

Looking at the search results, I see that women are underrepresented in higher management positions. So, maybe there's a glass ceiling that prevents women from reaching the top echelons of organizations, where salaries are higher.

Also, women of color face even larger pay gaps, which suggests that racism and sexism intersect to create worse outcomes for them.

I should also consider education levels. One search result mentioned that women earn more degrees than men but still earn less. So, education alone isn't closing the gap.

Another point is that women may start their careers at lower salaries, and since future raises are often based on current salary, that initial disadvantage can follow them throughout their careers.

There's also the motherhood penalty. Women who have children often face wage penalties, possibly because employers perceive them as less committed or less reliable.

On the other hand, men sometimes experience a fatherhood bonus, where their earnings increase after having children. That's interesting; maybe because employers see them as more stable or responsible.

So, it seems like there are multiple factors contributing to the gender pay gap. It's not just one thing; it's a combination of career choices, negotiation skills, work-life balance issues, bias, discrimination, and structural inequalities.

I think to really address this problem, society needs to tackle all these aspects. That could involve promoting gender equality in education and career choices, encouraging women to negotiate their salaries, providing better support for working parents, addressing unconscious bias in hiring and promotion processes, and enforcing equal pay laws.

It's also important for companies to conduct regular pay equity analyses to ensure that they're not discriminating against women or any other group.

Finally, raising awareness about the gender pay gap and its causes can help change attitudes and promote fairness in the workplace.

In conclusion, the gender pay gap persists due to a complex interplay of factors, including career choices, negotiation behaviors, work-life balance considerations, bias, discrimination, and structural inequalities. Addressing this issue requires multifaceted approaches that promote equality in education, challenge stereotypes, support working parents, and ensure fair compensation practices in the workplace.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The gender pay gap persists due to a complex interplay of factors, including career choices, negotiation behaviors, work-life balance considerations, bias, discrimination, and structural inequalities.}} \]
