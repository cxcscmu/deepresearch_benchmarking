Alright, so I need to figure out how body language affects communication. I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I know that communication isn't just about the words we say; there’s also non-verbal stuff, and body language is a big part of that.

First off, what is body language? I think it includes things like our posture, facial expressions, gestures, and even how we position ourselves in relation to others. So, it’s all the non-verbal signals we send out without uttering a single word.

Now, how does this affect communication? Well, I recall that studies have shown that a large percentage of communication is non-verbal. I think I heard somewhere that only 7% of communication is the actual words spoken, while 38% is tone of voice and 55% is body language. But I’m not sure about those numbers; maybe I should look that up to get accurate information.

Communication - What Percentage is Body Language?

Q.
Typically what percentage of communication is made up from the body language of the speakers? I've heard 55%. Is this reasonable?
(Mr Rod Jones, 13 January 2009)
A.
The percentage that you have quoted is basically correct, but isn’t always relevant to all modes of communication.
The figure 55% comes from some research that Albert Mehrabian undertook in 1971, the results of which are still often quoted today. Mehrabian basically came to the conclusion that communication, on a face-to-face basis, is thought to consist of three separate elements:
Words (what is actually said)
Tone of voice (how we say the words)
Body Language
All three of these elements can be conveyed at the same time to express an overall message. Often, the tone of voice and body language are combined to become the most powerful form of communication. However, body language – which forms a large part of non-verbal communication – is often used on its own, and is thought to be one of the most ‘telling’ modes of communication. Through his research Mehrabian also surmised that proportionally, the three elements were not of equal importance. He claimed that in face-to-face communication, the majority of what is put across is portrayed through non verbal communication:
Words (the literal meaning) account for 7% of the overall message
Tone of voice accounts for 38% of the overall message
Body Language accounts for 55% of the overall message
Therefore, through face-to-face communication, the nonverbal communication becomes the most powerful mode of communication when conveying feelings or attitudes – e.g. “I like this”, “I don’t like this”. It is much more likely, therefore, to be the primary indicator.
For instance, imagine that a man and a woman are having a blind date. The man asks the woman if she’s enjoying herself. The woman isn’t enjoying herself at all, but wants to be polite, so she says “yes, I’m having a really nice time”. The literal meaning of the words she uses conveys that she is enjoying herself. The tone of voice she uses in conjunction with the words may, however, betray the words she’s speaking. Her closed, awkward body language may also express that she’s not enjoying herself. So the two non-verbal communication elements may give away the fact that she isn’t having a very good time, despite saying she is.
However, it’s worth noting that Mehrabian has since noted “…Unless a communicator is talking about their feelings or attitudes, these equations are not applicable”. In essence, the 7% figure can be misleading as it could imply that the words we say are of relatively little importance. This isn’t the case - the above equation is only really relevant when the words we are saying are at odds with the body language or tone of voice we’re using.

Also, although these figures are a generalisation, they might well vary between men and women, as women talk about their feelings and emotions much more than men (at least typically), and women are more attuned to listening to what's said than men, although they, too, respond to non-verbal cues like facial expression and body language. I think it's best to take this as a guide, but hardly an exact science.

You do know that this is one of the biggest false myths going? Professor Mehrabian himself says this is not what his findings proved and is a complete misinterpretation of his research. And if you think about it seriously, how non-sensical it is to think that communication is only '7% the words'. Look up the Mehrabian Myth on google and find out more about how wrong these figures are and how Mehrabian's research was not even about 'how much of communication is verbal/tone of voice/body language.

The percentage of communication that is carried by body language varies between zero and 100%. There are no useful average values for the general case, only for some very specific situations.
In typical communication intensive situations like lectures the majority of information that is communicated comes to you through the words, with a minimal contribution from facial expressions and body language. To verify this try simply watching a TED talk or a TV documentary with the sound muted. You probably get nothing. Now try the opposite and watch a TED talk with the video covered and listening only

What Percentage Of Communication Is Your Body Language
What Percentage Of Communication Is Your Body Language
By: Phil Taylor
Time to read: 4 min.
There is an urban myth about the percentage of what percentage is body language or non-verbal communication. We are constantly told that 93% of our communication is non-verbal after much research and understanding that is incorrect.
According to body language experts, the percentage of nonverbal communication we use to communicate with one another is around 60% to 65%
Oftentimes, we’re told that 93% of our communication is non-verbal. If this is the case, then it should be possible to watch a television program in another language with no sound playing and understand what’s going on the moment you start watching.
Table Of Contents
[ show]
Body Language Communication Study Albert Mehrabian
The 7 38 55 Rule Is A Myth
Is 93% 7% non-verbal communication rule actually true?
First, we will start by describing what this rule is for. There were a number of studies conducted in the late 1960s by a doctor named Albert Mehrabian and he was looking at non-verbal communication & the impact non-verbal communication has on it.
The data from his study showed that 55% of communication was through body language, 38% through tone, and only 7% of the actual content (the words they say)
This has become known as the 93% 7% rule because we take 55% and add 38% and that is a non-verbal piece and the verbal piece of courses remaining 7% totaling 100%.
The Problem
The study was actually pretty clear about the limitations and what the findings were. We think there is plenty of room for misinterpretation and that’s probably what happened with Mehrabian’s research and led to the 93% 7% rule.
We often hear about the 93% 7% rule about conversations and nonverbal communication, which highlights how to use nonverbal behavior to communicate effectively. For example, in presentations or at work, or in public speaking.
The problem again is that the study was not about that. The design of the research just had to do with an audience that did not know who the speaker was, as well as what he communicated in terms of content. The speakers used just one word.
What Was Measured
The study mostly measured liking, neutrality, and disliking. These are all variations of feeling rather than a wide range of emotions so you have participants who don’t know the speaker who says just one word. They are then restricted to liking or disliking the person they see.
Somehow this finding was interpreted by many to mean that 93% of all communication is nonverbal it’s just not the case.
You Can’t Believe Everything You Read, Test It.
We can test this misinterpretation of Mehrabian findings pretty easily consider for example watching a TV presenter they clearly have a visual component and an audio component to it now it’s not fair to say that you should be able to figure out what they are saying without any sound because 38% and original fining had to do with the tone let’s look at just 55% versus 45% if when they were live and the microphones went down would you be able to figurer out just from watching with no audio 55% of the message that they are trying to deliver?
You may be able to figure out something but certainly not 55% of the message they are trying to communicate the tone and the actual content of what is being said is far more important than just 45% in terms of accurately communicating a message.
Should We Ignore Non-Verbal Communication?
So does that mean that non-verbal communication is not important and this misinterpretation of early research has caused irreparable damage?
Should we ignore non-verbal communication? No not at all and rule communication is extremely important and in the original research, there was an important message that Mehrabian was trying to communicate. The message is simple it’s about incongruency.
Mehrabian was really getting out in his study in terms of finding was that when there is incongruence between non-verbal communication and verbal communication meaning someone is expressing one thing nonverbally but saying another verbally individuals pay much more attention to the non-verbal communication.
The Real Findings
That was a really important part of the study that has been overshadowed by the misinterpretation so if you want to effectively communicate and make sure that your messages is understood to make sure that your verbal communication is congruent is consistent with your verbal communication.
What Is Tone Of Voice In Communication
The tone of voice is how you convey your mood, personality, and attitude in written communication. The tone of voice may be seen as an aspect of style in which the writer is able to demonstrate her personal preferences.
There are three different aspects to the tone of voice, which are known as the “Three Tones”. These include:
1) The Attitude towards the content (positive or negative)
2) How formal or informal the writing is (formal or informal)
3) How assertive or passive (assertive or passive).
Summary
How much do we communicate through body language has never really been truly figured out by experts like Chase Huges have stated in his book the Six Minute X-Ray rapid behavior profiling is around 66%.
The use of body language is so important because it enables us to express our feelings and emotions without relying on words and sentences which people might not understand. According to the research in this study, non-verbal communication is essential regardless of what specific number we assign to it. It’s more than half of communication and we all know that naturally.

55% 38% 7% - The myth that 58% of communication is body language
55% body language, 38% tone, 7% words?  The myth about body language in presentations
You've heard the numbers, and they didn't make sense.  It might have been in a Presentation Skills course or at Toastmasters.  I've seen it in Sandler Sales training recently. Here they are:
55% of communication is visual (your body language)
38% of communication is your voice (tone, inflection, etc)
7% is verbal (your words)
Really?  Does that make any sense?  Its actuallly 90% wrong.
If they were true,
shouldn't you be able to understand 93% of a foreign language just by seeing the person talk?
shouldn't you be able to understand 55% of a speech on television with the sound turned off?
The famous 55%, 38%, 7% rule is actually a myth.  It's based on a study done in 1967 by Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a Professor of Psychology at  UCLA, but the study was completely misinterpreted by the media, and passed on for decades as fact.  Then the internet came along, and if you Google
55 38 7
you'll see a bunch of sites, including Wikipedia, that debunk the myth.
Trainers and presentation skills coaches love the myth because it seems to substantiate the point of view that movement and tone are critical to a presentation.  Authors like Jerry Weissman still use it as the basis for books published in 2009, even though the numbers are  completely misleading.
Of course, presentations are definitely improved by
appropriate hand movements
physical movement by the presenter
great body language
raising and lowering the tone of voice to emphasize points
but those are not more important than the words.
Also, if someone is boring and soft spoken enough, a lot of their message may be lost because the audience may not be paying attention.
However, the 55%, 38%, 7% numbers are a myth, and you can see plenty of references about it now on Google.  Spread the word.

What percentage of communication is nonverbal?
Professor Mehrabian combined the statistical results of the two studies and came up with the now famous—and famously misused—rule that communication is only 7 percent verbal and 93 percent non-verbal. The non-verbal component was made up of body language (55 percent) and tone of voice (38 percent ).
Click to see full answer.
In this way,  what percentage of communication is nonverbal in nature?
These studies led Dr. Mehrabian to devise a formula to describe how the mind determines meaning. He concluded that the interpretation of a message is 7 percent verbal, 38 percent vocal and 55 percent visual. The conclusion was that 93 percent of communication is “nonverbal” in nature.
what is the 7 %- 38 %- 55 rule? Albert Mehrabian's 7-38-55 Rule of Personal Communication. In communication, a speaker's words are only a fraction of his efforts. The pitch and tone of his voice, the speed and rhythm of the spoken word, and the pauses between those words may express more than what is being communicated by words alone.
Correspondingly,  what percentage of communication is words?
The numbers represent the percentages of importance that varying communication channels have. The belief is that 55% of communication is body language, 38% is the tone of voice, and 7% is the actual words spoken.
What percentage of communication is facial expression?
38 percent of a message pertaining to feelings is the way the words are spoken. 55 percent of a message pertaining to feelings is in the facial expression.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I have these search results about the percentage of communication that is body language. It seems like there's a common misconception floating around, and I need to sort out what's accurate and what's not.

First, there's this idea that 55% of communication is body language, 38% is tone of voice, and 7% is actual words. This adds up to 100%, and it's often referred to as the "7-38-55 rule." But according to several sources, this is a myth that's been misinterpreted over time.

One of the documents mentions that this percentage comes from research by Albert Mehrabian, who conducted studies in the 1960s. His studies apparently showed that 55% of communication was through body language, 38% through tone, and 7% through the actual words spoken. However, it seems like this has been taken out of context.

Another source points out that this research was specifically about liking or disliking someone based on communication, not about the general communication process. So, applying these percentages to all types of communication might not be accurate.

Moreover, if we consider that 93% of communication is non-verbal (55% body language plus 38% tone), that would mean only 7% is verbal. But that doesn't make sense in many scenarios. For example, if you're watching a foreign movie without subtitles, you can't understand 93% of what's being communicated just through body language and tone. That suggests there might be some misunderstanding here.

Some sources suggest that the actual percentage of communication that is non-verbal varies depending on the context and the message being conveyed. One document mentions that body language experts estimate around 60-65% of communication is non-verbal. That seems more plausible to me.

So, perhaps the 55-38-7 breakdown is not universally applicable, and it's better to think of non-verbal communication, including body language, as a significant but not overwhelmingly dominant part of how we communicate.

But to be thorough, maybe I should look for more recent research or different perspectives on this.

Communication - What Percentage is Body Language?

Q.
Typically what percentage of communication is made up from the body language of the speakers? I've heard 55%. Is this reasonable?
(Mr Rod Jones, 13 January 2009)
A.
The percentage that you have quoted is basically correct, but isn’t always relevant to all modes of communication.
The figure 55% comes from some research that Albert Mehrabian undertook in 1971, the results of which are still often quoted today. Mehrabian basically came to the conclusion that communication, on a face-to-face basis, is thought to consist of three separate elements:
Words (what is actually said)
Tone of voice (how we say the words)
Body Language
All three of these elements can be conveyed at the same time to express an overall message. Often, the tone of voice and body language are combined to become the most powerful form of communication. However, body language – which forms a large part of non-verbal communication – is often used on its own, and is thought to be one of the most ‘telling’ modes of communication. Through his research Mehrabian also surmised that proportionally, the three elements were not of equal importance. He claimed that in face-to-face communication, the majority of what is put across is portrayed through non verbal communication:
Words (the literal meaning) account for 7% of the overall message
Tone of voice accounts for 38% of the overall message
Body Language accounts for 55% of the overall message
Therefore, through face-to-face communication, the nonverbal communication becomes the most powerful mode of communication when conveying feelings or attitudes – e.g. “I like this”, “I don’t like this”. It is much more likely, therefore, to be the primary indicator.
For instance, imagine that a man and a woman are having a blind date. The man asks the woman if she’s enjoying herself. The woman isn’t enjoying herself at all, but wants to be polite, so she says “yes, I’m having a really nice time”. The literal meaning of the words she uses conveys that she is enjoying herself. The tone of voice she uses in conjunction with the words may, however, betray the words she’s speaking. Her closed, awkward body language may also express that she’s not enjoying herself. So the two non-verbal communication elements may give away the fact that she isn’t having a very good time, despite saying she is.
However, it’s worth noting that Mehrabian has since noted “…Unless a communicator is talking about their feelings or attitudes, these equations are not applicable”. In essence, the 7% figure can be misleading as it could imply that the words we say are of relatively little importance. This isn’t the case - the above equation is only really relevant when the words we are saying are at odds with the body language or tone of voice we’re using.

Also, although these figures are a generalisation, they might well vary between men and women, as women talk about their feelings and emotions much more than men (at least typically), and women are more attuned to listening to what's said than men, although they, too, respond to non-verbal cues like facial expression and body language. I think it's best to take this as a guide, but hardly an exact science.

You do know that this is one of the biggest false myths going? Professor Mehrabian himself says this is not what his findings proved and is a complete misinterpretation of his research. And if you think about it seriously, how non-sensical it is to think that communication is only '7% the words'. Look up the Mehrabian Myth on google and find out more about how wrong these figures are and how Mehrabian's research was not even about 'how much of communication is verbal/tone of voice/body language.

What Percentage Of Communication Is Your Body Language
What Percentage Of Communication Is Your Body Language
By: Phil Taylor
Time to read: 4 min.
There is an urban myth about the percentage of what percentage is body language or non-verbal communication. We are constantly told that 93% of our communication is non-verbal after much research and understanding that is incorrect.
According to body language experts, the percentage of nonverbal communication we use to communicate with one another is around 60% to 65%
Oftentimes, we’re told that 93% of our communication is non-verbal. If this is the case, then it should be possible to watch a television program in another language with no sound playing and understand what’s going on the moment you start watching.
Table Of Contents
[ show]
Body Language Communication Study Albert Mehrabian
The 7 38 55 Rule Is A Myth
Is 93% 7% non-verbal communication rule actually true?
First, we will start by describing what this rule is for. There were a number of studies conducted in the late 1960s by a doctor named Albert Mehrabian and he was looking at non-verbal communication & the impact non-verbal communication has on it.
The data from his study showed that 55% of communication was through body language, 38% through tone, and only 7% of the actual content (the words they say)
This has become known as the 93% 7% rule because we take 55% and add 38% and that is a non-verbal piece and the verbal piece of courses remaining 7% totaling 100%.
The Problem
The study was actually pretty clear about the limitations and what the findings were. We think there is plenty of room for misinterpretation and that’s probably what happened with Mehrabian’s research and led to the 93% 7% rule.
We often hear about the 93% 7% rule about conversations and nonverbal communication, which highlights how to use nonverbal behavior to communicate effectively. For example, in presentations or at work, or in public speaking.
The problem again is that the study was not about that. The design of the research just had to do with an audience that did not know who the speaker was, as well as what he communicated in terms of content. The speakers used just one word.
What Was Measured
The study mostly measured liking, neutrality, and disliking. These are all variations of feeling rather than a wide range of emotions so you have participants who don’t know the speaker who says just one word. They are then restricted to liking or disliking the person they see.
Somehow this finding was interpreted by many to mean that 93% of all communication is nonverbal it’s just not the case.
You Can’t Believe Everything You Read, Test It.
We can test this misinterpretation of Mehrabian findings pretty easily consider for example watching a TV presenter they clearly have a visual component and an audio component to it now it’s not fair to say that you should be able to figure out what they are saying without any sound because 38% and original fining had to do with the tone let’s look at just 55% versus 45% if when they were live and the microphones went down would you be able to figurer out just from watching with no audio 55% of the message that they are trying to deliver?
You may be able to figure out something but certainly not 55% of the message they are trying to communicate the tone and the actual content of what is being said is far more important than just 45% in terms of accurately communicating a message.
Should We Ignore Non-Verbal Communication?
So does that mean that non-verbal communication is not important and this misinterpretation of early research has caused irreparable damage?
Should we ignore non-verbal communication? No not at all and rule communication is extremely important and in the original research, there was an important message that Mehrabian was trying to communicate. The message is simple it’s about incongruency.
Mehrabian was really getting out in his study in terms of finding was that when there is incongruence between non-verbal communication and verbal communication meaning someone is expressing one thing nonverbally but saying another verbally individuals pay much more attention to the non-verbal communication.
The Real Findings
That was a really important part of the study that has been overshadowed by the misinterpretation so if you want to effectively communicate and make sure that your messages is understood to make sure that your verbal communication is congruent is consistent with your verbal communication.
What Is Tone Of Voice In Communication
The tone of voice is how you convey your mood, personality, and attitude in written communication. The tone of voice may be seen as an aspect of style in which the writer is able to demonstrate her personal preferences.
There are three different aspects to the tone of voice, which are known as the “Three Tones”. These include:
1) The Attitude towards the content (positive or negative)
2) How formal or informal the writing is (formal or informal)
3) How assertive or passive (assertive or passive).
Summary
How much do we communicate through body language has never really been truly figured out by experts like Chase Huges have stated in his book the Six Minute X-Ray rapid behavior profiling is around 66%.
The use of body language is so important because it enables us to express our feelings and emotions without relying on words and sentences which people might not understand. According to the research in this study, non-verbal communication is essential regardless of what specific number we assign to it. It’s more than half of communication and we all know that naturally.

The percentage of communication that is carried by body language varies between zero and 100%. There are no useful average values for the general case, only for some very specific situations.
In typical communication intensive situations like lectures the majority of information that is communicated comes to you through the words, with a minimal contribution from facial expressions and body language. To verify this try simply watching a TED talk or a TV documentary with the sound muted. You probably get nothing. Now try the opposite and watch a TED talk with the video covered and listening only

55% 38% 7% - The myth that 58% of communication is body language
55% body language, 38% tone, 7% words?  The myth about body language in presentations
You've heard the numbers, and they didn't make sense.  It might have been in a Presentation Skills course or at Toastmasters.  I've seen it in Sandler Sales training recently. Here they are:
55% of communication is visual (your body language)
38% of communication is your voice (tone, inflection, etc)
7% is verbal (your words)
Really?  Does that make any sense?  Its actuallly 90% wrong.
If they were true,
shouldn't you be able to understand 93% of a foreign language just by seeing the person talk?
shouldn't you be able to understand 55% of a speech on television with the sound turned off?
The famous 55%, 38%, 7% rule is actually a myth.  It's based on a study done in 1967 by Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a Professor of Psychology at  UCLA, but the study was completely misinterpreted by the media, and passed on for decades as fact.  Then the internet came along, and if you Google
55 38 7
you'll see a bunch of sites, including Wikipedia, that debunk the myth.
Trainers and presentation skills coaches love the myth because it seems to substantiate the point of view that movement and tone are critical to a presentation.  Authors like Jerry Weissman still use it as the basis for books published in 2009, even though the numbers are  completely misleading.
Of course, presentations are definitely improved by
appropriate hand movements
physical movement by the presenter
great body language
raising and lowering the tone of voice to emphasize points
but those are not more important than the words.
Also, if someone is boring and soft spoken enough, a lot of their message may be lost because the audience may not be paying attention.
However, the 55%, 38%, 7% numbers are a myth, and you can see plenty of references about it now on Google.  Spread the word.

To Talk Or Not To Talk That Is The Question!
Martina Advaney 05. 06. 2017
As we all know, eye contact and just a look can communicate a million words. The old adage also goes, action speaks louder than words. Depending upon which research paper you refer to, the percentage mostly varies from 70 to 93 percent.
At Least 70 Percent Of Communication Is Non Verbal
There are also those who will tell you that it’s all bunkum. Philip Yaffe goes on to indicate, the research of Professor Albert Mehrabian and all that his book Silent Messages stands for is inaccurate.
Though, Philip Yaffe mostly relies on the fact that a well constructed speech which depends on words, is more meaningful than a badly constructed speech that is well delivered.  He has a point.
But do we in our day to day communication with family, friends, colleagues and strangers go about giving speeches? Is  average conversation about eloquence?
Professor Mehrabian’s studies
Let us give a quick look to Professor Mehrabian’s studies. He is known for his pioneering work in the field of nonverbal communication, mainly body language. His extensive efforts have been, both towards  theoretical  and experiments that have helped identify nonverbal and subtle ways in which people convey:
like-dislike,
power and leadership,
discomfort and insecurity,
social attractiveness,
persuasiveness,
and ways to detect when others are being deceptive in communication.
He quite succinctly was able to explain how the voice, such as tone, intonation and volume, take up about 38 percent and most of a person’s communication; about 55 percent, comprises of body language. Thus, it leaves only 7 percent to the words actually being spoken. This 7, 38, 55 model is probably as relevant today as it was, when he first presented his study way back in the 70’s.
Is 70 % of communication non-verbal?
Microexpressions
Paul Ekman, the famous professor of psychology took all of this many steps further with his books Emotions Revealed and Unmasking the Face. But also his association with the investigating authorities in identifying when the criminals were lying and able to beat the polygraph; more commonly known as the lie detector.  His studies relate mainly to micro expressions.
We have been reading a fair amount in the recent days about pulling someone towards him and giving him a more than vigorous handshake and about the strong handshake where the knuckles went white. Is this about insecurity or is this about communicating power or both, or even about one-upmanship, added to that? All of it done, without words.
The university of Pennsylvania, has published a paper which is worth more than just a casual read. The paper titled T he Art Of Communication deals with some of the basic aspects of relating with other people.  This paper gives good tips for the average person on how she/he can improve on methods of communication and thus get a more empathetic reaction from others.
“Bubble Area”
One of the aspects the paper talks about is respecting a person’s personal space. They call this the “Bubble Area”. According to them the space a person needs from another is approximately one meter. In the opinion of the writer of this article, this is perhaps true of the American culture and the need for personal space varies from country to country.
For example, research supported by the Plainmath platform shows that one meter would be considered too far in France and the Czech Republic and the same one meter would be considered too close in many of the Asian countries.
The other body language tips they give could be quite useful to many. The basic one is what they call SOLER. This is about smile, openness, leaning forward, eye contact and a relaxed body form.
They further go on to talk about the voice. This is about the voice being well modulated and should be at a medium tone and volume. This again is perhaps subject to debate because what would be medium volume in the U.S. might be considered loud in many other countries. So here again one has to pay attention to where one is.
Mirroring the other person’s body language happens automatically between two individuals who have a natural empathy for each other.
Many feelings are communicated non verbally. Research also shows it is impossible not to send non verbal messages during communication.
There are also many schools all over the world that specialize in teaching body language skills. Sales persons reputedly practice many of the body language moves in order to get a better response.
If not 93 percent,  perhaps the minimum level of 70 percent of the communication being non verbal is true.

So, after looking into this, it seems that the 55-38-7 breakdown is not accurate for all types of communication. It was based on specific studies by Albert Mehrabian, but those studies had limitations and were misinterpreted over time. The general consensus now is that non-verbal communication, including body language, plays a significant role, but not to the extent of 93%.

Some sources suggest that around 60-65% of communication is non-verbal, which seems more reasonable to me. It makes sense that both verbal and non-verbal cues work together to convey a message, and sometimes non-verbal signals can contradict or complement the verbal ones.

I think it's important to understand that body language is a crucial part of how we communicate, especially in face-to-face interactions. It can influence how our words are perceived and can sometimes speak louder than words themselves, especially when there's inconsistency between what's being said and what's being expressed non-verbally.

For example, if someone is telling you they're happy, but their body language suggests otherwise—like slumped shoulders, avoiding eye contact, or a forced smile—it might indicate that something is off or that they're not being entirely truthful.

Moreover, body language can also play a role in building rapport, showing interest, and establishing trust in a conversation. Positive body language, such as maintaining eye contact, nodding, and facing towards the speaker, can make the other person feel heard and valued.

On the other hand, negative body language, like crossing arms, fidgeting, or looking away, might signal defensiveness, discomfort, or disinterest.

Therefore, being aware of one's own body language and being able to read others' non-verbal cues can greatly enhance communication effectiveness.

In summary, while the exact percentage of communication that is body language may not be 55%, it is undeniably a significant component that influences how messages are received and interpreted.

\boxed{\text{Body language significantly affects communication by influencing perception, building rapport, and sometimes contradicting verbal messages. While the exact percentage is debated, it is widely acknowledged as a crucial element in face-to-face interactions.}}
