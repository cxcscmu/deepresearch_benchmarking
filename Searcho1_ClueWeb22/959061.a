So I've been hearing a lot about this term "anti-vax" lately, and I'm not really sure what it means or why some people are against vaccines. I mean, vaccines have been around for a long time and they've saved so many lives. Diseases like smallpox and polio have almost been eradicated because of vaccines. So, why would anyone be against them?

First, I think I should understand what "anti-vax" means. From what I gather, "anti-vax" is short for "anti-vaccination," which refers to the opposition to vaccination and immunization. It seems like there's a group of people who don't believe in vaccinating themselves or their children, and I'm curious to know what their reasons are.

I remember there was a big controversy a few years back about vaccines causing autism. I think someone published a study linking the MMR vaccine to autism, but I also heard that the study was retracted and discredited. Is that still a prevalent belief among anti-vaxxers?

Let me try to look into this. Maybe I can find some information online about why people are against vaccines. I need to be careful though, because not all information on the internet is reliable. I should look for credible sources like scientific journals, news articles from reputable publishers, or information from health organizations like the CDC or WHO.

Why Are People Anti-Vaxx? 7 Common Reasons
by Lindsay E. Mack
June 7, 2016
Few current topics are more divisive than the safety of vaccines. Parents who are against vaccinating their children, or anti-vaxxers, may be confusing to those who favor the benefits of herd immunity. So if you’ve ever wondered why people are anti-vaxx, here are a few common reasons.
Anti-vaxxers are often concerned about the potential side effects of the numerous vaccinations that babies receive. Distrust of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as a preference for a more “natural” lifestyle, are also common components of the movement. However, the anti-vaxxer’s desire to prevent potential negative consequences in their own children may lead to major health concerns for many people.
According to Mother Jones, many states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children based on personal beliefs, religious beliefs, or medical exemptions. However, as the leniency in vaccinations continues, the dangers of very serious diseases grows. As explained in the Huffington Post, a recent increase in the prevalence of measles and whooping cough is directly correlated to the refusal of vaccines. Both diseases are preventable with vaccination. So why do anti-vaxx parents continue to hold their ground despite the dangers of these major diseases? The concern for their children is understandable, but many of their reasons for opting out of vaccinations are not based on science.
1
Concern About Side Effects

Some individuals do experience side effects from vaccinations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most reactions are mild, such as soreness at the injection area or a slight fever. As further explained by the CDC, serious allergic reactions to any vaccine are very rare and occur in fewer than one in a million doses. And as reported in the BBC, most experts agree that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the slight risks of allergic reactions.

Fear Of "Big Pharma"

Wariness of corporations is another factor. As explained in National Geographic, many members of the anti-vaccine movement have an "intense distrust of Big Pharma —the multinational pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines." Anti-vaxxers do not trust the powerful companies to make decisions in the best interest of consumers.
3
Preference For Homeopathy

The distrust for "Big Pharma" often goes hand-in-hand with anti-vaxxer's preference for homeopathy. However, many natural remedies have not been tested in peer-reviewed studies, and some practitioners have been accused of promoting myths about vaccines. For example, as reported in The Globe and Mail, a homeopathic college was criticized because it "promoted unscientific, false claims about the dangers of vaccines, and advocates the use of ineffective alternatives called nosodes." Alternatives to traditional medication often lack rigorous scientific study.
4
The Autism Link That Never Was

The idea that vaccines lead to autism has persisted in the anti-vaxx crowd for a long time. That's thanks mostly to a now debunked 1998 study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who, according to The New York Times, conducted the study using funds from laywers of families seeking ot sue vaccine makers. admitting to . However, as explained by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), a New York-based organizaiton that "promotes scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims," scientific study has proven that vaccines are safe, and do not cause autism. As CSI further explained, this may be a case of confusing causation with correlation; the autism "epidemic" is likely not related to vaccines, but rather an expansion of the diagnosis.
5
Concern About Vaccine Overload

Some anti-vaxxers worry about the effects of giving their children too many vaccines at a young age. According to a 2015 piece in Vaccine, some parents fear that many injections "may overload the child's developing immune system and leave him or her susceptible to secondary infections." However, a piece in Pediatrics reported studies prove the immune system can respond to a large numbers of antigens, and thus it's unlikely multiple vaccines will weaken a child's immune system.
6
Vaccines Are Unnatural

Some parents get caught up on the idea that vaccines are inherently unnatural, and therefore dangerous. However, according to the CDC, "your child’s immune system produces immunity following vaccination the same as it would following 'natural' infection with a disease.
The difference is that the child doesn’t have to get sick first." By using an inactivated vaccine, children can safely develop immunity without getting sick.
7
Desire To Keep Children Healthy

Overall, anti-vaxxers are acting out of a desire to keep their children healthy, and they believe avoiding vaccines is one way to preserve their kid's health. As explained in Time, some researchers have the idea that educating anti-vaxx parents about the dangers of diseases such as measles and rubella is one way to get more children inoculated against these diseases.

Opposition to vaccines
Health and medical experts have hailed vaccines as being one of the major achievements in the 20th century, but not everyone agrees.
In the past few years, opposition to vaccinations has been discussed more frequently in the news. Concerned parents are opting to forgo vaccinations for their children for many different reasons.
This has resulted in a surge of infectious diseases that had been previously or nearly eradicated.

Is vaccination opposition new?
Vaccination opposition isn’t a new concept. As long as there have been vaccines, there have been people who objected to them.
Refusing vaccines started back in the early 1800s when the smallpox vaccine started being used in large numbers. The idea of injecting someone with a part of a cowpox blister to protect them from smallpox faced a lot of criticism. The criticism was based on sanitary, religious, and political objections. Some clergy believed that the vaccine went against their religion.
In the 1970s, the DTP vaccine received a wave of opposition when it was linked to neurological disorders. Studies have found that the risks are very low.
To combat vaccination opposition, laws have been passed that require vaccinations as a measure of public health.
Common reasons behind vaccine opposition
There are a variety of reasons behind vaccine opposition. Some people have to forgo different vaccinations due to a high risk of potential allergic reactions. But for most who refuse vaccines it should be known that there is little risk.
There are some common reasons that lead to vaccine opposition. Some cite religious beliefs as the reason behind their refusal to get vaccinated, though most mainstream religions do not condemn vaccines.
There was a belief that diseases were disappearing due to better sanitation and hygiene, not vaccines. This has been proven false by the resurgence of previously eradicated infectious diseases.
It was also believed that a vaccine wouldn’t protect you. Those who are vaccinated can still get sick, but they will experience mild symptoms.
People also think the risks outweigh the benefits. This is currently the biggest objection in the United States. Parents cite many medical risks, including autism, as potential consequences of being vaccinated.
There is the common belief that since these diseases have been eliminated, there’s no need for vaccinations. Diseases will only stay eradicated as long as vaccines are still used to prevent them.
And many think that pharmaceutical companies can’t be trusted. They believe that pharmaceutical companies only want to sell their products, regardless of the impact on the people who use them.
The most common reasons that parents oppose vaccinations are medically unfounded. These include:
Autism
The belief that vaccines can cause autism has become widespread in the past few years. Parents seem to be most concerned about the MMR vaccine, which is used to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella.
Multiple studies have shown that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Most of these studies had large sample sizes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that vaccines are very safe in all but a few cases. The CDC also clarified that vaccine ingredients do not cause autism.
Thimerosal, an ingredient that has been used in some vaccines, also raises concerns. It is a mercury-based preservative that was thought to cause autism. It is now only used in some flu vaccines.
There are also thimerosal-free flu vaccinations available. Even so, the CDC states that thimerosal does not cause autism.
Flu vaccines
Some people don’t get flu vaccines for themselves or for their children. There are several reasons for this, including:
The flu vaccine doesn’t protect against all strains of the flu.
The vaccination needs to be given every year.
The vaccination could make them sick, which is false.
The flu vaccine is recommended for almost everyone who is six months of age or older. There are both shot and nasal spray vaccinations available, which can be used by different people.
Some people with different allergies can use one type, but not the other. It’s important that you check what type of flu vaccine you should get.
Most side effects from the flu vaccine are mild and go away within 1 to 2 days.
Mistrust of science
Some opposition to vaccines comes directly from a mistrust of science, or mistrust of the government. Some people believe that pharmaceutical companies and scientists want to sell a product regardless of harmful consequences.
Others are skeptical of science that they don’t understand, or the chemicals they don’t know that go into vaccines. This distrust grows, as laws require children to be vaccinated in order to attend public schools.
Some parents prefer “natural” or homeopathic treatments instead. These treatments can aid in relieving the symptoms of some conditions, but are not as effective in preventing disease.
When people mistrust science, they’re less likely to vaccinate. They’re also less likely to trust the doctors who recommend vaccines.
Results of vaccination opposition
While some people need to forgo vaccinations due to potential allergic reactions, others refuse vaccinations for themselves or their children for many reasons.
Most of the concerns that create opposition to vaccination are nothing more than misconceptions.
Unfortunately, the decision not to vaccinate oneself or one’s children doesn’t just affect them. The large number of people refusing vaccines has led to the reemergence of infectious diseases in areas where they had been eradicated or nearly gone.
Measles was declared eradicated in the United States in 2002. But in 2014, there were over 600 reported cases. Measles is a potentially deadly disease, and health experts explain that parents refusing to vaccinate their children are the cause behind its resurgence.
Pertusis, or whooping cough, has also seen a dramatic increase in reported cases attributed to a lack of vaccinations.
If you have concerns about a vaccination for you or your child, talk with a doctor that you trust and get their opinion. In almost all cases, the potential risk of a vaccine is much smaller than the risk of developing the disease it was created to prevent.

15 Reasons People Are Hating On Anti-Vaxxers
15 Reasons People Are Hating On Anti-Vaxxers

The anti-vaccine movement actually started long before people even had computers in their homes. As soon as vaccines became a thing, people protested.

While social media is a newer concept in people's lives, and society sees much of the debate about vaccines play out in forums like Facebook and Twitter nowadays, the anti-vaccine movement actually started long before people even had computers in their homes. As soon as vaccines became a thing, there were people lining up protesting them. And guess what? Jenny McCarthy and Andrew Wakefield weren’t there yet.
Of course, protesting against something wouldn’t be complete without a slew of people clamoring back from the other side. Anti-vaxxers aren’t opposed to debate. In fact, most of them show up with their thinking caps on and ready to support their arguments with research. Still, they are silenced. They are shut down, ridiculed for their parenting tactics, name-called and shamed.
But why? Why are we still stuck in this day and age in a place where we cannot respect another parent’s wishes? Why are we so quick to raise our voices and shut people down who are just trying to do their best by their children? Why aren’t we opening our minds more to listen to alternative points of view? Why aren’t we talking rationally about this subject, trading opinions and research, and helping to come to a conclusion that brings parents together instead of driving them apart? What’s so scary about an anti-vaxxer?
15 The Rise In Outbreaks
Ah, yes. Outbreaks. Epidemics. Whatever you call them, they’re making a big resurgence in American communities. Who could forget that Disneyland epidemic? Between December of 2014 and February of 2015, there were 125 confirmed cases of measles linked to the location.
While the media was quick to descend upon anti-vaxxers and blame them for the outbreak, it was never confirmed that this was not the case. In fact, the MMR vaccine is known to shed. This information is clearly stated in the manufacturer’s vaccine insert. This means people who have been recently vaccinated with the MMR shot are able to transmit measles and mumps to others.
At the end of the day, anti-vaxxers can’t figure out what pro-vaxxers are so angry about. After all, vaccines work, right? If they’re so darn effective, then why does it matter if the kid in the line at the teacups ride isn’t vaccinated. Are we to believe your vaccines only work if we get ours? If I don’t wear deodorant tomorrow, will your deodorant not work? I don’t get it.
14 Herd Immunity Is Compromised
Every time I hear this argument, I want to beat my head against a brick wall because that would probably feel better than trying to explain what herd immunity really means, but here goes nothing. The concept of herd immunity actually stemmed from cattle. Yes, cows.
Pro-vaxxers believe that as long as a certain percentage of people are vaccinated, they will protectively cover the small percent that are not vaccinated. Thus, they believe the incidence of rising outbreaks is due to more people not vaccinating. However, for herd immunity to work, 95 percent of a population has to be immune. We’ve never been 95 percent vaccinated — ever. In addition, roughly 10 percent of people who are vaccinated never develop immunity to the vaccine. It’s called seroconversion.
Furthermore, we must account for not just people who don’t ever vaccinate, but people who aren’t fully vaccinated. The vast majority of adults never get their booster shots past age 18. Most of the elderly population were never vaccinated until they became elderly, and even then were not given the MMR, DTAP and so forth.
13 Those Diseases Are Scary
Something anti-vaxxers and pro-vaxxers can actually agree on. It’s not as though anti-vaxxers are sitting around hoping their kids come down with diseases. That’s not how this works. Truthfully, if a child in the neighborhood has the chicken pox, they would much rather their kid come into contact with it than not. Because that’s how natural immunity is acquired, and chicken pox is more severe in adulthood. But chicken pox parties aren’t new. Our pro-vax parents were doing the same thing.
That said, no anti-vax parent is eager to see their toddler come down with the measles. However, that passes. It’s not a lifelong disability. It’s not death. Healthy people do not die from these illnesses the way they once did. In fact, between 2004 and 2015, there wasn’t a single death from the measles in the United States. However, there were 108 deaths due to the MMR vaccine. Perspective.
12 Because, Jenny McCarthy
Via: Google Images
Anti-vaxxers have definitely caught a lot of flak over the years for relying on the testimony of celebrity parent and Playboy model Jenny McCarthy. After all, a woman cannot possibly be an attractive bleach blonde bombshell and also be smart. Insert eye roll.
So, when Jenny tried to tell the world that her son was injured by vaccines, she was not met with the compassion that she deserved. What’s interesting is that she received so much hatred for her point of view, but other celebrities have said similar things and not received the same feedback.
No one is ripping Rob Schneider a new one for intelligently explaining why he doesn’t think vaccines are safe. Nobody cares that Selma Blair doesn’t vaccinate. We still hold Erin Brockovich to high accord despite her anti-vax views. We still crack up at everything Bill Maher and Jim Carrey say even though they’re publicly anti-vax. Biased much?
Full disclosure: Jenny McCarthy probably did open the eyes of some parents out there. She may have been the first alarm bell that went off for a few who had failed to research vaccines until hearing of her story. That said, the majority of parents who are researching vaccines are doing so because they are having a baby or have an injured child.
11 Doctor Google
Anti-vaxxers never had legitimate sources. They quote sites like Natural News. Always make sure you ask them for peer-reviewed, scholarly sources that have been published in medical journals. Just be ready. Because sometimes you’ll run into an anti-vaxxer like me, and I’ve got hundreds of them that I share regularly with people looking to research vaccines.
In fact, the number of people reaching out and asking me for help with this specific topic has got to be so large that I created a forum online for parents where I have posted nearly 60 pages of links and summaries on vaccine research. This includes everything from explanations of the illnesses they allegedly prevent to vaccine inserts, as well as oodles of peer-reviewed studies. It also includes many studies that pharmaceutical companies use to support their safety claims, and educates parents on recognizing when those studies have conflicts of interest.
That said, I can’t account for all the anti-vaxxers out there. It’s not wise to jump on either side of this fence without knowing why you’re doing it.
10 They Spread Illness
Via: Google Images
There’s this big urban myth going around out there that children who aren’t vaccinated somehow carry disease. Let’s be clear about this. Vaccines do not prevent illness. By and large, most simply reduce the number of symptoms a person has. You can still be vaccinated for the mumps and catch the mumps. Now would be a good time to preface yourself on the Harvard mumps outbreak of 2016. All 40+ students who contracted the mumps were vaccinated. Imagine that!
Merck claims their MMR shot is 88 percent effective at preventing the mumps. That said, they’re currently in the midst of a massive lawsuit for falsifying studies that led to that figure. Independent sources show the vaccine is far less effective, and reports have surfaced claiming Merck knew this all along.
Furthermore, the starting point of an infection is not always someone who isn’t vaccinated. It’s often someone who was and they are shedding. Pay special attention to the headlines this fall when kids start back to school. There is always an uptick of outbreaks from all the shedding as kids go back to school after getting their booster shots.
Point blank: no one can spread a disease that they do not have. Not being vaccinated does not make you automatically carry that illness.
9 They Speak Out
Via: Google Images
Truth be told, part of the problem people have with anti-vaxxers is that they won’t just do their business and keep it quiet. Instead, they want to share their unpopular opinion. They want to blast it on Facebook every day so that it’s the first thing their pro-vaxxing friends see when they wake up and scroll through their feed.
They want to shake things up for their friends. They want to get them questioning vaccine safety. They want them to worry that they may have been wrong all this time. They have every intent of shedding light on the vaccine safety debate and leaving parents wondering which path is right for them.
They actually want parents to start to think about vaccines instead of blindly accepting them as a part of life. That would make me uncomfortable, too if I were trying to avoid my conscience and slide by on this issue without actually researching it before consenting to having it done to my kids.
8 They’re All Conspiracy Theorists
First and foremost, make sure you understand that the term conspiracy theorist was invented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to try and discredit people who didn’t follow in line the way the FBI wanted them to.
There are absolutely people who don’t vaccinate who also believe the Earth is flat, there are aliens here disguised as people, and the Illuminati is real. I’m not here to speak on any of that. I am always entertained by these conversations; I’ll admit that. I don’t aim to close myself off from the discussion of almost anything.
That said, I don’t invest much time in exploring these theories, because well, they don’t have the data backing them the way vaccines do. There’s no proof for me that the center of the Earth is a safe haven where the elite can do hide out when the world comes to an end. I have no way of knowing for sure or supporting a stance — even to my own self — that Beyoncé is a cult ringleader. Nor do I feel that impacts my life or my children at all. So, I stay in my lane and try to only give my full attention to subjects we’ve studied well. As the popular saying goes, I made my tin hat from the aluminum in your vaccines.
7 It’s All Crunchy Hippie Nonsense
Right up there with conspiracy theorists, people seem to believe that you cannot be against vaccines without being in favor of all things natural. I’m not one to knock natural remedies. I think they have their place. I also think medicine has its place. The fact of the matter is that parents should have a choice in which is best for every scenario. Once upon a time, we told parents to medicate everything they could with acetaminophen. Nowadays, we know it doesn’t even work as a pain reliever and that fevers are highly beneficial and shouldn’t be immediately reduced without more pertinent medical reasons.
Just because someone doesn’t vaccinate doesn’t mean they are relying on God to protect their child from illness. In fact, many religious folk avoid vaccines for religious reasons, but not because they are stupid and believe their child won’t fall prey to illness. Instead, they don’t agree with the aborted fetal cell lines that are used to produce vaccines.
Others simply aren’t interested in exposing their children to increased risks of ADHD, autism, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, brain swelling, SIDS, and more that are all linked to vaccines.
6 Cognitive Dissonance
Via: Google Images
Understand that going against vaccines does require that you open your eyes — widely. This is necessary any time you’re going to investigate anything that you’ve been believing blindly without a doubt. You can certainly remain critical and science-minded, but you have to be willing to look at the evidence and accept the truth if it turns out that you were wrong all this time.
Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone believes something so deeply and strongly that they cannot see the other side of an issue. Fear motivates a lot of this. People are afraid to put the burden of all that research and decision making on themselves. It’s easier to blame the doctor if something goes wrong. But guess what? You can’t sue him if a vaccine kills your child, and you will still blame yourself for trusting the doctor without verifying what he told you about the vaccine.
You’ve got to have the courage to look away from what you’ve been taught and trained to believe. Some people will research and still decide to vaccinate, but in my experience, most end up refusing vaccines. You’ve got to ask yourself, why?
5 The Media Tells Them To
There is definitely bias in the media. Donald Trump could be wrong about everything else, but this he is not. Fake news exists, but we’re going far deeper than satire here. The news organizations in America are markedly biased. Why wouldn’t they be? The same people who own the news stations also own major pharmaceutical corporations. They are constantly stuffing your commercial breaks with vaccine and antidepressant ads for a reason. And did you know the U.S. is one of only two nations that even allow drug companies to advertise on television? Make note of how many drug ads you see next time you’re binge-watching. It’s a lot!
Interestingly enough, while the media was splashing headlines left and right about the Disneyland measles outbreaking 2014 where 125 individuals were infected, they barely acknowledged the outbreak of measles that same year of 383 cases. Why not? Because the majority of the infected parties were Amish. The media and pharmaceutical giants are not in the business of trying to make the Amish afraid of the measles. They will not succumb to vaccines. Instead, they focus their efforts of those who they think are less likely to put up a fight.
4 That Wakefield Guy Was A Discredited Fraud
Via: Google Images
Once upon a time, a gastroenterologist named Dr. Andrew Wakefield co-authored a study on the relation between enterocolitis and the development of neurological disorders in children. The aim of the study was never vaccines, and the result wasn’t either. The doctors never expected to discover measles in the guts of the sample children, but they did. So, they reported it.
They made a casual link between the MMR vaccine and these children and noted that it required further investigation. That was all. There was no claim that the vaccine caused autism or any other disorder in these kids. Still, Wakefield was getting too close to the truth for the comfort of the CDC and medical industry. So, they vilified him. His career was ruined. His name tarnished. His paper retracted, and so forth.
To this day, people associate his name and face with the word fraud. What they fail to realize is that the claims that his study was performed incorrectly have now been confirmed false. His co-authors were never penalized the way he was. Why not? In a nutshell, because they had the money to defend themselves in court while they let their partner take the fall alone.
What’s Wakefield up to now? In 2016, an important documentary came to light that he took part in titled Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe. The film included many prominent doctors in the medical field and their testimony upon realizing vaccines were not safe. It was produced by Del Bigtree, who had to walk away from his job on the popular show The Doctor’s to make this film.
3 They're More Afraid Of Autism Than Death
Via: Google Images
It’s an easy argument to make. They’d rather have a dead kid than one with autism. How sad! The thing is, anti-vaxxers don’t fear death from illnesses like measles, mumps and polio, because they have researched the truth behind them. Vaccines were never truly responsible for the decline in these diseases. Instead, proper hygiene and sanitation factors that were put into place did most of the work. In fact, these diseases were all well into declining before vaccines ever came to be.
On the autism front, it’s very easy for a parent of a neurotypical child or even one with mild autism to say a parent shouldn’t fear the diagnosis. But when autism is now estimated to be at a diagnostic rate of 1 in 45, something is wrong. In the 1990s, this rate was only 1 in 10,000. That kind of leap does not come from more awareness, and perhaps awareness is the last thing we need.
2 They Don’t Trust Doctors
Via: Google Images
Doctors are mere human beings. They make mistakes. They have to carry massive insurance policies to cover those mistakes. They are nothing more than what they were trained to be.
They were trained to do exactly what they were told to do in medical school. They are not educated on vaccines in any thorough manner. They are not even educated on the illnesses that vaccines aim to prevent. Their textbooks are printed with funding from pharmaceutical companies. They are repeatedly told that vaccines save lives, and it’s never actually explained to them how. If the doctor is on a need-to-know basis, where do you stand?
Of course, there are doctors that also don’t believe in vaccines. Some just don’t think they’re effective. Some trust the body’s natural immune system to do its job. Others have researched vaccines and find them to be dangerous, and even deadly. Anti-vaxxers commonly cite the work of these doctors to back up their beliefs, and they are met with anger and vitriol on the other side. Why? Is Suzanne Humphries not credible? Is she not accredited by the same medical boards as your pediatrician or family doctor?
1 They Think For Themselves
This is absolutely terrifying to some people. It truly is. We have been indoctrinated into believing doctors are superior to us as parents. Without a medical degree, we must be completely incapable of reading a study and ascertaining what it means. We’ve been pushed to believe that organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration are the ultimate authority on our health and safety. But those organizations are hotbeds of lawsuits and fraud that cherry-pick which studies they discern as credible — and those studies are often funded directly by them and their pharmaceutical partners.
Anti-vaxxers refuse to accept those studies. They present with major conflicts of interest. If I were to invent a product for your baby and claimed it was safe, you would want to know that it is. You would want evidence. Well what if my only studies showing its safety were performed by me with my money? What if there were independent studies out there that I had no parts in and those studies showed my product wasn’t safe? Would you still trust my product based on my word alone? Anti-vaxxers don’t.
I’m not a doctor by any means, and I have no desire to be one. But I did graduate from four-year top-100 university. While my bachelor’s degree in Psychology didn’t earn me much acclaim in the psych field, it did teach me a whole hell of a lot about scientific research. So much so that I landed a job in the pharma sector not long after I graduated. I’ve since left that position, because I couldn’t keep promoting things that I knew were harmful to people. But hey, I knew my stuff enough to be employed in that field. Now you’re going to tell me I don’t know it well enough to speak out against it?

Why Do Some People Believe Vaccines Are Dangerous?
Vaccines help stop the spread of disease. So why are vaccine skeptics distrustful of them?
By Eve Watling On 2/25/19 at 6:10 AM EST
Health
Vaccines have repeatedly been shown to help stop the spread of disease without causing long-term health problems. But many people continue to link vaccines to everything from autism and sudden infant death syndrome to bowel disease and arthritis. What drives vaccine skeptics' evangelism?
In the late 18th century, when British doctor Edward Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine, it was religion—anti-vaxxers argued that God sent illnesses to punish people. When vaccinations became compulsory in Victorian England, it was personal liberty—parents complained it violated their right to body autonomy and they launched anti-vax societies and publications.
Today, there are a variety of reasons some people remain skeptical about vaccines.

Social media is fueling vaccine scepticism
Anti-vaxxers were able to advocate before the internet— The U.K.-based Leicester Anti-vaccination League formed in 1869— but social media has made it easier to spread erroneous claims and hard to debunk them . "Most online media don't benefit from the quality control of journalists and editors that shapes the content of traditional mass media," write researchers Marina Joubert and Francois van Schalkwyk. "Consequently, content is generated by experts and quacks alike, and opinion and facts become blurred. This makes it hard to judge if information is credible or not."
Without fact-checking, Facebook groups become echo chambers that amplify a single perspective, one often lacking rigorous scientific evidence.

Past mistakes by the medical establishment
Of course these stories wouldn't spread if there wasn't already a some mistrust of the governments and medical institutions that administer vaccines: Between 1932 and 1972, hundreds of African-Americans were co-opted into the Tuskegee experiment, their syphilis left untreated even after penicillin was proven an effective treatment in the 1940s. In fact, the men In fact, none of the men were ever told that they had the disease or that there was treatment available. This led to new infections, deaths and children born with congenital syphilis. It also sparked a lasting mistrust of the American medical establishment by people of color.
Around the time Americans were receiving SV40-infected polio vaccines, pregnant women in Europe and Australia were being prescribed the anti-morning sickness drug Thalidomide, which ended up causing extreme deformation and death in thousands of babies.
The fact that modern medicine still doesn't have all the answers may also be fuelling anti-vax sentiment. A 2017 study published in Information, Communication & Society points out that "much of the appeal of anti-vaccination sites is in the genuine pain of those touched by childhood illness and death, and the lack of a seemingly adequate medical explanation. In this instance, anti-vaccination reasoning fills this 'void' by placating parents who feel abandoned or dismissed by the medical community."

Many vaccine skeptics are also mistrustful of the pharmaceutical company, believing Big Pharma is shilling unnecessary (and potentially dangerous) vaccines just to make money. When pharmaceutical companies are sued for failing to report information about the safety of their drugs, it furthers that distrust.
SV40: Vaccines and Cancer
Further bolstering the arguments of vaccine skeptics are dubious "news" stories alleging to have proof of vaccine toxicity: In 2015, the website Vaccines.news ran a story with the headline: "CDC admits 98 million Americans were given cancer virus via the polio shot."
The story was a wild extrapolation of real events: In the 1950s and early '60s, Americans were accidentally inoculated with polio vaccines containing SV40, a simian virus present in monkey kidney cells used to grow the vaccine. Despite the fact that SV40 has not been proven to cause cancer, and that SV40 has not been present in any vaccine since 1963, some people remained unconvinced. It's often a kernel of truth like this, wrapped in a lot of misinformation, which can make anti-vax fake news so complicated to unravel. This misleading story, from Vaccines.news and other similar websites, has been shared thousands of times on Facebook.

The Lancet Study: Vaccines and Autism
A single study has contributed greatly to anti-vax beliefs: In 1998, British gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield published a study in The Lancet that linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism and bowel disease.
It was later revealed that Wakefield's study had a sample size of just 12 children and contained many inaccuracies. (It was also funded by parents suing vaccine companies.) It took a dozen years for The Lancet to retract the paper—and for Wakefield to have his medical license revoked—but by that time the bogus story had made an indelible impact. Subsequent studies have rigorously examined far larger sample groups and found no link between vaccines and autism, but Wakefield's theory is still touted by anti-vaxxers. In 2008 Jenny McCarthy made headlines claiming her son developed autism following vaccinations—a position she's since distanced herself from. Even President Trump has helped fuel this particular piece of fake news: "You take this little beautiful baby and you pump—I mean, it looks like just it's meant for a horse and not for a child," he said of the vaccine schedule in 2015. "… Just the other day, two years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic."
This misinformation is particularly hard to dispel, perhaps, because the actual causes of autism remains unknown.

Russian intervention
Experts say social media bots and Russian trolls are fueling distrust of vaccines to further social discord in the West. "It's a known strategy to infiltrate an interest group around a particular issue or topic and then slowly try to introduce new things into that discourse," David Broniatowski, an engineering professor at George Washington University, told Radio Free Europe. "A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas."
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University studied thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017, and found that the same troll accounts that tried to influence the presidential election were also tweeting about vaccination. They were actually tweeting both for and against, to establish "false equivalency" and the perception that the U.S. is divided on the issue. In reality 87 percent of Americans believe vaccines were safe and effective. "By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases," said lead researcher Mark Dredze.
According to the BBC, the study also found that malware Twitter bots were much more likely to share anti-vaccination messages than typical Twitter users, using them as "bait" to get people to click on links to unsolicited commercial content or virus downloads.

Complacency
Although anti-vax parents have an skeptical view of the medical establishment, they are by no means social outliers: Totally unvaccinated children tend to come from white middle-class families with a married, college-educated mother. Rates of vaccine-exempt kids are far higher in wealthier areas like Orange County, California, than they are in poorer regions nearby.
Vaccination relies on "herd immunity," or the idea that if most people are immunized even those who are not will be protected. And because disease outbreaks are rarer in affluent communities, these parents feel they can rely on herd immunity to protect their child—The thought being, "Let someone else risk their child's health."
But if enough parents don't vaccinate, then the system breaks down and outbreaks arise, even in affluent spaces: A 2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland infected 147 people. A second outbreak two years later hit another 125 people at the park, and cost the public health system $2.3 million.

The allure of "natural" health
Our society is increasingly preoccupied with organic foods and medicine—certain that natural substances are all we need to remain healthy and than "chemicals" are the problem. In 2018, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle company, Goop, invited "holistic health psychiatrist" Kelly Brogan to speak at a conference—Brogan links vaccines and autism, and insists flu shots don't work. Holly Blumhardt, a California mother of three unvaccinated children, told the L.A. Times her family believes in staying healthy "from the inside out." She takes vitamins, avoids GMOs and sees to a chiropractor—and receives a belief exemption from innocculating her kids.
An entire alternative medical establishment has emerged to serve anti-vaccine parents fixated on being "natural": One former naturopathic doctor told The Atlantic she met a naturopath who suggested elderberry syrup could substitute for the flu vaccine. Naturopaths undergo far less rigorous scientific training than conventional doctors, yet 20 states give them licenses to practice, legitimizing science-skeptical philosophies.
Biased assimilation
Biased assimilation is the phenomenon when all new input is viewed through the lens of what is already believed, making it harder to absorb information that may radically alter your preconceived notions.
Accurate information that contradicts assumptions can actually make people double-down on their beliefs: In a 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics study, more than 1,700 vaccine-skeptic parents were given ample research disproving any link between autism and the MMR vaccine. But while the parents reported their misperceptions about vaccines and autism were reduced, they were even less likely to vaccinate their children than before. The evidence, which included emotive images of sick children, reinforced the overall vague association between vaccines and sickness.
Another study that year, this time focussed on the flu vaccine, showed similar results—people who already had concerns about vaccination were less likely to get a flu shot after reviewing, and even accepting, scientific evidence that directly addressed their concerns. Pro-vaccine messaging may need to focus more on the positives of vaccination—that it protects people from illness—rather than countering misinformation.
The Dunning-Kruger effect
Why do such false beliefs take root in the first place? Many people are unable to accurately appraise their own understanding of a topic, a condition known as the Dunning-Kruger effect. A 2017 study found that 62 percent of people who performed poorly on a test about autism believed they knew as much or more about the causes of autism than doctors or scientists. This overconfidence could explain why vaccine sceptics are so certain they understand more about vaccines than experts.

Vaccines aren't perfect
Some vaccinations can cause some mild side effects, like a low-grade fever or soreness at the injection site. In very rare cases, severe allergic reactions have been recorded. And being innoculated also doesn't guarantee 100 percent lifelong immunity: The flu vaccine, for example, works differently depending on the type of flu virus it's fighting. And it might not always protect you from the flu: According to the CDC, a flu shot, reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40 percent and 60 percent in the overall population, which means some people who get the jab will still get sick. Although that doesn't sound great, it's not to be sniffed at: The CDC says the flu vaccine prevented 5.3 million influenza illnesses in the 2016-17 flu season alone.
Even if a vaccine doesn't prevent someone from getting the flu or other illness, studies have shown the disease is generally milder than in people who were unvaccinated.
The Bottom Line
Anti-vaxxers are swept up in a perfect storm of social, historical and psychological factors that have led them to distrust vaccines. But there's still hope. "Hesitancy is a spectrum," epidemiologist Avnika Amin told Newsweek previously. "Most people aren't going to be 100 percent against all vaccines and refuse to engage in conversations. That's one very small portion of the spectrum. Taking a moment and realizing that everyone is on the same side, we all want what is best for the child—I think that is the best place to start."

Many who refuse to get COVID vaccine struggle to cite valid reasons for hesitation
August 2, 2021
by John Anderer
KRAKÓW, Poland — Why are so many people vehemently opposed to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine? Similarly, why do so many others habitually kick the vaccine can further down the road, telling themselves they’ll eventually get the vaccine. Polish researchers from Jagiellonian University and the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities believe they have the answers to why people are turning away from vaccines.
Ultimately, study authors conclude anti-vaxxers get most of their motivation from a very vague negative attitude toward vaccines that has little basis in much of anything resembling concrete science or facts. After surveying a group of 492 people who consider themselves either ambiguous towards or opposing vaccination, a number of recurring themes emerged including mistrust in doctors, mistrust in the greater medical community, and a tendency to buy in to attention-grabbing anti-vaccine arguments and headlines.
Confusingly, most participants told researchers right off the bat that their personal aversion to the COVID-19 vaccines are based on their own or other peoples’ negative experiences with vaccines. However, when asked to actually explain such occurrences, pretty much all of them fell back on vague explanations. For example, many said they simply couldn’t remember where they had originally heard that vaccines were harmful. Others parroted common anti-vax claims such as vaccines cause autism, allergies, or birth defects, without citing any research or proof to back up their beliefs.
People seek out information that confirms their own opinions
Study authors believe the human tendency to seek out and remember information in support of beliefs they already have, which scientists call confirmation bias.
“Confirmation bias consists of an individual actively seeking information consistent with their pre-existing hypothesis, and avoiding information indicative of alternative explanations,” researchers explain in a media release. “Therefore, a pre-existing negative attitude toward vaccines may cause individuals to interpret negative symptoms as consequences of vaccines, further reinforcing the negative attitude.”
Additionally, it’s also common for people to forget where they originally learned or heard about something if they hear the information from multiple sources. In some cases, the info can blend together with everyday life, leading an individual to confuse something they read online with a real-life experience. The research team thinks this may have contributed to their findings as well.
Choosing anti-vaxxers over doctors?
Study authors add that their data indicates anti-vaxxers believe vaccines almost always cause serious side-effects, fail to protect society from disease, and lack proper testing before manufacturers distribute them to the public. Troublingly, most vaccine deniers also believe that anti-vaccination leaders, somehow, have more reliable information on all of these issues than real doctors. In their view, the people in charge of anti-vaccine websites and social media care more about the public’s health than any doctor or government official.
For what it’s worth, those who consider themselves merely “vaccine hesitant” told study authors they generally believe vaccines are effective and properly developed. Researchers find that same group is very susceptible to the anti-vaccine movement’s statements and info detailing the “Big Pharma” conspiracy. In other words, vaccine hesitant individuals can very much go in either a pro or anti-vaccine direction depending on the information they encounter on a given day.
Researchers conclude by noting there is little scientific evidence to date suggesting anti-vaxxers’ minds can be changed. So, they recommend that vaccination awareness campaigns focus their efforts on reaching the hesitant contingent instead.
The findings appear in the journal Social Psychological Bulletin.

Alright, so I've got this task to figure out why some people are anti-vax. First off, I need to understand what "anti-vax" means. From what I gather, it stands for "anti-vaccination," which means people who are against getting vaccinated or vaccinating their children. Now, vaccines have been around for a long time and have saved countless lives by preventing diseases like smallpox and polio. So, why would anyone be against them?

I remember hearing about a controversy linking vaccines to autism, especially the MMR vaccine. I think someone published a study suggesting a connection, but I also recall that the study was retracted and discredited. Is that still a big issue among anti-vaxxers?

I need to dig deeper into this. Maybe I can look up some articles or studies that explain why people are against vaccines. I should be careful about the sources I use, making sure they're reliable and credible.

Let me try searching for "reasons people are anti-vaccine."

[Performs search]

Okay, I've got a few articles here. The first one is from Romper.com, titled "Why Are People Anti-Vaxx? 7 Common Reasons." It seems to list some of the main concerns that anti-vaxxers have. Let's see what they are.

First, there's concern about side effects of vaccines. I know that vaccines can sometimes cause mild reactions like fever or soreness at the injection site, but serious allergic reactions are rare, right? The article mentions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says most reactions are mild.

Second, there's a fear of "Big Pharma," meaning multinational pharmaceutical companies that make vaccines. Anti-vaxxers seem to distrust these companies and think they prioritize profits over people's health.

Third, some people prefer homeopathy or natural remedies over vaccines. But I've heard that homeopathy isn't backed by solid scientific evidence.

Fourth, there's the lingering belief that vaccines cause autism, even though numerous studies have debunked this link.

Fifth, some parents worry about "vaccine overload," thinking that giving multiple vaccines at once could overwhelm a child's immune system. But studies have shown that vaccines don't weaken the immune system.

Sixth, there's a perception that vaccines are unnatural, and some people prefer to avoid them for that reason.

Lastly, the article mentions that overall, anti-vaxxers are trying to keep their children healthy, but they've come to the conclusion that avoiding vaccines is the way to do it.

Hmm, these are some of the common reasons. But I need to look into this more deeply. Maybe there are other factors at play.

Let me check another article. This one is from Healthline.com, titled "Anti Vaxxers: Understanding Opposition to Vaccines." It seems to cover similar ground but might have more details.

According to this article, opposition to vaccines isn't new; it dates back to the early 1800s when smallpox vaccines were introduced. Some people had religious objections, while others had sanitary or political concerns.

The article lists several common reasons for vaccine opposition, including religious beliefs, the idea that diseases were disappearing due to better sanitation, thinking that vaccines don't protect, fearing that the risks outweigh the benefits, believing that diseases have been eradicated so vaccines are unnecessary, and mistrusting pharmaceutical companies.

One of the main concerns mentioned is the alleged link between vaccines and autism, which has been thoroughly debunked by multiple studies. The article emphasizes that vaccines are very safe and that the benefits far outweigh the minimal risks.

There's also a section about flu vaccines, where some people think they don't protect against all strains or that they can make you sick, which isn't accurate.

Moreover, there's a mistrust of science and government, with some people preferring natural treatments over vaccines.

The article concludes by highlighting that the refusal to vaccinate has led to the resurgence of infectious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which were once under control.

This is helpful, but I wonder if there are more nuanced reasons behind vaccine hesitancy. Maybe socioeconomic factors or access to accurate information play a role.

Let me look at another source. This article is from BabyGaga.com, titled "15 Reasons People Are Hating On Anti-Vaxxers." It seems to be from the perspective of those who oppose anti-vaxxers, so it might offer some insight into why people are critical of anti-vax stances.

Looking through the list, many points reiterate the concerns about outbreaks and herd immunity. There's also mention of Jenny McCarthy and the autism-vaccine link, which seems to be a persistent theme.

One interesting point is that anti-vaxxers are often accused of spreading illness, but the author argues that vaccinated people can also spread diseases through shedding. I need to verify that claim.

Another point is that anti-vaxxers speak out and spread their views, which some people find annoying or dangerous. There's also a stereotype that anti-vaxxers are all conspiracy theorists or crunchy hippies, which may not be accurate.

The author also mentions cognitive dissonance, suggesting that people have a hard time accepting information that contradicts their beliefs.

There's a discussion about media bias and how the media portrays anti-vaxxers, as well as the role of celebrities in shaping public opinion.

Overall, this article seems to be defending anti-vaxxers or at least trying to understand their perspective.

I think it's important to consider both sides of the argument. Maybe I should look for academic research on vaccine hesitancy.

Let me see if I can find a more scholarly source.

[Performs another search]

Here's an article from Newsweek titled "Why Do Some People Believe Vaccines Are Dangerous?" It explores various reasons, including historical mistrust, social media influence, past medical mistakes, and the appeal of natural health approaches.

The article mentions that social media fuels vaccine skepticism by allowing misinformation to spread rapidly without fact-checking. It also notes that past medical scandals, like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the Thalidomide disaster, have eroded trust in the medical establishment, especially among marginalized communities.

Additionally, the article discusses how the lack of definitive answers about certain health issues can make people more receptive to anti-vaccine arguments. It also touches on the role of pharmaceutical companies and the perception that they prioritize profits over safety.

One point that stands out is the reference to a study suggesting that anti-vaccine sentiments fill a "void" for parents who feel abandoned or dismissed by the medical community when their children suffer from illnesses or disabilities.

Furthermore, the article mentions the infamous Lancet study by Andrew Wakefield that falsely linked the MMR vaccine to autism, which has since been retracted, but the damage to public perception persists.

It's clear that the autism-vaccine myth continues to influence many people's decisions, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.

Another aspect is the idea that some people are more susceptible to believing in conspiracies or alternative health practices, which can include rejecting vaccines.

The article also touches on the concept of "biased assimilation," where people interpret new information in a way that reinforces their existing beliefs, making it difficult to change their minds with factual information.

Moreover, there's a mention of the Dunning-Kruger effect, where people overestimate their understanding of complex topics like vaccine science.

Finally, the article acknowledges that vaccines aren't perfect and can have side effects, although these are generally mild and rare.

So, it seems like there are multiple factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy or refusal. It's not just one thing; it's a combination of mistrust, misinformation, and emotional responses.

I think it's important to approach this topic with empathy while also promoting accurate information. People have valid concerns about their health and their children's health, and it's crucial to address those concerns with science-based evidence.

Maybe I should look for strategies on how to communicate effectively with vaccine-hesitant individuals.

[Performs another search]

Here's an article from StudyFinds.org titled "Many who refuse to get COVID vaccine struggle to cite valid reasons for hesitation." It discusses a study that found anti-vaxxers often have vague reasons for their stance and struggle to provide concrete evidence to support their beliefs.

The study suggests that anti-vaxxers rely on confirmation bias, seeking information that reinforces their pre-existing negative attitudes toward vaccines, and dismissing information that contradicts their views.

It also mentions that vaccine-hesitant individuals are susceptible to anti-vaccine arguments and may be swayed by conspiracy theories about "Big Pharma."

The researchers recommend that vaccination awareness campaigns focus on reaching the hesitant group rather than trying to change the minds of staunch anti-vaxxers, as their beliefs may be more entrenched.

This aligns with what I've been reading elsewhere—that it's challenging to change deeply held beliefs, especially when they're rooted in mistrust and misinformation.

I think one of the key takeaways is the importance of building trust in the medical community and ensuring that accurate information is easily accessible to the public.

Perhaps improving transparency in how vaccines are developed and regulated could help alleviate some of the mistrust.

Additionally, addressing broader issues like income inequality and access to healthcare might also reduce vaccine hesitancy, as people who feel marginalized or overlooked may be more likely to distrust authority figures and institutions.

In conclusion, there are多种原因导致一些人反对疫苗接种。这些原因包括对副作用的担忧、对大型制药公司的不信任、对自然疗法的偏好、以及错误地认为疫苗会导致自闭症等疾病。社交媒体的传播加剧了这些误解，而历史上的一些医疗丑闻也损害了公众对医学界的信任。尽管如此，科学研究一致表明疫苗是安全有效的，拒绝接种疫苗可能导致传染病的卷土重来。因此，重要的是通过提供准确信息和建立信任来应对疫苗犹豫和反对情绪。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People are anti-vax due to concerns about side effects, distrust in pharmaceutical companies, preference for natural remedies, belief in debunked links to autism, and historical mistrust in medicine, despite scientific evidence supporting vaccine safety and efficacy.}} \]
