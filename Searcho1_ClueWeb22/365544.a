As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or access to real-time data, but I can provide you with a general idea of how public figures might cope with the pressures of fame based on common strategies and known examples.

First, it's important to understand that fame can bring a lot of pressure, including constant media attention, high expectations for performance, and scrutiny of personal life. Athletes like Simone Biles, who have achieved extraordinary success at a young age, often face intense pressure to maintain their status and continue performing at the highest level.

One way that public figures cope with this pressure is by maintaining a strong support system. This can include family, friends, coaches, and mental health professionals. Having people who understand the challenges of fame and can provide emotional support is crucial.

Another strategy is setting boundaries. Managing one's time and deciding when to engage with the media and fans can help maintain a sense of privacy and control over one's life.

Engaging in self-care activities is also important. This can include exercise, meditation, hobbies, and spending time on personal interests outside of their public role.

Additionally, some individuals find it helpful to focus on their goals and the reasons why they pursued their career in the first place. Keeping sight of their passions and the positive aspects of their success can provide motivation and resilience in the face of pressure.

It's also worth noting that seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, is becoming more accepted among public figures. Addressing mental health proactively can be an effective way to manage the stresses associated with fame.

In the case of Simone Biles, she has been open about taking care of her mental health, even making the difficult decision to withdraw from events at the Olympics to prioritize her well-being. This shows that she prioritizes her mental health and understands the importance of self-care.

Overall, coping with the pressures of fame involves a combination of support from others, personal boundaries, self-care, focusing on one's goals, and seeking professional help when needed.
