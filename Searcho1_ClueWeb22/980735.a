So I have this question: "What role should a leader take in vision development?" Hmm, vision development sounds important for any organization or team. I guess leaders are supposed to play a key role in this, but I'm not exactly sure what that entails. Maybe I should look up some information on this.

First, I need to understand what a vision is in the context of leadership. I think a vision is like a clear image of the future that a leader wants to achieve. It's something that inspires and guides the team towards a common goal. So, vision development would be the process of creating and shaping that vision.

Now, what role should a leader take in this process? Is it solely the leader's responsibility to come up with the vision, or should they involve their team in the process? I feel like involving the team might be better because then everyone feels invested in the vision. But maybe in some cases, the leader needs to take a more decisive role.

Let me try to think of some examples. Take Steve Jobs, for instance. He was known for his visionary approach at Apple. From what I've read, he had a very clear vision of what he wanted Apple products to be, and he drove that vision forward. It seems like in his case, the vision was largely his own creation.

On the other hand, there are leaders who are more collaborative. Like Patrick Lencioni in his book "The Ideal Team Player" talks about the importance of teamwork and collaboration. Maybe in those scenarios, the vision is developed collectively.

Hmm, so perhaps it depends on the situation and the type of organization. Maybe in some cases, a more autocratic approach is needed, while in others, a democratic approach is better.

Wait a minute, maybe I should look into different leadership styles and see how they relate to vision development. There's authoritarian leadership, democratic leadership, laissez-faire leadership, transformational leadership, and so on. Each of these probably has a different approach to vision development.

Let me consider transformational leadership first. According to Bass's theory, transformational leaders inspire and motivate their followers to achieve extraordinary outcomes. They often have a clear vision and are able to communicate it effectively. So, in this style, the leader seems to play a central role in developing the vision.

In contrast, democratic leadership involves征求团队成员的意见和建议。这样的领导者可能会在愿景开发过程中更加包容和合作。这可能有助于确保团队成员对愿景有归属感，并更有可能致力于实现它。

另一方面，放任型领导则较少参与决策过程，给予团队更大的自主权。在这种情况下，愿景的发展可能更多地由团队来驱动，领导者可能扮演着支持性和指导性的角色。

不过，我认为在大多数情况下，领导者在愿景开发中应该发挥积极的作用，即使他们选择采取包容性的方式。愿景通常需要一个清晰的方向和目标，而领导者的位置使他们能够站在更高的角度，看到组织的全局和发展潜力。

此外，领导者还需要具备沟通愿景的能力，使其对团队成员具有吸引力和激励作用。如果团队成员不能理解或认同愿景，那么它就很难起到引导作用。

也许，理想的领导者会在愿景开发中平衡自主性和包容性。他们可以开始时提出一个初步的愿景框架，然后与团队成员进行讨论和修订，以纳入不同的观点和想法。这样，愿景既体现了领导者的远见，也反映了团队的共识。

此外，领导者还应该确保愿景是实际可行的，与组织的资源和能力相匹配。设定一个不切实际的愿景可能会导致失望和失败。

我也想到，愿景应该是灵活的，能够适应环境的变化。因此，领导者需要定期审查和调整愿景，以保持其相关性和有效性。

总之，我认为领导者在愿景开发中的角色应该是积极的引导者和合作者。他们应该提出愿景的初始构想，与团队成员进行开放的沟通和协商，以形成一个共同认可的、实际可行的愿景，并且能够随着时间的推移进行调整。

不过，我可能需要一些权威来源来支持这个观点。也许我可以查找一些关于领导力和愿景开发的学术文章或管理书籍。

让我尝试进行一次搜索，看看其他人是怎么说的。

The Importance of Clear Vision in Leadership
The Importance of Clear Vision in Leadership
July 11th, 2014
The role of leadership in any organization, whether it be a board of directors at a large NGO, a corporation, or the manager of a small business, is to provide a future vision. Everything done within an organization should be in the context of achieving goals, both short- and long-term, and the leadership should develop those goals. Having employee input is highly valuable and necessary, but it is the vision of the leadership that ensures progress and improvement on a day-to-day basis.
Developing a Shared Plan
Everyone within an organization can be more effective if they understand a set of shared goals. Knowing how to achieve those goals requires planning. Even the word leadership implies that we’re going somewhere with someone who can lead - but does everyone understand where we’re going? Vision is what leaders use to develop a plan which they can communicate to the rest of the team, so everyone knows where they’re headed.
Seeing Today and Tomorrow
Vision can also ensure that the goals of an organization are realistic, based on the current state of the business and industry culture. A leader must be able to see the strengths of individuals as well as the group. They must also see weaknesses so they can be addressed and improved upon.
Clear vision means seeing a big picture and all the parts that make up the big picture. By understanding the way things work - or don’t work - a leader can make big decisions about how to move forward. Their vision should also enable them to encourage individuals towards goals that benefit the entire organization. Great leaders are able to see beyond what’s possible today and look toward what is possible in the future. They can also see the path that everyone must be on to get there.

How to build your leadership vision
“Create a vision and never let the environment, other people’s beliefs or the limits of what has been done in the past shape your decisions.” – Tony Robbins
Think of the world’s most famous leaders: Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Warren Buffet. Indra Nooyi. Sheryl Sandberg. They’re not known for their day-to-day management of minutiae, and they won’t be remembered for their fortunes or their memoirs. We know these names because they have strong leadership vision – and it propelled them to the highest peaks of success.
Leadership and vision aren’t just partners – they’re one and the same. Leading without vision is like driving a car blindfolded: You just wouldn’t do it. You cannot lead the way without seeing where you’re going. But what is vision in leadership? And how can you develop it?
How much do you know about leadership vision?
Take Free Business Identity Quiz
What is vision in leadership?
Vision is one of the core leadership values. It’s the dream and the direction for your company. It’s what forms your company culture, guides your decisions and helps you set – and crush – your goals. It’s what inspires others to follow you, work hard and make a difference. Leadership vision is what makes a company worth working for.
No great leader ever accomplished anything without having a powerful vision, but that isn’t all you’ll need. You must not only get crystal-clear on your leadership vision. You must also be able to communicate it to others effectively and get them excited about it.
How to create your leadership vision
Creating a mission statement and a vision statement are basic fundamentals every business person learns in school or on the job. So why do some leadership visions take such powerful hold while others seem to fade away?
Leadership vision is about more than written statements and rules of conduct. The most inspiring leaders are fueled by their purpose and passion, and their vision affects every decision they make and action they take. They don’t just have a vision – they are their vision.
1. Self-reflection
Leadership and vision both come from within. To determine your vision, you must get in touch with your inner purpose – your ultimate reason for doing what you do every day. This type of self-awareness is an active skill that requires time and effort, but is well worth it. You’ll come away with a certainty and belief in yourself that you never thought possible.
2. Mindfulness
Practicing mindfulness can deepen your self-reflection and allow you to gain new insights that contribute to your leadership vision. Practices like meditation and priming can also reduce stress,  promote productivity and help you stay focused on your outcomes. Unrivaled focus is a trait of many top leaders and a necessary part of living your leadership vision.
3. Positivity
The best leadership vision examples are always optimistic, forward-looking and illuminating. No one wants to work toward a future that’s fixated on problems or filled with challenges. Tony says, “Identify your problems but give your power and energy to solutions.” Great leaders embody this ideal, reframing problems in a positive way, focusing on solutions and imagining possibilities.
4. Clarity
A future that’s unclear is just as uninspiring as a future that’s dark. Outstanding leadership vision examples are clear and concise. They answer a big question – “Why?” – in a way that’s easy to understand. Today’s employees seek meaningful work that will help them find fulfillment and feel like they’re making a difference in the world. Leadership vision that does that will make them want to stick around.
5. Communication
What is vision in leadership if you’re not able to communicate it effectively? Once you have an honest, positive and concise leadership vision, tell the world! Never assume that your employees already “know” your vision if you haven’t told them specifically. Put your vision statement everywhere. When announcing decisions or accomplishments, always relate them back to your vision. Leadership communication is just as vital as vision.
6. Action
“Rewards come in action, not in discussion,” as Tony says. You communicate your leadership and vision not only through your words but also through your actions. When your vision is strong, you’ll have the confidence you need to make tough decisions, set and achieve lofty goals and take massive, determined action in every aspect of the business.
Leadership vision examples
Sometimes you need to learn from the best. Here are three examples that perfectly sum up the power of leadership and vision.
TerraCycle
TerraCycle was started by 20-year-old Tom Szaky in 2001 with a concise and powerful leadership vision: “Eliminating the idea of waste.” Tom dropped out of Princeton to bottle worm poop as fertilizer. Everyone probably thought he was crazy, but he had a vision. Today, TerraCycle is a multi-million dollar company that sets up programs for hard-to-recycle materials all over the globe. To this day, the original vision statement is found in the signature of every employee email.
Amazon
Everyone knows Amazon – and that’s largely in part due to its legendary founder, Jeff Bezos. His leadership vision was short and clear: Be the store for everything, A-Z. His leadership style is as bold as his vision. He takes big risks and thinks outside the box. He lives by the motto “The one thing I might regret is not trying.” Whether you agree with his style or not, one thing is undeniable: Bezos certainly knows the answer to the question “ What is vision in leadership ?”
JetBlue
For a leadership vision example from a company in crisis, look no further than JetBlue’s breakdown in 2007. In five days, the airline canceled more than a thousand flights due to a severe ice storm on the East Coast. For a company with a vision statement “to inspire humanity, both in the air and on the ground,” it didn’t look good. But CEO David Neeleman tackled the backlash head-on. He publicly apologized, compensated passengers and never once blamed the weather. He lived his leadership vision with honesty and integrity and allowed JetBlue to bounce back.

Learn how to gain more followers, members, and support for your organization by learning how to develop and communicate your organization’s vision.
What is a vision?
Why do you need to communicate a vision to others?
When do you need to communicate your vision?
How do you create a vision?
How do you communicate a vision to others?
In his 1961 Inaugural address, John F. Kennedy said,
"Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce."
Every leader has a vision. For Nelson Mandela, it was a South Africa without Apartheid. For Lech Walesa, it was a Poland run by workers and common people. For Susan B. Anthony, it was a United States in which women had the right to vote.
Even though these are examples of famous leaders, they are not much different from community leaders who have visions for their communities.
If you are a community leader, you probably already have some kind of vision. Perhaps you want elderly folks to be able to live decently and independently. Or maybe you want your school district to give children from all backgrounds an equal chance at academic achievement. Or perhaps you want a community that has the skills and commitment to discuss hard issues and solve tough problems cooperatively.
Whatever your vision of your community is, it is important. Why? Because nothing happens until it happens in someone's mind first.
In this section, you will learn how to take a dream and turn it into a vision. You will also learn how to use your vision to lead--to mobilize and inspire people so that others want to join you in making your vision a reality.
But first let's take a closer look at the different steps in developing and communicating a vision. There are three steps in the vision process:
Developing your own vision
Communicating your vision to others
Developing the group's vision, within the group
This section focuses on the first two steps: How, as a leader, you develop your own vision and communicate it to others. It also focuses on how to use your vision to move people toward a common goal.
The next section focuses on step three, developing the group's vision.Included in that section is an outline of how to develop a vision statement for your group or organization.
Now, we will look at you and your vision.
What is a vision?
A vision is your big picture of the way things ought to be. It is your billboard image of what you are working towards.
For example, you may have a picture of all the different ways you want your neighborhood to be better. You may want a neighborhood that has clean streets. You may want people to watch out for each other so that crime is less likely to take place. You may want a neighborhood in which people know each other well enough to be able to solve problems together.
Everyday, as you go about your life, you may find yourself thinking about all the ways things could be better. If you put together all the pieces of how things should be, you have an overall vision.
Once you put together all those pieces, your overall vision might be: A neighborhood that is friendly, safe, and clean; one in which neighbors know, like, support each other, and work out differences together.
Your overall vision is like a billboard: It is a picture of your ideal neighborhood or community that gets your ideas across powerfully, accurately, and quickly.
Once you have a vision, you tell people about it and use it to lead people.
Why do you need to communicate your vision to others?
Why communicate your vision to others? Because no one can decide to follow you until they know what direction you're headed in.
If your vision is one that touches a chord with many people and if you can communicate it well, people will join you in reaching towards your goals.
In the words of the Syracuse Cultural Workers, "No matter what our attempts to inform, it is our ability to inspire that will turn the tides."
Sharing a vision is a central role of a leader--a vision gives people a bigger picture of what things can be like. It helps people raise their hopes and expectations; it inspires them. When people are inspired, they are more likely to work on something.
When do you need to communicate your vision?
All the time. Whenever you talk to people about your group or organization, tell people what you are working towards. The more you do it, the better you will get at it, and the more people will be willing to support you.
Even before you have formed a group or organization, it is important to talk about your vision. As you communicate it to others, you are creating a community of people who know about your idea and who potentially will support you.
How do you create a vision?
Dream big
Dreaming is the first step. Go ahead and dare to dream about what you can do and what is possible to accomplish. Don't be afraid to dream big. You can always scale down to meet the realities of the situation, but dreaming big allows you to think about ideas that may not seem likely, yet are in fact possible. Thinking big also forces you to think about the long term, always a useful thing to do.
You have nothing to lose; it doesn't cost a nickel.
Can you recall a time when you got a wild idea in your head and your heart started beating fast and you wondered what it would be like if you could make that idea happen?
Maybe you intermittently think, "Oh, that's impossible. How can I be so foolish as to think that!" However, often the ideas that feel foolish may have the most potential. They are often ideas that are new to the world. Learn to value and trust your hunches. If you get an idea that makes your heart sing, chances are good that others will come to sing along with you.
How to dream big:
We'll start with an imaginary example of how things are already in your community:
Imagine that you presently live in a neighborhood in which people are frightened of those different from themselves. Children are considered a nuisance. People come home from work and quickly run into their houses without saying hello to their neighbors. Some people struggle with alcohol and no one knows about it or helps them. In some homes there is domestic violence
Now here's a dream for how things can be different:
Imagine that you live in a neighborhood in which people from different cultures really know and like each other. In this neighborhood, people visit each other often. They eat dinner at each other's houses and know each other's children. People communicate often enough to know when one family is in trouble or need. When someone is in trouble, others come to their aid, sometimes without being asked.
If you have such a dream, don't let it go! Turn it into a vision and make it happen!
Lili Fini Zanuck, a film director and producer, said, "Nothing happens without a dream. The daydreaming mind will wander to something greater than the conscious mind could ever have imagined... The more you visualize your dream, the more you understand it. That's how you begin. Soon you're on the road to realizing your dream."
Develop your personal vision
How do you start developing a vision? Let's start with ourselves for practice.
Everyone has a personal vision. Everyone has a picture in their minds of what they want for themselves in the future. Perhaps you would like a better job, would like to have enough time in your life to think about what you want to do next, or become more influential in your community.
Exercise:
What do you envision for yourself in the next five years?
How do you want to grow?
What do you envision for your work?
What do you envision for your family life or friendships?
What do you envision for where you live?
What do you envision for fun and recreation?
What do you envision for yourself as a leader?
A vision for your own life is simply a picture of where you want to be in the future. And a vision for your community, group, or organization is simply your picture of where you want that group to be in the future.
Develop a vision for your community, group, or organization
So now that you've had some practice creating a vision for yourself, try creating and articulating a vision for your community, group, or organization.
How do you articulate your vision of how things should be? Jump in and try.
And remember, the way you see things is what matters in this first stage of developing a vision. Don't try to think like anyone else. Trust your vision of the way things should be. Even though you may be creating a vision for your community, a vision is your personal view.
The more a vision reflects what you really think and care about, the more powerful it will be. People will be more likely to respond to your message if they see you care about an issue, rather than seeing you as a political figure talking about an abstract issue.
So go ahead and picture what you would like your neighborhood, community, or group to be like in the future.
Exercise:
Imagine your community the way you would like it to be. Write out your ideas. Don't worry about how they sound. This is sort of like a personal brainstorming session--get everything in your head out on paper without judging it. You can clarify and focus later. Use some of the questions below to help you think or make up your own questions:
What does your community look like physically? What kind of buildings are there? What kind of public spaces? Is it safe to walk around it during the day and at night?
What kind of work do people do? Who has what kind of jobs? Do people like their work? Why?
How do people get along with each other? Do people from different groups communicate and get along? Do younger and older people have contact and good relationships with each other?
How do decisions get made? Are things fair for different groups? Does every group have a fair say? Are many people involved in sharing their ideas and solving problems?
What do families look like? Do people within families get along? Are there places where women and men can get help if they need it? Is there child care available? Do neighbors help each other? Do single people feel there is a place for them in the community?
Where do people play? Do people in the community go to recreational events together? What possibilities are there for young people, old people, and everybody in between?
Clarify your vision
Once you have lots of ideas down on paper you have a good start. Now, sift through everything you wrote down and pick out what is most important to you. (Don't throw away the details, though--they are important for later when you are communicating your vision.) Now, are there some general statements that express your most important ideas? Are there some powerful or compelling phrases or words that get to the heart of what you care about?
Let's go back to a previous example:
"Imagine a neighborhood in which people from different cultures really know and like each other. In this neighborhood, people visit each other often. They eat dinner at each other's houses and know each other's children. People communicate often enough to know when one family is in trouble or need. When someone is in trouble, others come to their aid, sometimes without being asked."
How can you boil this vision down to a few powerful phrases?
Here are some examples:
A caring neighborhood where people from many cultures know their way around each other's kitchens.
In this neighborhood, "a friend in need is a friend indeed."
An extended family neighborhood--people talk, eat, and celebrate together. People help each other out when times are hard.
A "guardian angel" neighborhood--people care and watch out for each other.
Of course, everyone's vision for their community will be different. What phrases or words get to the core of what you care about?
Do you want a neighborhood in which each person is secure, welcome, and involved?
Do you want a child-friendly community?
Do you want economic justice for all?
The more you put your own heart into your words, the more other people will be able to relate to what you have to say. Then they will be more likely to follow your lead.
How do you communicate a vision to others?
Get feedback on your vision
Talk to people about your vision as much as you can. Tell them what you are thinking. Give them your big picture of things. Then listen. See if other people are concerned about the same things you are concerned about. See if people are interested in your picture of how things could be.
The more you talk to people and listen to them, the clearer your vision will become. First of all, you will get some practice speaking. Whenever a person talks, they have a chance to hear their thoughts out loud; as they listen to themselves, they get clearer on what they are trying to say.
Secondly, after listening to people respond to your ideas, your vision will probably change somewhat. You may want to incorporate some of their thinking into your own. Other people's ideas will help you make your vision stronger.
After talking to people about your vision for a period of time, you will get an idea of how strong your vision is. You will have a sense of whether other people get excited when you speak. Everyone doesn't necessarily have to agree with your vision for it to be a good one--but if people get animated and interested in talking with you about your vision, that is a sign that you are onto something.
Develop and communicate the details
After you test and reshape your big-picture vision, you should develop the details. You need to give people some specifics as to what your big picture will mean on a day-to-day level. You also have to tell people what steps you will take to get there, i.e., develop a plan. People may think your big picture is a meaningless mirage if you don't give them some ideas as to how you think things will actually change.
You don't have to have all the answers, but you need to have some ideas. If you have a vision of your neighborhood as one in which people from different cultural and racial backgrounds work together to prevent crime, what has to happen to get there? Do you need different church groups to set up a task force first? Do you need to set up some cultural sharing events? Do you, at some point, need to build a neighborhood group that can challenge city hall to provide better police protection for your neighborhood?
Write up some tentative ideas for how to get things done. The better your plan for reaching your vision, the more likely people will take you seriously and be willing to follow your lead.
Once you have some confidence that your vision is sound, begin to put it out as a way to gather support for your leadership and what you and your organization want to accomplish. Use your vision as a way to inspire people to act.
Help people take ownership of a vision
As a leader, you have to help people take your vision and make it their own. This is an important step in bringing people together to work toward a common goal. Members of a group need to have a shared vision and a sense of ownership in order to be committed to the group. That is key in helping people stay with a group for the long haul.
People don't need to agree with all the details of your vision in order to follow your lead. They will have different ideas about how to put a vision to use. That is fine and healthy. But in order to work together, people need to share an overall vision and some basic goals.
To help people take your vision and make it their own, you need to talk and listen. You shouldn't talk too much. You should mostly listen to people's thinking. If you really sit back and listen to people, they will tell you what is most important to them.
It may take people a long time to get to the point of telling you what is really important to them. They may have to tell you first about their children or a crummy experience they had with a politician. However, if you can listen long enough, people will tell you their thinking about how things should change.
A balancing act: Meet people where they are and challenge them at the same time
At times people may not be ready to hear your vision of how things can be. Some people may disagree. Some may have so much of their attention taken by surviving day-to-day that it is difficult for them to listen to how things can be better. Also, people sometimes feel mistrustful, hopeless, discouraged, and cynical. Some people depend on a narrow picture of the world in order to feel secure.
Communicating a vision to people through that obstacle course can be tough. You often have to meet people where they are in order to establish some trust. As we talked about earlier, listening is an important tool in doing that.
But you also have to communicate the parts of your vision that people can relate to. They may not be ready to think about an overall plan for transforming your neighborhood. However, they may be able to think about doing something about the potholes in the streets. If so, talk about potholes. Talk to people "where they're at." Speak to their conditions and their personal needs. This will help you build some trusting relationships. Later you can do more.
On the other hand, it is sometimes important to say things that people are not quite ready to hear. People need to think about new ideas over a period of time before they can make sense of them. New ideas are important to introduce, even if they engender initial resistance. Often the strongest and most important ideas meet with resistance.
A leader has to lead. And the most important aspect of leadership is winning over the thinking of people to a vision of what things can be like.
This can take time. You may need to be gentle, but also persistent.
Be courageous
In order to create and communicate a vision, you must be courageous. People who communicate a vision of what things should be like are often the people who are courageous enough to state what is obviously wrong and unjust. It can be difficult to say out loud that the prince has no clothes. However, once you say it, people will see that it is true.
If, for example, you see some clear problems in your community, be courageous and start talking about them to others. Ask people how they think things should be. You may find that you have more in common with people than you had thought.
You should also be prepared for people to attack you for what you are trying to do. Ideas that lead to fundamental changes are frightening to people. People may actively campaign against you. Often, these campaigns can get quite personal. People may try to make your personal problems or shortcomings the issue, rather than the issue you are trying to put forward.
If this happens, gather your close friends and allies around you. Together, come up with a plan to handle the attack and direct the discussion back to the real issues. Don't try to handle an attack by yourself. When an attack is being directed at you, you will need the perspective of friends. It will help if you can anticipate and plan for such attacks before they happen, but sometimes that is not possible.
Modify your vision
As you lead, you will modify your vision. The more you lead, the more you will learn about what needs to change. You will also learn from the people you lead.
Your vision should be flexible enough so that you can change it as circumstances change. That doesn't mean you give up your principles or your hopes about what is possible. But as you collect information and advance your thinking you should adjust your vision to keep it up to date.
Use your vision to act
Developing and communicating a vision is just the beginning. Once you have a workable vision, you need to use it to get where you want to go. You need to organize, draw up an action plan, and go!
In Summary
As you lead, you should be communicating your vision all the time. People look to leaders to inspire them and keep them on the right track. The more you are enthusiastic and clear about where you are going, the more likely it will be that people follow your lead.
Don't underestimate the power of your ideas and words. You, as much as anyone, have what is takes to lead others and to help them envision a better neighborhood, community, country, and world.

Why Leaders Must Have Vision
Debbie Zmorenski
Great leaders have vision. There are very few natural visionary leaders in the corporate world. I have been lucky to have worked with two during my 34-year career with Walt Disney World. The good news is that this is a skill that can be learned. It is probably the most powerful tool in a leader’s toolbox. So what is a vision? How does it work, and how is it different from a vision statement?
Let's begin by defining a vision statement and a vision. A vision statement is a statement of words describing where and what an organization wants to be in the future. It usually remains unchanged for many years. There is nothing wrong with vision statements. They have their place in the organizational structure. However, vision statements do not necessarily translate into action. Without action, an organization has a nicely framed statement on the wall but no forward motion.
In contrast, vision can be defined as a picture in the leader's imagination that motivates people to action when communicated compellingly, passionately and clearly.
To be a visionary, a leader need have nothing more than a clear vision of the future. The difficult task is communicating that vision with clarity and passion in order to motivate and inspire people to take action. A visionary leader who clearly and passionately communicates his or her vision can motivate employees to act with passion and purpose, thereby ensuring that everyone is working toward a common goal. The end result is that everyone contributes to the organization's forward momentum.
"In order to take the organization to the highest possible level, leaders must engage their people with a compelling and tangible vision," said Warren Bennis, professor of business administration at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.
What follows is a practice exercise that you can use to develop and hone your visionary communication skills:
Step 1: Think of one challenge within your department, division or organization.
Step 2: Imagine the big picture. Visualize the incredible future success that you will realize from the new and improved situation, as well as the benefits to the organization and to the employees. This is your chance to be a true visionary. No dream is too big or too fantastic. This is the "pie in the sky" result you are seeing.
Step 3: Determine how you will communicate your vision. What words and phrases will you use? In what environment will you choose to communicate your vision – in a staff meeting, one on one, with supervisors and managers? How will you communicate the benefits to the staff and to the organization? Write down your ideas on paper.
Step 4: Practice communicating what you have written. Make sure it sounds sincere. Practice out loud to yourself and to others. If you don't believe it, no one else will believe it either.
If you use this exercise frequently, you will find that expressing your vision in a compelling and clear manner will soon feel very natural.
When you are ready to communicate your vision to your employees, give them only the vision of success. Great leaders use vision as a tool to inspire and motivate, not to dictate. Do not give your employees the steps for achieving the vision, but let them determine the methods and tactics for achieving the goal. Great leaders know how to give the gift of vision and then step away.

Alright, I have some information from these documents. Let's see what they say about the role of a leader in vision development.

From Doc 1, it mentions that the role of leadership is to provide a future vision, and that leaders should develop goals, both short-term and long-term, with employee input being valuable and necessary. So, it seems like leaders should be the ones to set the vision, but they should also consider inputs from their team members.

Doc 2 is from Norwex, and it talks about the five fundamentals of leadership, with the first one being "Lead with Vision." It emphasizes that having a clear vision is crucial and that leaders pave the way for others, showing that leaders should indeed have a vision and share it with their team.

Doc 3 is from Tony Robbins and discusses six secrets to leadership vision. It stresses that vision is not just about having a mission or vision statement but about embodying that vision and making it a part of everything the leader does. It also talks about self-reflection, mindfulness, positivity, clarity, communication, and action as key components of developing and implementing a vision.

Doc 4 is from the Community Tool Box and provides a detailed guide on developing and communicating a vision. It suggests that leaders should first develop their own vision, then communicate it to others, and finally help the group develop its own vision. This document emphasizes the importance of dreaming big, clarifying the vision, getting feedback, and using the vision to inspire and motivate others.

Doc 5 is about why leaders must have vision and distinguishes between a vision statement and actual vision. It argues that a vision statement is just words on a wall unless it is brought to life through a leader's compelling communication of a vivid future.

So, synthesizing these sources, it seems that leaders play a central role in vision development. They are responsible for creating a vision, communicating it effectively to their team, and inspiring others to work towards that vision. However, it's also important for leaders to incorporate input from their team members to make the vision inclusive and engaging.

Moreover, the vision should be clear, positive, and actionable. Leaders need to not only have a vision but also live it and act in alignment with it, serving as role models for their teams. Effective communication of the vision is crucial; leaders must be able to paint a picture of the future in a way that resonates with others and motivates them to take action.

In summary, the leader's role in vision development is multifaceted: they must create a vision, communicate it effectively, embody it through their actions, and foster an environment where the team can collectively work towards achieving that vision.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Leaders play a central role in vision development by creating a vision, communicating it effectively, embodying it through actions, and fostering a collective effort towards achieving it.}}
