Alright, so I need to explain how climate change works. Hmm, that's a big topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First off, I know that climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns around the world. It's not just about the Earth getting warmer, although that is a major part of it.

I think I should start by understanding what causes climate change. I've heard a lot about greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which is a natural process that keeps the planet warm enough to support life. This is called the greenhouse effect, right? Without it, the Earth would be too cold to live on.

But somehow, human activities have been enhancing this greenhouse effect, leading to more heat being trapped and the planet warming up beyond normal levels. So, what are these human activities? Well, burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for energy releases a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Deforestation also plays a role because trees absorb carbon dioxide, so when they're cut down, there's less to absorb it.

Okay, so increased greenhouse gases lead to more heat being trapped. But how does that actually cause climate change? I think it's because as the atmosphere warms, it affects weather patterns. For example, warmer air can hold more moisture, which might lead to heavier rainfalls and more intense storms in some areas. In other places, the warming could lead to droughts because the water evaporates faster.

Also, I recall that warming temperatures can melt ice caps and glaciers, which leads to rising sea levels. That's a big concern for coastal cities and island nations. Plus, the ocean absorbs a lot of the excess heat and carbon dioxide, which makes it more acidic and affects marine life.

I should probably look into some specific mechanisms to understand better. Maybe I can find some scientific explanations or diagrams that illustrate how this works. Let me try searching for "greenhouse effect and climate change" to get more detailed information.

What is Climate Change and the Greenhouse Effect?
The earth is surrounded with a layer of gases, and energy from the sun enters the earth’s atmosphere by passing through this layer. The earth land and water absorb much of this energy but some is reflected back away from the earth. The rest of the energy remains close to the earth.
Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of these gases including carbon dioxide has increased through out use of fossil fuels and these are becoming trapped in this layer of gas.
This has caused an increase in temperature and scientists agree the average temperature increase must be kept to no more than 2 0 C to avoid the most dramatic and far reaching impacts. This process is generally known as climate change.
What evidence is there that our climate is changing?
There are many examples of how our climate has already changed, both here in the UK and overseas. Research by the Tearfund study estimates there are already an estimated 25 million environmental refugees resulting from floods, storms and rising tides. An increase in temperature has caused the polar ice caps to melt, endangering the habitats of polar bears. In fact, their numbers have declined by 20% in the last 20 years.
In the UK, for example, over the last 40 years our winters have become warmer with more intense rainfall. Over the last 200 years our summers have become drier and hotter, leading to water shortages. The last six summers have been the warmest since records began. The hottest temperature recorded in the UK was 38.5 0 C, in August 2003, in Brogdale, Kent.
An increase in rainfall also means our rivers are more prone to flooding. For example the Thames Barrier in London was raised an average of three times a year in it first 18 year of operation. By 2030, it is predicted the Thames Barrage will need to be raised 30 times each year, double its present use.
Will climate change bring have any health impacts?
The changes to our long term weather patterns will affect our health. Research suggests there will be an increase in the cases diseases which are caused by warmer weather including hay fever, cataracts, skin cancer and even tropical diseases such as Dengue fever and West Nile virus. Warmer summers may lead to an increase in food borne diseases. The concentration of ozone will increase and this will lead to more hospital admissions.
On the other hand, warmer winters may mean a reduction in the number of cold related deaths and the number of households experiencing fuel poverty.
Are there any economic benefits of tackling climate change?
In October 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern, advisor to the government published his report on the economic impacts of climate change. The report made several recommendations including that the total cost of unabated climate change would be 5% of the global GDP. In contrast, prompt and substantial actions in the next 10 – 20 years to reduce the impact of climate change would cost only 1% of global economy.

CHAPTER 2
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
CLIMATE AND HUMAN EVOLUTION
Earth scientists are in the midst of a revolution in their understanding of how climate change occurred in the past. Researchers are discovering the geological and astronomical forces that have changed the planet's environment from hot to cold, wet to dry, and back again, over hundreds of millions of years. Dramatic climate change is nothing new for planet Earth. The climate of the past 10,000 years, during which civilization developed, is a mere blip in a much bigger history of climate change. In fact, Earth's climate will most certainly continue to go through dramatic changes—even without the influence of human activity. Most scientists believe that, if not for extreme climate shifts some 65 million years ago, most of the animals on Earth today, including humans, would probably not be here.
Astronomical cycles have caused the climate to fluctuate between long periods of cold lasting 50,000 to 80,000 years and shorter periods of warmth lasting about 10,000 years. Some scientists believe that these geologically rapid shifts between warm and cold were the catalyst behind human evolution, forcing humans to adapt physiologically and socially in order to cope with the changing climate.
THE WORLD CLIMATE
Earth's climate is a delicate balance of energy inputs, chemical processes, and physical phenomena. Temperatures on Venus are too hot for the human body; on Mars, they are too cold. This difference in temperature is due to the varying composition of each planet's atmosphere. All three planets receive huge quantities of solar energy, but the amount radiated back into space as heat depends on the atmospheric composition of the particular planet. Some gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane, absorb and maintain heat in the same way that glass traps heat in a greenhouse. These gases in Earth's atmosphere allow temperatures to build up, keeping our planet warm and habitable. That is why the increased buildup of these and other gases caused by pollution is often called the "greenhouse effect ." (See Figure 2.1.)
It is necessary, however, to distinguish between the "natural" and a possible "enhanced" greenhouse effect. The natural greenhouse effect creates a climate in which life can exist, causing the mean temperature of Earth's surface to be about 33 degrees Celsius (91 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it would be if natural greenhouse gases were not present. Without this process, Earth would be frigid and uninhabitable. An enhanced greenhouse effect, sometimes called the anthropogenic effect, refers to the possible increase in the temperature of Earth's surface due to human activity.
The scorching heat of Venus is the result of an atmosphere that is composed largely of CO 2. The atmosphere of Earth, however, is nitrogen- and oxygen-based and contains only 0.03 percent CO 2. This percentage has varied little over the past million years, permitting a stable climate favorable to life. The blanket of air enveloping Earth moderates its temperature and sustains life.
A Revolutionary Idea
Earth's atmosphere was first compared to a glass vessel in 1827 by the French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Fourier. In the 1850s British physicist John Tyndall tried to measure the heat-trapping properties of various components of the atmosphere. By the 1890s scientists had concluded that the great increase in combustion in the Industrial Revolution had the potential to change the atmosphere's load of CO 2. In 1896 the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius made the revolutionary suggestion that human activities could actually disrupt this delicate balance. He theorized that the rapid increase in the use of coal that came with the Industrial Revolution could increase CO 2 concentrations and cause a gradual rise in
temperatures. For almost six decades his theory stirred little interest.
In 1957 studies at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in California suggested that, indeed, half the CO 2 released by industry was being permanently trapped in the atmosphere. The studies showed that atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 in the previous 30 years were greater than in the previous two centuries and that the gas had reached its highest level in 160,000 years.
Findings in the 1980s and 1990s provided more disturbing evidence. Scientists detected increases in other, even more potent gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, notably chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and -12), methane, nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and halocarbons (CFCs, methyl chloroform, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons). Atmospheric concentrations of these gases from the 1700s through the 1900s have increased drastically. As shown in Table 2.1, the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 increased from 280 parts per million (ppm) in preindustrial times to 370.3 ppm in 2001.
Table 2.2 shows trends for the late 1990s and early 2000s in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks (repositories, such as forests, that absorb and store carbon). Major sources of greenhouse gas emissions are shown in Figure 2.2. In 2001 electricity generation at power plants continued to account for the largest share (33 percent) of these emissions, followed by transportation (27 percent), industry (19 percent), agriculture (8 percent), commercial sources (7 percent), and residences (5 percent).
Emissions from most sources have increased since 1995. During the late 1990s emissions from industry began to decline and continued that trend into the early 2000s. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attributes the decline to a shift in the overall U.S. economy from a focus on manufacturing industries to service-based businesses. Agricultural emissions are predominantly nitrogen-based, rather than carbon-based. Residential emissions are mainly due to CO 2 generated from combustion of fossil fuels (such as oil) for heating purposes.
Scientists know that atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases are increasing. Figure 2.3 shows the dramatic increase in concentrations of CO 2 from 1981 through 2002 based on data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from its Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL). This buildup of CO 2 and other gases could possibly trap energy from the Sun. No one is certain how this accumulation affects Earth's climate.
Is the Earth Getting Warmer?
As of 2004 even experts are not sure whether the world has already experienced human-induced climate change. Scientists have been unable to provide a definitive answer because they do not know how much the global climate has varied on its own in the relatively recent past (about 1,000 years). Temperature records based on thermometers go back only about 150 years. Investigators have turned, therefore, to "proxy" (indirect) means of

measuring past temperatures. These methods include chemical evidence of climatic change contained in fossils, corals, ancient ice, and growth rings in trees.
In 1998 Drs. Michael E. Mann and Raymond S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Dr. Malcolm K. Hughes of the University of Arizona at Tucson surveyed proxy evidence of temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere since 1400. They discovered that the twentieth century was the warmest century of the past 600 years. They concluded that the warming trend seems to be closely connected to the emission of greenhouse gases by humans. Some experts, however, question whether studies of proxy evidence will ever be reliable enough to yield valuable information on global warming.
Three international agencies have compiled long-term data on surface temperatures—the British Meteorological Office in Bracknell, United Kingdom, the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Temperature measurements from these organizations reported that the 1990s were the warmest decade of the twentieth century and the warmest decade since humans began measuring temperatures in the mid-nineteenth century. The average global surface temperature was approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit warmer than at the turn of the twentieth century, and this rise increased more rapidly since 1980.
According to NASA, the 2002 meteorological year was the second warmest year recorded since the late 1800s. (See Figure 2.4.) A meteorological year runs from the beginning of winter to the end of autumn. Thus, the 2002 meteorological year ran from December 1, 2001, to November 30, 2002. The mean surface temperature for that year was 0.51 degrees Celsius (33 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the climatological mean (average for 1951–1980). The warmest temperature occurred in 1998. There has been a strong warming trend over the past three decades.
While some scientists are uncertain whether the greenhouse effect accounts for the change, most believe that it is the most likely explanation. Climate models suggest the potential for a warming from 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years, warmer than Earth has been for millions of years.
In December 2003 the council of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) issued a statement declaring that Earth's climate was warming faster than expected and blamed the increase on anthropogenic (human-related) emissions of greenhouse gases. The statement from the AGU, an international scientific organization with more than 40,000 members, declared that "scientific evidence strongly indicates that natural influences cannot explain the rapid increase in global near-surface temperatures observed in the second half of the 20th century" (David Perlman, "Earth Warming at Faster Pace, Say Top Science Group's Leaders," San Francisco Chronicle, December 18, 2003).
However, some scientists observe that major climate events should be viewed in terms of thousands of years, not just a century. A record of only the past century may indicate, but not prove, that a major change has occurred. Is it caused by greenhouse gases, or is it natural variability? While some experts believe it is not possible to conclude that the warming is caused by greenhouse gases emitted by human activity, the rising temperature is roughly on track with that of computer models programmed to predict the course of greenhouse warming.
FURTHER SIGNS.
In 1990, at the first of several meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), several early signs of actual climate change were noted: the average warm-season temperature in Alaska had risen nearly three degrees Fahrenheit in the previous fifty years; glaciers had generally receded and become thinner on average by about thirty feet in the past forty years; there was about 5 percent less sea ice in the Bering Sea than in the 1950s; and permafrost was thawing, causing

the ground to subside, opening holes in roads, producing landslides and erosion, threatening roads and bridges, and causing local floods. Ice cellars in northern villages have thawed and become useless. More precipitation now falls as rain than snow, and the snow melts faster, causing more running and standing water. While this could be natural variability, it is the kind of change expected of global warming, that is, the Arctic will warm more than the global average.
According to the EPA, global sea levels have risen by six to eight inches over the last century. The increase is attributed to melting mountain glaciers, expansion of ocean water in response to rising temperatures, melting of the polar ice sheets, and surface discharge of groundwater
that has been pumped out of the ground. The sea level along much of the U.S. coast has risen by ten to twelve inches per century, although the rate varies by location.
Melting glaciers and collapsing ice shelves in Antarctica have been well publicized, particularly the breakup of the Larsen B Ice Shelf in early 2002. Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey estimate that melting of Antarctica's entire ice sheet will increase the sea level by 73 meters (approximately 240 feet). However, it is unknown whether the ice sheet is actually shrinking or growing.
The Effects of Volcanic Activity on Climate
Volcanic activity, such as the 1991 eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines, can temporarily offset recent global warming trends. Volcanoes spew vast quantities of particles and gases into the atmosphere, including sulfur dioxide (SO 2) that combines with water to form tiny supercooled droplets. The droplets create a long-lasting global haze that reflects and scatters sunlight, reducing energy from the Sun and preventing its rays from heating the Earth, thereby causing the planet to cool.
This also occurred in 1982, when the El Chichon volcano in Mexico depressed global temperatures for about four years. NASA reported that satellite sensors measured the SO 2 cloud from Mount Pinatubo at 15 million tons, about twice the size of the one emitted by El Chichon.
NASA found that the haze of sulfur from the eruption reflected enough sunlight to cool the Earth by about 1 degree Fahrenheit, as was predicted by computer models.
In 1815 a major eruption of the Tambora volcano in Indonesia produced serious weather-related disruptions, such as crop-killing summer frosts in the United States and Canada. It became known as the "year without a summer." On the other hand, for several years following the Tambora eruption people around the world commented about the beautiful sunsets, which were caused by the suspension of volcano-related particulate matter in the atmosphere.
The Effects of Clouds on Climate
Clouds may hold a key to understanding climate change. Although we see clouds virtually every day, surprisingly little is known about them—where they occur, their role in energy and water transfer, and their ability to reflect solar heat. Earth's climate maintains a balance between the energy that reaches Earth from the Sun and the energy that radiates back from Earth into space. Scientists refer to this as Earth's "radiation budget." The components of Earth's system are the planet's surface, atmosphere, and clouds.
Different parts of Earth have different capacities to reflect solar energy. Oceans and rain forests reflect only a small portion of the Sun's energy. Deserts and clouds, on the other hand, reflect a large portion of solar energy. A cloud reflects more radiation back into space than the surface would in the absence of clouds. An increase in cloudiness can also act like the panels on a greenhouse roof.
NASA's Earth Science Enterprise is a satellite-based program that includes numerous scientific studies of clouds. These studies have revealed that:
The effect of clouds on climate depends on the balance between the incoming solar radiation and the absorption of Earth's outgoing radiation.
Low clouds have a cooling effect because they are optically thicker and reflect much of the incoming solar radiation out to space.
High thin cirrus clouds have a warming effect because they transmit most of the incoming solar radiation while also trapping some of Earth's radiation and radiating it back to the surface.
Deep convective clouds have neither a warming nor a cooling effect because their reflective and absorptive abilities cancel one another.
Another Possible Climate Culprit—Solar Cycles
Scientists have known for centuries that the Sun goes through cycles; it has seasons, storms, and rhythms of activity with sunspots and flares appearing in cycles of roughly 11 years. Some scientists contend that these factors play a role in climate change on Earth. Some research, though sketchy and controversial, suggests that the Sun's variability could account for some, if not all, of global warming to date. The biggest correlation occurred centuries ago—between 1640 and 1720—when sunspot activity fell sharply and Earth cooled about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. (The Sun is brighter when sunspots appear and dimmer when they disappear.)
The Effects of the Oceans on Climate
Oceans have a profound effect on climate, because of their huge capacity to store heat and because they can moderate levels of atmospheric gases that regulate global temperatures. Covering more than 70 percent of Earth and holding 97 percent of the water on the planet's surface, oceans function as huge reservoirs of heat. Ocean currents transport this stored heat and dissolved gases so that different areas of the world serve as either sources or sinks (repositories) for these components. While scientists know a great deal about oceanic and air circulation, they are less certain about the ocean's ability to store additional CO 2 or about how much heat it will absorb.
The top eight feet of the oceans hold as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere. As ocean waters circulate globally, heat is transferred from low altitudes to high altitudes, from north to south, and vertically from surface to deep oceans and back. But how is this heat apportioned? If heat is able to circulate through the entire oceanic depth range, the process could take centuries and the world's oceans could serve to buffer or delay global warming. Researchers are working to determine that possibility, but it remains one of many unanswered questions.
The Effects of El Niño and La Niña on Climate
For centuries fishermen in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America have known about the phenomenon called El Niño. Every three to five years, during December and January, fish in those waters virtually vanish, bringing fishing to a standstill. Fishermen gave this occurrence the name "El Niño," which means "the Child," because it occurs around the celebration of the birth of Jesus, the Christ child. Although originating in the Pacific, the effects of El Niño are felt around the world. Computers, satellites, and improved data gathering have found that the El Niño phenomenon has been responsible for drastic climate change.
An El Niño occurs because of interactions between atmospheric winds and sea surfaces. In normal years, trade winds blow from east to west across the eastern Pacific. They drag the surface waters westward across the ocean, causing deeper, cold waters to rise to the surface. This upwelling of deep ocean waters carries nutrients from the bottom of the ocean that feed fish populations in the upper waters.
In an El Niño the westward movement of waters weakens, causing the upwelling of deep waters to cease. The resulting warming of the ocean waters further weakens trade winds and strengthens El Niño. Without upwelling, the nutrient content of deep waters is diminished, which in turn causes the depletion of fish populations. The warm waters that normally lie in the western waters of the Pacific shift eastward. This turbulence creates eastward weather conditions, in which towering cumulus clouds reach high into the atmosphere with strong
vertical forces and the weakening of normal east-to-west trade winds. An El Niño is the warm phase of a phenomenon known as ENSO (El Niño/ Southern Oscillation ), which can also include a cold phase known as a La Niña.
The worldwide effects of El Niño can include torrential rains, tornadoes, hurricanes, mud slides, flash flooding, beach and cliff erosion, sewage spills, drought, increased snowfall, and disruption in the marine food chain. Such weather events often affect regional energy and economic markets. The El Niño of 1982–83 is estimated to have caused $13.6 billion in damage and killed 2,000 people around the world. In 1997 and 1998 El Niño–related storms in California caused more than 9,000 people to seek federal disaster assistance for property losses. An estimated $3.6 million in aid was distributed to approximately 1,689 people. The American Fisheries Society estimated that 1990s storms were the most devastating for marine life in more than a century.
POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF A WARMING CLIMATE
Rising Sea Level
Some observers compare global warming to nuclear war in its potential to disrupt human and environmental systems. While some sources dispute the occurrence of human-induced climate change, if temperature increases of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius (35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit) were to take place, substantial changes would occur on Earth's surface. If average temperatures rise this much by 2030, the global sea level could rise 20 to 140 centimeters (8 to 56 inches). The Climate Institute in Washington, D.C., forecasts a further rise of 26 inches by 2100. This rise would be caused by the expansion of seawater as it is warmed, along with melting glaciers and ice caps.
More than half the population of the United States lives within 50 miles of a coastline. A rising sea level would narrow or destroy beaches, flood wetland areas, and either submerge or force costly fortification of shoreline property. Figure 2.5 shows areas along the Southeast coast that could be vulnerable to rising sea levels because they lie at low elevations.
Higher water levels would increase storm damage and many coastal cities worldwide would be flooded. Some islands, such as the Philippines, have already seen encroachment. Residents of the Maldives, islands which lie on average three feet above sea level in the Indian Ocean, are already erecting artificial defenses, such as breakwaters made of concrete, to fend off rising seas.
Some 70 million people in low-lying areas of Bangladesh could be displaced by a one-meter (39.4 inches) rise. Such a rise would also threaten Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya in Japan, as well as coastal China and the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. The rising waters would also intrude on inland rivers, threatening fresh water supplies and increasing the salt content of groundwater as the sea encroaches on freshwater aquifers (naturally occurring underground water reservoirs). Much of the increased rainfall would come not in the steady, gentle rains favored by farmers, but from heavy storms and flooding.
Increased Heat
Warmer temperatures may also increase the evaporation rate, thereby increasing atmospheric water vapor and cloud cover, which in turn may affect regional rainfall patterns. A warmer climate would likely shift the rain belt of the middle latitudes toward the poles as water-laden air of the tropics travels further toward the poles before the moisture condenses as precipitation. This would shift patterns of rainfall around the world. Wetter, more violent weather is projected for some regions. Forests, which are adapted to a narrow temperature and moisture range, would particularly be threatened by climate shifts.
The opposite problem—too little water—could worsen in arid areas such as the Middle East and parts of Africa. Some experts have suggested that the greenhouse effect and global warming are mild terms for a coming era that may be marked by heat waves that may make some regions virtually uninhabitable. Frequent droughts could plague North America and Asia, imperiling food production, as agriculture is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Most experts believe Africa will be the most vulnerable to climate change because its economy depends largely on rain-fed agriculture, and many farmers are too poor and ill equipped to adapt. Australia and Latin America could also be subject to severe drought.
NASA has begun using computer calculations in an attempt to predict the effects of global warming on some of the major cities in the United States.
The Effect of Increased Temperatures on Humans
Extra heat alone would be enough to kill some people. Some deaths would occur directly from heat-induced strokes and heart attacks. Air quality also deteriorates as temperatures rise. Hot, stagnant air contributes to the formation of atmospheric ozone, the main component of smog, which damages human lungs. Poor air quality can also aggravate asthma and other respiratory diseases. Increasing ultraviolet rays can increase the incidence of skin cancers, diminish the function of the human immune system, and cause eye problems such as cataracts. Higher temperatures and added rainfall could create ideal conditions for the spread of a host of infectious diseases by insects, including mosquito-borne malaria, dengue fever, and encephalitis.
Decreasing Biological Diversity
Biological diversity is also predicted to suffer from global warming. Loss of forests, tundra (arctic plains), and
wetlands could irrevocably damage ecosystems. Some species that live in precise, narrow bands of temperature and humidity may find their habitats wiped out altogether. Rising seas would cover coastal mangrove swamps, causing the loss of many species, including the Bengal tiger. Plants and animals of the far north, like the polar bear and the walrus, would die out for lack of an acceptably cold environment. Many species cannot migrate rapidly enough to cope with climate change at the projected rate. Opportunistic species, such as weeds, often out-compete trees and other plants more valued by humans. Pests, such as certain insects, may survive where other species cannot.
The U.S. Forest Service believes that eastern hemlock, yellow birch, beech, and sugar maple forests would gradually shift their ranges northward by 300 to 600 miles but would be severely limited by the warming and largely die out, along with the wildlife they shelter. Studies by World Wildlife Fund International report that more than half the world's parks and reserves could be threatened by climate change. These include the Florida Everglades, Yellowstone National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains, and Redwood National Park in California. The EPA warned in 1988: "If current trends continue, it is likely that climate may change too quickly for many natural systems to adapt."
SOME POSSIBLE POSITIVE EFFECTS.
There are several possible positive consequences of global warming. Agriculture in the northern United States and southern Canada, on the West Coast, and in interior parts of the West could benefit, as could the evergreen forests of the West Coast. Milder winters could reduce the number of cold-weather deaths, as well as the cost of snow clearance and heating. Northern waters could remain open longer for navigation, and the Arctic Ocean might become ice-free, opening a new trade route between Europe and Asia.
GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS
The science of global atmospheric change is still in its infancy. Most of our images of the world's environmental future must come from computer and mathematical models. The most highly developed tools now available to project climatic changes are complex computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). Even these models are crude, imperfect representations of the real world and of the future world. They cannot indicate where changes will be the worst. Nor can they accurately calculate the heat reflected by clouds or absorbed by the ocean. As a result, scientists disagree over whether the forecasts of global warming are reliable.
Although computer models have become more accurate over the years, important uncertainties limit their predictive abilities. Even the most powerful computers are limited in their ability to store and analyze the vast quantity of data required to accurately simulate the global climate. Modelers have tried to overcome these limitations by introducing assumptions into their models that deliberately oversimplify some operations to free the GCMs' capacity for more critical operations. For example, modelers
have assumed that the ocean was not warmed by emissions of greenhouse gases before 1985. Although this assumption increases GCM capacity, it increases the uncertainty of the computer's predictions because the ocean will reach its capacity to absorb emissions sooner. Scientists do not know, however, how much or by how long the predictions are distorted because of this error.
In Global Deception: The Exaggeration of the Global Warming Threat (Washington, DC: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, 1997), Patrick J. Michaels claims that the global warming crisis has been greatly overstated. He notes that newer GCMs, which are more physically realistic than the older models, tend to forecast less warming rather than more.
GREENHOUSE GASES
The Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) reported that CO 2 accounted for 83 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2001. (See Figure 2.6.) Methane (CH 4) was second with 9 percent of the total, followed by nitrous oxide (N 2 O) with 6 percent and other greenhouse gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), with 2 percent.
Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a gas that is a naturally occurring component of Earth's atmosphere. It is also produced by a variety of human and animal sources. These factors are a part of the carbon cycle. (See Figure 2.7.) As shown in Figure 2.6, CO 2 was the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases emitted from 1990 to 2001.
The burning of fossil fuels by industry and motor vehicles is, by far, the leading source of CO 2 in the atmosphere, accounting for 97 percent of the nation's emission of greenhouse gases in 2001. (See Table 2.2.) As populations and economies expand, they use ever-greater amounts of fossil fuels.
The DOE released its International Energy Annual 2001 in March 2003. The report presents data collected on CO 2 emissions related to fossil fuel use around the world. The United States was responsible for the largest portion (23 percent) of such emissions in 2001, followed by Western Europe (16 percent) and China (13 percent). (See Figure 2.8.) The western European countries responsible for most of that region's CO 2 emissions were Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France.
The DOE predicts that CO 2 emissions from developing countries could actually surpass those from industrialized countries before 2020. (See Figure 2.9.) This trend is attributed to increased use of coal in developing countries, particularly China and India, while developed countries rely increasingly on natural gas.
THE ROLE OF THE FORESTS AS CARBON SINKS.
Forests act as sinks, or repositories, absorbing and storing carbon. Trees naturally absorb and neutralize CO 2, although scientists do not agree on the extent to which forests can soak up excess amounts. The increasing levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere might conceivably be tolerated in Earth's normal CO 2 cycle if not for the additional complicating factor of deforestation. The burning of the Amazon rain forests and other forests has had a twofold effect: the immediate release of large amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere from the fires, and the loss of trees to neutralize the CO 2 in the atmosphere. (See Figure 2.10.)
THE ROLE OF THE OCEANS AS CARBON SINKS.
The oceans are, by far, the largest reservoir of carbon in the carbon cycle. The oceans hold approximately 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere and 20 times more than the terrestrial reservoir (land). Oceanographers and ecologists disagree over the carbon cycle–climate connection and over the ocean's capacity to absorb CO 2. Some scientists believe that the oceans can absorb one to two billion tons of CO 2 a year, about the amount the world emitted in 1950. Until scientists can more accurately determine how much CO 2 can be buffered by ocean processes, the extent and speed of disruption in the carbon supply remains unclear.
Methane
Methane (CH 4) is an important component of greenhouse emissions, second only to CO 2. (See Figure 2.6.) While there is less methane in the atmosphere, scientists
estimate that it may be 21 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO 2. Over the past two centuries, methane's concentration in the atmosphere has more than doubled and scientists generally attribute those increases to human sources, such as landfills, natural gas systems, agricultural activities, coal mining, and wastewater treatment. However, according to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. emissions of methane from energy and waste management sources actually declined between 1990 and 2002, while agricultural emissions increased over the same time period. (See Figure 2.11.) The increase is blamed on domestic animals and the decomposition of their waste, which releases methane. Growing markets for beef and milk products are driving a booming livestock business.
Nitrous Oxide
Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is formed by natural biological sources and by a number of human activities. Although N 2 O makes up a much smaller portion of greenhouse gases than CO 2, it is much more (perhaps 310 times more) powerful than CO 2 at trapping heat. Figure 2.12 shows that agriculture is and has been the major source of N 2 O emissions in the United States, followed by energy and industrial sources. Specific agricultural sources of N 2 O emissions are shown in Figure 2.13.
OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES
Other primary greenhouse gases are what the DOE calls "engineered gases." These are gases specially designed for modern industrial and commercial purposes. They include hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).
HFCs are chemicals that contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. They are popular substitutes in industrial applications for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs are commonly used in cooling equipment, fire extinguishers, as propellants, and for other uses. They are blamed for depletion of the ozone layer in the stratosphere, which shields the Earth from deadly ultraviolet radiation.
PFCs are a class of chemicals containing fluorine and carbon. They also are increasingly used by industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs. SF6 is a colorless, odorless gas commonly used as an insulating medium in electrical equipment and as an etchant (an etching agent) in the semiconductor industry.
Although emissions of these chemicals are very small in comparison to other greenhouse gases, they are of particular concern because of their long life in the atmosphere. PFCs and SF6 have atmospheric lifetimes of thousands of years and are actually far more potent greenhouse gases than CO 2 per unit of molecular weight.
THE INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE—A SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS?
Global warming was only acknowledged as an international problem at the end of the twentieth century. At the world's first ecological summit, the 1972 Stockholm Conference, climate change was not even listed among the threats to society.
Climate-change science has been developing rapidly, leading observers to recognize the complexity of the issues. In order to understand the issue of climate change and any possible global warming, scientists worldwide gathered together in 1990 to exchange information. They formed the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is sponsored jointly by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization .
The panel's mission was to advise the parties to the 1992 Global Warming Treaty. It received the input of nearly 400 of the world's climate experts from 25 nations.
The IPCC report was the most comprehensive summary of climate-change science to date. With regard to various statements about climate change, the scientists responded based on how sure they were of global warming: "virtually certain" (nearly unanimous agreement and no credible alternative), "very probable" (roughly a 90 percent likelihood of occurring), "probable" (a two out of three chance of happening), and "uncertain" (evidence does not support). The outcome indicated an international consensus on three basic statements related to global warming: that greenhouse gases do produce climate change, that there is a natural greenhouse effect, and that emissions resulting from human activities are contributing to the proliferation and effects of greenhouse gases.
A Landmark Judgment—The 1995 IPCC Report
In 1995 the IPCC reassessed the state of knowledge about climate change. The panel reaffirmed its earlier conclusions and updated its forecasts, predicting that, if no further action is taken to curb emissions of greenhouse gases, temperatures will increase 1.44 degrees to 6.30 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. The panel concluded that the evidence suggested a human influence on global climate.
The cautiously worded statement was a compromise following intense discussions. Nonetheless, it was a landmark conclusion because the panel, until then, had always said that global warming and climate changes could have been the result of natural variability. Despite acrimonious debate and challenges to the report, the conclusions have largely held up to scientific scrutiny.
The 2001 Update
The IPCC issued its third assessment report in 2001. It actually comprises four reports: Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Climate Change 2001: Mitigation, and Climate Change 2001: The Synthesis Report. The IPCC's assessment covered the adaptability and vulnerability of North America to climate change impacts likely to occur from global warming. Among the suggested possible effects of global warming are:
Expansion of some diseases in North America
In coastal areas, increased erosion, flooding, and loss of wetlands
Risk to "unique natural ecosystems"
Changes in seasonal snowmelts, which would have effects on water users and aquatic ecosystems
Some initial benefits for agriculture, but those benefits would decline over time and possibly "become a net loss"
Next IPCC Update Due in 2007
The IPCC plans to publish its fourth major assessment report in 2007. At meetings held in Paris during 2003 seven themes were selected for focus in the report:
risk and uncertainty
regional integration
water
key vulnerabilities
adaptation and mitigation
sustainable development
technology
SOME RESEARCHERS STILL QUESTION THE THEORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE
In the Swiss Review of World Affairs (July 1994), Dr. Richard Lindzen, professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, observed that a solid scientific foundation is lacking from claims that global warming is imminent. He believes that Earth's climate depends on more than the CO 2 content. Instead, Earth cools by atmospheric movements upward and poleward rather than only by radiation; and climate changes since 1850 are indistinguishable from natural variability. He further claims that no large-scale model includes all the known major factors in the water vapor cycle. In 1997 Dr. Lindzen added that the natural system has built-in resilience and that the observed changes are insignificant and not urgent.
In October 2003 Anders Sivertsson, Kjell Aleklett, and Colin Campbell, researchers from the University of Uppsala in Sweden, disputed the IPCC's predictions of extreme temperature change due to CO 2 emissions. According to Andy Coghlan in his article "'Too Little' Oil for Global Warming," in the journal New Scientist, the researchers noted that their data show that the world's oil and gas supplies will be depleted long before atmospheric CO 2 concentrations build to sufficient levels to make a major difference in Earth's climate.
Among the claims of critics of global climate warming are:
The increase in the Earth's surface temperature during the past 150 years is less than the best existing climate models can explain. As the models improve, however, they predict less and less warming.
Climate has been known to change dramatically within a relatively short period without any human influence.
Temperature readings already showed increased temperatures before CO 2 levels rose significantly (before 1940).
Natural variations in climate may exceed any human-caused climate change.
Some of the increase in temperatures can be attributed to sunspot activity.
If warming should occur, it will not stress Earth; it may even have benefits, such as for agriculture, and may delay the next ice age.
Reducing emissions will raise energy prices, reduce gross domestic product, and produce job losses.
While clouds are crucial to climate predictions, so little is known about them that computer models cannot produce accurate predictions.
In 2000 a handful of scientists at the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine began a drive to collect the signatures of other scientists on a petition reading in part: "There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects on the natural plant and animal environments of the Earth." As of April 2004 the so-called Petition Project claims to have collected more than 19,500 signatures, including 17,100 from scientists, mostly with advanced degrees.
THE RESPONSE OF THE NATIONS
United States
Many industrialized countries have committed themselves to stabilizing or reducing CO 2 emissions. President George H. W. Bush's administration (1989–1993) opposed precise deadlines for CO 2 limits, arguing that the extent of the problem was too uncertain to justify painful economic measures. However, in 1989 the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established and later authorized by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990.
When President Bill Clinton took office in 1993, he joined the European Community in calling for overall emissions to be stabilized at 1990 levels by 2000, but this goal was not met. In October 1993 the United States, under the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, released The Climate Change Action Plan detailing the nation's response to climate change.
The plan included a set of measures by both government and the private sector to lay a foundation for the nation's participation in world response to the climate challenge.
The measures called for under the Action Plan would reduce emissions for all greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000. However, since the time the projections were prepared and the Action Plan was published, the economy grew at a more robust rate than anticipated, which led to increased emissions. Furthermore, the U.S. Congress did not provide full funding for the actions contained in the plan.
At the time, the U.S. global warming program was coordinated through the Committee on Earth and Environmental Science within the Office of Science and Technology Policy of the White House. Some eighteen federal agencies were represented in the multiyear, multibillion-dollar research program, nine of which received the bulk of funding. NASA received 66 percent, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) was provided 10 percent. Rounding out the top nine were the Smithsonian Institution and a half dozen federal agencies, including the EPA and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, and the Interior.
Even though the United States had a comprehensive global warming program in place, Congress was reluctant to take steps to reduce emissions. However, the Clinton administration implemented some policies that did not require congressional approval. In 1999 President Clinton made a number of executive orders and began several new initiatives. These included the Climate Change Technology initiative, a five-year, $6.3 billion program of tax incentives and investments focusing on improving energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; the Wind Powering America initiative, seeking to supply 5 percent of the nation's electricity through wind technology by 2020; and a Brightfields initiative, aimed at using former industrial sites contaminated with toxic waste for producing pollution-free solar energy. Executive Order 13134 aimed at coordinating federal efforts to develop technology to grow the economy while simultaneously solving some environmental problems, such as converting crops, trees, and other "biomass" into fuels, power, and products. Executive Order 13123 required all federal government agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2010. The federal government was the largest energy consumer in the nation, and the Clinton administration wanted it to serve as an example to the nation's businesses and consumers, who ultimately could reap benefits from energy improvements. President Clinton also established the U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative to study areas of uncertainty about global climate change science and identify priorities for public investments.
After President George W. Bush took office in 2001 he established a new cabinet-level management structure
to oversee government investments in climate change science and technology. Both the U.S. Climate Change Research Initiative and the USGCRP were placed under the oversight of the interagency Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), which reports integrated research sponsored by thirteen federal agencies. The CCSP is overseen by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Office of Management and Budget.
In June 2002 the George W. Bush administration released the third National Communication of the United States of America under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The U.S. Climate Action Report — 2002 acknowledges that greenhouse gases resulting from human activities are accumulating in the atmosphere and that they are causing air and ocean temperatures to increase. However, it does not rule out the still unknown role of natural variability in global warming. In addition,
the report reiterates that the administration plans to reduce the nation's greenhouse gas intensity by 18 percent over the following decade through a combination of existing regulations and voluntary, incentive-based measures. In November of that year the CCSP publication Our Changing Planet was issued as a supplement to the President's 2003 fiscal year budget. According to this document the administration's overall approach to climate change is "to achieve both environmental protection and a healthy economy, based on the best possible information for action."
In July 2003 the CCSP published two major reports: Strategic Plan for the U.S. Climate Change Science Program and The U.S. Climate Change Science Program: Vision for the Program and Highlights of the Scientific Strategic Plan. Together these documents outline the approach the CCSP plans to take to achieve its five main scientific goals:
Improve knowledge of the Earth's past and present climate and environment, including its natural variability, and improve understanding of the causes of observed variability and change
Improve quantification of the forces bringing about changes in the Earth's climate and related systems
Reduce uncertainty in projections of how the Earth's climate and related systems may change in the future
Understand the sensitivity and adaptability of different natural and managed ecosystems and human systems to climate and related global changes
Explore the uses and identify the limits of evolving knowledge to manage risks and opportunities related to climate variability and change
The CCSP illustrates that climate change is a complex issue and involves a wide range of natural and anthropogenic (human-related) factors as shown in Figure 2.14.
Other Nations
Saudi Arabia and several other oil producing nations have resisted the setting of new targets for emissions because they fear this will reduce the demand for their oil. On the other hand, many environmentalists believe that reducing pollution depends on increasing energy efficiency and gradually switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy, an idea most industrialized countries have been slow to embrace.
China's ongoing economic revolution may lead that nation to become the world's largest contributor to global warming. China is burning increasing amounts of coal and is expected to become the single greatest creator of greenhouse gases in the coming decades. China's leaders indicate that they are well aware that coal burning causes pollution, but the Chinese government has made it clear that it will not sacrifice development for the environment. Chinese leaders argue that it is unfair to impose constraints on China or developing nations when Western countries have been willfully polluting the environment for more than a century, pointing out that China has only recently become a significant offender. Critics of China's argument note that China itself would be harmed by global warming, which could dry up crops, shrink water supplies, and cause the flooding of major coastal cities.
In 1992 representatives of thirty-seven island nations, which make up the Alliance of Small Island States, drafted an agreement to present to the Earth Summit. These nations, including Cyprus and Malta (in the Mediterranean) and the Caribbean islands, fear their existence is threatened by the rising sea level. They claim they will be the first victims of global warming, becoming a whole new category of environmental refugees. Tourist beaches are shrinking, dikes are being erected to protect reclaimed land, and some islands have already been evacuated. Since they are so vulnerable, these nations feel an urgency not felt by the Northern industrial countries and the larger developing nations. Nonetheless, larger countries may have similar incentives to stabilize sea levels. A three-foot rise in ocean levels would render an estimated 72 million people homeless in China, 11 million in Bangladesh, and 8 million in Egypt.
A Global Warming Treaty
In 1992, 143 countries approved a UN global warming treaty in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that committed them to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Many environmentalists criticized the treaty as too weak because it did not establish specific targets that governments must meet. The treaty did not include specific targets mainly because then-President George H. W. Bush, representing the United States, refused to accept them. President Clinton signed the treaty in 1994, although adherence to the environmental measures has largely been disappointing even among those nations that originally signed.
Supporters of a global warming strategy advocate limiting the emissions of the four main greenhouse gases and recommend a gradual transition away from fossil fuels, which currently provide about three-quarters of the world's energy.
In 1995, 120 parties to the global warming treaty met in Berlin in what is known as the Berlin Mandate to determine the success of existing treaties and to embark on discussions of emissions after 2000. Differences persisted along North-South lines, with developing countries making essentially a moral argument for requiring more of the richer nations. They pointed out that the richer nations are responsible for most of the pollution. The Berlin talks
essentially failed to endorse binding timetables for reductions in greenhouse gases.
The Kyoto Protocol —Rich versus Poor Countries
In December 1997 delegates from 166 countries met in Kyoto, Japan, at the UN Climate Change Conference to negotiate actions to reduce global warming. The task was more complicated and difficult than was envisioned in 1995, when parties to the 1992 Rio de Janeiro treaty on climate change decided that stronger action was needed. What was originally envisioned as a matter of deciding on a reduction target and a timetable for industrialized countries once again broadened into a contentious debate between developed and developing countries as to the proper role of each.
Some developed nations, including the United States, wanted to require all countries to reduce their emissions. However, developing countries felt the industrialized nations had caused, and were still causing, most global warming and therefore should bear the brunt of economic sacrifices to clean up the environment. Even within the industrialized community, the European Union criticized the United States for lagging behind in reducing emissions, as it had previously pledged.
Different targets for different countries, tailored to their economic and social circumstances, emerged as a possible way to get around the impasse between nations. The final compromise, signed by the parties, was for the industrialized nations to cut emissions by an average of 5.2 percent between 2008 and 2012. The treaty also set up an emission trading system that would allow countries that exceed their pollution limits to purchase on an open market "credits" from countries that pollute less. This provision was viewed as necessary to U.S. congressional approval. The developing nations feared that such a trading system would allow rich countries to buy their way

into compliance rather than make unpopular emissions cuts. Enforcement mechanisms were not agreed to, nor did developing nations commit to binding participation.
The U.S. Congress never ratified the treaty. In March 2001 President George W. Bush indicated that the United States would pull out of the treaty because it would cost an estimated $400 billion and 4.9 million jobs to comply. The treaty was ratified by the European Union and Japan in June 2002.
PUBLIC OPINION ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING
In March 2004 the Gallup Organization conducted its annual poll on topics related to the environment. Participants were asked several questions about global warming and the Kyoto Protocol.
As shown in Table 2.3 more than a quarter of those asked admitted they did not have a good understanding of the global warming issue. Half of those asked said they understood the issue fairly well. Another 18 percent felt they had a very good understanding about the issue. In 1992, 22 percent of people responded that they did not understand the issue at all, but this had dropped to 6 percent in 2004.
Table 2.4 shows how poll participants view the timeliness of global warming. Just over half (51 percent) of those asked in 2004 believe that global warming has already begun, while 17 percent feel that global warming will occur within the next few years or within their lifetimes. Another 18 percent consider global warming a problem for the distant future, and 11 percent believe that it will never happen at all. This breakdown of opinions on the subject has remained fairly constant through the years.
Concern about global warming has wavered over the years but is generally lower in 2004 than in previous years. (See Table 2.5). In a poll from March 2004, 26 percent of respondents expressed a great deal of concern about global warming and 25 percent expressed a fair amount of concern. Together these opinions represent just over half of all the people polled. In 1989 nearly two-thirds of those asked felt a great deal or fair amount of concern about this issue. In 2000 nearly three-quarters did. Overall concern does appear to be on a downward trend. These results coincide with the data presented in Table 2.6. Poll participants were asked to rate their views about the seriousness of global warming based on the information they have seen in the media. In 2004 more people (38 percent) considered the seriousness to be exaggerated by the media rather than reported correctly (25 percent) or underestimated (33 percent).
In 2004 Gallup asked people about the response of the Bush administration to global warming. Pollsters pointed out that a group of "prominent" scientists have criticized the administration's approach to dealing with global warming, claiming that scientific evidence has been ignored and distorted. Only 8 percent of the poll respondents indicated they had heard a great deal about this criticism. Another 26 percent had heard a moderate amount of information about it. The largest fraction (40 percent) claimed they knew very little about the criticism and 26 percent knew nothing at all about it. When asked which side they tended to believe in this dispute (the Bush administration or the scientists) a majority (59 percent) sided with the scientists, while 32 percent sided with the Bush administration.
Despite the administration's well-publicized opposition to the Kyoto treaty, Gallup's 2004 poll shows that more people support the treaty than oppose it. Figure 2.15 illustrates that 42 percent of poll respondents indicated that the United States should agree to abide by the provisions of the treaty, compared to 22 percent who disagreed. A sizable percentage of those asked (36 percent) had no opinion on the matter.
People participating in Gallup's 2003 environment poll were asked whether increases in the Earth's temperature over the last century were due more to natural causes or to pollution associated with human activities. As shown in Figure 2.16, human activities received nearly twice the blame than did natural causes. This breakdown is identical to that reported by Gallup when the same question was asked in 2001.

Global Warming and the Greenhouse Effect
Hello, do you know who I am? I am the Earth, yes this very planet and I would like to talk to you about a couple of things which worry me and should upset you, too.
Everyone talks about what the weather’s like today and the next day. Will today be colder than yesterday, will it rain tomorrow… And that’s normal as the weather plays a really important role in our lives. It influences us on what we are going to wear to school for example, or if we will be able to play outside and it also influences all living things on our planet as well as the plants.
If you were to join me in an elevator, do you know what I would tell you? That I am hot, very very hot. This is because of climate change, which is something that human beings have a big responsibility for.
Every time you turn on the light, the computer, the microwave o even shower, you are consuming energy. This energy is produced, largely, by burning gases, coal, or petroleum, which are known as fossil fuels. When burning them you are sending off tons and tons and tons of gases into my atmosphere.
These gases remain in the atmosphere forming a type of ugly, dirty roof which withholds heat. This is called the “greenhouse effect” because a Greenhouses is where one can cultivate plants, and the roof does not allow heat to escape, and I am getting hotter and hotter.
If the rise in temperature continues, there will be great consequences for me and all living things. It will cause huge storms and terrible flooding , it will melt the ice in the poles making the sea level rise flooding cities on the coast, there would be more forest fires as well as droughts, turning areas once full of life into deserts. And it will kill off entire animal and plant species.
But…can you do something to stop climate change? Of course you can. Use clean energy found in the sun and wind, clean energy which doesn’t produce such harmful contaminating gases.
Each one of you can help with little changes, by walking, biking or taking public transport instead of using a car. And by turning off the lights, the TV or computer when you have finished with it. And don’t forget recycling, taking care and respecting all that is around you, animals, forests, rivers, seas…
By making intelligent decisions and working all together we can do it. Because, as you know… Children can make a WORLD of difference!

BACKGROUND ON CLIMATE CHANGE - The TRUE Facts on Climate Change
The TRUE Facts on Climate Change
BACKGROUND ON CLIMATE CHANGE
In the past couple decades increasing attention has been placed on the term "global warming."  The term itself has many different definitions and implications on nearly every ecosystem and species on the planet.  Global warming is not only impacting global temperatures.  Its influences are seen with soil nutrient levels, precipitation, seal levels, and polar ice cap thickness [5] .  Climate change via global warming has been attributed to the increased levels of greenhouse gases most notably CO2.
"The period of concern extends from the start of the industrial revolution when [CO2] buildup began to the end of the 21st century, the outer limit of current models used to predict future trends.  CO2... is a principal greenhouse gas whose concentration has increased some 25% over that period."
So what exactly is the greenhouse effect? Figure 1 accurately depicts the actions at work:
Greenhouse Effect
Radiation from the sun is the only major source of heat on Earth.  70% of the incident radiation enters the "atmosphere and its constituents and the earth's geosphere, cryosphere, and oceans [5] ."  After the radiation enters it is absorbed and re-radiated at higher energy levels by atmospheric particles.  "It is that energy which provides the energy intrinsic to the globe's climate and presumably is involved in global climate change.  After earth absorptioin, only 5% or so radiated from the surface is transmitted directly to space; most is reabsorbed and re-radiated in all directions before finally being transmitted beyond the planet's confines [5] ."  For earth's climate to go unchanged, the amount of heat entering must be equal to the heat exiting.  This simple thermodynamic process is out of equilibrium with increased levels of atmospheric particles that continue to absorb and readmit radiation without letting energy escape into space.  A greenhouse is known as a confined building that allows the sun's energy to enter but whose glass keeps the heat energy in.  The way atmospheric molecules are preventing radiative energy to escape is where the greenhouse analogy originates.
There are six major gas molecules that have been considered as causing this greenhouse effect.  Water vapor (H20), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N20), methane (CHa), ozone (O3), a group of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the most commonly referred to greenhouse gases.  The most problematic of all these is CO2.  The gas is never truly removed, but recycled through "continuously through several storage sites including the deep oceans (the largest by an order of magnitude) and terra firma reservoirs [5] ."  When fossil fuels are burned, stored carbon from the past thousands of years is released back into the atmosphere.  The release to storage cycle is currently out of equilibrium and resulting in a build up of the gas in the atmosphere.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got some information from these search results. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, there's a page from Dudley.gov.uk that explains the basics of climate change and the greenhouse effect. It says that the greenhouse effect is natural and necessary for life on Earth, but human activities are enhancing it, leading to more heat being trapped in the atmosphere. The main human activities mentioned are burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, and deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide.

Then, there's a journal article from OSTI.GOV that discusses the physical basis of climate change due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. It mentions that the concentration of greenhouse gases is increasing, and this could lead to a warming of about 1-2 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years. It also cites that there are potential climatic effects and ways to detect changes in climate.

Another source is from Encyclopedia.com, which provides a more detailed history of the concept of the greenhouse effect and its relation to climate change. It talks about how the idea was first proposed in the 19th century and how it gained prominence in the 20th century with evidence showing increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

The encyclopedia entry also discusses the natural greenhouse effect and distinguishes it from the enhanced, or anthropogenic, greenhouse effect caused by human activities. It mentions that without the natural greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold to support life, but the enhanced effect could lead to undesirable climate changes.

There's also information about how scientists have been measuring temperature changes and how the 20th century was the warmest in the past 1000 years, based on proxy data like tree rings and ice cores. There's some debate about the reliability of these proxy measurements, but overall, there's a consensus that the Earth is warming.

The entry also discusses the increase in greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and others, and how their concentrations have risen due to human activities. It provides tables showing the atmospheric concentrations and rates of change for these gases.

It's interesting to see that while CO2 is the most abundant greenhouse gas, methane and nitrous oxide are much more potent in terms of their heat-trapping ability. For example, methane is said to be 21 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2, and nitrous oxide is 310 times more effective.

The encyclopedia also mentions the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and their assessments. The IPCC reports suggest that there's a human influence on global climate change, and they predict temperature increases of 1.44 to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 if no action is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

However, there are dissenting voices. Some scientists question the extent to which human activities are causing climate change and argue that natural variability could be a significant factor. There's also mention of the "Petition Project," where thousands of scientists have signed a petition questioning the evidence for catastrophic global warming.

Looking back at the Dudley.gov.uk page, it mentions that climate change isn't just about warming; it can also lead to changes in precipitation patterns, more extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. These are all interconnected and can have significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies.

The Encyclopedia.com entry also discusses the potential positive effects of global warming, such as milder winters and benefits to agriculture in some regions, but overall, the negative impacts are expected to outweigh the positives.

There's a lot of data presented, including graphs showing increasing CO2 levels over time and trends in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. It's clear that emissions have been rising, especially from sources like electricity generation and transportation.

I think it's important to understand that while greenhouse gases are essential for maintaining Earth's temperature, the enhancement of their concentrations due to human activities is leading to changes in the climate that could have detrimental effects.

One thing that stands out is the role of carbon sinks, like forests and oceans, which absorb CO2. The encyclopedia mentions that forests are being lost due to deforestation, which not only reduces the absorption of CO2 but also releases more CO2 when the trees are burned or decompose.

Similarly, the oceans absorb a significant amount of CO2, but this can lead to ocean acidification, which affects marine life. So, there are multiple dimensions to this issue.

The entry also discusses the potential impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels threatening coastal areas, more frequent and severe weather events, and shifts in agricultural productivity. These are all areas where further research and understanding are crucial.

There's a section on General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are computer models used to simulate the Earth's climate and predict future changes. However, these models have uncertainties, and there's ongoing research to improve their accuracy.

It's also mentioned that some greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, have shorter lifetimes in the atmosphere compared to CO2, which can stay for centuries. This means that reducing emissions of shorter-lived gases could have quicker impacts on slowing down warming.

Moreover, there are engineered gases like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which are potent greenhouse gases used in various industrial applications. Their emissions are smaller in quantity but have a large global warming potential.

The international response to climate change is also discussed, with mentions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The U.S. position has been volatile, with commitments made and later withdrawn, depending on the administration.

Public opinion seems to be mixed, with a majority expressing concern about global warming but varying degrees of understanding and prioritization of the issue.

Overall, from these sources, it's evident that climate change is a complex issue with significant scientific consensus on the role of human activities in enhancing the greenhouse effect and causing global warming. There are potential serious impacts, and international cooperation is deemed necessary to mitigate these effects.

I think the key points to remember are:

1. The greenhouse effect is natural and necessary for life on Earth, but human activities are enhancing it.

2. Burning fossil fuels and deforestation are the main contributors to the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly CO2.

3. There's a consensus among scientists that the Earth is warming, and human activities are a significant cause.

4. The impacts of climate change include rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, more extreme weather events, and rising sea levels.

5. There are both challenges and opportunities in addressing climate change, and international cooperation is crucial.

I should probably look into more current data, as some of these sources might be a bit outdated. For instance, the Encyclopedia.com entry seems to be from the early 2000s, and there have been more recent IPCC reports and scientific studies since then.

Maybe I can do another search to get more up-to-date information.

What does the IPCC’s latest report mean?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has just released its latest report, which is a comprehensive assessment of the physical science of climate change. Here, we’ve unpacked what it tells us, why it matters, and what this all means for Australia.
What’s the IPCC?
The IPCC is the most authoritative international body on climate science. The IPCC was established in 1988 and is an essential component of the world’s response to climate change. Its Assessment Reports – published every five to eight years – have been a driving force for action, heavily influencing international agreements.
What is the latest report (6AR WGI)?
This latest report from the IPCC is Working Group I’s (WGI) contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (6AR). Working Group I assesses the physical scientific basis of climate change. Among other things it covers humans’ influence on the climate system, extreme weather, and the current and future state of our climate.
The report is years in the making and draws from a new generation of highly advanced climate models and scenarios. It is the work of literally hundreds of scientists from around the world and is put through an extraordinarily rigorous process of review.
What are the main takeaways from this report?
The most important climate science update for almost a decade shows there is a narrow path to avoiding climate catastrophe, but only through immediate, deep and sustained emissions reductions. This may be our final warning.
Climate change is already wreaking havoc around the world, with worse to come. Our decisions this decade will be the difference between a liveable future for today’s young people, and a future that is incompatible with well-functioning human societies.
Every choice and every fraction of a degree of avoided warming matters. The right choices will be measured in lives, livelihoods, species and ecosystems saved. The benefits of stronger action will be realized well within our lifetimes, and even more so for our children and grandchildren.
Summaries with Simon: the latest IPCC Report \\ Climate Council
Watch on
Key points (expanded):
1. The scale and pace at which humans are altering the climate system has almost no precedent
Current atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) are higher than at any time in the last two million years. It is “unequivocal” that this human interference has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.
Human influence has warmed the climate at a rate that is unprecedented in at least the last two thousand years.
2. Climate change and its impacts are accelerating, and more impacts are on the way
Temperatures and sea levels are rising, rainfall patterns are changing, and extreme weather events are becoming more intense and destructive, with deadly consequences.
Having ignored the decades of warnings, we are now seeing these alarming changes unfold at a faster and faster rate. In other words, our climate is not merely changing, the rate of change is now accelerating.
Heatwaves, droughts, floods, heavy downpours and other extreme events are getting worse, driven by the burning of coal, oil and gas.
While immediate action is necessary to avoid truly devastating impacts in future, and we will start to see the benefits of this action in two decades or so, our past inaction and the inertia in the climate system means that some impacts will continue to escalate over longer timeframes.
The possibility of abrupt changes with the potential to massively disrupt human societies, such as ice sheet collapse, sudden changes in ocean circulation, or much higher levels of warming than expected, should compel us to take far stronger action today.
3. Every fraction of a degree matters!
This point cannot be overstated: every tiny bit of avoided warming counts.
The Sixth Assessment Report states:  “With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger.”
Every additional 0.5°C of warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity and frequency of heatwaves, damaging rainfall, and droughts.
4. The most important thing is reducing emissions as much and as fast as possible.
All paths to avoiding truly devastating climate change involve removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. However, these cannot be a substitute for efforts to first reduce emissions to as close to zero as possible.
Australia does not currently have a net zero target, nor has it followed other nations in strengthening its target for 2030. Based on the latest science, and taking into account Australia’s national circumstances, the Climate Council has concluded that Australia should reduce its emissions by 75% below 2005 levels by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2035.
There is no room for any new fossil fuel developments – including gas – if we’re to avoid catastrophic warming.
Why is this report so important?
This report’s release is a key moment in what has become the most important year for international cooperation on climate change since at least 2015 and the negotiation of the Paris Agreement. It is an essential input to international negotiations culminating at COP26, ensuring that governments have the latest and most authoritative science to inform their commitments and actions.
We must recognise that the decisions we make today will resonate for centuries or millennia. Changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia, especially changes in ocean temperature and sea level. Some impacts can no longer be avoided, but strong action today can make things far better than they would otherwise be.
So, what now?
This is a lot of information to take in, and much of it is pretty full on. If you need to, take a minute to process how you’re feeling (and check out our guide on managing stress in uncertain times here ).
The situation is critical, but this report also shows that we can avoid a future of truly catastrophic warming. The world is racing to net zero emissions, and Australia is rapidly being left behind. But Australia is perfectly placed to be part of the solution, and the sooner we act, the more we benefit. Add your name to our people-powered push for urgent climate action this decade.

The new IPCC climate report is hugely important — and here are 6 main takeaways

Earth has warmed 1.09℃ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The report also found that escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth and every facet of the weather.
The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
The IPCC is the climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, and it is the global authority on the state of Earth’s climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment.
Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today — but there is still time to avert the worst damage if humanity chooses to. Here are six takeaways from the report:
1. It’s unequivocal: Humans are warming the planet
For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally — leaving absolutely no room for doubt — humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans.
The IPCC finds Earth’s global surface temperature warmed 1.09℃ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29℃ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1℃ of the increase is due to data improvements.)
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years.
The IPCC recognizes the role of natural changes to the Earth’s climate. However, it finds 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities.
In other words, pretty much all global warming is due to humans.
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years, with the warming also reaching ocean depths below 2,000 meters.
The IPCC says human activities have also affected global precipitation (rain and snow). Since 1950, total global precipitation has increased, but while some regions have become wetter, others have become drier.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over most land areas. This is because the warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture — about seven percent more for each additional degree of temperature — which makes wet seasons and rainfall events wetter.
2. CO2 levels are rising faster than ever
Present-day global concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are higher and rising faster than at any time in at least the past two million years.
The speed at which atmospheric CO2 has increased since the industrial revolution (1750) is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the last 800,000 years and between 4 and 5 times faster than during the last 56 million years.
About 85% of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels.
About 85 percent of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels. The remaining 15 percent are generated from land-use change, such as deforestation and degradation.
Concentrations of other greenhouse gases are not doing any better. Both methane and nitrous oxide, the second- and third- biggest contributors to global warming after CO2, have also increased more quickly. Methane emissions from human activities largely come from livestock and the fossil fuel industry. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the use of nitrogen fertilizer on crops.
3. Extreme weather is on the rise
Hot extremes, heatwaves and heavy rain have also become more frequent and intense across most land regions since 1950, the IPCC confirms.
The report highlights that some recently observed hot extremes, such as the Australian summer of 2012–2013, would have been extremely unlikely without human influence on the climate.
Human influence has also been detected for the first time in compounded extreme events. For example, incidences of heatwaves, droughts and fire weather happening at the same time are now more frequent. These compound events have been seen in Australia, Southern Europe, Northern Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and African tropical forests.
Even if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia.
4. Our oceans are getting hotter, higher and more acidic
Oceans absorb 91 percent of the energy from the increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. This has led to ocean warming and more marine heatwaves, particularly over the past 15 years.
Marine heatwaves cause the mass death of marine life, such as from coral bleaching events. They also cause algal blooms and shifts in the composition of species. Even if the world restricts warming to 1.5-2℃, as is consistent with the Paris Agreement, marine heatwaves will become four times more frequent by the end of the century.
Melting ice sheets and glaciers, along with the expansion of the ocean as it warms, have led to a global mean sea level increase of 0.2 meters between 1901 and 2018. But, importantly, the speed that the sea level is rising is accelerating: 1.3 millimeters per year during 1901-1971, 1.9mm per year during 1971-2006, and 3.7mm per year during 2006-2018.
Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of CO2, has occurred in the overall oceans and is reaching depths beyond 2,000 meters in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic.
5. Many changes are already irreversible
The IPCC says if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia. For example, global warming of 2℃ this century will lead to an average global sea-level rise of between two and six meters over 2,000 years — and much more for higher emission scenarios.
Globally, glaciers have been synchronously retreating since 1950 and are projected to continue to melt for decades after the global temperature is stabilized. Meanwhile, the acidification of the deep ocean will remain for thousands of years after CO2 emissions cease.
Global warming stays below 2°C during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The report does not identify any possible abrupt changes that would lead to an acceleration of global warming during this century — but does not rule out such possibilities.
The prospect of permafrost (frozen soils) in Alaska, Canada, and Russia crossing a tipping point has been widely discussed. The concern is that as frozen ground thaws, large amounts of carbon accumulated over thousands of years from dead plants and animals could be released as they decompose.
The report does not identify any globally significant abrupt change in these regions over this century, based on currently available evidence. However, it projects permafrost areas will release about 66 billion metric tonnes of CO2 for each additional degree of warming, and these emissions are irreversible during this century under all warming scenarios.
6. But we can still act and prevent the worst-case scenario
Earth’s surface temperature will continue to increase until at least 2050 under all emissions scenarios considered in the report. The assessment shows Earth could well exceed the 1.5℃ warming limit by the early 2030s.
If we reduce emissions sufficiently, there is only a 50 percent chance global temperature rise will stay around 1.5℃ (including a temporary overshoot of up to 0.1℃). To get Earth back to below 1.5℃ warming, CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere using negative emissions technologies or nature-based solutions.
Global warming stays below 2℃ during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2°C  … Humanity, however, must choose to act.
The IPCC analyzed future climate projections from dozens of climate models, produced by more than 50 modeling centers around the world. It showed global average surface temperature rises between 1-1.8℃ and 3.3-5.7℃ this century above pre-industrial levels for the lowest and highest emission scenarios, respectively. The exact increase the world experiences will depend on how much more greenhouse gases are emitted.
The report states, with high certainty, that to stabilize the climate, CO2 emissions must reach net zero, and other greenhouse gas emissions must decline significantly.
We also know, for a given temperature target, there’s a finite amount of carbon that we can emit before reaching net-zero emissions. To have a 50:50 chance of halting warming at around 1.5℃, this quantity is about 500 billion metric tonnes of CO2.
At current levels of CO2 emissions this “carbon budget” would be used up within 12 years. Exhausting the budget will take longer if emissions begin to decline.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2℃ and limit it to around 1.5℃, the globally agreed goals of the Paris Agreement. Humanity, however, must choose to act.

SINGAPORE: Over the past three years, approximately 250 experts in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Working Group I (WGI) writing team volunteered their time and expertise to author the sixth - and latest - assessment on the physical basis of climate change.
It is the first of a series of IPCC reports in each assessment cycle spanning approximately seven years, examining climate research undertaken since the last cycle ended in 2014.

The writing team faced considerable obstacles. The assessment cycle was extended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which fundamentally changed how authors met and worked across borders and time zones in collaboratively writing multiple drafts.
Almost 80,000 comments on the drafts were submitted from expert reviewers and governments over the past three years; all had to be addressed for the report to pass the IPCC approval process.
They also faced the challenge of completing a report concise enough for policymakers seeking authoritative information on climate change, while simultaneously accounting for the explosion of climate literature published since 2014.
About 14,000 total citations to relevant literature were assessed - and even that voluminous amount doesn’t cover the staggering breadth of climate science research during that period.
As such, the approved report released on Monday (Aug 9) is a monumental feat and the authors’ efforts should be applauded.

CLEAR HUMAN INFLUENCE ON MORE FREQUENT EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS
While the report’s fundamental conclusion - that climate change is happening and that humans are causing it - isn’t new, there are three key takeaways worth highlighting.
First, stronger evidence has emerged of clear human influence on more frequent extreme weather events across the globe, such as rainfall, droughts, severe storms like cyclones, and from compound events like wildfires driven by heatwaves and dry conditions.
We can say with strong confidence that historical “natural” variability of the climate system alone can no longer explain most extreme weather events experienced since 2014.
Instead, human influence, through increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land cover change, is now the prime suspect.
AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURES WILL EXCEED PARIS AGREEMENT’S THRESHOLD GOALS
Second, it appears all but certain that average global surface temperatures, currently at 1.1 degrees Celsius above the baseline pre-industrial era in the 19th Century, will exceed the 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius threshold goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Without rapid cuts to the approximately 50 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gases currently emitted worldwide per year, we will pass 1.5 degrees Celsius sometime early during the next decade.
Even the reduced emissions from COVID-19 lockdowns over the past 18 months will not slow future temperature increases; the temporary blip is more than offset by the momentum from decades of accelerating global GHG emissions that won’t abate.
Yet, the report also assesses that scenarios with stringent global GHG emissions cuts during this decade, resulting in net-zero emissions by 2050, can stabilise temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius - and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees Celsius - by 2100.
This small window of opportunity to meet the Paris Agreement goal, however, will continue shrinking every year without substantive action.

NET-ZERO EMISSION GOALS HAVE BECOME EVEN MORE CRITICAL
Third, the need for action is urgently critical since the report clearly articulates a bleak climate future without achieving the net-zero goal.

A useful analogy with the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics may help illustrate this point. Adding GHG emissions to the climate system and the resulting change in extreme weather is akin to an athlete’s health when continuously using performance-enhancing drugs.
Record-breaking extreme weather events like the heatwaves, severe storms, and wildfires that we’ve seen across the globe over the past few months are likely to occur more frequently in the years to come, just like record sporting performances from athletes’ consistent usage of human growth hormone or anabolic drugs.
As continued steroid use often leads to debilitating chronic health issues for athletes, the report also stresses long-term and potentially irreversible changes to our planet, such as the continued melting of massive Greenland and Antarctic glaciers leading to dangerous levels of sea level rise.
Just like drug overuse in sports can damage an athlete’s future health and lead to premature death, we must therefore be wary of uncontrolled GHG emissions and its detrimental risks to societies.
Indeed, these risks can be existential, as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted in his 2019 National Day Rally regarding the environmental and geopolitical threats of rising sea levels to Singapore.
Our cities are warm and will get warmer. But how can technology keep us cool and keep emissions down? Find out how on CNA's The Climate Conversations.

A NEW CLIMATE ATLAS TO SEE HOW REGIONS LIKE SOUTHEAST ASIA WILL FARE
In this IPCC assessment cycle, detailed information into climate risk assessment, particularly on climate hazards arising under different global warming levels (i.e., 1.5, 2 degrees Celsius or beyond), is available for discrete geographical regions like Southeast Asia.
While the report describes and assesses such risks for different regions in detail, one exciting development stands out.
The regional variations in climate - from historical data and from projected climate model simulations assessed by the IPCC - will be publicly available through an interactive online atlas.
Users can analyse and download the numerous datasets used in the report for their regions of interest, and access synthesised information for climatic impact drivers such as temperature, rainfall and sea level rise.
Commentary: We can no longer ignore the health risks of climate change in Asia
Commentary: Climate change in Singapore and what the future brings
As an educator, it is often difficult to dynamically display the variety of potential climate futures for my students, especially at regional levels and over different time periods.
They - and their families and loved ones who live, work and play in Southeast Asia - are more invested in knowing how climate change affects them locally, which can be significantly different than the global “big-picture” impacts.
For instance, the atlas illustrates that some coastal Southeast Asian cities like Manila likely face greater risks from wet weather extremes and more intense tropical cyclones, while other cities in the region like Singapore instead face greater heat risks with each degree Celsius of additional warming.
Having this atlas will be an exciting communication tool to clearly illustrate concepts of climate science for students and for many other stakeholders affected by climate change, as well as demonstrate the regional outcomes of global action (or inaction) on GHG emissions.
SO, WHAT’S NEXT?
The report articulates the dire nature of the climate emergency we face, and provides important information for accelerating action towards the Paris Agreement goals in the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow held this November.
For the IPCC, subsequent reports building on WGI’s work will be released next year from Working Group II (dealing with climate impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability) in February, Working Group III (on climate mitigation) in March, and a Synthesis Report from all Working Groups in September.
Taken together, these documents provide an important blueprint for people to understand what can be done to address the climate emergency we face.
However, our work as IPCC authors has one important caveat. While we objectively assess relevant science-based climate policy options for governments, we do not formally prescribe such policies in our reports.
As I tell my students, we climate scientists can authoritatively answer questions of whats, whys, and wherefores of climate change.
The important climate policy questions starting with “should”, however, have to be determined collectively by decision-makers in each country and the people who support them, based on the best information available.

August 9, 2021
A new United Nations–led report from hundreds of climate scientists around the world makes it clear: The human-driven climate crisis is now well under way. Earth is likely hotter now than it has been at any moment since the beginning of the last Ice Age, 125,000 years ago, and the world has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius, or nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit, since the Industrial Revolution began—an “unprecedented” and “rapid” change with no parallel in the Common Era. What’s more, the recent spate of horrific heat waves, fire-fueling droughts, and flood-inducing storms that have imperiled the inhabited world are not only typical of global warming, but directly caused by it.
Climate change has arrived, in other words, and it will keep getting worse until humanity reduces its greenhouse-gas pollution to zero, which can be accomplished only by dethroning oil, coal, and gas as the central energy sources powering the global economy.
But the speed of that transition matters—and preventing every last ton of carbon pollution, and averting every additional tenth of a degree of warming, will not only lessen the harm over the next few decades, but resound for centuries and even millennia to come.
These are the conclusions of the newest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN-sponsored body that has periodically released a synthesis of current climate science since its founding in 1988. The group’s reports tend to punctuate the otherwise slow immiseration of climate change; its previous synthesis report, released in 2013, helped inform international climate policy, including the writing of the Paris Agreement.
This is its sixth report and its most definitive. The group’s findings must be agreed to by 195 countries; this famously makes it more conservative than some scientists believe is prudent. But compared with previous reports, there is little restraint here. In its strongest statement of culpability ever, the IPCC declared that humanity is “unequivocally” responsible for climate change. “In past reports, we’ve had to make that statement more hesitantly. Now it’s a statement of fact,” Gregory Flato, a vice chair of the group that authored the report and a senior research scientist within the Canadian government, told me.
Some of the worst impacts of climate change can still be avoided. “There are still emissions pathways that would lead us to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, but they require deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions,” Flato said. “That leaves a glimmer of optimism that we could limit warming to levels like that.” But it would require much more expedient action from the United States than is contemplated in, say, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Congress is currently considering.
The report is 3,949 pages long and synthesizes the past eight years of advances in climate science; altogether, it cites some 14,000 studies. It would be folly to try to summarize all that work here. But the bottom line is that climate science, and the cataclysm of climate change, has lurched into the present tense. Where scientists once warned of disasters in the distant future, now they strive to understand what has already happened—and what is too late to save. Here are four takeaways:
1. Climate change is now a fact of modern life—and it will only get worse.
Climate change has been happening now nearly since before it first became a public issue. When James Hansen, the head of climate science at NASA, first warned Congress about climate change in 1988, he framed it in what might be called the tentative present tense, saying that the agency could now say “with a high degree of confidence” that global warming was under way.
And it was. As the new report notes: “Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850.” Yet in the past few years, global warming has moved from a statistical property to an ambient condition of modern life. A mega-drought seems to grip the American West without end. A series of wildfires have passed, like a baton, from one part of the world to another, going from California to the Amazon to Australia to Greece to California again. And then there was the morning, a few weeks ago, when Americans on the East Coast and in the Midwest woke up, thousands of miles away from any wildfire, and smelled smoke in the air.
“We’re reaching a point where the impacts of climate change are becoming too hard to ignore for many people,” Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and a co-author of one of the report’s chapters, told me.
For the first time, the report establishes that those extreme events are happening because of climate change. Scientists’ ability to attribute individual events to the warming atmosphere is the “biggest advance” the field has seen in the past decade, Ben Cook, a climate-science professor at Columbia University, told me.
“Every inhabited region across the globe” has seen a well-documented increase in heat waves, heavy rain, or drought, the report says. Human activity is also behind the demise of glaciers since 1990, the hemorrhaging of the Greenland ice sheet, and the decline of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere since 1950, the report says. No part of the world has been left untouched by humanity’s prodigious carbon pollution.
2. Sea-level rise will be worse than once thought—and could occur quickly and catastrophically.
In the past decade, climate scientists have arrived at more pessimistic views about sea-level rise, and those views are reflected in this report. Most researchers now believe that the oceans will rise roughly half a foot more than once projected. In a relatively optimistic “intermediate” emissions scenario, for instance, the IPCC once projected that oceans would rise about one and a half feet by 2100. The new report finds that just under two feet is more likely, and two and a half feet is not out of the question.
The authors could not eliminate from their models the small chance that some of the largest glaciers in West Antarctica could catastrophically collapse this century. In that scenario, humanity could see more than six and a half feet of sea-level rise by 2100 and perhaps as much as 16 feet of sea-level rise by 2150.
3. Sea-level rise is also essentially irreversible.
If humanity successfully learns how to remove carbon from the atmosphere, some of the impacts of climate change, such as ocean acidification and the rise in land temperatures, may be reversible.
But some will not. Sea-level rise is chief among them. “Once you have melting under way, it’s very hard to rein it in, even if you go full-scale into reversal of global warming,” Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech and a co-author of the report, told me. The slow increase in sea levels could continue for millennia.
“When I say those words, it almost chokes me up. It scares the crap out of me, frankly,” Cobb said. “This is a horrific long-term consequence to the decisions we’ll be making this decade on our watch.”
4. The climate is now changing on political time.
If climate change is happening now, then its time scales—which once seemed distant—are suddenly ticking by at the speed of the political or business calendars. An earlier draft of this report cautioned that the world could see more than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by the early 2030s. Although that language was removed because researchers could not guarantee that a fluke event, such as a once-in-a-century volcanic eruption, would not briefly cool the planet and delay the inevitable for a few years, the broad point remains. The IPCC now warns that the world is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2040 even if humanity cuts carbon pollution as rapidly as is plausible. In fact, the agency estimates that enough greenhouse gas is already in the atmosphere today to raise the planet’s temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius—only the cooling effects of smog and other forms of conventional air pollution are keeping temperatures depressed.
But humanity may still avoid warming the planet by 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. On all pathways, the world’s temperature will increase more than 1.5 degrees Celsius by the middle of the century; the only question is whether it then begins to cool down or keeps going up. Current policies suggest that the planet is set for 3 degrees Celsius, or more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit, of warming by the end of the century.
“We’re already seeing extreme rainfall, heat waves, and droughts that are all implicitly or explicitly tied to climate change—and this is just a 1-degree world,” Cook said. “I would not want to live in a 4-degree world. And a 3-degree world … would be quite challenging.”

Back in 1990, the world’s top climate scientists convened to put together a report on the state of Earth’s climate. Working together collaboratively, they put together the very first IPCC report, where they definitively linked the increased carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere with the increased temperatures that were being seen across the Earth. The CO2 increase from a pre-industrial ~280 ppm to 354 ppm was coupled with a temperature increase of 0.7 °C (1.3 °F), and the alarm was sounded that things were going to get a lot worse unless we took collective steps to mitigate humanity’s impacts on the planet.
Now, in 2021, the 6th IPCC report has just been released, and the situation is far more dire, but our knowledge of what’s occurring is far more extensive. CO2 concentrations now sit at 412 ppm, Earth's temperature is a full 1.3 °C (2.3 °F) above pre-industrial levels, and still, no meaningful, sustained initiatives to reduce our global carbon emissions have been taken. In fact, they’re presently at an all-time high. The longer we delay meaningful climate action, the more severe the consequences will get not just for all of humanity today, but for generations and even millennia to come. Although our climate future intimately depends on how global emissions unfold in the coming years and decades, the latest IPCC report provides unprecedented clarity on a number of important issues. Here are the top six takeaways we should all accept and understand.

1.) Warming will exceed 1.5 °C in every plausible scenario. This current climate report focuses on 5 separate climate scenarios, as driven by carbon emissions:
SSP1-1.9, designed to limit temperatures in 2100 to below 1.5 °C warming,
SSP1-2.6, a slightly more plausible low-end emissions scenario,
SSP2-4.5, a realistic scenario assuming that current policies are successfully implemented worldwide,
SSP3-7.0, a high-end emissions pathway where emissions slowly increase and have doubled by century's end,
and SSP3-8.5, a more pessimistic high-emissions scenario.
In each of these 5 scenarios, it's estimated that the Earth will warm by 1.4 °C, 1.8 °C, 2.7 °C, 3.6 °C, and 4.4 °C, respectively. In all cases, we will pass the 1.5 °C mark sometime in the early 2030s: about 10 years from now. In the non-optimistic scenarios for emissions, we will pass 2.0 °C of warming sometime around 2050. None of this, however, means “game over” for the climate. The SSP1-1.9 scenario shows that temperatures will only crest 1.5 °C for a few decades, dropping below 1.5 °C by century’s end. The less time we spend with extreme temperatures on Earth, the more successful we’ll be at mitigating the ill effects of climate change; the more rapidly we decarbonize the energy sector, the better those mitigations will be.

2.) The predicted uncertainties in climate sensitivity has narrowed substantially. If you double atmospheric CO2, the temperature will increase, but by how much? Previously, the "likely" (1-sigma, or 68%) range was between 1.5 and 4.5 °C. As of this new report, that range is now 2.5 to 4.0 °C, with merely half the prior uncertainties. Similarly, the "very likely" range (~90% confidence) is 2.0 °C to 5.0 °C. This reduction in uncertainty is driven largely by combining three different lines of evidence: paleoclimate evidence, physical process models, and the instrument record.
Although the above graph, which shows a comparison between the 5th and 6th IPCC assessment reports, looks very similar in the uncertainties, there’s an enormous point to pay attention to. The prior report, from 2014, shows the “likely” range of temperature outcomes, while the current report, from 2021, shows the “very likely” range of temperature outcomes; there’s only a ~10% chance that something outside of this range could occur. Although there are still substantial uncertainties in the various models, those uncertainties are largely captured and reflected in the published ranges of temperature outcomes.

3.) Major, very old climate science predictions — including the hockey stick and warming trends — were all correct. The above graph shows a variety of climate models and their predictions for how the global mean temperature would increase, going as far back as 1970 and showing the prediction beginning the year they were made. The black, thick line shows the actual observed temperature on a year-to-year basis. As you can clearly see with a visual inspection, or as you can robustly find with a more detailed statistical analysis, historical climate models and past IPCC projections have accurately predicted real-world temperatures in subsequent years.
It’s more than just the warming trends, however. The “hockey stick” graph now goes back more than 2000 years, and shows definitively how unprecedented the modern warming trend is; the first two centuries of the 3rd millennium will be warmer than any multi-century period over the past 100,000 years. Skeptics often question how much of the warming is due to natural factors versus how much is due to human activity, and the latest report has answered that: approximately ~95-100% is human-caused; approximately ~0-5% is natural (due to solar and volcanic effects).
Humans are the cause of this unprecedented warming, and it is up to us to be the solution, too.

4.) Extreme events — heat waves, droughts, floods, and even hurricanes — will all be more frequent and/or severe. This one is an enormous advance that hasn't gotten enough attention in recent years. Just last decade, most of the discussion around extreme weather events occurred in generalities. We would talk about the distribution of events in a statistical sense: the mean baseline moved and perhaps the spread increased as well, but there wasn't a good way to examine a particular event and to answer a question like, "how much worse was this particular event made by human activity?"
The same combination of observations that made the earlier reduction in uncertainties possible, including paleoclimate, instrument readings, and process modeling, also enables us to quantify how extreme events are linked to climate change. The picture, in a nutshell, is not pretty. The below set of graphs show the incidence of heatwaves, floods, and droughts will occur. The takeaway is clear: events that used to be once-a-decade or even once-per-50-years are now occurring almost annually. For those of you wondering about hurricanes, the prevalence of category 3, 4, and 5 hurricanes has increased dramatically due to climate change as well.
Weather events that were once-in-10-years or once-in-50-years are now more likely and will continue ... [+]

5.) Sea level rise will be severe and long-lasting no matter what path we take. The biggest risk, of course, is that an abrupt and colossal change occurs: what we've typically called a "tipping point" in the past. Two of these are intimately related to the seas: ice sheet collapse and abrupt changes in ocean circulation. Most projections result in 0.5-1.0 meters of sea level rise through 2100, with an acceleration occurring in the moderate and high-end emissions scenarios.
However, a destabilized Antarctic ice sheet (below, dotted line) shows what sort of catastrophic sea level rise would ensue. According to the IPCC, "global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and 5 m by 2150 under a very high... emissions scenario – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice sheet processes." Just as many extreme weather events will occur more frequently, so will coastal flooding events, particularly along certain regions such as the United States’s Gulf and Atlantic coasts. A combination of sea level rise, tidal cycles, and shifting ocean currents could transform what were once-in-a-century flooding events into annual events by 2100.
The report also warns that the combination of deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt will likely, with high confidence, result in elevated sea levels for millennia. If warming is limited to 1.5 °C, 2 °C, or 5 °C over that term, sea levels will rise by 2-3 m, 2-6 m, or 19-22 m for each of those three scenarios. (That is not a typo!)
The five expected warming/emissions scenarios and the corresponding sea-level rise, as detailed in ... [+]

6.) Achieving zero net CO2 emissions is mandatory, and the timescale is key. With reduced uncertainties, tighter and more robust predictions, and a clear vision of our future, the latest IPCC report shouldn’t alarm us, but rather should inform us and spur us to what’s desperately needed: climate action. The "lukewarmer" argument, where some skeptics hoped that climate change would be on the milder end of what's expected, can now be ruled out. However, so long as no low-risk, high-impact events occur, warming of ~6 C and above also appears unlikely so long as we don't exponentially increase our emissions.
There’s reason for optimism, however. Once we reach the point — and we all assume that we someday will — where we achieve net-zero carbon emissions, global warming will pretty much cease at that time. Even though temperatures lag carbon dioxide concentrations, once we reach that net-zero emissions goal, we can now predict that the atmospheric CO2 concentrations will decrease, leading to roughly level temperatures. (Temperatures will drop if we move to negative carbon emissions.) The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) is discussed thoroughly in the new IPCC report, and agrees with an important 2010 paper. The conclusion is that as soon as we hit net-zero emissions, the temperature will roughly be frozen-in at that value unless/until negative emissions work to reverse the warming trend.
If zero carbon emissions were to be achieved today, temperatures would level off and remain at their ... [+]

Even though these six takeaways summarize the key points very effectively for scientists, it’s very difficult for most people to understand these rather abstract conclusions. To help bring home exactly what this means, I’d like to take you back to an event that happened in the Columbia River Gorge — the canyon along the Columbia River separating Oregon from Washington State — back in 2017. The Pacific Northwest is typically hot and dry during the months of August and September, posing a severe wildfire risk and leading to numerous burn bans across the western areas of North America.
On the afternoon of September 2nd, hiker Kevin Marnell, hiking along Eagle Creek in the National Scenic Area there, heard a series of loud bangs, reminiscent of gunfire. Just minutes later, he saw thick smoke rising nearby from down the mountain slope, closer towards the river. Despite this being a protected area, despite the burn bans, and despite the enormous amount of educational efforts that had gone into wildfire prevention (more than 80% of all wildfires are started by humans, rather than natural causes), this quickly grew into the now-infamous Eagle Creek fire, which:
stranded 153 hikers,
caused the evacuation of thousands of people across 6 towns,
burned approximately 50,000 acres along the only navigable waterway from the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Ocean,
and caused tens of millions of dollars in property damage.

What most people don’t remember from that 2017 fire is the story of how it began, but it’s burned into my memory because of my experience being a teenage boy. When I was 13, my friends and I very much enjoyed getting our hands on small explosives: firecrackers, M-80s, Roman candles, etc. When it was my turn to play, I would light the fuse and run away, but a kid I knew, Todd, liked to play a game that terrified me: light the fuse, hold it as long as possible, then throw it as high as he could just before ignition, attempting to cause a mid-air explosion. (Playing such games with explosives is not without risk, as my now-blind friend Tyler can attest.)
Similarly, two (at least) teenage boys were playing a game with these small explosives:
light them,
throw them down the mountain towards the river,
and attempt to get them to land in the river, but as close to dry land as possible.
To no one’s surprise, the very first errant throw — the first one to land on dry land instead of in the river — started what would become this catastrophic fire, whose ramifications are still being felt today. The problem isn’t that “something went wrong” with the game; the problem is that anyone attempted to even play this game in the first place.
This 1989 image was taken just one year after a catastrophic wildfire destroyed hundreds of ... [+]

In many ways, as a society, it’s illustrative of how we’re incorrectly responding to societal problems that have a scientific solution. You cannot eradicate a virus when people keep engaging in activities — like not wearing a mask and refusing vaccinations — that incubate and spread it. You cannot reduce the damage from wildfires when we don’t properly fund forest management and even a small number of humans keep starting them. And you cannot mitigate the worst consequences of a warming planet if we do not collectively reduce the carbon emissions that actively cause the planet to warm.
When collective action is required, individual freedom to engage in the opposite action is the enemy of us all. It’s long past time for policymakers to catch up to the science, but there is good news. Just as the burned area of the Columbia Gorge has already started to regrow, we know precisely how to heal the Earth from the damage we’re continuing to inflict. Mandating and enforcing a rapid global reduction in carbon emissions, re-wilding large areas of the Earth, and doing it sooner rather than later, could potentially leave the planet in better shape by 2100 than it is, today, in 2021. But this won’t happen without a sustained change in global policy that does not blow with the fickle political winds: what’s needed now is not more reports, but sustained and coordinated action. The future of the Earth, and our species, is literally in our hands. What we do about it will impact all of us for years, generations, and even millennia to come.
