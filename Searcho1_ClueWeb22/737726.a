I'm trying to understand why people become cult leaders. It seems like a complex issue, and I want to get a good grasp on the possible reasons behind it. I think starting with some background information on cults and their leaders would be helpful.

First, I need to define what a cult is because the term can be a bit vague. From what I know, a cult is a group that's often characterized by extreme devotion to its leader and a set of beliefs that may be outside the mainstream. These groups can be religious, political, or even centered around personal development. The key feature seems to be the strong influence the leader has over the members.

So, why do people become cult leaders? I suspect there are multiple factors at play here. Maybe some people have a natural inclination towards leadership and use that to build a following, especially if they can offer something that appeals to certain individuals or groups. Perhaps they fill a void or provide a sense of belonging that people are seeking.

Another angle could be that some leaders are charismatic and manipulative, using their charm to gain control over others. They might exploit people's vulnerabilities or gullibility to build a loyal following. It's also possible that some leaders genuinely believe in their ideology and think they're doing good, even if their methods are questionable or harmful.

I should probably look into some famous cult leaders to see if there are any common traits or patterns. For example, David Koresh of the Branch Davidians, Jim Jones of Jonestown, or Charles Manson. Understanding their backgrounds and motivations might give me some insights.

Let me consider David Koresh. He was the leader of the Branch Davidians, a religious group in Texas. He had a charismatic personality and was known for his interpretations of religious texts. He seemed to have a magnetic appeal that drew people to him. But his leadership also led to a standoff with federal agents that ended in a fire, killing many members, including children.

Jim Jones led the Peoples Temple, which culminated in the mass suicide/murder at Jonestown in Guyana. He was also charismatic and had a vision of creating a utopian community, but it turned deadly.

Charles Manson is different; he wasn't leading a religious group per se, but more of a countercultural movement. He inspired his followers to commit murders, believing it would spark an apocalyptic race war.

From these examples, it seems that charisma plays a significant role. These leaders were able to persuade others to follow them and sometimes to carry out extreme actions. But charisma alone might not be enough. There must be a combination of factors, including the followers' needs and the environmental context.

Perhaps some people are drawn to cult leaders because they offer a sense of purpose or community. In times of uncertainty or dissatisfaction with mainstream society, individuals might be more receptive to alternative ideologies and charismatic figures who promise answers or a better way of life.

On the other hand, maybe some cult leaders are driven by a desire for power and control. They see an opportunity to wield influence over others and exploit that for their own ends, whether it's financial gain, personal validation, or some other motive.

It's also worth considering the psychological aspects. Are cult leaders often individuals with specific personality disorders or mental health issues that predispose them to manipulate others? Or is it more about situational factors and the dynamics within the group?

I think I need to do some research to get a better understanding. Maybe there are studies or books that explore this topic in depth.

The Psychology Behind Why People Join Cults
The Psychology Behind Why People Join Cults

At best, cults are predatory organizations intent on scamming people out of their funds or possessions. At their worst, cults are terribly dangerous groups, with leaders procuring sexual favors from their followers or in the most infamous cases, leading dozens to their deaths. The dangers of cults have been displayed on the news and pop culture alike, so what makes someone join them?
People who become cultists are most often lacking important qualities in their life to make them feel comfortable and accepted (via Online Psychology Degree Guide ). Cults can offer health, financial security, and peace of mind, providing an illusion of comfort. Others, such as Heaven's Gate, offer fantastical benefits like eternal life or a divine afterlife. Cults present themselves as a social group filled with love and connection that can be very appealing to the right kind of person, which is why they are very careful to recruit the most dedicated and loyal members possible.

Most cultists are average people. Not one race or income level is targeted, although women are more likely than men to join a cult. The key unifier between cultists is low self-esteem. Cult leaders will target those new to an area, those who have gone through recent professional or romantic loss, and people who are lonely (via TED ). Recruits are then often "love bombed" — showered with compliments, affection, and seduction — to provide a feeling of acceptance and being wanted, which is associated with the cult. The recruitment process can take months, and more often than not, the target is a friend or family member of a cultist who finds it hard to turn down the offer.
Once someone joins a cult, a leader begins to manipulate them. After the honeymoon period of love bombing, leaders can force public humiliation and self-indoctrination to return the low self-esteem that plagues their followers. Paranoia sets in, and members who might object to the claims and requests of a leader are afraid to break from the example of blind obedience set by their fellow cultists. Even if most cults don't end in death, the already fragile mental state of a cultist can be severely damaged by the manipulation of their leader.

Cult leaders and the psychological traits that make people want to follow them

Cult leaders: What makes people like David Koresh so successful at getting people to follow them?
The psychology of cult leaders like David Koresh have fascinated sociologists for decades
By Léa Surugue
Updated January 23, 2017 11:19 GMT
On 19 April 1993, David Koresh, leader of the destructive Branch Davidians cult, died after a 51-day FBI siege of the ranch he and his followers were occupying, near the town of Waco, Texas. Seventy-nine people, including children, also lost their life when the place was burnt down. The FBI had been suspecting the cult – a breakaway group from the Seventh-Day Adventist church – of hiding weapons on the compound, and sexually abusing many of its youngest members.
This episode, known as the "Waco siege", remains one of the most dramatic manifestations of what can happen when a dangerous personality takes the leadership of a group, and converts its members to an extreme ideology (see box at the end for a full definition of a "cult").
Twenty-three years on, David Koresh's name is still associated with one of the most destructive and criminal cult leaders in history. But a question remains: what was so special about Koresh that hundreds of people decided to follow him?
Who are cult leaders?

The psychology of individuals like Koresh and the mechanisms by which they draw followers in has fascinated sociologists and psychologists alike for many years.
No cult leader has ever submitted to in-depth psychotherapy, so establishing a clinically-accurate psychological profile of these men and women is a difficult task. Yet, listening to the testimonies of cult victims and studying the writings of cult leaders can provide an interesting – and sometimes chilling – insight into their minds.
"The rejection of scrutiny is the first characteristic of a cult and of its leader. They do not like to be examined, and are convinced nothing is wrong with them. In their mind, it is the rest of the world who has a problem. In that context, the only thing you can do is analyse their behaviours by interviewing their victims", former FBI agent and human behaviour expert Joe Navarro told IBTimes UK.
'Pathologically narcissistic'
Based on their work with victims, most experts coincide in saying cult leaders share a number of psychological traits that are typical of a narcissistic personality disorder, as defined the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual, the leading psychology textbook reference in the US.
Why advertise with us
David Berg considered himself as a prophet, above his followers.davidberg.org
"Obviously this does not mean that all narcissistic personalities will turn out to be cult leaders, nor that all leaders classify as narcissists, but there are clear indications that they do have characteristics in common," says Robert Pardon, director of the New England Institute of Religious Research.
In particular, cult leaders believe they are unique beings. David Berg, the leader of the Family International (previously Children Of God), a cult still in existence, was known under the name Moses David. He was considered as a spiritual leader by his followers, a sort of prophet showing them the way.
As a result of this "uniqueness", leaders think they are entitled to more privileges. Some of the Waco siege survivors alleged Koresh was the only man allowed to have sex with the girls in the group, including some as young as 11.
These individuals lack empathy, but they have a strong need for admiration. "This pathological tendency to narcissism does not imply 'self-love'. Rather it means that these people overvalue themselves at the same times as they devalue others", Navarro says.
Their certitude of being above everyone else exists only insofar as they are surrounded and adulated. "Cult leaders have no sense of who they are. They build their identity based on the admiration and the fear that people reflect back to them", Pardon explains.
The 'charming predator'
Cult leaders may also display antisocial personality disorder traits, which include a form of psychopathy. Perhaps the most unsettling characteristic of cult leaders – which comes back over and over in victims' account – is that they are both charismatic and authoritarian. The cult leader is a sort of "charming predator", with an ability to draw people in.
"The cult leader has a certain degree of interpersonal intelligence which pulls people into his orbit. While he is not able to reflect on his own psychological state, he understands the state of his victims, listens to them and uses it to control them", says Dr Alexandra Stein, who specialises in social psychology of ideological extremism, and is herself a former cult member.
Once the victims are isolated from everyone they knew, the effort to charm them fades, replaced by a form of coercive control, where the leader shows signs of his authoritarian nature. V iolence is rarely needed to control the followers, this combination of natural charisma and authoritarianism are enough. In that sense, Stein says totalitarian regimes were not unlike cults, and leaders like Hitler shared many characteristics with cult leaders.
A mirror of the leader's personality
Whether it is large organisation or a small group of individuals, the cult is often a reflect of the leader's personality. Cult leaders cultivate secrecy, a desire to isolate followers and have a constant tendency to lie. These practices are found at all levels of the organisation.

Stein herself never met the leader of the cult she was trapped in, but his presence and his destructive influence was felt nevertheless. His authoritarianism, his control and his sense of grandiosity ended being replicated by other individuals in the cult's hierarchy.
"It is very hard to get a straight story from a cult leader because they lie a lot. On top of that they see people as dispensable, as either against them or with them. They see the world in terms of absolutes, and believe their ideology is the only answer to everything", she concludes. "Recognising this and understanding that these personality traits are the reason why a cult is the way it is is the first step to prevent people from joining it."
What is a cult?
What do we mean when we say "cult"?
They are a lot of opinions on the matter. "Some people take the question really personally. Christianity was originally thought of as a cult", Joe Navarro points out. He however says that secrecy and the fact they reject scrutiny are a good place to start defining what a cult is.
Alexandra Stein has come up with a comprehensive definition, which includes a number of elements people should watch out for to make sure they are not being drawn in a cult. The personality of the leader is the place to start, as it can tell a lot about whether the group is dangerous or not. She says looking at whether the structure is very closed, isolating and hierarchical is the next step.
The form of the ideology should also be considered to define a cult. If it is presented as the only answer to explain the universe, past and present, then it's worth considering the group as a cult.
A process of "brain washing" or "coercive persuasion" is also typical of a cult. During this process, the leader sets up an environment where the only perceived safe place is the group, but paradoxically it is also the source of threat . "If a group or an individual tries to isolate you from all your previous relationships, you can start worrying", Stein says.
Finally, she explains that what characterizes a cult is that as a result of this structure, ideology and process followers become highly dependent on the group and exploitable, they always a cting in the interest of the cult, never in their own.
In this article, the word cult was used for groups - religious or not - which display these different characteristics.

Common Cult Leader Characteristics & Personality Traits
Story from Mind
4 Personality Traits Cult Leaders Have In Common
Sara Coughlin
October 10, 2018, 5:30 AM
illustrated by Anna Sudit.
We, as a true-crime-consuming, armchair-psychologizing public, can't help but be fascinated by the minds of the strangest and most mysterious among us. If you aren't thinking of serial killers right now, you're probably thinking of cult leaders instead. And, in the same way that serial killers share certain tendencies and personality traits, so, too, do cult leaders
To learn more about what makes cult leaders tick, we spoke with cult researcher and author Janja Lalich, PhD, professor emerita of sociology at California State University, Chico.
Regardless of the goals or nature of their cult, most cult leaders behave the way they do in order to cultivate and maintain a power imbalance, Dr. Lalich says. If their followers never know how they are going to react to something, they're in control. If their followers don't know when they'll make their next appearance, they're in control. If their followers can't guess what their next demand will be, yes, they're still in control.
As large as they loom in the public imagination, there's only so much we can know about these enigmatic, notorious figures. Here, Dr. Lalich walks us through four key traits that we can identify in most cult leaders — and why they fuel their rise to notoriety.
1 of 4
“
They are narcissistic.
”
This is probably pretty obvious, since we're talking about people who literally establish cults around themselves and their own personalities, but it bears mentioning that cult leaders tend to be highly self-absorbed. They may have simply grown up thinking that they're superior or, Dr. Lalich explains, some cult leaders gain their sense of self-aggrandizement after having what they believe to be an encounter with a god or deity — and it's that visit that inspires them to start their cult. Either way, narcissism is the root of several other behaviors commonly associated with cult leaders. "They demand extreme loyalty," Dr. Lalich says. They don't allow criticism and seek to control everything that goes on within their following. Because they're driven by their ego, they believe that they deserve to make these demands.

“
They are charismatic.
”
If there's one thing that pop culture has taught us about cult leaders, it's that they are charismatic. As common as that descriptor is, it's actually a rather complicated (and pretty subjective) term. It could describe to the leader's way of speaking, dressing, or treating their followers. Whatever it is, there's a magnetism to it that's hard to resist. "They have that aura of being special — or people attribute that to them," Dr. Lalich says. She's quick to add that what appears to be special to one person might not be all that alluring to someone else. It comes down to the cult leader finding people who respond well to how they present themselves and then bringing that group, no matter how small, under their wing. This sets up something Dr. Lalich calls "charisma by proxy," which refers to the cult leader's inner circle taking up their cause and spreading it to a wider range of people than the cult leader themselves would be able to appeal to effectively.

“
They are unpredictable.
”
Along with their magnetic personality and overall confidence, a cult leader's erratic behavior allows them to maintain that aforementioned power imbalance. First off, Dr. Lalich explains, the leader will limit how often they actually appear before their following — then, when they do show up, they'll act with total duplicity. "You don’t know if he’s going to come in as a raging bull or as a sweet seducer," Dr. Lalich says, adding that this tactic is a surefire way to keep followers "on edge" with a desire to please the leader.
4 of 4
“
They have a "turn-on."
”
Once they've established their movement and gotten a taste of power, most cult leaders develop a clear motivating force behind their actions, be it status, money, sex, or all three, Dr. Lalich says. Even if they claim to be working or speaking for a higher power, it's far more likely that they're acting to serve their ego. And the lengths they'll go to satisfy their desires are usually far beyond the average person's limits. "They don't have any shame," Dr. Lalich says. "[They] demand things that a decent human being wouldn't."

Cults differ in terms of the adopted belief systems and as a result, individuals who specialize in the study of cults have tried hard to find some of the characteristics common to cults so that they can use them as a basis for studying them.
These characteristics are then put to use at a time when the cult experts are about to identify how new cults now operate. As a result, it is now possible and easier to easily identify if an organization is a cult or not, regardless of their beliefs.
A cult can be defined as any religion whose teachings are not based on the God of the Bible. They manipulate scriptures and infringe on one’s decision making ability. Cult leaders can never admit that they are one and always justify their beliefs.
We cannot recognize cults by the mere use of common sense and the need to develop unbiased methods is important. Cults are based on two foundations; altering the bible and presenting alternative foundations that are separate from the Bible. Control and influence of lies is at the core of most cults’ activities, programs and relationships (Langone 17).
Manipulative characteristics of cults
Characteristics of cult include the pyramid power structure where the top figure head is at the apex. In ‘find it quick handbook on cults and new religions’, Rhodes states that authoritarianism is much prevalent in any cult (Rhodes, R. 12).
As long as they are alive, the authority of the leaders is usually absolute and although they deny that their followers should not submit their conscience to them, people find themselves submitting to their rules because of the pressure put on them.
Kaslow, F. & Sussman, M. (159) state that the authoritarian leader often makes absolute claims about his character, abilities or knowledge. The above authors suggest that those cult members who submit to the authority of their leader are never corrected. This shows the consent and acceptance to the unlawful activities involved.

Cult leaders are manipulative of their followers’ character and will always accuse one’s character if you raise questions that differ with their standard doctrine because they feel threatened.
The followers’ minds are controlled by men and not God’s spirit since the cult has distorted view of the Holy Spirit (Rhodes, R. 13). Information passed on to the flock is also tightly controlled and censured. A careful evaluation of their arguments shows that fairness does not prevail in its operations though they paint a persuasive outward picture.
This is contrary to the biblical teachings that say we should not appeal to one’s authority but God’s anointing: In (The Holy Bible New International Version 1113), the Bible says we have anointing from the Holy one and all human beings know the truth. Other human beings may lead us astray because their anointing is counterfeit, thus the need to remain in the Lord (The Holy Bible New International Version 1113).
Cult followers are usually isolated from close family members and close influences/friends to avoid potential critics over their activities. They sometimes create fortified boundaries and some of them require members to renounce and break off their associations with relatives (Rhodes, R. 13).
At initiation, a cult follower is normally instructed to minimize association with close allies and this is justified by the literature given to converts by the cult leaders so that they can read and familiarize themselves with the requirements of the movement. New members are usually given materials to read about the cult which they find captivating (Clark 181). Therefore, according to the above authors, isolation and fortification is a common characteristic of cults.
The bible says that we should grow up in all aspects into Him, who is the head, even Christ (The Holy Bible New International Version 1070). Christ is the way the truth and life but cult leaders make their followers believe that they are the way to the God and as such, no one can go directly to the father without first passing through them.
Due to monopoly of information, cult followers become dependent on their leaders who continue benefitting from the gifts given to them. The members fear asking questions because they will be excommunicated (Rhodes, R. 13). The leaders use trickery and deceitful scheming as they toss people about to retain their command. Thus, while the bible teaches that we should believe only in one God, Rhodes (13) confirms the contrary of this warning that happens in cults.

Cult doctrines are opposed to historical spiritual foundations and they always claim to restore New Testament Christianity. Thus, they redefine biblical terms such as God, Jesus, and sin to mean something totally different (Rhodes, R. 13).
They use restoration from spiritual slavery as a trick to prey on potential converts. Their reform initiatives are usually selective though they claim to be based on God’s law which is neglected in many aspects. Their leaders show no mercy whenever an offense is committed causing stigmatization among other members.
If we alienate God and oppress the Holy trinity we divide the body of Christ. People should learn to read between the lines on the teachings they receive since most cults will teach what the Bible says but act contrary to the teachings. Cults have both good and bad people and therefore Christians should always be their brother’s keeper so that they bring the brethren who have gone astray to Christ.
We are called to be united in the body of Christ by being completely humble, gentle, patient and bearing with one another in love (The Holy Bible New International Version 1070). Rhodes observes the distortion of God’s word that is contrary to what the bible says about misinterpretation of His word.
Concerns about Cults
A lot of confusion and disputes have been generated because of the psychological manipulation associated with cults that demands for total commitment. Some of these groups even harm people who defy their doctrines making it hard for its followers to leave. This creates a state of paranoia due to the fear caused by the leader (Deception Bytes 19).
Some of the cult members found guilty of destructive behavior also buy their way to justice causing their activities to prevail. Some cult leaders often lie about their spiritual inclination when approaching and recruiting new members making it unethical (Deception Bytes 3).
In family settings some of these unethical teachings are passed onto children. Some children are even abused because they are subjected to assertive parental authority. Cults raise social concerns in cases where they adapt unconventional practices and lifestyles. Their members devote a lot of time to the group, they change or modify their personal goals and they are also barred from socializing with outside members (ApologeticsIndex 2).
Cults also infiltrate into positions of power and force their subjects to participate in their educational programs. In societies where they are dominant, they engage in deceptive sales practices, fundraising activities and sponsorships to lure people to their side (ApologeticsIndex 2).

Theological concerns also arise from people’s beliefs and the foundations upon which these beliefs are formed. While deception bites (3) recognizes the aspect of paranoia and fear in cults, apologeticsindex (2) confirm this by noting how the members group themselves together so that they are not enlightened by what is going on outside their leader’s sphere of influence.
The Holy Bible New International Version (1050) tells us that our conflict is necessary and that if only we can rely on Jesus, he shall surely lead us to the truth and an eternal life. This is a truth that no cult has any knowledge about. There is no need for any one of us to remain as slaves of our fellow men because after all, when Jesus died on the cross, he died for our sins and redeemed us from our sins.
Every thought of Christians should be preoccupied with the need to remain captive obedience to Christ who strengthens us. In addition, exit counseling is important for people who leave cults because of the psychological trauma that comes with their teachings and practices (Galanter 984).
Conclusion
Cults differ in terms of the adopted belief systems and as a result, individuals who specialize in the study of cults have tried hard to find some of the characteristics common to cults so that they can use them as a basis for studying them. Characteristics of cult include the pyramid power structure where the top figure head is at the apex.

4 Personality Traits Cult Leaders Have In Common

We, as a true-crime-consuming, armchair-psychologizing public, can't help but be fascinated by the minds of the strangest and most mysterious among us. If you aren't thinking of serial killers right now, you're probably thinking of cult leaders instead. And, in the same way that serial killers share certain tendencies and personality traits, so, too, do cult leaders.
To learn more about what makes cult leaders tick, we spoke with cult researcher and author Janja Lalich, PhD, professor emerita of sociology at California State University, Chico.

And the lengths they'll go to satisfy their desires are usually far beyond the average person's limits. "They don't have any shame," Dr. Lalich says. "[They] demand things that a decent human being wouldn't."

Alright, so I've got some information here about why people become cult leaders. From what I've read, it seems like there are a few key traits that many cult leaders share. Let's see, first off, they tend to be narcissistic. That makes sense because cults are often built around the leader's personality and beliefs. So, if someone has a big ego and thinks they're superior to others, they might be more likely to try and create a following around themselves.

Next, they're usually charismatic. That's interesting because charisma can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it helps them attract followers and gain their trust. But on the other hand, it can also be used to manipulate people into doing things they might not otherwise do. It's like they have this magnetic quality that draws people in.

Also, cult leaders are often unpredictable. That seems to be a strategy they use to keep their followers off balance and always wanting to please them. By being inconsistent in their behavior, followers never know what to expect, which can make them more compliant.

Lastly, there's this idea that cult leaders have a "turn-on," meaning they have a driving motivation, whether it's power, money, sex, or some combination of those. And they'll do whatever it takes to satisfy that desire, sometimes at the expense of their followers' well-being.

Now, thinking about this, it seems like cult leaders exploit people's vulnerabilities. They offer a sense of belonging, purpose, and sometimes even financial security, which can be attractive to individuals who are feeling lost or insecure. It's like they prey on people's needs and then manipulate them once they're in.

But it's not just about the leader; it's also about the followers. There has to be a mutual dynamic where the followers are willing to give up their autonomy and trust the leader implicitly. Maybe some followers are looking for a parent figure or someone to tell them what to do because they're not sure themselves.

Another perspective is that cults provide a simplified worldview, which can be comforting in a complex world. They offer black-and-white answers to gray areas, which can be appealing to some people.

I also came across the term "authoritarian leadership." It seems like cult leaders often have an authoritarian style, where they demand obedience and don't tolerate dissent. This is different from transformational leadership, where leaders inspire and motivate followers based on mutual respect and shared goals.

Comparing cult leaders to other types of leaders, like political leaders or business executives, there are certainly overlaps in terms of charisma and the ability to influence others. But what sets cult leaders apart is the extent to which they manipulate and control their followers, often for their own gain.

It's also worth noting that not all charismatic leaders are cult leaders. There are many leaders out there who are charismatic and influential without resorting to manipulation or exploitation. So, it's important to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy forms of leadership.

Moreover, the environment and cultural context can play a role in the emergence of cults. In times of uncertainty or crisis, people may be more susceptible to joining cults because they're seeking answers and security.

Looking back at history, there have been many cults and cult leaders across different cultures and time periods. From ancient religious cults to modern-day groups, the phenomenon seems to persist in various forms.

In terms of preventing people from becoming cult leaders or joining cults, education and awareness seem crucial. Teaching critical thinking skills and encouraging people to question authority can help them spot manipulative tactics.

Additionally, fostering strong support networks and communities can reduce the appeal of cults for vulnerable individuals. If people have a sense of belonging and purpose outside of a cult, they may be less likely to join one.

Overall, the reasons why people become cult leaders are complex and multifaceted. It involves a combination of personal traits, such as narcissism and charisma, as well as societal factors that make people susceptible to cult influence.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People become cult leaders due to a combination of narcissistic tendencies, charisma, unpredictability, and a strong desire for power, money, or sex. They exploit vulnerabilities in followers seeking belonging, purpose, and simplicity in a complex world.}} \]
