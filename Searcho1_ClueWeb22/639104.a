So I have this question: "How do American cultural beliefs and values influence the use of medical technology?" Hmm, that seems pretty broad, but I guess I need to break it down. First, I need to understand what American cultural beliefs and values are, and then see how they relate to medical technology.

Let me start by thinking about American culture. I know that the United States is a diverse country with people from all over the world, so there isn't just one set of beliefs and values. But there are some common themes, right? Like freedom, individualism, and perhaps a belief in progress and innovation. Those might be relevant here.

Okay, so if Americans value individualism, that might mean that people prefer to make their own choices about their healthcare and the technologies used in their treatment. Maybe they expect a lot of options and aren't willing to accept just one standard approach.

Also, the belief in progress and innovation could lead to a greater acceptance of new medical technologies, even if they're not yet fully proven. Americans might be more open to trying cutting-edge treatments and procedures because there's a general optimism about what science can achieve.

But I should also consider the role of religion and spirituality in American culture. A lot of people in the U.S. are religious, and their beliefs might influence whether they accept certain medical technologies or not. For example, some religious groups might object to certain procedures like stem cell research or abortion.

Moreover, the American healthcare system is unique compared to other countries. It's mostly privatized, which means that market forces play a big role. So, perhaps the drive for profit influences the adoption of medical technologies. Hospitals and doctors might be more likely to adopt technologies that are expensive or that can bring in more revenue, even if the benefits aren't entirely clear.

I should probably look into some specific examples to illustrate this. Maybe something like robotic surgery or genetic testing. Are these more commonly used in the U.S. compared to other countries, and if so, why?

Wait, maybe I should do a search to find some statistics or studies on this. Like, how does the U.S. compare to other countries in terms of medical technology usage?

Medtech  to the United States
Trends and opportunities
The market
The United States (US) has the largest medical technology (medtech) market in the world, accounting for 40 per cent of the global medical device industry (Source: SelectUSA, ‘ Medical Technology Spotlight ’, 19 February 2021). The country is a net exporter of medtech and exported roughly US$28 billion in instruments and appliances used in medical, surgical, dental, or veterinary sciences in 2020 and imported US$27.6 billion. Australia exported roughly US$69.7 million in instruments to the US in 2020, making it the second largest destination of Australian medical devices following New Zealand (Source: TradeMap, 2021 ).
US innovation in the life sciences is expected to continue to grow, with the medical device market reaching US$208 billion in 2023 (Source: SelectUSA, ‘ Medical Technology Spotlight ’, 19 February 2021). An aging population, presence of chronic disease, and high medical costs will drive demand for medtech in the US creating an opportunity for Australian exporters to enter the market.
Australia’s outstanding medical science, strong intellectual property (IP) protection, robust regulatory regime, fast-tracked clinical trials, and expertise in successful commercialising medical science and technologies result in high quality products that are attractive in the US market.
Opportunities
Medtech that aims to make care more efficient, faster, cheaper, and more accessible will drive export opportunities into the US. Some medtech trends that are building traction in the US include:
ehealth
remote care
personalised medicine
mobile health apps
portable diagnostics
3D printing.
Competitive environment
Mexico (26.7 per cent), Germany (11.7 per cent), Ireland (8.9 per cent), China (8.4 per cent) and Costa Rica (7.6 per cent) are the primary exporters of instruments and appliances used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences to the US. Australia ranked 37 th with 0.1 per cent of exports into the US (Source: TradeMap, 2021 ), so there is ample room for Australia to increase its share of the US market for medtech.
Tariffs, regulations and customs
The Australia-US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), which came into effect on 1 January 2005, ensures greater access to the US market for Australian products.
This agreement also enhances prospects for Australian services, trade and investment, improves the regulatory and investment environment between the two countries, and promotes increased business mobility.
Please visit the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website for comprehensive information on the AUSFTA.
US tariffs are not unusually high by world standards. The US Customs Service and a number of government agencies regulate goods imported to the US. Non-compliance may result in delays, extra costs, litigation and even prohibition.
Tariffs and duty rates are constantly revised and are subject to change without notice. Comprehensive information on US tariffs can be obtained from the website of the US International Trade Commission.
Customs brokers are licensed by the US Department of the Treasury and assess tariff classification, quota compliance and anticipation of difficulties in the entry of products you export to the US. Austrade can help you find a customs broker to suit your exporting needs.
Industry standards
Foreign manufacturers of medical devices importing into the US must meet all regulations which include registering the establishment, listing the devices, adhere to manufacturing standards, report adverse events, and if applicable Premarket Notification 510(k) or Premarket Approval. The initial importer must also register medical devices with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are subject to Medical Device Reporting. Devices that emit radiation require further FDA requirements and are subject to Medical Device Reporting (Source: FDA, ‘ Importing into the U.S, 10 February 2021 ).
Marketing your products and services
Market entry
The US has an expansive medtech market which adheres to strict regulations particularly for safety and intellectual property. It is important to research the market to understand the protocol.
The US has clusters of life science ecosystems where there is more advanced infrastructure for medtech innovation and growth due to their proximity to funding and research institutions. Key states for medtech include California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York/New Jersey, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Washington DC, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
Industry associations and medtech conferences are key to growing a network in the US. Events are a productive way to meet partners and learn about current trends in the field.
Distribution channels
When looking at the US, exporters can distribute directly to the market or through third party distributors. Given the distance to the US, due diligence and ongoing communication is key when working with third parties.
Transport
Using a good customs broker and freight forwarder is the most efficient way to ship your goods. These companies are expert in documentation, freight rate negotiations and finding the most economical way to get your product to the buyer. For more information on freight forwarders, please email info@austrade.gov.au.
There are a number of ports on both the east and west coasts of the US. The largest ports (by tonnage) in the US are in Louisiana, Texas, New York, and California. Total transit time between Port Botany in Sydney and Lost Angeles Port is between 25-43 days (19 days on the sea) with an approximate cost of US$2435 (Source: SeaRates.com, 19 February 2021 ). Air freight is also available but can be more costly.

America leads the world in high tech care and health care costs

Why is U.S. health care so costly compared to other developed countries? A recently published report provides some insights.
In a study of 11 countries, Harvard researchers found that while the United States has the highest health costs relative to its GDP, its use of services is average. More specifically, the U.S. ranks lower than nearly every other country in doctors’ visits, hospitalizations, hospital days, and consultative services.
The difference is that the U.S. uses more expensive technologies with high numbers of surgical and cardiovascular procedures and imaging studies.
Other sources of high costs include brand-name drugs and administration of insurance programs. And while the U.S. has fewer physicians per capita, our physicians earn more than counterparts in every other nation.
With fewer doctors, hospitalizations, and office visits, one might conclude that U.S. health care is poor. In many respects, that is true. The U.S. has a low life expectancy and high maternal and infant mortality compared to other wealthy nations.
One explanation is that the U.S population is larger and more geographically and economically diverse compared to its peer countries. As the Harvard group explained, if the state of Minnesota were compared to a similarly prosperous European country, it could hold its own. In contrast, Mississippi, a poorer state, would rank much lower.
The message is that if you cannot access the U.S. health system due to income or distance, your health is at risk. The ACA tried to fix this problem by expanding insurance eligibility with federal support. Surprisingly, some states whose citizens would have benefitted refused to cooperate.
The Harvard report suggests two remedies for curbing health care costs: price control of new brand-name drugs and curbing the proliferation and costs of new technology. These ideas are not new. As the famous economist Uwe Rinehart once wrote, “ It’s the prices, stupid .”
While some countries like Great Britain have taken measures to control such costs, little has been done in the U.S. We are left with a dysfunctional system that creates high costs, expensive drugs, and technology, and lacks a stable national health insurance plan. Is it any surprise the U.S. health care system has been ranked last among developed countries?
Worse, we have another embarrassing statistic to report: medical bankruptcy. As health care costs continue to rise, many patients can’t afford to pay their medical bills. A recent study revealed that many patients deal not only with hefty hospital bills, but also lost wages and even unemployment when they are ill. It’s also important to remember that medical bills remain the number one reason for bankruptcy in the United States.
Four years ago, experts in medical bankruptcy grew tired of seeing families lose their homes because of medical debt. To solve this problem, these experts founded a nonprofit organization called RIP Medical Debt (RMD).
Like a mortgage, some medical debt is discounted and sold on the open market as a commodity. In some cases, the debt can be purchased for pennies on the dollar. The buyers then own the debt and recover whatever payment they can.
RMD purchases such debt and then raises donations to settle the account. For example, a donation of $15,000 can absolve $1M of medical debt. Over four years, the organization has retired millions of dollars of debt for patients and their families. While I applaud this program, its very existence speaks volumes about the inadequacies of health insurance in the U.S.
As I write this blog, the stock market has stumbled due to the looming threat of trade warfare between the United States and China. If this crisis continues, the price of imported goods will rise for American businesses and consumers. If so, companies may trim their health care benefits, and shift the burden onto employees through higher premiums and higher deductibles. Such changes will nudge many employees even closer to financial ruin if they get sick.
The current national political agenda is aimed at creating more jobs for Americans. Unless those jobs offer adequate health insurance, medical bills will devour wages. If elected officials are serious about helping Americans, they should stop playing political football with health insurance.
Only a stable single-payer system, similar to Medicare, will keep the average American family secure in times of illness. If armed with national price control like Medicare, such a plan can tackle the escalation of health care costs.

Abstract
This analysis draws upon data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and other cross-national analyses to compare health care spending, supply, utilization, prices, and health outcomes across 13 high-income countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These data predate the major insurance provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In 2013, the U.S. spent far more on health care than these other countries. Higher spending appeared to be largely driven by greater use of medical technology and higher health care prices, rather than more frequent doctor visits or hospital admissions. In contrast, U.S. spending on social services made up a relatively small share of the economy relative to other countries. Despite spending more on health care, Americans had poor health outcomes, including shorter life expectancy and greater prevalence of chronic conditions.

Total health spending is a function of both price paid to providers or for drugs and the volume of services used. These charts explore prices and use of health services in the U.S. relative to comparable countries (those with both a total GDP above the median for OECD countries and a per capita GDP greater than the OECD median). While available data are limited to select services and drugs, we find that higher prices – more so than utilization – explain the United States’ high health spending relative to other high-income countries.
The U.S. has higher prices for most health care services and prescription drugs, according to available internationally comparable data. Meanwhile, utilization of several services, including physician consultations and hospital stays, is lower than in many comparable countries. Use of some services, such as C-sections and knee replacements, is higher in the U.S. than in similar countries.
Despite having fewer office visits and shorter average hospital stays, the U.S. overall spends twice as much per person on healthcare than do comparable countries.
These charts accompany an analysis showing how prices for health services in the U.S. have grown over time.

On average, other wealthy countries spend half as much per person on healthcare than the U.S.
In 2016 the U.S. spent 18% of its GDP on healthcare, whereas the next highest country (Switzerland) devoted 12% of its GDP to healthcare. The average amount spent on healthcare per person in comparable countries ($5,198) is half that of the U.S. ($10,348).
The U.S. has fewer physician consultations per capita than most comparable countries
Aside from Sweden, the U.S. has the fewest physician consultations per capita among similarly wealthy countries. In 2015, comparable countries saw an average of 7.6 total consultations per person at physician offices, hospital outpatient departments, and emergency rooms, while the U.S. averaged 3.9 consultations per person.
The U.S. has fewer physicians per capita relative to similar countries (2.6 per 1,000 in 2013 compared to the comparable country average of 3.4).
The U.S. has consistently had fewer physician consultations per capita than comparable countries
In 2000, the U.S. had about 46% fewer physician consultations per capita than similarly wealthy countries, and the gap has remained generally consistent over time. In 2015, comparable countries saw an average of 7.6 consultations per person at physician offices, hospital outpatient departments, and emergency rooms, while the U.S. averaged 3.9 consultations per person.
Patients in the U.S. have much shorter average hospital stays than patients in comparable countries
Shorter hospital stays can potentially be more cost-effective than longer ones – assuming no change in the effectiveness and quality of care – but they may also result in higher costs and service intensity per day. U.S. patients experience shorter hospital stays on average (6 days) than patients in comparable countries (10 days).
The U.S. has consistently had much shorter average hospital stays than patients in comparable countries
The average length of stay has steadily decreased over time due to changes in medical guidelines and practices, improved technology, and shifts in hospital reimbursement and financial constraints. The U.S. and most comparable countries have seen hospitals visits shorten at a similar pace since 1994.
The average nightly hospital price is slightly higher in the U.S. than in Switzerland, and much higher than in Australia
Hospital spending represents 32% of total health spending in the U.S. Average prices for select health services in the U.S. (based on employer-based insurance claims and patient cost-sharing) and a few comparable countries are available from the International Federation of Health Plans. Although hospital stays are shorter on average in the U.S., the average price of a night in the hospital is far higher in the U.S. than in Australia, and slightly higher than in Switzerland.
The U.S. averages fewer angioplasty and more bypass surgeries than most comparable countries
The U.S. performs fewer angioplasty and slightly more coronary bypass surgeries on average relative to comparable OECD countries. Both procedures are used to treat heart disease, but bypass surgery is generally recommended for patients with more severe heart disease.
The average price of an angioplasty or bypass in the U.S. is higher than in comparable countries
The U.S. performs fewer angioplasties and more coronary bypass surgeries than comparable countries, but its average prices for both procedures are substantially higher than in comparable countries where data are available. According to the International Federation of Health Plans, the average price of an angioplasty in the U.S. is 183% higher than in Australia, which sees the next-highest price among those comparable countries with available data. The average price per coronary bypass surgery in the U.S is 129% more than Switzerland’s next-highest average.
The U.S. performs more caesarean sections than most comparably wealthy countries
The U.S. performs more caesarean sections than most comparable countries, although the rate of cesarean deliveries in the U.S. has declined slightly after increasing nearly 60% between 1996 and 2009 to peak of 32.9% of live births. Although caesarean section deliveries may be necessary in certain cases, they are often performed unnecessarily, are more expensive and often pose more risks for mother and child than a natural delivery.
Access & Affordability
Outpatient telehealth use soared early in the COVID-19 pandemic but has since receded
The average price of a caesarean section in the U.S. is higher than in comparable countries with available data
In 2014, the price of a normal delivery in the U.S. averaged $10,808, about 33% less than the average price of a caesarean section ($16,106). Compared to similar countries for which data are available, prices for both types of deliveries are much higher on average in the U.S.
The U.S. leads most comparable countries in MRI availability and use
The U.S. has more MRI units available per million population than most comparable countries have on average, and it performs more MRI examinations per 1,000 people than the comparable country average. This correlation is not necessarily found in other similarly wealthy countries. For example, France has a below-average number of MRI units available per million population but an above-average volume of MRI exams performed. Medical practice patterns or cultural trends driving demand may be contributing to the utilization of medical technology.
The average price of an MRI in the U.S. is significantly higher than in comparable countries
In 2014, the U.S. performed more MRI exams than most similarly wealthy countries at an average price of $1,119 per MRI. This was 42% more than the average price in the United Kingdom, 122% more than the average price in Switzerland, and 420% more than the average price in Australia. According to the International Federation of Health Plans, the national 95th percentile average price of an MRI in the U.S. is $3,031.
The average price of an appendectomy in the U.S. is at least double the average price in comparable countries
While fewer appendectomies are performed on average in the United Kingdom compared to the U.S., the price per surgery in the U.S. is $15,930 – nearly double the price in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, in Australia and Switzerland, where far more appendectomies are performed on average than in comparable countries, the price of each surgery is even less, at only $3,814 in Australia and $6,040 in Switzerland.
The U.S. performs more knee replacements than comparably wealthy countries
Both the U.S. and similarly wealthy countries for which data are available have seen an increase in the number of total knee replacements performed since 2000, though the U.S. has consistently performed more of these surgeries. In 2014, the U.S. saw an average of 227 total knee replacements performed per 100,000 population, compared to the average of 180 per 100,000 in similarly wealthy countries.
The average price of a knee replacement in the U.S. is higher than in comparable countries with available data
The average price of a knee replacement in the U.S. was $28,184 in 2014, 40% more than the average price in Switzerland, 53% more than in the United Kingdom, and 77% more than in Australia.
The average price of a hip replacement in the U.S. is higher than in comparable countries with available data
The average price of a hip replacement in the U.S. is much more than the average price in those comparable countries for which data is available.
The average price of a colonoscopy is higher in the United Kingdom than in the U.S.
The average price of a colonoscopy in the United Kingdom is 135% more than the average price in the U.S.
The average price of Humira in the United States is about 96% higher than in the United Kingdom
Humira, prescribed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is priced 96% higher in United States than in the United Kingdom and 225% higher than in Switzerland, according to data from the International Federation of Health Plans. For the U.S., these data reflect the average payments made, including insurance and patient cost-sharing, but does not reflect rebates.
The average price of Xarelto in the U.S. is more than double the price in the United Kingdom
Xarelto, a drug prescribed to prevent or treat blood clots, is priced more than twice as high in the United States, on average, than in the United Kingdom or Switzerland.
The average price of Harvoni in the U.S. is 42% higher than in the United Kingdom
Harvoni, a high-cost specialty drug prescribed to treat Hepatitis C, is priced 42% higher in the United States, on average, than in the United Kingdom and 90% higher than in Switzerland.
The average price of Truvada in the United States is 44% higher than in Switzerland
Truvada, prescribed to treat HIV/AIDS, is priced 44% higher in the United States, on average, than in Switzerland, and 89% higher than in the United Kingdom.
The average price of Tecfidera in the United States is 174% higher than in Switzerland
On average in the United States, Tecfidera (prescribed to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis) is priced 174% higher than in Switzerland, and 668% higher than in the United Kingdom.
The average price of Avastin in the United States is 124% higher than in Switzerland
Avastin, prescribed to treat some cancers, is priced 124% higher in Switzerland, on average, and 125% higher than in the United Kingdom. Unlike some other drugs included in the International Federation of Health Plans, the price range for Avastin is relatively large; the 25th percentile was $2,289 and the 95th percentile was $8,831 in 2014.

T he United States has a complex health-care delivery system composed of private and government-funded insurance plans. Half of all Americans receive their health insurance from their employer or their spouse’s employer. Over 40 percent of Americans receive their health insurance from the government. The remainder are either uninsured or obtain health insurance through the private individual market. The current political debate concerns how large a role the government should play in our health-care delivery system.
The United States spends far more money per person on health care than other industrialized countries. Last year, overall medical spending in the U.S. totaled $3.5 trillion or 18 percent of the national gross domestic product.
Because other countries spend less on health care, they are often used as models for the U.S. Looking to other countries to solve our health care delivery system problems, however, may not be reasonable. Other countries are smaller than the U.S. and have more homogenous populations. What the people of one country favor may not be applicable or acceptable to people living in a different society.
According to a Forbes survey, the U.S. accounts for 38 percent of life-saving and life-extending medical innovations, compared to an average of 15 percent in other countries. The U.S. also leads the world in the research and development of pharmaceuticals.
In all other industrialized countries, the demand for health care is much greater than the money budgeted for it. The results of this supply/demand mismatch are chronic shortages followed by strict rationing of health care. The rationing can take many forms — from long waits, to denying the elderly access to certain procedures, to allowing individuals with political influence to receive priority attention from providers.
Canada has a truly single-payer, nationalized system that is totally funded by taxpayers. In 2018, wait times for specialty care averaged 20 weeks. In practice, Canada has a two-tiered system in the sense that officials allow their citizens to travel to the U.S. for privately funded health care.
Great Britain established a comprehensive government health-care system in 1948 that gives every citizen cradle-to-grave coverage. About 10 percent of the population has private insurance, and many physicians combine government entitlement work with private practice. Over the past year, 250,000 citizens have waited more than six months for planned treatments within the National Health Service, while 36,000 people have waited nine months or more.
Switzerland has a comparatively large private health-care sector, and patients are responsible for 30 percent of their own health-care costs. Consequently, a certain degree of health-care consumerism exists in Switzerland, and the country has been fairly successful in holding down costs. Unfortunately, as officials increase the number of benefit mandates required in insurance plans, health-care costs are rising.
Singapore has a multi-tiered system with different levels of care depending on the patient’s ability and willingness to pay more. This is similar to the system in the U.S. before the passage of Medicare and Medicaid: private hospitals and doctors treated paying patients and charity hospitals and residents-in-training cared for low-income patients.
Is there some combination of measures from other countries that the U.S. can use in reforming our health-care delivery system? Although the overall systems vary, the common factor for all other countries is government-mandated health insurance. Even those countries that have a component of “private” health care continue to mandate that every citizen have government-approved health insurance.
While universal health insurance coverage is a worthy goal, the critical point is using the best mechanism to allow the greatest number of Americans access to health care. Simply having health insurance in no way guarantees timely access to health care. The American experience with the Veterans Administration hospital system, a comprehensive, government-controlled, single-payer health-care program, reveals unacceptable wait times and huge inefficiencies.
The United States distinguishes itself from other countries by a broader use of free markets. Just like all other economic activities, the free market offers the best solution to provide the greatest access to health care and to control costs.
Instead of looking to other countries, health-care reform in the U.S. should allow Americans to freely make their own health-care decisions and use their own health-care dollars. This would give Americans the best chance to use their right to access health care. Eliminating third-party payers, greater use of health savings accounts, price transparency, and health insurance reform would put patients, rather than the government, in charge of their own health care.

What you pay into the healthcare system become other people's incomes. As Americans spend more than 18% GDP on healthcare, any significant cutback from here mean - lose of jobs, lose of incomes, .... even though we do see nations have better healthcare measured by overall populations than US and spend less in GDP (Australia, Japan, ...), a sudden cutback on people's incomes, you know what will happen.
One thing for sure - keep the doctor who treat you and you trust highly paid but cut incomes of others won't work, definitely won't.

Doctors can get by on 400k a year (like they do in the UK)- they don't need to be paid millions.

PLASTIC (Cosmetic) surgeons in HOLLYWOOD ... to make celebrities ... AGELESS ...
Wonder if that will be covered in MEDICARE-FOR-ALL ...
I guess the rest of us will just ... sag ...

Doctors making millions? Where the hell did you pull that number from (besides your backside!?)
Drew Krenke • 2 years ago
Fair enough - so how much do you think they make?
And to answer your fair question - I got it from a documentary where they were comparing the US to the UK system.   I don't really know how accurate that is - it was the comparison they made.

The pay depends significantly on the specialty ranging from $590k for Cardiologists to Pediatricians/Family Care at around $230K. The top specialists do make a very good living but this is after years of training (and debt) and something few doctors are able to do. Also the pay does vary significantly depending on location--doctors get paid better in NYC/Boston/etc than in Omaha.

Say what?   I'm in the medical field and know many doc's. They do get paid well, but I can only think a a very same group that get  that much.

According to Lancet (an authoritative medical magazine) , Japan's healthcare system performs best in G7. Of course, you know Japan also constantly has the highest life expectancy in the world. You can google to find out good and bad in Japanese healthcare system but bottom line -- it is better than US and spends less in GDP plus people live longer.
Again, as I posted before -- what you paid into the healthcare system has become other people's incomes. As more than 18% of GDP is sucked into the system, don't blame a few lowly paid administrators for all problems. Of course, no one wants to lose his job or see his income drops.
Again, keep the doctor treat you (whom you trust) well paid but cut everyone else won't work, definitely won't.
There is little hope as so many voters in the food chain.

We have seen the nightmares with the VA. Do you really want to government to run your healthcare?
jdondet • 2 years ago
I will say this about the VA, they did spot and treat a cancerous growth that I had growing within me. However, I also couldn't get treated by the VA when I had bronchitis recently--I hadn't made an appointment. It is a mixed bag when it comes to healthcare.

I bet. Granted, they are under-pressure to do a better job.
What many folks don't know. Medicares low cost is co-funded by our private insurance. That why we are seeing our cost go up.

I thought it was supposedly paid for by the employer and the worker. I know there was a Medicare deduction that was made on my paycheck every two weeks. That is while I drew a paycheck because I am what you call retired these days. But it wouldn't surprise me that the government has its tendrils elsewhere also.

Isn't medical care simply a service or commodity like any other? Pay for what you want or when it's needed but how any individual does that should be a personal choice not determined by any third party except by choice.

Aah, but don't you know that healthcare is a right?  The Donkeys say so.
I, however, have a different take.  I do not believe that one can make something a "right" that someone else must be compelled to provide- that is the essence of slavery.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's a document from Austrade about medtech exports to the United States. It seems like the US has a big medical technology market, and it's growing. They mention things like e-health, remote care, personalized medicine, mobile health apps, portable diagnostics, and 3D printing as trends that are gaining traction in the US. It also talks about how the US is a net exporter of medtech, but Australia has some room to increase its share in that market.

This gives me an idea that the US is innovative and open to new technologies in medicine. But I need to connect this to cultural beliefs and values. Maybe the American emphasis on innovation and individualism drives the adoption of new medical technologies.

Next, there's an article from KevinMD about why US healthcare is so costly compared to other developed countries. It says that while the US uses fewer doctors' visits, hospitalizations, and hospital days, it uses more expensive technologies like surgical and cardiovascular procedures and imaging studies. So, it seems like the US is investing in high-tech medical interventions, which probably aligns with the cultural value placed on advanced technology and seeking the best possible medical care, even if it's costly.

The article also mentions that the US has a higher life expectancy and lower maternal and infant mortality compared to other wealthy nations, but when you look at states like Minnesota, they perform well, while states like Mississippi don't. This suggests that there's variability within the US, and access to healthcare plays a big role.

Then, there's a PubMed article that compares health care spending, supply, utilization, prices, and health outcomes across 13 high-income countries, including the US. It finds that the US spends much more on health care, primarily due to higher use of medical technology and higher prices, not because of more frequent doctor visits or hospital admissions. This reinforces the idea that Americans prefer or are more likely to use high-tech medical interventions.

Moreover, the US spends less on social services relative to other countries, which might indicate a different set of priorities. Perhaps Americans prioritize individual health care over social services, reflecting a more individualistic approach.

Another source from the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker provides specific data on healthcare prices and utilization in the US compared to other countries. It shows that while the US has fewer physician consultations and shorter hospital stays, the prices for services and procedures are much higher. For example, the average price of an MRI in the US is significantly higher than in comparable countries.

This suggests that not only are Americans using more high-tech services, but they're also paying more for them. Maybe the combination of high demand for technology and lack of price controls leads to higher costs.

The article also mentions that the US performs more caesarean sections and knee replacements than most comparable countries, which could be due to a variety of factors, including patient preference, physician practice patterns, or even legal considerations like avoiding malpractice lawsuits.

Another point is that the US has more MRI units available per million population and performs more MRI examinations per person than the comparable country average. This could be because of greater availability of technology, higher patient demand, or perhaps defensive medicine practices.

Looking at drug prices, the US generally pays higher prices for medications compared to other countries. This is likely due to a lack of price regulation in the US, allowing pharmaceutical companies to set higher prices.

Now, considering all this, how do American cultural beliefs and values influence the use of medical technology?

First, individualism is a core American value. People place a high value on personal autonomy and making their own choices. In the context of health care, this might translate into a desire to choose the best possible treatments, including the latest technologies, even if they are expensive.

Second, there's a strong belief in progress and innovation in American culture. There's an optimism that new technologies can solve problems and improve lives. This likely extends to medical technology, where there's an expectation that the newest treatments are the best.

Third, the US has a history of prioritizing scientific and technological advancement. The government invests heavily in research and development, and there's a culture that celebrates scientific achievements. This environment fosters the development and adoption of new medical technologies.

Fourth, the US healthcare system is largely market-driven, with a mix of private insurance and public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The market incentives can drive the adoption of new technologies, as hospitals and providers may invest in the latest equipment to attract patients and stay competitive.

However, there are also factors related to healthcare costs and access. The high cost of medical technology in the US may make it less accessible to some people, especially those without good insurance coverage. This could lead to disparities in who gets to benefit from these technologies.

Additionally, the US healthcare system is complex, with multiple payers and varying levels of coverage. This can make it difficult to negotiate prices for medical technologies, leading to higher costs overall.

Religion and spirituality also play a role in American culture and can influence healthcare decisions. Some religious groups may have specific beliefs about certain medical treatments, which could affect their use of technology in healthcare.

Moreover, there's a trend towards patient empowerment and involvement in healthcare decisions. Patients are increasingly seeking information and wanting to be active participants in their care. This might lead to higher demand for advanced technologies, as patients seek out the best possible treatments.

On the other hand, there's also a growing awareness of the potential overuse of medical technology and the associated costs. There's a movement towards evidence-based medicine and value-based care, which aim to ensure that treatments are effective and provide good value for money.

In conclusion, American cultural beliefs and values, such as individualism, belief in progress and innovation, and a market-driven approach, influence the use of medical technology by driving demand for the latest and most advanced treatments, even if they are expensive. However, this comes with challenges related to cost and access, which are subjects of ongoing debate and reform efforts in the US healthcare system.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{American cultural beliefs and values, such as individualism, belief in progress and innovation, and a market-driven approach, influence the use of medical technology by driving demand for the latest and most advanced treatments, even if they are expensive.}} \]
