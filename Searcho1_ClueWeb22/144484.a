I've been asked to consider why organic agriculture might be considered bad. Now, I know that organic farming is often promoted as a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to grow crops and raise livestock. It avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and emphasizes soil health and biodiversity. But, like any system, it has its drawbacks. I need to think carefully about this and perhaps look up some information to get a balanced view.

First off, one potential issue with organic agriculture is that it generally has lower yields compared to conventional farming methods. That means that organic farms might produce less food per hectare. This could be a problem when we're trying to feed a growing global population. If organic farming can't produce as much food as conventional methods, it might not be the best solution for ensuring food security worldwide.

Another possible drawback is that organic products often cost more than their conventionally grown counterparts. This is because organic farming can be more labor-intensive and requires more management practices to control pests and maintain soil fertility without chemicals. Higher costs could make organic foods less accessible to lower-income families, potentially limiting their dietary choices.

I also recall that some studies have suggested that organic farming might require more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farming, due to those lower yields. If that's the case, expanding organic agriculture could lead to more deforestation and loss of natural habitats, which would be counterproductive from an environmental perspective.

On the other hand, organic farming promotes biodiversity and can be better for soil health in the long run. It also avoids the use of synthetic pesticides, which can have negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. So, there are definitely advantages to organic methods.

But the question is asking why organic agriculture might be considered bad. Maybe I should look into some specific examples or studies that highlight the limitations of organic farming.

Let me try searching for information on the drawbacks of organic agriculture.

Advantages and disadvantages of Organic Farming
Organic farming is a method of growing crops, fruits, vegetables, etc. maintaining the quality of soil and ecological balance in the environment. It relies on local natural conditions of the surroundings rather than using inputs (like fertilizers, pesticides, etc.) that may lead to adverse effects on the environment.
Organic farming is a combined production system that involves tradition, innovation, and science to promote a good quality of life for us and benefits the ecosystem equally. It is an advanced technique that uses natural ways of cultivation to minimize pollution and wastage in the environment.
The IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is a worldwide organization established in 1972. IFOAM initiated the movement to promote organic farming to protect the people and the environment from the negative impacts of chemical-based fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones, etc.
Organic cultivation has been proved a beneficial production system to maintain our health. However, it has some drawbacks that show the negative aspects of these farming methods. Here, you will find out the pros and cons of organic farming.
Table of Contents[show]
Advantages of Organic Farming
Organic farming is becoming very popular worldwide. People have started using organic products; hence organic cultivation is trending rapidly. These are the major advantages of organic production methods that highlight its popularity.
No chemicals for resistance to pests and diseases
Organic farming creates natural levels of resistance to control pests and diseases instead of chemical-based pesticides. It eliminates the use of synthetic products to improve the productivity of the crops.
These farming methods permit only natural soil enhancement techniques rather than using fertilizers to maximize the yield.
Supports healthier soil and pollinators
It is one of the most crucial advantages of organic farming. The application of synthetic agricultural chemicals is one of the biggest problems for pollinators like bees. For example- Glyphosate and neonicotinoids are majorly responsible for devastating certain pollinators’ populations. Well, organic farming supports pollinators as it does not include chemical-based boosters.
At the same time, the soil in organic procedures is known to produce healthier items with higher antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin E, etc.
Does not use genetically-modified food items
One of the best parts of organic farming is that it does not use genetically modified food. The organic farmers are only permitted to cross-breed to encourage natural production levels. They are not permitted to use industry-based products to grow crops for market purposes.
A healthy environment for the farmers to work
Organic farming is beneficial not only for the health of the soil, food, and people who consume organic food but also beneficial for the farmers themselves. The organic farmers are not exposed to harmful synthetic ingredients as they manage their fields on a daily basis.
On the other hand, the farming procedures that involve chemical ingredients for cultivation are prone to develop health issues in the future such as neurological disease, headache, the myriad of bothersome symptoms, migraines, etc.
Organic farmers use natural fertilizers
Farming needs fertile soil to improve productivity. Organic farming methods improve soil fertility by using natural fertilizers prepared at the farming location, unlike conventional farming. The natural fertilizers used in organic processes help to encourage better yield.
Conventional farming uses chemical-based fertilizers that eventually destroy the fertility of the soil. Organic farmers use various methods to maintain the fertility of the soil—for example- crop rotation, green manure, composting, worm farming, etc.  Therefore, this involves various advantages of organic farming.
Produces healthier food
Organic farming is a natural process of producing food, hence the nutrition level of this food is quite high as compared to food produced through conventional farming. Since the fruits and vegetables grown through organic methods take a long time to flourish, hence it is obvious that they are much tastier and nutritious.
For example- Peaches grown in organic farms taste much better as it contains higher polyphenol.
In short, it can be said that organic farming relies on quality production, whereas conventional farming believes in quantity production.
Offers profitable niche crop opportunities to organic farmers
Organic farming provides a very good opportunity to commence diversifying the products that we cultivate every year. Conventional farmers rely on cash crops to earn profits. For example, we cultivate Soybean and corn as major cash crops to earn great profits.
Organic farmers can grab this opportunity to grow various food items that can be sold throughout the year. For example, – Heirloom crops are great opportunities for organic farmers that taste much better and are nutritious at the same time. Even the seeds of heirloom crops are quite affordable than hybrid ones.
The Eco-friendly method of cultivation
If we look at the present scenario, then environmental protection is our basic priority. No matter which field we belong to but the important thing is that our every approach should be eco-friendly. Talking about farming processes, organic farming benefits the climate as it stores carbon in the soil.
It helps to minimize energy usage as the methods require physical labour more often than mechanical equipment. It also reduces the emission of greenhouse gases helping the ecosystem.
Disadvantages of organic farming
Although organic farming is beneficial for our health and environment, it also has some disadvantages as well. The cons of organic procedures mainly include these problems.
Expensive food items
One of the major disadvantages of organic farming is that organic food is more expensive than the food produced through the conventional farming method.
High production cost
Production cost in organic farming is quite higher as it requires more manpower. We can also associate it with inefficient marketing as distribution along with production is minimal than conventional farming.
Rarely subsidized farming method.
Any kind of subsidies does not offer most of the organic farmers. Without any subsidy, there will always be a huge risk involved in organic procedures such as weather changes or crop failure, etc.
Insufficient knowledge & skills
The organic farmers should have sufficient knowledge and skills about localized soil systems, meteorology, ecology, and other factors that influence crop growth. Without the proper knowledge, an individual organic farmer will be unable to protect his crop in critical stages that may arise while farming processes.
The crop is susceptible to illness.
The crops are easily susceptible to illness that may slow down the production. Organic foods have a shorter shelf life as compared to conventional food. The reason is that we do not treat the organic food materials with waxes or preservatives, unlike conventional methods, to store it for a long time.
Low yield
Organic farming is unable to fulfil the world’s demand for food to survive. It may lead to starvation in the countries that are producing enough food for the survival of their population.
Rigorous certification procedure
Organic farms have to go through tough certification processes.  Also, it involves a certain certification amount. It is mandatory to meet organic standards. If an organic farm fails to meet these standards, it may have to face the consequences.
Organic farming is a better choice for the environment as it helps to minimize the pollution level. At the same time, it protects us from the side-effects of harmful chemicals used in conventional farming methods.
Organic products are much healthier as grown in natural conditions through natural methods. It provides healthy nutrients, minerals, vitamins, proteins, fibres, etc. to us, simultaneously, it helps to maintain the environmental sustainability.
So, these are some advantages and disadvantages of organic farming through which we can develop more effective technologies so that they can limit its demerits.

Three major arguments are given by the opponents of organic farming/agriculture (Details below). Do you agree/disagree with these arguments?
Three major arguments are given by the opponents of organic farming/agriculture, these are:
1. not sufficient organic inputs are available
2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming
3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic.
Do you agree/disagree with these arguments. Please only reply if you have more than five years practical experience in organic farming/agriculture. My simple meaning to organic agriculture is efficient utilization or recycling of mainly the local resources (flora, fauna, soil, water and society) following all ecological principals and avoiding the use of  synthetic chemicals. Leave aside certified organic farming.

1. There is sufficient organic materials available, It is the photosynthesis that regulate the net primary productivity.
2, Yields will often go down when converting from high-input systems, but can often increase when converting from low input systems. There are many ways to influence yields in farming and this is not a major limitation for oa. In addition, the overarching problem for farmers of the world is overproduction....
3.Most nutrients are mediated by microorganisms and they are certainly impacted by the form nutrients are in.

Great thread.  Here are my thoughts on the three points:
1. not sufficient organic inputs are available
This, I think, is the most difficult of the three questions.  I think Kunuthur captures the essence of what I would say, which is that nutrients exist in a cycle. Both the size and rate of that cycle can be manipulated over time.  The cycle in agriculture has losses from 1) leeching of nutrients our of the system and 2) removal of nutrients from crop harvest. In the conventional argument people focus on the second aspect, and argue that low-input farming methods cannot cope with the losses of nutrients due to crop harvest. Organic farming methods tend to do a lot to increase the total size of the nutrient cycle and enhance the total potential fertility of a soil, which is an undeniably good thing. As Kunuthur points out these will take time to create realized effects in the soils. But allowing for localized inputs, particularly from very high nutrient loads such as waste water, natural erosion, areas of high nutrient uplift (from deep rooted plants), etc. I would argue that organic methods can supply the needed nutrients for global level food production needed to feed 10 billion people.  I don't think we could do it yet, due to lack of investment and infrastructure, which leads into the next point.
2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming
No...total disagree. Indigenous agro-forestry systems in several areas around the world have shown yields of 15 tons/ha, more than conventional corn, wheat, or soy yields in industrial farming.  Furthermore, the efforts in plant breeding in particular over the last 200 years have been focused on industrial type, mono-cropped systems. The very, very few plant breeding facilities that are focusing on organic systems have shown huge gains in yield when breeding plants for organic systems. So growing plants bred for industrial type agriculture in organic systems and then saying they don't perform as well is a rigged game, and of course they are going to do worse.  Just like if we bred plant for an organic system and grew them in a fertilizer heavy system they would perform worse...in fact could possibly die due to being "burnt" from high fertilizer exposure.  You can't compare the current state of the two system when one system has received over 99% of the agricultural funding over the last 200 years, and even with that case there are again agro-forestry systems that still show comparable and in rare cases higher yields.
3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic.
I hate this question.  As a soil biogeochemist I have to say that yes, plants can't differentiate between the two.  It's just like an artificial vs. a natural flavoring (which only differ in the source from which the are distilled)....if you give two vials to a chemist he cannot tell which is which.  Chemically the individual molecules perform exactly the same. But my problem with this very reductionist argument is that as a whole I would say that the soil can tell because an inorganic source of nutrients in not going to come with the suite of other elements and constituents that an organic source comes with. If you just pour on nitrogen without, for instance, all the carbon that comes with organic sources that is greatly going to change the microbial community, the balance of nitrogen to everything else in the soil, and therefore the entire nutrient cycle. So while chemically I aatgree plants cant tell the difference, I think they can tell of the imbalance of the source (which can happen with organic sources too).

In reference to your first question I would suggest that depending on your Bio Region
There may be a shortage of appropriately mineralized biomass for your soil requirements. Biomass can not supply minerals not in supply in the soil it comes from. For instance in Western Canada there are dramatic shortages of phosphorus in the soil. High concentration organic source material with complimentary mineral balances is how I make soil adjustments for optimum growth and nutrient values. This does not currently work with all local biomass sources. I bring in seed meals, from oilpressing,usually an animal feed, as a bulk npk correction. It is High in phophorus and low in pottasium, that we have far too much of in our soils. This works hear because seed meal is shipped in bulk train cars from the canadian praries and can be had at relatively low cost. If This was Not available I would probably use concentrated rock phosphorus with local biomass for humus and nitrogen. This would be the most reasonable alternative for phosphorus deficiency in my opinion as all most no other reasonable sources are available and unrefined rock phosphorus is far too High in both lead and cadmium to be healthy. Phosphorus deficiency is common in many parts of the world. I would refer you to a free online library of excellent resources at soilsandhealth.org in reference to your other questions for in depth answers.

Regarding your second question you could consult the following papers:
1.) Seufert, V. et al. Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture. Nature 485, 229–232 (2012)
2.) Badgley, C. et al. Organic agriculture and the global food supply. Renew. Agr. Food Syst. 22, 86–108 (2007)
To put it in a nutshell: yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics. You can find examples of high differences (>40% lower organic yields), examples of nearly equal yields, and some sources even report yield gains under organic agriculture compared to conventional. However, not all of these studies are uncontroversial.

Regarding the first problem I would propose to use the unconventional sources of nutrients which includes not only the organics but some naturally occurring rocks and minerals. These rocks and minerals contain significant amount of plant nutrient but as such not fully available to plant . Some modification (physical/chemical/biological)is required to make the nutrient available to plant. For example phosphocompost  is made by enrich ordinary compost with rock phosphate during composting process which is an excellent source of phosphorus

In regard to your first question there is lot of locally available and farm generated organic resources are available. If these available resources are effectively utilized they contribute more towards organic inputs
Regarding second question, yield level in organic system may goes down in initial years. If, organic system is followed continuously defnitely it will increase the yield. Once organic carbon content is build up in soil by organic farming and increased nutrient supply continuously will increase the yield.
Regarding third question plants can't differentiate the nutrient sources but it is the matter of pollution of the environment and fertility status of the soil. If we go on depending on inorganic sources of nutrients it will pollute the environment and reduces the inherent productive capacity of the soil in turn leads to decrease in yield levels over a period.

Regarding your 3rd question, organic agriculture uses methods of plant nutrition that are more environmentally sound, requires less inputs overall, and use less energy in the process. Synthetic chemicals disrupt the ecological, biochemical, and chemical balance of soil systems, whereas organic inputs rely on geomicrobiological interactions within the rhizosphere which are driven by the energy of photosynthetic carbon compounds provided by the plant when the plant senses that soil nutrients are deficient.

For your 2nd question.
if you change to use organic fertilizer from inorganic, there must be inadequate nutrient supply to plant/root, immobilization process also contribute decreasing yield.
I never use just straight organic matter/fertilizer to supply nutrient in my farm/field.
it take much time for bacteria-fungi-etc to decompose-mineralize nutrient from organic pool.
Organic matter, i believe, not the main source of nutrient supply. Using organic matter as soil conditioner (both physical-chemical-biological aspect).

In reference to your 2nd point, I indeed agree that yield goes down if you rely on organic farming on large scale. With respect to the weed problems that emerge in large scale organic farming, one can imagine that large scale organic farming is not realistic.

I totally agree with all the 3 arguments. However, the only factor these 3 points do not take into account is impact on environment. That is certainly a growing concern all over the world. So, I would say judicious and efficient use of both organic and inorganic is the way forward and the proportion of both depends on the local conditions dictated by availability of organic resources, compeiting demands for organic sources, soil fertility and  crops grown.

But, what about environmental implications? Organic farming may lead to a more "natural" cropping system. However, environmental risk associated to incorrect management may be taking into account. For instance, inadequate rates of organic fertilizers can pollute aquifers and may favor the presence of pests. So it is strongly important to consider how the application of organic materials is and the property of these. Moreover, not only fertility and yield is important, environmental consequences are too.

One point being missed is weed management. In my part of the world organic systems have difficulty dealing with weeds. Either they must cultivate frequently and thus induce soil carbon loss and loss of soil quality, or tolerate higher levels of weeds, which poses serious issues for other farms and surrounding environment. In my opinion organic systems are best suited to tropical systems with high carbon turnover and mineralisation and regions with cheap labour for weeding.

There is an abundance of organic material available for agricultural input, but just adding raw organics to soil is not particularly helpful in the short-term.  Better to compost the organics first, then add to cropland.  Then following yields do not diminish, waiting for the microbial populations to perform nutrient cycling.
Both nutrient cycling and disease control by natural means are totally relative to the volume of the full ACTIVE (not dormant) BENEFICIAL microbial soil community available.  Increase the soil volume of the full microbial community - quick and easy to accomplish on-site, in liquid form, dispensed via existing farm equipment.
Both mulching and cover cropping should be considered in weed control.

That sufficient organic inputs are not available is a misnomer. One can truly state sufficient organic inputs are not MADE available to organic farming due to human failure in preference to synthetic chemical inputs which are subsidized and rule the markets.
Yield levels steadily and linearly increase with time with organic inputs eliminating crop failures as these inputs are eco-friendly and environmentally safe.
All organic inputs undergo mineralization process due to which inorganic nutrients are released slowly and steadily to meet the crop nutrition needs corresponding to their absorption by crops in different stages of their growth and development. Whereas, in case of inorganic inputs, the nutrients are released in very high concentrations much beyond the ability of absorption and needs of crops. It is true that plants can not differentiate between organic and inorganic inputs. But, it should be remembered always that organic inputs provide food for soil sheltered micro and macro flora and fauna which are indispensable to the holistic development of crops both in quality and quantity. Organic inputs thus serve as food for soil biota whereas inorganic inputs destroy the soil biota besides causing pollution of natural resources such as soil, water and air which in turn spoil the quality of crops, animals and finally humans.

Let me conclude as sufficient argue and information has been given by the LEARNED participants from that,  it can be concluded that
1. Sufficient organic inputs are available the need is their integrated and efficient use.
I would like add my experience of arid zone( Rainfall below 500mm)-Availability  at farm level was influenced  by several factors like rainfall, cropping pattern, size of holding, availability of labor etc. In general  most of the places farmers used raw cow dung, kept under sunlight for months and this caused great loss in nutrient availability ,mainly that of the nitrogen. On an average 1.5-4.5 t/ha organic manure was available at farm level in the form of crop residues and animal dung.
-Availability increased at village level  by 1.5-2.0 folds mainly because of some farmers kept animals for dairy purpose. Also there are unproductive  and old animals available  at village level in large numbers. These animals may not give milk but  provide manure  in substantial  quantity. Cattle provided 4.6 to 11 kg/ha/yr ( total agriculture land/total number of animals in the village).Trees are the integral part  of farming system of arid zone and contribute equivalent to 0.04t manure/tree. Trees available in common land ,protected areas, waste land  etc. also contribute to organic input availability at village level Availability further increased at district level as intensive dairy farming  was observed in peri-urban areas. After addition   of organic input availability from all the sources the figure reached to 4.5-5.0 t/ha. This amount of organic input is sufficient for rainfed farming in low rainfall areas. The availability of nutrient can be further increase by adopting following management practices-
1. Crop rotation with leguminous crops like cluster bean, moth bean  moong bean etc.
2. Avoiding heaping of dung under sun and use of improved methods  of  composting. In arid zone due to shortage of water and high temperature  pit composting method has been found most suitable.
3. Tree leaf litter,  animal urine,  bones of dead animals, non palatable weed biomass  are some of the other rich and underutilized sources of nutrients that can suffice the nutrient requirements of the arid zone production system.
Therefore, organic inputs are available in sufficient quantity in low rainfall areas the only need is their efficient utilization.
IF THIS MUCH IS POSSIBILITY IN ARID ZONE THAN CERTAINLY THE SITUATION WILL BE MUCH MORE BETTER IN HIGHER RAINFALL AREAS.
______________________________________________
2.Yield response depends mainly on two conditions A. Drylands where chemicals have been used in limited quantity and soil biological system is not disturbed, with the integrated  application of all eco-technologies the yield start upward growth from the very first year
B. In irrigated areas where heavy chemical are used that disturbed micor- ecosystem of farm/field that need 2-4 years to restore and then either comparable or higher yield than chemical farming is possible and people reported.
THEREFORE NO YIELD LOSS BUT IN ADDITION TO SUSTAINABLE YIELD , ORGANIC FARMING REDUCES COST OF PRODUCTION, HELP IN CLEANER ENVIRONMENT , GENERATE EMPLOYMENT, HEALTHIER PRODUCER AND CONSUMER, CLIMATE RESILIENCE, WATER AND BIODIVERSITY  CONSERVATION ETC. , Yes it need patience and continuous efforts.
Let us just make conditions favourable for nature to work. after all all biological( including agriculture ) is a nature's business only and we are workers and consumer ( or recycler)  of this business house.
____________________________
3.  yes, this is a mis-argument that plant can not differentiate the source of nutrient  that does not mean to feed anything without considering the system as whole, even our tongue cannot differentiate poison and non poison material but still we take care about that.This is rather a  argument to promote the business of chemicals. If we go in depth of science plant  sense/ realise the good and bad for them but they are helpless.
________
My intention for Putting these questions for the members  was to get their views,  spread it among the others  so that all apprehensions and doubts need to cleared. Some of the  replies were based on data of various sources, or assumption without getting field experiences that never works.
I am thankful to all the sincere participants specially Nao Lincoln and KS Reddy.
I choose this date  of world environment day   (5 June) as the organic/ ecological farming  can contribute to great extent for conserving and improving environment.
Thanks a lot, if any of the viewers has real experience please reply in my another question of long term organic farming.

In all entirety and in holistic sense, non human population in every context and imagination far exceeds that of human on Earth if not else where. Whereas, most of the non human species are the silent, sad and helpless sufferers when it comes to sharing of food and shelter resources on Earth. This is simply because of human arrogance of superiority over non humans. It is high time this attitude should die once for all i.e., before nature exhibits its fury as it is already getting manifested as floods, drought, earth quakes, tsunamis, virulence of diseases of unknown etymology. It is in this context, that truthful organic farming systems become pertinent if not indispensable.

I am sorry, I am not a >5 yrs' experienced person to add anything here. I am just learning about these farming systems now. My PhD  work is  comparing organic farming with conventional in terms of ecosystem services. May be because it is not that important to talk about  all the 'ecosystem services' that organic or conventional farming system provide, NOBODY here talked seriously about those services(except some people talked about soil nutrients). How about pollination services provided by those diversified organic farming (vs monoculture based conventional)? Why do people forget about their protein/fiber/oil rich foods pollinated by our pollinators? How about the roles of other beneficial insects like ground beetles (carabidae), parasitoids, and naturals enemies ? Do they not have any role of providing ecosystem services in organic agroecosystems? I do not understand why people (yes, even the educated, experienced people) do not care about other 'ecosystem services' but only talk about yield? Unless we have a overall economic valuation, comparing only the crop yield between two farming doesn't make any sense for our sustainable agriculture industry. I hope people will answer these questions too?

Dear Dr. Sharma,
1. not sufficient organic inputs are available: totally agree, specially in livestock farming.
2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming. It is true in the short-term and in 'conventionalized' organic farms (with simplistic management, just to comply with organic standards -i.e. input substitution-). Regarding the long-term there are different opinions, generally supporting the idea of similar and even higher production levels, and with extra outputs (social and environmental services). Regarding this last point, we should think about how production/productivity is measured: are ecosystem and social services (that also positively influence productivity in the long term) taken into account?
3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic. When discussions come to organic products quality, I prefer to focus the conversation of food safety (chemical residues) instead nutritional quality. The reason is that organic farming is not an unique type of production as it allows/embrace many farms management practices and structures, so that I strongly think that products quality depends of the productoin system (its structure and management) and that this is not a consequence of just being certified as organic.
Regards,
Alfredo J. Escribano.

Now after one year gap  I hope most of us agree that
1. There is no shortage of organic inputs rather the problem is distribution and efficient +  integrated use.
2. Many of the scholars supported that  total output of organic system has been been NEVER  recorded lower than conventional system. This aspect is more discussed in my other question can we compare organic to conventional in terms of yield only ? please see
3.Dr Lincoln given nice reply that  yes, plant as a system can differentiate  source of  nutrient in terms of effect.
Thus  with this whole discussion I may draw a conclusion that  all the three apprehensions are not true  and organic system, if manage prudently ,able to ensure long term food security, soil health and climatic resilience.

I mostly agree with Arun's conclusion above, But again, we need to see in a holistic approach. Why should we compare yield only? There are several other ecosystem services that we need to consider while comparing these two systems. It depends on the context too, since there are many different "types" of the organic or conventional systems. We will get mixed answers if we generalize the case.

Dear Arun,
Below your 3 statements/arguments are my comments.
1. not sufficient organic inputs are available
This should not be a problem for organic agriculture because with this method of farming recycling/composting on site at the farm become a must do practice. Besides this there are many agronomic practices that include: crop rotation, green manuring, companion cropping that aim at regenerating as much as possible soil fertility.
2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming
This statement is refuted by several studies from the Rodale Institute in the US and others that proved that the yields of organic agriculture are comparable to those of conventional farming.
3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic.
I would say here that plans respond beautifully to nutrients that are easily accessible (ex. water soluble) making synthetic fertilizers (salts) very effective in growing plants (when irrigation water is available too). However, the fertility approach embraced in organic farming consists in 'feeding' the soil bacteria first. When the soil microflora is abundant and diverse, then the metabolism carried out by the soil biology will facilitate the process of humification and with it the solubilization and accessibility of nutrients for the plants.

Agricultural experts generally agree that future increases in food production will come from three options:1) expanding the land area, 2) increasing the frequency in which the land is cropped, and 3) raising crop yields through varietal improvement and better crop management. The first and second options are close to the limit and we are left with the third option. Do you think improved varieties and better management practices will be the key to future increases in food production?

4 Challenges of Organic Farming that you Should Know
Vasilis Bouronikos | 23 June, 2020 | 3 min(s) read
Organic products are often appraised for their benefits to health and the environment. There is a lot of hype around organic and not wrongly so. But when it comes to farming and producing organic food, you should be aware that it also requires a lot of effort to deal with. the many challenges of organic farming.
However, young and farmers interested in joining the organic farming bandwagon should not be deterred from it. Instead, they should be aware of them in order to make an informed choice and be better prepared to deal with those challenges.
So, what are the main problems of organic agriculture? Let’s find out.
The Challenges of Organic Farming that Farmers Have to Deal With
1. Time is Critical
One of the main problems of organic farming is that of timing. This does not concern all cases, but generally, organic produce and meats require efficient supply chains to reach the market quicker.
The main difference between organic from conventional farming methods is using fewer chemicals throughout food production. But despite the obvious health benefits, organic products are generally more susceptible to decay for various reasons. From temperature fluctuations during transportation and generally less forgiving shelf life, organic products need to be consumed sooner to ensure food safety and appeal.
2.  Pests Want your Organic Products too
Another critical challenge of organic farming is that of pest infestations that are as old as farming itself. Pests such as rodents or insects, if not controlled, are responsible for the destruction of crops. For that reason, humans have been using chemicals known as pesticides to deal with them effectively for a long time now. However, as many of those chemicals are not of natural origin and are toxic to the environment, they are not allowed in organic farming.
As a result, organic producers have to find alternative and effective ways to deal with pests. Even though pesticides are banned from organic farming, there are still some pesticides from natural ingredients that organic farmers can still use. Other ways to dealing with pests include diversified crops, employing traps, mating disruption, or the use of birds and other insects.
3. It is Harder to Market Organic Products
As mentioned above, in organic agriculture it is important that products reach the market quickly in order to remain fresh and nutritious. However, living in a culture where commuting long distances and online ordering is the norm, organic produce is at a disadvantage.
For this reason, organic farmers need to find local channels of distributing their products that may not always be possible. Alternatively, farmers should invest in top-quality climate control vehicles to allow longer transportation. That way, organic products can reach distant markets where demand is high.
4. Limited Supply of Organic Food
One final challenge of organic farming is that production yields are lower compared to conventionally grown food. In addition to lower production, mainly due to not using industrial fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, organic agriculture also requires more land to meet the previous production levels.
To deal with it, farmers should do their homework and plan ahead for their crops. They need to make sure that a specific variety or type of crop is suitable for the area and to make sure that what they cultivate is always in season.

What are the disadvantages of organic food?
The organic industry is on the move: According to data from the Organic Trade Association, more than 82% of U.S. households purchase organic, more than 75% of all sections on supermarket racks offer organic choices and half of the organic operations are expanding their full-time work.
As we know that if something is there then advantages and disadvantages are definitely there the same as organic food. In this article, we discuss some disadvantages of organic food points.
Also read here: Benefits of Organic Food
Disadvantage: The Cost Factor
Let’s begin with the most obvious disadvantage of organic food: It nearly always costs more than conventionally raised food. That’s little surprise when you consider the large list of price- and production-optimization practices that are common on conventional farms but aren’t released on organic farms.
These involve genetically modified organisms, conventional pesticides, herbicides, petroleum-based also sewage-sludge-based manure, antitoxins, increased hormones, and irradiation. Depending on what’s being produced, the lack of organic raw elements can ratchet prices up too.
For many customers of organic food, the mandated loss of these practices is deserving of the increased cost. But the stark fact is that many mortals simply can’t bear the variation in cost.
There’s a different kind of price portion for farmers: The learning curve they need to undergo if they prefer to transition from conventional to organic farming. Suddenly they must master a completely new set of farming policies, with both supervision and experienced workers less readily available than they are for conventional farming.
Possible Disadvantage: Too Costly and Restrictive
Some farms support widely organic production practices but haven’t really pursued organic certification, either because they discover the letter of the organic standards to be too limiting, or because of the additional costs included that they don’t desire to reach on to the customer. (Becoming USDA Certified Organic can cost everywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars.)
While those might be considered disadvantages to the organic label, they’re also a great reason to get to know your local farmers. If you stop by the farmer’s market or farm stand during a time when it’s not very busy, farmers are often happy to discuss their philosophies and farming practices.

15 Disadvantages and Advantages of Organic Farming
Apr 12, 2018 by Brandon Gaille
Organic farming is defined as a production system which works with localized conditions to create products that integrate biological, cultural, and mechanical practices which promote biodiversity.
There are several required components which must be included with the farming process for the crops generated to be labeled as organic. Biological controls must be used, including crop rotation and disease management, instead of chemical controls. The agricultural system must have an emphasis on biodiversity placed on the surrounding environment.
Organic farming must also reduce off-farm inputs and external inputs that may affect the growing process. Renewable resources must be used in some way as well, while synthetic fertilizers musts be completely eliminated.
When done properly, organic farming is able to maintain the balance of an ecosystem. It uses nature as the model to produce needed items.
There are certain advantages and disadvantages of organic farming which must be considered.
List of the Advantages of Organic Farming
1. It creates higher natural levels of resistance to pests and disease.
Organic farming eliminates the use of synthetic products to maximize the yields that can be produced. It works on creating a healthier soil instead, encouraging the link between healthy plants and protected soils. No chemical herbicides or pesticides are used. Only natural soil enhancement techniques are permitted.
Healthy plants, grown in health soil, are naturally resistant to disease and pests. These plants have stronger natural defense mechanisms through this technique, which thickens the cell walls of the plants being grown.
2. Organic farming allows for specialization opportunities.
Conventional farming practices focus on the growth of a specific commodity crop. In the United States, that means soybeans, wheat, or corn are typically grown. Through organic farming practices, there are more opportunities to specialize. That is because the farm produces crops that grow best in the soil composition that is available to the farmer.
The advantage of being able to grow a specialty crop is that these produces usually command a higher price at the market. Organic foods can already be priced about 20% above commodity crops. Specialization can add another 20% to 40% to the final price a customer pays. Many organic farmers can sell directly to their customer base as well, which eliminates the costs that other farmers often pay.
3. This farming process supports a healthier soil and supports pollinators.
One of the biggest risks to bees and other pollinators is a synthetic agricultural chemical application. Glyphosate and neonicotinoids are particularly devastating on certain pollinator populations.
At the same time, soils from organic farms are known to produce items that have higher antioxidant content, Vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids when consistent practices are used. There are higher micronutrient and mineral levels in produced food products through organic farming because organic materials reach into deeper soil layers.
4. There are no worries about genetically modified foods with organic farms.
Organic farming does not use GMO crops at all. Farmers are permitted to cross-breed plants (or animals) to encourage better natural production levels. They are not permitted to use industry-altered products when growing or producing items for the market. This requirement may limit the yields that a farm is able to produce when compared to GMO farming, but it also eliminates the threat of customers leaving because they don’t want to consume GMO products.
5. The working environment for organic farmers is healthier.
Farmers who are involved in the organic farming process are not exposed to potentially dangerous synthetic ingredients as they manage their fields on a daily basis. People who are consistently exposed to chemical pesticides have a higher risk of developing a future neurological disease. Higher levels of lifetime exposure will increase this risk.
Many farmers who use synthetic products will suffer from a myriad of bothersome symptoms over time. Headaches become quite common, including migraine headaches. Fatigue is another common complaint. Increased exposure may also lead to memory loss in some individuals.
6. Organic farmers can often create their own fertilizers at their farming location.
Soil fertility is improved with organic farming methods because natural fertilizers must be used to prepare fields. Several methods are possible, including crop rotation that uses certain fields for pasturelands, for up to 6 years between growing crops. Green manure, worm farming, composting, and cover crops are all effective methods of creating needed fertilizers as well.
7. It can be implemented in almost any geographic location or growing season.
The processes of organic farming store carbon within our soil. It reduces energy requirements. It limits the need for products based on fossil fuels. No matter how long a growing season may be, organic farming efforts can be implemented to maximize the natural production levels that are available.
List of the Disadvantages of Organic Farming
1. There are no subsidies offered for most organic farmers.
Most industrialized countries offer farm subsidies of some type to encourage people to become farmers. Without farmers, it would be difficult to have our food and fuel demands met, after all. Unfortunately, most of the subsidies that are authorized only apply to farmers that are growing commodity products. Without access to subsidies, organic farmers take on many more risks that could wipe them out, such as weather changes or a crop failure.
2. It requires more work to produce goods that are ready for sale.
Organic farming may still allow for certain “organic” fungicides or pesticides, which can reduce the work burden for some. For the average farmer, however, there is a greater physical burden that applies to the production of crops for the marketplace. Pulling weeds and other cultivation techniques must be used frequently.
New ideas in permaculture and biodynamics are changing this negative component of organic farming over time. Compared to commodity farming, there are still many additional labor requirements in organic farming that must be considered.
3. Organic farmers must have specific knowledge about localized growing systems.
The quality of a crop that can be produced through organic farming is heavily reliant on the skills, knowledge, and wisdom of the individual farmer. In organic farming, the farmer must monitor crop growth patterns during every critical stage of growth. If a farmer is unable to recognize a problem that may be present, then the value of the crop may be reduced. In extreme circumstances, crop loss may even occur for some farmers.
At the same time, farmers must also have local knowledge about soil systems, ecology, meteorology, and other influential factors that can affect how certain crops grow.
4. There are unique marketing challenges in place for organic goods.
Organic foods are more expensive than commodity foods or commercially-grown products. The marketplace for organic foods is not as defined as it is for other crops either. That can make it difficult for specialty farmers to compete with their own products.
To counter this issue, many communities are developing food cooperatives with local farmers and markets. For a small fee, customers can “prepay” for organic foods that they can pick-up after the growing season has been completed.
5. Organic farms and foods must go through a rigorous certification process.
In the United States, organic certifying agents that are accredited by the USDA must certify the farms before an organic label can be associated with the crops and products produced. Farms or product processors which create less than $5,000 in gross income from organic sales are exempt from this standard. Otherwise, it is illegal to market a product as being organic.
For many organic farms, that means the organic certifying agent must be hired to verify that the farming methods meet the current organic standards that have been authorized. The total cost of the initial authorization can be as high as $1,500. There are also annual certification fees that must be paid.
The annual certification fees are based on a farm’s total organic production value, which means some farmers may pay the $1,500 fee every year.
6. It usually costs more to be competitive with organic farming.
Outside of the certification costs that are required to begin organic farming in the first place, there are a number of additional start-up costs that must also be considered. Certain soil amendments, such as rock dust, are more expensive for many farmers when compared to the traditional chemicals that may be used in commodity farming.
As soil conditions improve through organic farming processes, the costs in this category usually decline over time. Many organic farmers can maintain healthy soils through composting and other natural methods. That is not a guarantee, however, so some organic farmers may never see cost-savings develop over time compared to neighboring commodity farmers.
7. There are different levels of “organic” permitted in the United States.
There are 4 different levels of organic foods that are permitted in the United States. An item is labeled as 100% organic only if it is produced through a certified process. For a multi-ingredient product, all items must be grown through a certified organic process, although water and salt are excluded.
There is a 95% requirement in place for a food to be labeled as “organic.” That means 5% of the ingredients can be non-organic. In the U.S., there is an approved list of additional ingredients that must be used.
“Made with organic” labels follow the same requirements, allowing 30% of the ingredients to be non-organic. In the U.S., products in this category are not permitted to use the USDA organic seal.
If more than 30% of a product is made from non-organic ingredients, then it cannot be labeled as an “organic” product in any way. It can, however, list specific organic ingredients on its product label.
8. Synthetic chemicals can still be used in organic farming.
In the United States, organic foods are typically free of synthetic pesticides. There are, however, some exceptions to the rule. Organic farmers who can provide that natural pesticides have not worked to control pests are permitted to use synthetic products under specific circumstances. These farmers must show that cultural management practices and other organic practices have failed repetitively.
That means some organic foods being sold are exposed to the same chemicals and processes that commodity and conventional crops have – but with the higher organic prices. For some, that means there is no difference between the different products that are available in local markets.
9. Organic crops generally spoil faster.
Conventional foods are treated with waxes or preservatives to maintain their freshness during the shipping process. Organic foods cannot receive the same treatments. For many products, that means organic versions will spoil faster than conventional versions. If product arrivals are delayed or mishandled for some reason, then an entire shipment or crop may never make it to the market for consumption.
I recommend that you read these 19 important organic food consumption statistics that support some of these pros and cons.
The advantages and disadvantages of organic farming involve cost, production labor, and market size. All three factors must be present for a farmer to create profits from their organic methods. Without subsidies, there will always be a measure of risk involved as well. With foods that are tastier, potentially healthier, and without artificial chemicals produced, however, organic farming is also a process that everyone can feel good about.

Alright, I have this information from different sources about the disadvantages of organic agriculture. Let's see what they say.

First, from Earth Reminder, they list several disadvantages of organic farming. One is that it has lower yields compared to conventional farming, which could be a problem for feeding the growing population. Another is that organic products are more expensive, making them less accessible to lower-income families. There's also a point about organic farming possibly requiring more land, which could lead to deforestation and loss of natural habitats.

Then, in the ResearchGate discussion, there are three main arguments against organic farming:

1. Not enough organic inputs are available.

2. Yields are lower in organic systems compared to chemical farming.

3. Plants can't differentiate between organic and inorganic nutrient sources.

Several people disagree with these points. For example, one respondent argues that organic farming can provide sufficient nutrients if managed properly, and that indigenous agroforestry systems can have high yields. Another points out that plant breeding for organic systems can improve yields.

In another source from Brandongaille.com, they list several disadvantages of organic farming, including higher costs, more labor-intensive practices, and potential faster spoilage of products.

So, overall, the main criticisms seem to be lower yields, higher costs, and potentially less shelf life for products. But many people argue that these issues can be addressed with better management and practices.

I think to answer the question "Why is organic agriculture bad?" I need to consider these points and see if they hold up.

First, about yields: It's true that organic farming sometimes has lower yields compared to conventional farming. But as some respondents pointed out, this isn't always the case, especially in certain systems like agroforestry. Also, over time, as soil health improves with organic practices, yields can increase.

Second, cost: Organic farming is more labor-intensive and can be more expensive. This makes organic products pricier for consumers. However, some argue that the higher cost reflects the true cost of sustainable farming and that subsidies for conventional farming distort the market.

Third, land use: If organic farming requires more land to produce the same amount of food, that could be a problem for biodiversity and the environment. But again, if yields can be improved with better practices, this might not be an issue.

Also, some people might argue that organic farming is time-consuming and requires more knowledge and skill from farmers, which could be a barrier for some.

But looking at the bigger picture, organic farming has many environmental benefits, like preserving soil health, promoting biodiversity, and avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can have harmful effects on the environment and human health.

So, while there are some challenges with organic farming, I don't necessarily think it's "bad." It's just different, and it requires a different approach to farming.

Maybe the real issue is that our current food system is heavily geared towards conventional, industrial farming, and organic farming hasn't received the same level of support and research. If more resources were put into developing organic farming methods, perhaps some of these perceived disadvantages could be overcome.

Alternatively, maybe organic farming isn't the only solution, and a combination of different farming methods is needed to achieve sustainable food production.

In conclusion, while organic agriculture has some challenges, such as potentially lower yields and higher costs, it also offers significant environmental benefits. It's important to continue researching and improving organic farming practices to make them more viable and scalable.

\boxed{\text{Organic agriculture has challenges like lower yields and higher costs, but offers environmental benefits and sustainability.}} 

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Organic agriculture has challenges like lower yields and higher costs, but offers environmental benefits and sustainability.}} \]

Three major arguments are given by the opponents of organic farming/agriculture (Details below). Do you agree/disagree with these arguments?

Three major arguments are given by the opponents of organic farming/agriculture, these are:

1. not sufficient organic inputs are available

2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming

3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic.

Do you agree/disagree with these arguments. Please only reply if you have more than five years practical experience in organic farming/agriculture. My simple meaning to organic agriculture is efficient utilization or recycling of mainly the local resources (flora, fauna, soil, water and society) following all ecological principals and avoiding the use of synthetic chemicals. Leave aside certified organic farming.

Great thread. Here are my thoughts on the three points:

1. not sufficient organic inputs are available

This, I think, is the most difficult of the three questions. I think Kunuthur captures the essence of what I would say, which is that nutrients exist in a cycle. Both the size and rate of that cycle can be manipulated over time. The cycle in agriculture has losses from 1) leeching of nutrients our of the system and 2) removal of nutrients from crop harvest. In the conventional argument people focus on the second aspect, and argue that low-input farming methods cannot cope with the losses of nutrients due to crop harvest. Organic farming methods tend to do a lot to increase the total size of the nutrient cycle and enhance the total potential fertility of a soil, which is an undeniably good thing. As Kunuthur points out these will take time to create realized effects in the soils. But allowing for localized inputs, particularly from very high nutrient loads such as waste water, natural erosion, areas of high nutrient uplift (from deep rooted plants), etc. I would argue that organic methods can supply the needed nutrients for global level food production needed to feed 10 billion people. I don't think we could do it yet, due to lack of investment and infrastructure, which leads into the next point.

2. yield level goes down with organic systems or is not comparable to chemical farming

No...total disagree. Indigenous agro-forestry systems in several areas around the world have shown yields of 15 tons/ha, more than conventional corn, wheat, or soy yields in industrial farming. Furthermore, the efforts in plant breeding in particular over the last 200 years have been focused on industrial type, mono-cropped systems. The very, very few plant breeding facilities that are focusing on organic systems have shown huge gains in yield when breeding plants for organic systems. So growing plants bred for industrial type agriculture in organic systems and then saying they don't perform as well is a rigged game, and of course they are going to do worse. Just like if we bred plant for an organic system and grew them in a fertilizer heavy system they would perform worse...in fact could possibly die due to being "burnt" from high fertilizer exposure. You can't compare the current state of the two system when one system has received over 99% of the agricultural funding over the last 200 years, and even with that case there are again agro-forestry systems that still show comparable and in rare cases higher yields.

3. Plants can't differentiate between the sources of nutrients i.e organic or inorganic.

I hate this question. As a soil biogeochemist I have to say that yes, plants can't differentiate between the two. It's just like an artificial vs. a natural flavoring (which only differ in the source from which the are distilled)...if you give two vials to a chemist he cannot tell which is which. Chemically the individual molecules perform exactly the same. But my problem with this very reductionist argument is that as a whole I would say that the soil can tell because an inorganic source of nutrients in not going to come with the suite of other elements and constituents that an organic source comes with. If you just pour on nitrogen without, for instance, all the carbon that comes with organic sources that is greatly going to change the microbial community, the balance of nitrogen to everything else in the soil, and therefore the entire nutrient cycle. So while chemically I aatgree plants cant tell the difference, I think they can tell of the imbalance of the source (which can happen with organic sources too).

There is an abundance of organic material available for agricultural input, but just adding raw organics to soil is not particularly helpful in the short-term. Better to compost the organics first, then add to cropland. Then following yields do not diminish, waiting for the microbial populations to perform nutrient cycling.

Both nutrient cycling and disease control by natural means are totally relative to the volume of the full ACTIVE (not dormant) BENEFICIAL microbial soil community available. Increase the soil volume of the full microbial community - quick and easy to accomplish on-site, in liquid form, dispensed via existing farm equipment.

Both mulching and cover cropping should be considered in weed control.
