Alright, so I need to talk about the benefits and concerns of using non-nutritive sweeteners for weight loss. First off, I should probably clarify what non-nutritive sweeteners are. From what I know, these are artificial or natural substances that provide sweetness but have little to no calories. They're often used as substitutes for sugar in drinks and foods to reduce calorie intake, which in theory should help with weight loss. But there must be more to it, right? Let me think about this step by step.

Starting with the benefits, the primary advantage seems to be calorie reduction. If someone switches from regular soda to diet soda, for example, they're consuming fewer calories, which over time could lead to weight loss. Also, non-nutritive sweeteners don't raise blood sugar levels like sugar does, so they might be beneficial for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing it. Additionally, some people might prefer the taste of these sweeteners or find them helpful in controlling their sugar cravings without derailing their diet.

But now, what about the concerns? I've heard mixed things about artificial sweeteners. Some studies suggest that they might actually lead to weight gain, which seems counterintuitive. Maybe because people think they can eat more since they're having something "diet," or perhaps there's something about how the body reacts to artificial sweeteners that affects metabolism or appetite hormones. Another concern could be potential health risks associated with long-term consumption of these chemicals. There have been studies linking certain sweeteners to cancer, although I think regulatory agencies consider them safe when consumed in moderation.

Also, I've read that some people find artificial sweeteners too sweet, which might alter their palate over time, making naturally less sweet foods less appealing. This could lead to a preference for overly sweet foods and possibly contribute to poor dietary choices.

Moreover, there's the issue of the variety of non-nutritive sweeteners available—like aspartame, sucralose, stevia, etc. Each might have its own set of benefits and concerns, so it's important to consider them individually.

I think to get a clearer picture, I should look up some reliable sources to see what the current scientific consensus is on this topic. Maybe check out some recent studies or reviews on the subject.

Let me try searching for some information.

Introduction
In recent years, increased obesity related mortality has resulted in a surge of weight loss diets and products, and various fitness routines. It is widely understood that of the many contributing factors, a high sugar/high fat diet is partly to be blamed for the increasing obesity and related health issues such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, and certain cancers [1], [2]. As a result of the many negative health conditions associated with the intake of excessive sugar, there has been an upsurge in the consumption of NNS as an alternative [3]. Consumption of NNS-containing foods has increased among people of all ages, with 28% of the total population reporting intake. This trend is highly prevalent among children, especially when it comes to beverage intake. Analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected from 1999 to 2008 shows that NNS-containing beverage use increased from 6.1% to 12.5% among children and from 18.7% to 24.1% among adults [4]. A large variety of NNS are available, and they are differentiated based on whether they are high-intensity, low-calorie, high-potency, and/or non-nutritive [3]. NNS are known to be at least 30 to 13,000 times sweeter in taste compared with their natural counterpart, sugar (sucrose). This intense sweetness allows for smaller portions to yield sugar like sweetness in food products, thus enabling the manufacturer to label them as virtually “sugar free” or “non-caloric” [3].
The increased incidences of obesity and related health issues, mainly T2DM and CVD, have resulted in an increased production and consumption of foods made with NNS. The fundamental principle behind this upsurge in use of NNS is that individuals struggling with obesity can enjoy foods and beverages without the risk of consuming additional calories contributed by normal sugar-based products. NNS can be found in almost any food product such as beverages, ice cream, chewing gum, chocolate, jams/jellies, yogurt, and salad dressings. Overzealous use of these NNS brings to light the issue of safety, mainly with respect to the maximum amounts of said NNS considered safe for human consumption and whether there are any associated health issues with the use of these laboratory-created sweeteners.
Since their discovery and introduction into the public market, there has been much debate regarding the health advantages and disadvantages of artificial sweeteners. The very first evidence of artificial sweetener–related health issues was observed by the FDA before it banned a commonly used sugar substitute known as cyclamate, which was deemed inappropriate for consumption due to its carcinogenic effects evidenced through many animal studies [5]. Since then, the NNS industry has come a long way and consumers now have products safe for consumption, even for kids. However, irrespective of advancements in technology, it appears that scientific information regarding these sweeteners and the established amounts considered safe for consumption seem to be scarce. Hence, through this review, we aim to establish scientific information about the most commonly used artificial sweeteners in the food industry. In reviewing these NNS, we will discuss issues involving the sweetness factor compared with sucrose, FDA-recommended safety guidelines, health implications of consuming these sweeteners, threat of a carcinogenic and/or teratogenic effect, energy restriction, and other common issues such as sweeteners acting as laxatives when consumed in excess.
Methods
Based on these factors, we decided to review the pros and cons of consuming NNS, and to outline salient properties of some of the most commonly used NNS to help clinicians counsel their patients accordingly. A systematic review of several databases including MEDLINE and PubMed, and reliable websites on the internet was conducted from 1987 to 2012 to identify literature related to NNS. The keywords used individually or in combination, artificial sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners, non-caloric sweeteners, obesity, sugar substitutes, diabetes, and cardiometabolic indicators, were variously combined in the search list.
Role of non-nutritive sweeteners on glucose homeostasis
Non-nutritive sweeteners have been in use for decades for both weight loss and in diabetic diets. In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [6] suggests NNS may be used to enhance the palatability of foods to help consumers increase their consumption of certain foods to be included in their respective dietary routines. However, the understanding thus far was that NNS did not affect fasting glucose and insulin responses in patients with TD2M supplemented with NNS, particularly sucralose, to assist these patients in increasing compliance with their dietary needs [7]. To better understand the effects of NNS on glucose homeostasis, a recent study investigated the short-term effects of sucralose on glucose homeostasis and hunger compared with water, sucrose, and sucrose combined with sucralose in the liquid form [8]. Additionally, the study also examined the effects of consuming the aforementioned treatment beverages before consumption of a standardized breakfast to determine the physiological responses elucidated by the body in response to specific meals. The amount of sucralose used in the study approximated that of what is in a regular soft drink. Blood samples were collected at fasting, post-treatment, and after breakfast; the study found no differences in subjective responses, circulating triglycerides, or glucagon concentrations among treatment groups over time. However, the study reported significant differences in insulin, glucose, and ghrelin concentrations over time between the sucrose and non-sucrose treatments regardless of their sucralose consumption. Thus, the study concluded that sucralose may in fact be a relatively inert NNS as far as evoking hunger signals and short-term glucose homeostasis.
Non-nutritive sweeteners and their influence on weight control
Because NNS are alternatives to table sugar and its calories, theoretically, NNS would only aid in weight loss if compensatory sugar intake does not occur. Of concern is the appetite-promoting effect of NNS. Rats administered liquids containing saccharin consumed more food and gained more weight compared with rats given liquids containing glucose. The common perception that NNS may promote weight loss by reducing calories is misguided because consumption of saccharin-sweetened liquids increased overall food intake [9]. Furthermore, positive correlations between NNS consumption and increased body mass index in children and adolescents have been reported in several observational studies [10], [11], [12]. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence to state that NNS may be the cause of weight gain in children [13]. A second study found no evidence to link NNS use to weight gain in adults either [14]. Management of obesity is multifactorial, and no adequate evidence exists to target NNS use as an effective strategy in weight management. Other factors associated with modern lifestyle behaviors and genetics may be confounding influences that promote weight gain.
A Western diet and sedentary lifestyle encouraging energy-dense foods have resulted in a surge of chronic diseases that have led to an interest in gene–diet interactions within the clinical and scientific community. Understanding this gene–diet interaction can help promote diet modifications and reduction of obesity-related health disorders based on genetic makeup. Of all the energy-dense foods, it appears that consumption of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages may have the most effect on gene–diet-related patterns of obesity [15].
Saccharin
Saccharin has been on the market for more than 100 y and is the oldest NNS. It was discovered by Remsen and Fahlberg at John Hopkins University in 1879. This non-caloric sweetener is 200 to 700 times sweeter than sugar. It is marketed under the brand names Sweet’N Low®, Sugar Twin®, and Necta Sweet®. In the food industry, it is commonly used in soft drinks, baked goods, jams, canned fruit, candy, salad dressing, dessert toppings, and chewing gum, in addition to being used as a tabletop sweetener. It also is used in other household products such as toothpaste, lip gloss, mouthwash, vitamins, and pharmaceuticals. An important characteristic of saccharin is that its sweetening power is not reduced when heated, which makes it an excellent candidate as an additive in low-calorie and sugar-free products. Saccharin is not metabolized in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and therefore does not affect blood insulin levels [16], which makes saccharin a viable sugar substitute for patients with diabetes.
The Adequate Dietary Intake (ADI) for saccharin is set at 5 mg/kg body weight per day for adults and children. As per a 2010 report in Current Oncology [17], one would have to drink about 800 twelve-ounce diet sodas containing saccharin to reach doses that can induce carcinogenesis. The ADI also means that one can “safely consume 8.5 tabletop sweetener packets nearly every day over his or her lifetime.” It seems highly unlikely that any population would exceed the ADI for such intense sweeteners, considering the average user of saccharin ingests less than 1ounce of the sweetener each year. In a Belgian study, no risk for exceeding the ADIs established for saccharin and other similar sweeteners was found among individuals older than age 15 y [18].
However, a survey of the usage pattern of saccharin in edible products in India found that in all age groups consumption exceeds the ADI, with the most susceptible group being the 6- to 10-y age group, who exceeded the ADI by 54% through the consumption of ice candy and crushed ice. Intake of foods containing saccharin is high in India, as it is the cheapest and most widely used NNS product. Furthermore, a habitual intake of pan masala and pan betel products resulted in an excessive consumption of saccharin with an estimated maximum daily intake that exceeded the ADI by 137% [19]. Thus, overconsumption is possible in some settings warranting further study.
Since its introduction into the market, saccharin has been researched extensively to determine its carcinogenic potential. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s reported bladder cancer in rats given high doses of saccharin, which prompted the FDA in 1981 to pass a mandate that products containing saccharin carry a label warning about its potential as a human carcinogen [20]. However, it was later found that the cancer-causing mechanisms in rodents are not applicable to humans. Furthermore, clinical studies conducted since then have shown no association between saccharin consumption and cancer in humans [21]. As a result, in 2000, saccharin was delisted from the National Toxicology Report on Carcinogens and labels no longer have to display such warning [22].
A case–control study in Italy examined the association between saccharin and other NNS and gastric, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers between 1991 and 2004. The results of this study indicate that consumption of NNS products such as saccharin and aspartame are not associated with the risk for neoplasms in the population studied [23].
In a recent study, rats that consumed saccharin-sweetened liquids had an increased food intake and gained more body weight than rats that consumed glucose-sweetened liquids [9]. The findings of this study have major implications on public health, given that people are consuming foods containing NNS in an effort to lose weight. This study, although not done on humans, challenges the popular notion that use of intense NNS help in weight loss due to the calorie deficit. In another study, the same authors reported that in addition to increased energy intake and weight gain, use of NNS also caused accumulation of body fat and weaker caloric compensation [24].
Saccharin is the oldest and most researched of all NNS. It bears the FDA stamp of approval in suggested quantities by being a food additive on the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) list [25]. GRAS is a term designated to any substance added to food as an additive that is considered to be generally safe for human consumption. Despite its questionable carcinogenic history, currently there is not enough evidence that identifies it as a carcinogenic agent and it appears to be safe for consumption among children and adults, including pregnant women and patients with diabetes when quantities consumed are within the ADI recommendations.
Aspartame
Aspartame was originally discovered by James Schalatter, a chemist, who was working on an anti-ulcer drug. It is the methyl ester of the two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Although discovered in 1965, aspartame was not approved by the FDA until 1981 [26]. It is sold under the brand names Equal®, NutraSweet®, and Natra Taste®. Because it is made from amino acids, it provides 4 kcal/g. Aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sucrose and therefore very small amounts are required for sweetening foods, thus making its caloric contribution insignificant. According to the FDA, the acceptable daily intake of aspartame for humans is 50 mg/kg body weight, for both adults and children [27]. Aspartame is used as a sweetener in many products including chewing gum, diet soda, dry drink mixtures, yogurt and pudding, and instant tea and coffee. The flavor profile of aspartame is found to be highly acceptable. In a study on the effects of artificial sweeteners on food intake and satiety, aspartame was found by participants to have a more pleasant taste compared with stevia or sucrose [28]. Furthermore, aspartame does not elicit the same response as sugar does in the brain or the pancreas. A magnetic resonance imaging study showed a decline in activity of the hypothalamus part of the brain after ingestion of sucrose, whereas aspartame does not show similar response. It is suggested that for a hypothalamic reaction to occur there should be the combined stimuli of sweet taste and energy content, as found in sweetened caloric beverages. In the pancreas, aspartame does not stimulate an insulin response as sugar does [29].
Aspartame is metabolized to phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol in the GI tract. People with the genetic disorder, phenylketonuria, must exercise caution because they cannot break down phenylalanine to tyrosine, and therefore must avoid aspartame [26]. Because of aspartame’s effects on these patients, the FDA requires all aspartame products to have a label stating the containment of phenylalanine [6]. Common side effects reported from aspartame consumption include dizziness, headaches, GI issues, and mood changes [30].
There are mixed reports about the safety of aspartame. All of the studies funded by the industry vouch for its safety, whereas 92% of independently funded studies report that aspartame can cause adverse health effects [31]. Several studies have reported aspartame to be a trigger in causing headaches, with some people being more susceptible to this malady [32], [33], [34]. There are still many claims that a number of health problems are associated with consumption of aspartame including, but not limited to: Alzheimer’s disease, attention-deficit disorders, birth defects, cancer, diabetes, Gulf War syndrome, and lupus [27]. Aspartame can promote seizures in susceptible animal models by increasing phenylalanine levels in the brain. A similar effect is probable in human beings with seizures caused by increased phenylalanine [35]. In pregnant rats, aspartame proved to be nephrotoxic by causing alterations in the morphology of renal structures in the fetus and by causing decreased fetal body weight [36]. No association was found between aspartame consumption and the risk for common neoplasms such as gastric, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers among Italian people [23]. Aspartame intake during pregnancy and lactation was not found to increase risk for brain tumors among children [37]. Aspartame remains one of the most controversial and widely used artificial sweeteners today.
Acesulfame-K
Acesulfame-K was discovered in 1967 by the pharmaceutical company, Hoechst. This high-intensity sweetener is about 200 times sweeter than the table sugar sucrose [38]. It is used in more than 100 countries in more than 5000 products [39]. In the United States, acesulfame-K was initially permitted only in foods such as sugar-free baked goods, chewing gum, and gelatin desserts. In July 1998, this non-caloric sweetener was approved for use in soft drinks by the FDA [40]. Acesulfame-K is sold under the brand names Sunette®, Sweet One®, and Swiss Sweet® [41]. Acesulfame-K is heat stable and can be used in cooking and baking.
The ADI for acesulfame-K is 15 mg/kg body weight. In the United States, actual consumption is about 20% of the ADI over a lifetime [42]. As such, typical amounts of acesulfame-K and other artificial sweeteners consumed by the average population are quite low that toxicity is highly unlikely. In Portuguese teenagers, the highest estimated daily intake of acesulfame-K and aspartame was from soft drinks. However, the amount consumed was well below the ADI and this population was noted to be at low risk for any adverse effects arising from use of these artificial sweeteners [43].
Being a blended product comprising of an organic acid and potassium, acesulfame-K typically is found in food products in combination with other artificial sweeteners, which helps in developing an optimal flavor profile [44]. It is usually combined with aspartame or sucralose to provide a synergistic sweetening effect. Such combinations not only provide a “more sugar-like taste” but also decrease the total amount of sweetener used [41]. Concerns about the safety profile of blends of artificial sweeteners are addressed in a study that found no synergistic genotoxic effects when acesulfame-K was used in combination with aspartame in mice [45].
Acesulfame-K is excreted by the kidneys after it passes through the body unchanged [44]. One of the byproducts of acesulfame-K's breakdown in the body is acetoacetamide, which is toxic at high doses. However, the amount of acesulfame-K used to sweeten a beverage is very small and as such does not pose a safety hazard [46].
Widespread concerns exist about the safety of acesulfame-K, since it was tested in the 1970s when “the standard criteria for the design of animal carcinogenesis bioassays were still under development” [47]. The FDA approved acesulfame-K despite inadequate and poor-quality toxicity tests. Although acesulfame-K was nominated twice for testing in 1996 and 2006 in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay program, the motion was rejected by NTP and the product has not been subjected to such testing.
Sucralose
Sucralose, an artificial sweetener discovered in 1976, was granted FDA approval in 1998 for use as a sugar substitute in 15 food and beverage categories. Marketed under the brand name Splenda®, sucralose has a taste profile very similar to sugar and has no unpleasant aftertaste, an undesirable trait found in many other NNS. Extensive testing has established an excellent safety profile for sucralose, allowing it to be used among all population groups, including pregnant and nursing mothers [48].
Sucralose is a highly intense sweetener that is 600 times sweeter than table sugar. It is made by selective substitution of chlorine for hydroxyl groups on a sucrose core. This compound is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate due to being poorly absorbed during the digestion process. It passes through the body relatively unchanged with insignificant amounts being absorbed in the GI tract. Eventually, it is eliminated in the feces unchanged [44]. Sucralose is exceptionally stable and is able to retain its sweetness when subjected to high heat and acidity [49]. In the food industry, it is widely used as a NNS and is found in more than 4000 products in the United States [50]. Sucralose is also used as a sweetener in more than 80 countries today [51].
In a study comparing the sensory profile of several sweeteners, it was found that sucralose is most similar to table sugar [52], but unlike table sugar, sucralose does not promote tooth decay. In 2006, the FDA approved the use of a health claim regarding sucralose and the non-promotion of dental caries [53].
The safety profile of sucralose has been extensively reviewed and has been reported to be non-carcinogenic and non-genotoxic. Furthermore, due to its lack of bioreactivity and bioaccumulation in humans and animal models, sucralose is considered to be safe for long-term use [54].
There have been some claims that sucralose may negatively affect health. One controversial study found it to cause adverse effects in the GI tract [55]. Rats that consumed Splenda® for 12 wk had a significant decrease in beneficial gut bacteria with resulting weight gain, increased fecal pH due to decreased production of short-chain fatty acids by colonic bacteria, and enhanced expression of cytochromes in the body that can potentially affect bioavailability of nutrients and drugs. Furthermore, the stated changes in the GI tract occurred even when the rats were fed sucralose at low doses approved by the FDA for human consumption [55]. However, these results were widely criticized, with an expert panel report citing that the study is “deficient in several critical areas” and that the conclusions from the study are not “scientifically valid” [56].
Sucralose has been deemed safe for consumption by patients with diabetes because it has no effect on carbohydrate metabolism [57]. This NNS does not change the rate of glucose absorption from the small intestine; nor does it increase glycemic response or levels of incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide in healthy humans given an intraduodenal/intragastric infusion [58], [59]. Furthermore, sucralose did not stimulate insulin release or slow gastric emptying, thereby maintaining glucose homeostasis in the study population [59]. Other study findings indicate that sucralose had no effect on appetite in healthy, normal-weight adults [60]. NNS have been purported to increase insulin resistance, which could lead to weight gain. However, in a study comparing the body’s response to sucrose and sucralose, sucralose did not raise blood sugar levels or increase insulin resistance [61].
Because NNS are widely used by the public including women of childbearing potential, concern exists about its possible teratogenic effects. No adverse effect on normal fetal development was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits when fed sucralose during organogenesis [62]. However, some potential adverse health effects are reported from sucralose use. Case studies have identified sucralose to be a causative agent in triggering migraine headaches [63], [64]. In a hypothetical report, sucralose is suggested to be the most likely cause in the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease among Canadians due to its inhibiting action on gut bacteria, gut barrier function, and digestive protease enzymes [65].
Sucralose is one of the most researched and reviewed food additives today. Based on its strong safety background, it is even promoted for use among children. It is recommended that it be used in children’s foods to reduce sugar calories, which could be an effective strategy to combat childhood obesity [50], which is one of the most challenging public health concerns today.
Tagatose
Over the last few years, numerous NNS have been added to the list, one of them being a ketohexose also known as d -tagatose. Tagatose is a fructose isomer that is commonly found in milk and milk products. In comparison with sucrose and other sugars, it has been reported that tagatose produces a lower glycemic response and virtually zero calories [66]. This sweetener has been examined for its safety and functional properties as a bulk sweetener [8], [67]. For an artificial sweetener to be considered a staple in commercial food products, the two qualities that render it useful for consumption are safety and taste. A study investigating d -tagatose as a bulk sweetener reported that this sweetener not only has physical attributes identical to that of sucrose, but, the sweetness was comparable to sucrose as well. In fact, this study reported that trace amounts of d -tagatose are commonly found in certain milk products [8]. Another study reported that per FDA laws and policies, d -tagatose was found to contain no toxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic compounds or effects upon consumption [8]. A common problem associated with consumption of most artificial sweeteners is the fact that they can act as laxatives and although the FDA does not label a laxative effect as toxic, it does require that food manufacturers using sugar substitutes in their products label cautionary information regarding the possibilities of a laxative effect and subsequently print amounts/serving sizes safe for consumption to avoid such health issues [8]. In an experimental study, rats were fed a diet comprising of 20% (wt:wt) d -tagatose. The researchers evaluated both a stool-softening as well as a laxative effect induced by the sweetener. The results revealed that a laxative effect was observed only upon inducing higher doses. However, with the doses administered, the rats had normal stools and it appears that the d -tagatose was well tolerated over a period of 3 d [67]. Similar tests, when performed on humans, revealed that the mean laxative threshold value when consuming d -tagatose was approximately 40 g per meal over a single meal. However, additional studies are required to attest to these findings [67]. Another study reported that humans can easily tolerate up to 75 g of d -tagatose as long as it is equally distributed over three meals [8]. It also was reported that after carefully controlled experimental studies, d -tagatose could be used safely in products to assist with weight loss as well as diabetes because this sweetener effectively had a zero energy value as revealed via metabolic experimental studies [8], [67]. One study even reported possible anti-aging properties induced by d -tagatose by way of animal subjects (rats) on d -tagatose, demonstrating consistently low plasma glucose and insulin levels compared with those fed a regular glucose diet [68]. Of course, extensive human studies would be required to justify the anti-aging properties of this sugar substitute. Finally, it has been reported that tagatose might have pharmaceutical capabilities, especially in treating patients with diabetes. A Phase III clinical trial is in place to investigate the mechanisms and efficacy of tagatose in reducing hemoglobin A 1c levels. Although, the trials are still under way, human studies have suggested that tagatose could be the new potential antidiabetic drug because of its effects on postprandial hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM [69]. Nonetheless, it appears that at this time d -tagatose has been successfully used in chocolate and chewing gum, however, whether it may be approved as a sugar substitute safe for consumption on a regular basis and an appropriate replacement for table top sugar will depend on approvals from the FDA and other such entities.
Sugar alcohols
Sugar alcohols are saccharide derivatives obtained by replacing an aldehyde group with a hydroxyl group. Additionally, sugar alcohols also are classified as hydrogenated monosaccharides most commonly known as sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol; hydrogenated disaccharides such as isomalt, maltitol, and lactitol; and as mixtures of hydrogenated mono-di- and/or oligosaccharides such as hydrogenated starch hydrolysates [70]. It is the limited digestion and absorption associated with sugar alcohols that make them a primary choice of ingredients in sugar- and energy-restricted foods [70]. Several factors affect the digestion and absorption of sugar alcohols, one being gastric transit time and the fact that sugar alcohols might get fermented by gut bacteria, thus allowing limited absorption and to a certain extent, some sugar alcohols may escape the process of absorption completely [70]. However, unlike other NNS, it is important to note that with sugar alcohols that make it as far as the distal intestine, they will be subjected to some amount of fermentation thus leading to production of hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and small amounts of short-chain fatty acids. Of all the gaseous matter produced, likelihood of short-chain fatty acids being converted to small amounts of energy are very plausible. Although the energy available from sugar alcohols is 15% to 25% lower than glucose, the conversion of energy to adenosine triphosphate is almost as efficient as that of glucose [70]. Thus, for these reasons, the 1990 European Council Directives established an energy value for sugar alcohols for the purpose of food labeling [71].
Although sugar alcohols are widely used in foods, limited research is available to determine the metabolic effects of these sweeteners in humans [72]. A recent study investigated the metabolic effects of lactitol and xylitol in comparison with glucose on plasma insulin, glucose, and C-peptide in eight healthy, non-obese men. It was observed that upon ingestion of 25 g of lactitol or xylitol, plasma insulin, glucose, and C-peptide concentrations were not affected as dramatically as with ingestion of glucose [72]. In fact, this study also reported that glycemic indices of lactitol and xylitol were found to be –1 and 7 compared with 100 g of glucose. Finally, the effects of consumption of these sugar alcohols on carbohydrate and lipid oxidation is very minimal compared with glucose [72]. Hence, it might be worth exploring use of these sugar alcohols in food products marketed to patients with diabetes and individuals considering energy-restricted diets.
Stevia
Stevia, a natural NNS, is a glycoside isolated from the plant Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni and has been widely used in Japan for more than 20 y [73], [74]. Recently, stevia has been marketed as a no-calorie sweetener in baked goods and soft drinks. Studies have indicated possible hypotensive roles performed by stevia [74], in addition to some suggesting stevia increases insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in humans [28]. As far as safety issues concerning stevia, no negative side effects have been reported thus far. In fact, very recently stevia was approved for use as a sweetener by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives [28]. A recent study evaluated the taste responses of rodents (mice and rats) to both stevia and saccharin. It was reported that both mice and rats responded strongly to stevia compared with other non-caloric sweeteners, mainly aspartame and cyclamate [73]. Such experiments provide a new understanding of the effectiveness of these products. Of course, animal data would have to be tested in humans before any conclusions on the safety and efficacy of these products are to be claimed. The very first study [28] that investigated the effects of stevia on food intake, satiety, and postprandial glucose and insulin responses in humans reported that participants who consumed products made with stevia had a lower total caloric intake compared with those consuming sucrose. Furthermore, consumption of stevia significantly lowered insulin levels compared with both aspartame and sucrose, thus suggesting that using stevia in place of sucrose might be an effective way of managing food intake and satiation concerns. This study also reported that individuals consuming stevia had significantly lower postprandial glucose responses compared with those on aspartame and sucrose [28]. These findings suggest promising avenues for both manufacturers and individuals turning to products made with artificial sweeteners to combat the twin epidemics of obesity and T2DM.
Conclusion
Consumers often do not have adequate information about NNS. The pieces of information they are provided often are contradictory depending on the motive and investment of the body, industry, or agency providing the information. Although the FDA and most published (especially industry-funded) studies endorse the safety of these additives, there is a lack of conclusive evidence-based research to discourage or to encourage their use. However, consumers should be advised to employ a cautious attitude when using artificial sweeteners. When using any new product, it is important to monitor for symptoms related to allergies or intolerance, which may occur even when very small amounts are consumed. It is highly unlikely that U.S. consumers will exceed the ADI established for NNS. As these products have been on the market for decades, with consumption patterns on the rise and no reported adverse health problems affecting large numbers of people, their continued popularity and increased use are to be expected.
The clinical and epidemiologic data available at present are insufficient to make firm conclusions regarding the benefits of NNS displacing caloric sweeteners in energy balance maintenance or decrease of body weight or cardiometabolic risk factors. As a result of scarce epidemiologic and clinical data on the pros and cons of consuming NNS, very few recommendations regarding consumption of artificial sweeteners are made available. However, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends using artificial sweeteners in moderation, in conjunction with a healthy diet based on the recommendations provided in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans [6]. Given the sudden rise in obesity and related health issues, it is crucial that clinicians and scientists pursue research involving use of artificial sweeteners to understand their effects on energy consumption, appetite, satiety, body mass index, weight management, biochemical parameters such as insulin, glucose, leptin, cortisol, and finally the effects of artificial sweeteners on food cravings.
A recent scientific statement issued jointly by the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association adds credibility to this assertion [75]. A more recent publication emphasizes that obesity is not related to sugar consumption [76]. Weight management depends more on total calorie restriction rather than avoidance of caloric sweeteners. However, the use of NNS as an adjunct to dietary management in diabetes, in an attempt to optimize glycemic control, is more acceptable and practiced more frequently.
For optimal health it is recommended that only minimal amounts of both sugar and NNS be consumed. Today, there is renewed emphasis on eating fresh, local, and natural foods to maintain good health and promote sustainability. This calls for a balanced diet that includes whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds, low-fat dairy and lean meats, and avoidance or minimal inclusion of processed foods and additives. If these general principles of lifestyle are followed, artificial sweeteners, like the sugars they replace, will have an insignificant role in our diet and our lives.

Abstract
Background
Food products containing non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs) instead of sugar have become increasingly popular in the last decades. Their appeal is obviously related to their calorie-free sweet taste. However, with the dramatic increase in their consumption, it is reasonable and timely to evaluate their potential health benefits and, more importantly, potential adverse effects. The main aim of this scoping review was to map the evidence about health outcomes possibly associated with regular NNS consumption by examining the extent, range, and nature of research activity in this area.
Methods
We systematically searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies on NNSs (artificial sweeteners or natural, non-caloric sweeteners, either used individually or in combination) using text terms with appropriate truncation and relevant indexing terms. All human studies investigating any health outcomes of a NNS intervention or exposure were eligible for inclusion. No studies were excluded based on language, study design or methodological quality. Data for each health outcome were summarized in tabular form and were discussed narratively.
Results
Finally, we included 372 studies in our scoping review, comprising 15 systematic reviews, 155 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 23 non-randomized controlled trials, 57 cohort studies, 52 case-control studies, 28 cross sectional studies and 42 case series/case reports.
In healthy subjects, appetite and short term food intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental caries, weight gain and risk of obesity are the most investigated health outcomes. Overall there is no conclusive evidence for beneficial and harmful effects on those outcomes. Numerous health outcomes including headaches, depression, behavioral and cognitive effects, neurological effects, risk of preterm delivery, cardiovascular effects or risk of chronic kidney disease were investigated in fewer studies and further research is needed. In subjects with diabetes and hypertension, the evidence regarding health outcomes of NNS use is also inconsistent.
Conclusions
This scoping review identifies the needs for future research to address the numerous evidence gaps related to health effects of NNSs use.It also specifies the research questions and areas where a systematic review with meta-analyses is required for the proper evaluation of health outcomes associated to regular NNSs consumption.

Introduction
In the last decades, growing concerns about health and quality of life have encouraged people to avoid the consumption of food rich in sugar, salt or fat [1, 2 ]. With increased consumer interest in reducing sugar intake, food products containing calorie-free alternatives (non-nutritive sweeteners; NNSs) have become increasingly popular [3, 4 ]. NNSs are generallyseveral hundred to several thousand times sweeter than sucrose [5 ]. Most of them do not contain any calories while some NNSs (e.g. aspartame) contain very few [6 ]. Each sweetener has specific characteristics of sweetness intensity, persistence of the sweet taste, coating of the teeth and aftertaste effect [7, 8 ].
Most of the NNSs approved for human consumption are synthetic (artificial sweeteners; AS). However, more and more NNSs of natural origin are available on the market (natural, non-caloric sweeteners; NNCSs). The most familiar NNCSs are Stevia rebaudiana -based products. Steviol glycosides, extracted from the plant Stevia include stevioside and rebaudioside A, but also other, less common glycosides [9 ].
With regard to the range of approved ASs there are differences among countries. In the United States for example, there are currently six ASs which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for consumption (Table 1; [10] acesulfame-K, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose and advantame). In the European Union meanwhile, the range of currently approved ASs is wider, also including, for example, cyclamate [11, 12 ]. Stevia has been used as a sweetener for decades in some countries (e.g. Japan), while it was approved as a food additive just recently by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [13] and the US FDA.

Full size table
Parallel to the dramatic increase in the consumption of food and beverages sweetened with NNSs, concerns have been raised about their potential adverse health effects [14,15,16 ]. Several studies investigated short-term consequences (e.g. on food intake, mood, blood pressure); others evaluated long-term health effects (e.g. on body weight, incidence of obesity, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes or dental caries) of NNSs. Overall, plenty of scientific studies have been published, postulating a wide variety of beneficial, but also negative health effects of NNSs.
Since scoping reviews are used to present a broad overview of the evidence pertaining to a topic irrespective of study quality, they can be seen as a hypothesis-generating exercise and are therefore the optimal method for examining this emerging area as a first approach [17 ]. The aim of this scoping review was to map the available evidence about the health outcomes possibly associated with regular NNS consumption by examining the extent, range, and nature of research activity in this area.
Objectives
Primary objectives of this scoping review were to:
Identify all potential health outcomes associated with regular NNS consumption;
Define the number and types of primary studies (i.e. studies that collect original data from subjects) available for each health outcome;
Identify any gaps in the evidence base for the health outcomes of regular NNS consumption.
Secondary objective of this scoping review was to:
Summarize available systematic reviews on the association of NNS consumption and health outcomes, compare their inclusion criteria and limitations, and determine whether a new systematic review in this area is justified.
Methods
We used the approach of a scoping review (including a process known as evidence mapping) [18, 19] to compile all relevant evidence about the health effects of NNS consumption from the scientific literature. This approach is based on a systematic literature search and the transparent assessment of the retrieved evidence for its relevance for the research question by presenting an overview of a potentially large and diverse body of literature pertaining to this broad research topic, without making restrictions based on study design and methodology. Furthermore, it seeks to provide a descriptive summary of the evidence without detailed critical appraisal of included individual studies.
Inclusion criteria
To be included, a primary study needed to meet all of the following criteria: a) a study on human beings (of any age, gender or health status); b) an intervention with or exposure to any type and any dosage of ASs (aspartame, acesulfame potassium, saccharin, sucralose, advantame, neotame, cyclamate, alitame, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (DC)) or NNCSs (stevioside, rebaudioside A, thaumatin, brazzein) or NNSs (defined as any combination of AS and NNCS); c) a study reporting health effects of any type (both health outcomes and intermediate markers of health outcomes were included); d) no restriction on study design or language.
We also included relevant systematic reviews on the association of an NNS intervention/exposure and one or more defined health outcomes (every review describing or indicating a systematic search was regarded to be a systematic review).
In this manuscript we report on relevant systematic reviews, clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control and cross-sectional studies.
Search strategy
Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.ovid.com ), EMBASE (www.embase.com) and the Cochrane CENTRAL database (www.cochranelibrary.com) were searched from inception to October Week 2 2015 for studies on AS and to January Week 3 2016 for studies on NNCS and NNS, using text words with appropriate truncation and relevant indexing terms (MeSH). The search was in the form [terms for artificial sweeteners/ natural, non-caloric sweeteners/non-nutritive sweeteners] and [human studies]. Electronic searches were limited neither in time nor in language. Electronic searches were followed by hand searching of reference lists of relevant review articles and included primary studies. Electronic searches were updated in May Week 4 2017.
Data extraction and management
Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion by a single reviewer (SL). Only clearly irrelevant records were excluded at this stage. All potentially relevant abstracts and full papers were screened for inclusion by two reviewers independently using an inclusion/exclusion form specifically developed for the purpose of this scoping review (SL and IT). In case of disagreement, the subject was discussed among the two reviewers until a mutual decision could be made. When this was not possible, a third reviewer (JM) was consulted. A data extraction sheet was designed and piloted. Then two reviewers (SL and IT) independently extracted the following data for each included primary study: 1) first author; 2) year of publication; 3) study location; 4) study design; 5) aim of the study; 6) main characteristics and size of the study sample; 7) main characteristics of intervention/exposure and control; 8) outcome measures with direction of effect.
Intervention studies were classified as RCTs (with either parallel, or cross-over design) or non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), while observational studies were classified as prospective or retrospective cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, ecological studies or case reports/case series. Data sheets were compared and in case of differences in the extracted data, the relevant information was checked again in the study article and corrected.
Data for each health outcome were summarized in tabular form and were discussed narratively. Bubble charts were used to highlight the main relationship among the types of NNS used in the studies as intervention/exposure, the health effects and the study types. Bubble charts are multi-variable graphs, whose plot points along a grid where the X and Y axis are separate variables (in our case they represent the type of sweetener and health outcomes).Additionally, the different colours of the plotted points represent a third variable (in our case they show the study type).
For each included systematic review following data were extracted: 1) first author; 2) year of publication; 3) date of search; 4) databases searched 5) aim of the review; 6) study design of eligible studies; 7) main characteristics of eligible intervention/exposure; 8) outcome(s) eligible for inclusion.
Results
The flow diagram of the literature search (PRISMA Flow Diagram adapted for the scoping review process) is shown in Fig. 1. For ASs a total of 7970 articles were identified in the initial literature search, of which 669 appeared to be potentially relevant. Fifteen papers could not be retrieved; all others were available for detailed full-text assessment. Finally, 317 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This search focused on studies with ASs as the intervention or exposure; however, 11 primary studies with NNSs, 28 studies with diet beverages/diet sodas and one study with a combination of NNSs and sugar-alcohols were already identified at this stage. For NNCSs and NNSs, 3087 articles were identified in the original literature search, 112 full texts were screened for eligibility and finally 55 were included in the review. In 2017, after the update search of databases, 48 further studies were eligible for inclusion.

Short-term outcomes
Appetite and short term food intake
Eating behavior and metabolic effects due to the exposure to NNSs were investigated in five systematic reviews among other outcomes [20,21,22,23,24 ]. One review reported evidence for an appetite lowering effect of aspartame, whereas the other reviews reported conflicting evidence for the effects of Stevia and ASs in general on eating behavior.
The primary studies on short-term food intake focused on whether exposure to NNSs enhances the desire for sweet foods and drinks, leading to an increased food intake. From the included 60 primary studies, 32 were small, cross-over RCTs [25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] with a similar design: the subjects first consumed a “preload”, a food or drink sweetened with either NNSs or with sugar (a nutritive sweetener) or a food or drink which did not contain any sweetener (e.g. water). After a time delay subjects were offered an ad libitum meal and total energy intake was measured.
No effects of NNSs on short-term food intake or subjective awareness of hunger were described in 39 studies (9 parallel RCTs [53, 57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64 ], 22 cross-over RCTs [25,26,27,28,29, 31, 33,34,35,36,37,38,39, 41, 43, 46, 50, 51, 53,54,55,56 ], 7 non-RCTs [45, 65,66,67,68,69,70] and 1 case-control study [71 ]); 10 studies described an increased [32, 40, 45, 47, 49, 52, 72,73,74,75 ], while 11 studies described a decreased food intake or appetite [30, 42, 48, 76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83] in the NNSs intervention group as compared to the sugar-receiving or placebo group.
Long-term health outcomes in healthy populations
Cancer
Berry et al. [84] systematically summarized studies on the carcinogenic potential of sucralose and concluded that sucralose does not demonstrate carcinogenic activity even when exposure levels are several orders of magnitude greater than the range of anticipated daily ingestion levels. Another, broadly focused systematic review published in 2015 [85] assessed cancer risk among several other health outcomes. Authors of this review also searched for diet beverage studies, but only narratively summarized their results and concluded that, based on the available data, it was not possible to establish a link between cancer risk and the consumption of ASs.
In total, we identified 51 primary studies assessing the association of NNS consumption and cancer risk. The investigated exposure was use of any type of ASs or use of a subtype of ASs (saccharin or aspartame) in 47 studies, while 4 studies investigated exposure to NNCSs. Cancer outcomes by type of exposure as investigated in primary studies are shown in Fig. 3.

Out of the identified 41 case-control studies reporting on the effect of NNSs on cancer, 32 assessed the relationship between NNS consumption and the risk of developing bladder cancer or urinary tract cancer. The results of these studies are controversial: 11 case-control studies describe a positive association between AS/NNS intake and bladder or urinary tract cancer risk [86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96 ], while 20 report no association [97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116 ].
Two case-control studies assessed the risk of brain cancer (no association with AS use [117, 118 ]), 1 study assessed the risk for colorectal cancer (significantly increased with AS use [119 ]), 2 studies investigated the risk of pancreatic cancer (no association with NNSs [120, 121 ]), 1 study investigated the risk of breast cancer (no association with AS use [122 ]) and 4 studies investigated the risk of any type or more types of cancer (no association with NNS use [123,124,125,126 ]).
Three prospective cohort studies investigated the risk of lymphomas or other hematological malignancies [127, 128 ], 1 assessed the risk of biliary tract cancer [129 ], 1 assessed cancer incidence in general [130 ], 1 assessed the risk of tumor multiplicity in treated bladder cancer patients [131 ], 1 investigated the 5-year survival rate in urinary bladder cancer patients [132 ], while 2 retrospective cohort studies assessed the risk of bladder cancer [112, 133] (no significant associations were described in either of them).
The cross-sectional study described that breast cancer survivors compared to age-matched controls had significantly lower intakes of NNSs [134 ].
Chronic kidney disease
In a systematic review by Cheungpasitporn et al. [135 ], the 4 included studies assessed the association between consumption of artificially sweetened soda and chronic kidney disease. The authors concluded that consuming artificially sweetened soda did not increase the risk of chronic kidney disease in high-risk patients.
The primary studies we found on the association of NNS consumption and the risk of developing chronic kidney disease were 3 prospective cohort studies (describing no association [136,137,138 ]), 1 case-control study (describing a significant positive association [139 ]) and 2 cross-sectional studies (one of them indicating a positive association [136, 140 ]).
Dental health (caries)
We found 16 intervention studies (14 RCTs [141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154] and 2 non-RCTs [155, 156 ]) on the association of an NNS intervention and dental health. Details of these studies are summarized in Table 3.
Table 3 Characteristics of studies investigating the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners on dental outcomes
Full size table
Only two of the studies mentioned above described no differences between intervention and control groups [142, 155 ]; all other studies described a less acidogenic (increased) oral pH after the intervention as compared to the sugar-containing control.
Diabetes
In a systematic review published in 2014 [157 ], three included publications on 4 cohorts investigated the association between intake of artificially sweetened soft drinks and risk of type-2 diabetes [158,159,160] using additional information provided by the authors of two of the publications [158, 159 ]. The review reported an increased risk of diabetes when consuming 330 ml/day of artificially sweetened soft drinks; however, substantial heterogeneity was described among the cohort studies. Also, another systematic review published in 2016 [161] described a positive association between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and type-2 diabetes incidence; however, the authors of this review rated their findings as biased.
We found 6 prospective cohort studies (4 with an AS exposure and 2 with a “diet beverage” exposure), 1 retrospective cohort study (with AS exposure) and 1 case-control study (with AS exposure) on the risk of developing diabetes. These studies are summarized in Table 4.
Table 4 Cohort studies on the association of AS consumption and risk of developing diabetes
Full size table
Among the studies investigating the exposure to AS, 2 prospective cohort studies [162, 163] and one case-control study [164] described an increased risk of type-2 diabetes, while 2 prospective [160, 165] and 1 retrospective cohort studies [166] found no association between AS consumption and risk of diabetes. There were no studies investigating diabetes risk in association with NNCS consumption.
Headaches
We found 3 RCTs [167,168,169] with a cross-over design and 2 cohort studies [170, 171] investigating the effect of AS on headaches. These included either healthy populations or populations with a subjectively reported sensitivity to AS or people with a history of migraines. Two of them (one RCT [168] and one cohort study [170 ]) described a significant positive association, in the others no significant association was found between AS consumption and headaches.
Cognitive effects, mental health
RCTs assessing the behavior and mood of essentially healthy children after they were given a preload of either an artificially sweetened or sugar-sweetened food or beverage found no consistent effect of ASs on behavior. Most of the interventional and observational studies investigating the effect of an AS preload on cognitive abilities in healthy children and adults demonstrated that there was no association between cognitive performance, measured by an array of tests, and the intake of ASs in different forms.
Three studies (2 RCTs and 1 cohort study) investigated the effect of AS on depression and described an increased risk of developing depression symptoms or increased severity of symptoms in mood disorder patients [172,173,174 ]. In 1 case-control study, consumption of saccharin was significantly positively associated with the risk of Alzheimer’s disease [175 ].
Obstetric outcomes
Three cohort studies investigated the effect of AS consumption and preterm delivery [176,177,178 ], two of them describing a significant positive, while one described no association. One case-control study described no association between saccharin use before conception or during pregnancy and spontaneous abortion [179 ].
Weight change
We found 4 systematic reviews addressing the question whether NNS consumption has an unfavorable or favorable effect on body weight [22, 180,181,182 ]. Details of these reviews are described in Table 2. Miller et al. [181] indicated, based on data from RCTs, that substituting low-calorie sweeteners (LCS, including NNSs and sugar-alcohols) for calorically dense alternatives resulted in a modest reduction of body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and waist circumference. Rogers et al. [182] concluded, based on results of relevant RCTs, that low-energy sweetener consumption does not increase body weight. The meta-analysis of observational studies showed a significant positive association between LCS intake and slightly increased BMI, but no association with body weight or fat mass. Pereira et al. [180] concluded that results of the epidemiologic studies are highly inconsistent.
A systematic review [22] focusing on metabolic health effects of AS consumption in pediatric populations identified 3 large cohort studies with long-term follow-up, supporting the existence of an association between ASB (artificially sweetened beverage) consumption and weight gain in children, while 2 other prospective cohort studies described no or an inverse association with obesity. The identified 3 RCTs on children described no differences in weight or BMI between the NNS and the control groups.
Another systematic review [183] focusing on long-term metabolic effects of early NNS consumption concluded that the current evidence of the long-term metabolic effects of NNS exposure during gestation, infancy, and childhood is limited and inconsistent.
We found 31 interventional studies (27 RCTs [58, 61, 62, 74, 77, 184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,200,201,202,203,204,205] and 4 non-RCTs [67, 68, 79, 206 ]) and 36 observational studies [158, 159, 202, 203, 207,208,209,210,211,212,213,214,215,216,217,218,219,220,221,222,223,224,225,226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234,235,236,237,238,239,240,241] on the effect of NNS consumption on BMI or weight change, including recently published studies, which were not included in the systematic reviews presented above.
Of the 27 RCTs, 14 reported a weight reduction after the intervention with NNSs or diet beverages, 2 reported an increase in weight, while in 11 RCTs no weight change was observed. After subdividing the RCTs according to the type of exposure, we found 15 RCTs with an AS intervention, 8 describing a decrease in body weight after the AS intervention as compared to the (sugar-containing or unmodified) control intervention, 1 describing an increase, while in 6 AS intervention studies no differences were observed between the two groups. There were 3 RCTs with a NNCS (stevia) intervention [187, 204, 242 ]. None of them described a difference in change of body weight between the intervention and control groups.
Of the 17 prospective cohort studies, 10 described a positive association (either statistically significant or a non-significant trend) between NNS or diet beverage consumption and weight gain/increased BMI [159, 207,208,209,210,211, 216, 218, 237, 239 ], 3 observed an inverse association [214, 215, 217 ], while in 4 prospective cohort studies no association [212, 213, 219, 220] between body weight and NNS consumption was found. When investigating the subgroup of prospective cohort studies with a clear AS intervention (8 studies), we found 7 studies describing a positive [208,209,210, 216, 218, 237, 239] and 1 study describing no association [219] between AS consumption and weight gain/increased BMI. There were no cohort studies with a NNCS intervention reporting on weight gain or obesity.
Of the 17 cross-sectional studies, 12 described a positive [158, 222,223,224,225,226, 229,230,231,232,233, 241 ], 2 a negative [227, 235] and 3 no association [221, 228, 234] between NNS or diet beverage consumption and weight gain/increased BMI.
Health outcomes in non-healthy populations (diabetes and hypertension)
There are two main disease groups with a relatively wide literature of NNS intervention studies. In type-1 and type-2 diabetes patients, the effects of NNS use on diabetic control, including, but not limited to, blood glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), are widely investigated. We found 21 interventional studies (13 RCTs [33, 198, 243,244,245,246,247,248,249,250,251,252,253] and 4 non-RCTs [254,255,256,257] with an AS intervention, and 4 RCTs [193, 258,259,260 ]) and 2 non-RCT with an NNCS intervention [261] on this topic.Most of the studies described no difference in diabetic patients on diabetic control between the NNS intervention and the control group. Some studies investigated the glycemic effects of NNSs in people with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance [204, 206, 262 ].
The other disease group consists of hypertensive patients, where the role of NNSs in blood pressure control has been investigated. We found 9 RCTs [187, 193, 242, 259, 263,264,265,266,267 ], 4 prospective cohort studies [268,269,270,271 ], 1 case-control study [272] and 1 cross-sectional study [273] on this question, with controversial results.
Discussion
Summary of findings
Overall the evidence for health outcomes of AS is inconsistent and there are numerous gaps in the evidence base. In healthy subjects, appetite and short term food intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental caries, weight gain and risk of obesity were the most investigated health outcomes.
In case of the health outcome appetite and short term food intake, a majority of studies were short interventions with a cross-over design. A smaller part were randomized controlled trials with an intervention duration of 4 weeks up to 18 months. In case of the longer interventions, the type and dosage of the NNS was often not defined.
Bladder cancer and cancer of the urinary tract were investigated in multiple studies. For this type of cancer a systematic review may provide conclusive evidence. Most of the studies on urinary tract cancer investigated effects of artificial sweeteners in general; a smaller number investigated the effects of aspartame or saccharin. Other types of cancer were investigated in only one or a low number of studies.
We also found several studies on the role of NNS in dental caries prevention. Included studies suggested that stevia in chewing gum or NNCS beverages instead of sugar-sweetened beverages may be an effective tool for dental caries prevention. However, it has to be mentioned, that while sugar alcohols are widely used in chewing gums for caries prevention, and the literature on their effects is broad, the effects of NNCS on dental caries is investigated in a limited number of studies. In addition, in these studies, NNCSs were often combined with sugar alcohols. It would be interesting to see more comparative studies on the effectiveness of NNCS alone versus other interventions in influencing dental plaque pH; or studies with a longer intervention period and follow-up.
The effect of NNS on risk of diabetes was investigated in a limited number of cohort studies. These studies mainly focused on artificially sweetened beverage or diet beverage consumption and described different directions of effect. Further studies, focusing on special types of NNS (also including NNCS), are required.
Intervention studies on weight change focused mainly on the question whether NNS can be efficiently used in weight management. As part of weight loss intervention programs, more intervention studies would be required, to investigate the effects of NNS alone on body weight in both overweight, obese and normal-weight subjects. This would be especially important, since it is very difficult in observational studies to evaluate causality between NNS consumption and BMI/weight change and therefore results of these studies have to be interpreted with caution. A positive association between NNS consumption and weight gain in observational studies may be the consequence of and not the reason for overweight and obesity. Moreover, other factors, such as population characteristics, may influence the results of observational studies.
In subjects with diabetes, the effects of NNS were investigated mainly on glycemic control. Because of the heterogeneous, if not contradictory results, a thorough analysis of these findings in a full-fledged systematic review including meta-analyses, subgroup and sensitivity analyses is needed and might help to resolve some of the ongoing uncertainties. Further studies on long-term patient-relevant outcomes in diabetes are required.
The effect of NNS on lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients should also be analyzed in a high quality systematic review and meta-analysis.
Regarding NNCS, although Stevia is increasingly used as a sweetener, the number of studies on its health effects is limited as of now. Studies investigating the effects of NNCS on cancer or diabetes risk are completely lacking, while there are only few studies on weight gain and obesity risk. Clearly, there is a need for further research.
Eligible NNS not addressed by any of the included primary studies were: neotame, alitame, neohesperidin DC, thaumatin and brazzein.
Strength and limitations of this scoping review
The strength of our scoping review is its inclusion of all types of primary studies and systematic reviews which investigate any health effect of any NNS in any population. We are therefore able to present a comprehensive overview of the available scientific evidence on health effects of NNS.
Our scoping review might be limited by the following factors. Firstly, the literature search was conducted in three major and comprehensive databases, but we might have inadvertently missed relevant studies listed in other databases. Secondly, the title abstract screening was conducted by one reviewer who might have inadvertently excluded relevant studies at the first stage of the screening. This limitation might be evened out by conducting the literature search in two steps. In the second step, relevant references for both topics were identified and the chances for including all relevant references in our review were increased.
Detailed assessment of the study quality is not covered in a scoping review and was not conducted in the context of our scoping review. Therefore, information gathered on the health outcome includes only its direction of effect but no information on the internal or external validity of the study results.
Discussion of findings in light of other evidence summaries
In our scoping review we found a large number of studies of different designs, investigating effects of different types of NNS in different populations on a variety of health outcomes.
Systematic reviews to summarize the available evidence are already available (Table 2 ). However, they often have methodological limitations (e.g. language limitation of the search, electronic search in only one database, etc.) or a narrow scope.
There are systematic reviews, which also included key words for “diet soda” and “diet beverage” in their search strategy. There are several, primarily observational studies, where the exposure is defined as “diet”, which may indicate NNS-containing beverages, but further details are often not provided. Therefore, it is clearly a challenge when trying to synthesize the evidence to decide, how to deal with studies describing the intervention/exposure as “diet beverage”, “diet drink” or “diet soda” only. We also included such studies in this scoping review; however, it has to be mentioned that we did not include specific search terms for “diet” beverages/sodas in our search strategy, therefore the list of studies reporting on the effects of diet beverage etc. may be incomplete.
Implications of findings for practice, policy and future research
Current evidence demonstrates that there is a need for both further primary research and high quality comprehensive systematic reviews including meta-analyses, to inform future recommendations about the health benefits and risks of NNS to advise and support health care practice and public health decision-making.
This scoping review highlights the need for studies which investigate the long-term effects of individual sweeteners on some of the less well-researched health outcomes (e.g. headaches, depression or other mood disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, risk of preterm delivery). Future studies need to be rigorous in design and conduct, with well-defined interventions (providing information on type and dosage of the non-nutritive sweetener) and controls. Study reports should include detailed descriptions of all methodological aspects to enable proper interpretation of the results.
Systematic reviews are required for health outcomes with a large number of primary studies, but without conclusive evidence (e.g. appetite and short term food intake, risk of cancer, dental caries, risk of diabetes, glycaemic control in subjects with diabetes and blood pressure control in hypertensive patients) to support the formulation of recommendations and to be able to decide whether further, well-designed primary studies are required.
Conclusions
There are numerous gaps in evidence related to the health effects of NNS in both healthy and non-healthy populations. In healthy subjects appetite and short term food intake, risk of cancer, risk of diabetes, risk of dental caries are the most investigated health outcomes, all of them without any conclusive evidence. There is a need for well-conducted systematic reviews to quantitatively summarize results and assess their validity. Besides, there are numerous health outcomes, like incidence of headaches in association with NNS consumption, depression, Alzheimer’s disease, risk of preterm delivery, behavioural effects, cardiovascular effects or risk of chronic kidney disease, which were investigated in only few studies and further research activity is needed. A systematic review may also help to enable formulating recommendations for subjects with diabetes and hypertension on using NNS.

Abstract
Objective: Nonnutritive (NNSs) are used in place of sugars to reduce caloric and glycemic intake while providing desired sweetness, commonly replacing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with "diet" (zero-calorie) alternatives. Concern has developed due to observational data associating NNSs with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease. This counterpoint argues that, in general, NNSs used in place of added or excess sugars in the diet are likely beneficial.
Methods: A literature review was conducted on interventional trials investigating NNSs and obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Key words used in the search included artificial sweeteners, nonnutritive sweeteners, saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, stevia/steviol, acesulfame potassium, meal replacements, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and weight.
Results: Interventional data and indirect interventional data consistently showed beneficial effects on weight and cardiometabolic health, including glycemia, when SSBs or other energy-dense foods were replaced by artificially sweetened beverages or artificially sweetened meal replacements.
Conclusion: Although NNSs correlate with obesity and adiposity-based chronic disease, those data are fraught with confounding and error. Plausibility has been suggested on the basis of preclinical research on neuroendocrine control of appetite, satiety, and cravings plus the gut microbiome. However, interventional data reveal that replacing caloric/glycemic energy intake via NNSs creates an energy deficit resulting in weight loss and improvement in disease-especially dysglycemic disease. Intensive dietary intervention using artificially sweetened meal replacements shows a marked clinical benefit without detriment from their NNSs. Furthermore, beverages sweetened with NNSs rather than SSBs have been noted to be a critical component for those succeeding in maintaining weight loss. Although individual responses to the effects of NNSs are always warranted just like in any clinical situation, patients should not be advised to avoid NNSs in the context of dietary intervention to improve quality and energy deficit.

Non-Nutritive Sweeteners (Artificial Sweeteners)
Got a sweet tooth? Here’s the scoop on artificial sweeteners or “non-nutritive sweeteners” as we call them.
Non-Nutritive Sweeteners
The American Heart Association labels low-calorie sweeteners, artificial sweeteners, and noncaloric sweeteners as non-nutritive sweeteners (NNSs), since they offer no nutritional benefits such as vitamins and minerals. They may be low in calories or have no calories, depending upon the brand.
The FDA has approved these NNSs as safe for use in foods and beverages:
Aspartame (NutraSweet ® and Equal ®)
Acesulfame-K (Sweet One ®)
Neotame
Saccharin (Sweet’N Low ®)
Sucralose (Splenda ®)
FDA considers stevia (Truvia ® and PureVia ® ), monk fruit, and allulose to be Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) for use as NNSs.
Artificial Sweeteners in the Real World
The AHA strongly recommends limiting added sugars. Too much sugar can lead to weight gain, and those extra pounds can lead to a string of health problems. In addition to obesity, it can increase triglyceride levels, a risk factor for heart disease.
Not only are foods and drinks that are high in added sugars generally high in calories and low in nutritional value, they also take the place of more nutritious foods. For example, reaching for a regular soda instead of low-fat or non-fat milk.
Replacing sugary foods and drinks with sugar-free options containing NNSs is one way to limit calories and achieve or maintain a healthy weight. Also, when used to replace food and drinks with added sugars, it can help people with diabetes manage blood glucose levels. For example, swapping a full-calorie soda with diet soda is one way of not increasing blood glucose levels while satisfying a sweet tooth.
We don’t know for sure if using NNSs in food and drinks makes people actually eat or drink fewer calories every day. But reducing the amount of added sugar in your diet? That we know for sure is a good thing.
As you make healthy choices throughout your day, choose foods and beverages that are high in nutrients and low in saturated and trans fats and added sugars. Keep in mind that just because a product is “sugar free,” it doesn’t always mean that it’s healthy.
Foods and beverages that contain NNSs can be included in a healthy diet, as long as the calories they save you are not added back by adding more foods as a reward later in the day, adding back calories that take you over your daily limit.

Cutting Back
If you're trying to lose weight, you're probably searching for the best ways to cut calories from your diet. Using no-calorie sweeteners instead of sugar may help you create a calorie deficit .
But should you use artificial sweeteners for weight loss? Some people worry that artificial sweeteners cause weight gain, not weight loss. And many healthy eaters are concerned about artificial sweetener safety.
Artificial Sweeteners
There are many artificial sweeteners to choose from. Some provide no calories while others provide a very small amount that is not likely to make a difference in your total daily calorie intake . Here's an overview of the most popular brands of artificial sweeteners.
Advantame : 20,000 times sweeter than sugar
Nutrasweet, Equal or Sugar Twin (Aspartame): 200 times sweeter than sugar
Splenda (Sucralose): 600 times sweeter than sugar
Sweet and Low, Sweet Twin, Sweet'N Low, Necta Sweet (Saccharin ): 200-700 times sweeter than sugar
Sweet One, Sunett (Acesulfame Potassium or Ace-K): 200 times sweeter than sugar
Truvia, PureVia, Enliten (Stevia variations): 200-400 times sweeter than sugar
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides more information about each sweetener permitted for use in the foods and drinks that you consume. 1 ﻿
Safety
Many consumers are concerned about side effects of artificial sweeteners. But the issue of sweetener safety is highly controversial. So if you want to know if artificial sweeteners are safe, the answer will probably depend on who you ask.
Safe Sweeteners
Some high-intensity sweeteners are considered safe for consumption by the general public, according to the FDA. These include:
Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K)
Advantame
Aspartame
Neotame
Saccharin
Sucralose
The FDA also considers highly-purified steviol glycoside (Stevia) to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
So which sweeteners might be unsafe? In the United States, the FDA prohibits the use of cyclamate even though the sweetener is used in other countries. 2 Whole-leaf and crude Stevia extracts also are not permitted for use as sweeteners.
If you have a condition called phenylketonuria (PKU), your body may not react well to aspartame. For this reason, the FDA says you should avoid or limit foods and drinks that contain aspartame.
But even though the FDA has determined certain products are safe for you to use, many health experts are still unconvinced. Some users even say that they experience side effects with artificial sweeteners.
Bruce Y. Lee, MD, associate professor of international health and director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, is one of those experts. According to Dr. Lee, consumers should be concerned about sweetener safety even if they are generally recognized as safe.
"I would recommend being cautious about artificial sweeteners. Newly introduced sweeteners haven’t been around long enough for long-term studies on health risk," Dr. Lee says.
Other experts express greater concern. Larry Goldfarb, DC, founder of Medical and Wellness Center of New Jersey, claims that there were political and financial motivations behind the approval of certain sweeteners.
"The public has been duped that artificial sweeteners are fine to use and no harmful effects have been shown to exist. Research has shown just the opposite," says Dr. Goldfarb.
Dr. Goldfarb also notes that some studies have shown a relationship between aspartame and several serious diseases including cancer. But the FDA stands by their safety rating, stating "aspartame is one of the most exhaustively studied substances in the human food supply, with more than 100 studies supporting its safety."
Weight Gain
Even if you're not concerned about the safety of the sweeteners, you may not want to use them for weight loss. Some experts believe that using artificial sweeteners may cause weight gain, not weight loss. 3 ﻿
For years, researchers have been studying the way that our bodies and our brains react to low-calorie or no-calorie sweeteners.
Some studies have found that when we consume these sweeteners, we end up eating more food and consuming more calories overall.
Some scientists believe that because artificial sweeteners are so much sweeter than sugar, they train our brains to crave increasingly sweet foods. In addition, because these sweeteners do not provide calories, they confuse normal brain signals that tell us to stop eating when we've had enough food.
Other scientists think that eating artificially sweetened treats gives us an excuse to eat more food overall. 4 ﻿ For example, if you buy diet cookies, you might be tempted to eat more of them because you might think that they do less harm to your weight loss program. As a result, you may consume more calories overall.
But not all research studies have shown negative effects from artificial sweeteners. Some researchers have found that replacing high-calorie foods and beverages with lower calorie or no-calorie sweetened treats can lead to weight loss. One researcher said that the results are most dramatic when switching from high-calorie sodas to diet sodas with no calories.
So where does this leave you? Scientists say that trying to study eating behavior is too complicated to give exact answers. Even if a study says that artificial sweeteners may work for weight loss, your experience may be different.
To find the best plan for your health and well-being, you may want to think about how you use artificial sweeteners in your diet.
Weight Loss
If you currently eat a lot of foods with sugar, swapping them for foods with artificial sweeteners may be a reasonable first step. This process may help you become more thoughtful about your food choices and more careful about your meal planning.
"Ideally, it is best to cut down on all sweeteners as much as possible. But not everyone can do that," says Lee. "So, if there aren’t other options, then you could consider temporarily moving to artificial sweeteners from sugar. But again, ultimately, it is better to eventually move to natural means and reduce sweeteners in general."
Becoming mindful of your cravings and food choices might help you to reduce your dependence on sweeteners.
For example, you might crave a sweet soda or coffee drink in the afternoon to boost your energy levels. But even if you grab a diet drink with no calories, you may do more harm than good.
A caffeinated beverage dehydrates your body, which can cause fatigue. Drinking water instead boosts hydration, may improve your energy level, and provides zero calories.
6 Reasons to Drink More Water
Cutting Back
Dr. Lee notes that a sweet tooth is a learned phenomenon. "Like any habit, you can re-train yourself," he says. And Dr. Goldfarb agrees that the best first step is to re-program your taste buds. He offers a few tips to help reduce your dependence on sweets.
Eat Half and Eat Slowly
You will feel full if you eat slowly and then resist the temptation to finish the plate of food just because it's there. Eating more slowly helps your belly and your brain respond to the food that you've consumed. "Mindful eating" is one of the best ways to cut back on sugar and portion sizes in general.
Make Healthy Choices
Include healthy fats in your diet as they can help curb your appetite for sugar. Add avocado to your sandwich or salads or eat a single serving of salmon or tuna for dinner to feel more satisfied.
Give Yourself a Deadline
Reduce your sugar intake over a two week period and then just stop. You'll be surprised how easy it is. Cutting back on sugar will also give you room in your calorie budget to enjoy more nutritious diet-friendly foods.
Get Help
Reach out to experts if you can't cut sugar on your own. Seeking the care of a dietitian or nutritionist may be a good place to start.
A Word From Verywell
Artificial sweeteners may help some people lose weight. But many experts remain concerned about side effects and weight gain. So choose naturally sweet foods like whole fruit to satisfy your sweet tooth and take advantage of the vitamins, minerals, and other benefits that whole foods provide. And reach out to your healthcare team if you are concerned about side effects of artificial sweeteners or need help cutting back.
