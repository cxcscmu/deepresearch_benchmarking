I'm trying to understand why some people choose to go to college far away from home. At first glance, it seems like going to a nearby college would be more convenient—closer to family, maybe lower costs, and familiar surroundings. But clearly, many students opt for colleges that are far away. There must be some benefits or reasons that make them choose distance over proximity.

Let me think about this step by step. First, I need to consider what college represents for most people. It's a significant phase in one's life, marking the transition from high school to adulthood. College is not just about education; it's also about personal growth, independence, and experiencing new things. So, perhaps going far away enhances these aspects.

One possible reason is exposure to new environments and cultures. If someone grows up in a small town, going to a college in a big city can offer entirely new experiences. Similarly, attending a college in a different part of the country or even abroad can expose students to diverse perspectives and ways of life. This exposure can be invaluable for personal development and broadening one's horizons.

Another factor might be the quality of education. Some of the top colleges in the world are located in specific regions. Students who aspire to attend these institutions may have no choice but to go far away from home to receive the education they desire. Reputation and academic programs could be major draws that outweigh the inconvenience of distance.

Networking opportunities could also play a role. Colleges in certain areas might have stronger connections to industries or professions that students are interested in. For example, going to college in Silicon Valley could offer better chances for internships and jobs in tech companies. Similarly, attending college in New York might be attractive for those interested in fashion, finance, or arts.

Moreover, going to college far away can provide a fresh start. High school relationships and social dynamics can be left behind, allowing students to create a new identity and make new friends based on shared interests rather than pre-existing social ties.

Independence is another significant aspect. Living away from home forces students to take care of themselves, manage their finances, and make decisions without constant parental guidance. This can be an essential part of growing up and developing crucial life skills.

On the other hand, there are downsides to consider. Being far away from home means less frequent visits and support from family, which can be challenging, especially during difficult times. The cost of travel to and from home can add up, and homesickness is a common issue for students who are away from their support systems.

Perhaps some students see these challenges as opportunities to grow and overcome obstacles. The experience of facing and conquering homesickness or learning to manage alone can be incredibly empowering.

I should also consider the social aspects. Some students might feel that their local colleges don't offer the right fit in terms of campus culture, extracurricular activities, or student body diversity. Going elsewhere could mean finding a community that better matches their interests and values.

Additionally, for international students, going to college abroad is often seen as a way to improve their career prospects, especially if they aspire to work internationally or in global companies.

Let me try to summarize. People choose to go to college far away from home for various reasons, including:

1. Exposure to new environments and cultures.

2. Access to higher quality education or specific academic programs.

3. Better networking opportunities in desired industries.

4. A fresh start socially and personally.

5. Opportunities to develop independence and life skills.

6. Finding a better fit in terms of campus culture and community.

Of course, these benefits come with challenges, such as homesickness and increased costs, but many students see the advantages as worth the trade-offs.

I think this covers the main points, but maybe I can dig a bit deeper. Maybe there are some statistics or studies that have been done on this topic. It might be helpful to look into research about the effects of attending college away from home versus nearby.

Pros And Cons Of Going To School Far Away From Home
There are both good and bad things about going to school literally a thousand miles away from home

When I decided to go to school over a thousand miles away from home (1,707.7 to be exact), I knew there would be certain drawbacks but also plenty of perks. Some things, like how much I really miss home, I underestimated, while others, like the limited amount of restaurant choices in town of under five thousand are not as bad as I thought they would be.
Pro: Getting to experience new people, places, and things.
Con: Not having the comfort of the people, places, and things you already know.
I firmly believe that change is a positive thing, but from friends to restaurants to the landscape, it’s hard to adjust. I grew up with mountains literally always on the horizon, and I sometimes find myself looking out and searching for them and the comfort they brought me back home.
Pro: You’re no longer living with your parents and are (mostly) free of their physical presence and control.
Con: They aren’t there to support you when you mess up (as they warned you would).
The fact that my mom isn’t around to make sure I take her advice is a curse and a blessing. I can make my own decisions, but they are not always the right ones, and although my mom isn’t physically here, she’s always ready to say “I told you so” nonetheless.
Pro: Your parents aren’t there to control what you spend your money on.
Con: This causes you to often make impulse purchases that you might later regret.
I’ll admit that I didn’t necessarily need three different pairs of chelsea boots, but in the moment without someone there to stop me I felt like I did.
Pro: Meeting all kinds of new people from all over the country.
Con: Losing touch with old friends.
Catching up with some of my old friends makes me think they are just reliving high school; people who have been friends since middle school are rooming together and they regularly attend sporting events at our old school. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that, but that’s not at all what I wanted, which is why I chose a school so far away, but it makes it so much harder to consistently keep in touch with friends when they’re in a different time zone as you.
Pro: No curfew or really any restrictions about where and when you do mostly anything.
Con: When you go back home that curfew is reintroduced.
Having no one around to make you go to class is a dangerous thing. So is the fact that no one is around to remind you that more than four hours of sleep a night is necessary. And when you go back home after adjusting to not having anyone monitoring you to be met with a mom that tries to enforce an 11 o’clock curfew, it can cause some conflict.
Pro: It’s nothing like high school.
Con: It’s nothing like high school.
Don’t get me wrong, I am not one of those people who want to relive four years of awkwardness and supposed self-actualization, but the familiarity that comes from going to school with the relatively same group of people for years is something I’ll admit I miss. I’ll take the harder courses, new responsibility, and uncharted territory over braces and lockers any day, but I’ll admit the transition is not an easy one to make.

The Pros and Cons of Attending College Close vs Far From Home | CollegeVine Blog

The Pros and Cons of Attending College Close vs Far From Home
Finalizing your college list, a working list of the colleges to which you intend to apply, can be a long and involved process. You’ll need to balance a number of different priorities and values as you narrow down the 7,000 undergraduate institutes in the United States to a mere ten or so that you’d like to attend. It takes a lot of introspection and insight from those you trust before you can arrive at a balanced and effective list.
The factors that you weigh as you choose the schools you’re interested in will depend in large part on your personal priorities. For example, some students know they want to attend a small college in a big city. Other students might prefer a school close to the ocean or one known for its engineering program. All of these preferences will combine to help create your college list.
As you consider the preferences that will mold your college list, you’ll need to think carefully about each and how important it is to you overall. Not only that, but you’ll also have to predict how important each will be for you in the long run. Sometimes a preference might seem initially important to you, but could become less so over time.
One major consideration for many students is how far away from home they are willing to go for college. Some students know right away that staying close to home is not a top priority, while others recognize that they will have difficulty relocating any significant distance. And some students know that going far away will be initially difficult, but they will be be able to adjust over time, if the school is the right fit.
In this post, we’ll discuss going to college close to home versus going to college far away. We’ll outline some of the common pros and cons of each decision to help frame your thinking as you make this important choice about your future. To learn more about the benefits and disadvantages of going to college close to home or going to college far away, keep reading.
Benefits of Staying Close to Home
There are many benefits that come to mind immediately when you think about staying close to home as you begin your college career. One of the most obvious is the minimization of potential homesickness. College can include a period of adjustment for any student, and going through those changes far from home can make you homesick. If you stick close to home, you’ll likely have lots of support from your family and even friends while you tackle the next chapter of your life.
You’ll also have access to familiar resources. You may already know the town or area well, so you’ll have an easier time learning where to find groceries, a pharmacy, restaurants, and any other off-campus amenities. You’ll also usually be able to continue to see the same doctor and dentist, use the same bank, and not change your voter registration or deal with absentee ballots. Many logistics will be simplified.
In addition, going to college in close proximity to your parents often means access to other types of resources. You may have the option of visiting anytime you need a break from campus. A home-cooked meal and a free laundry room are only a drive away. Some students going to college close to their parents’ home even continue to live at home in order to save costs on room and board.
Your proximity will also ensure more continuity in your life. You might be able to keep your job from high school. You might have friends who are also staying local, meaning that your social circle can remain intact. You may even continue to participate in the same activities, like a club soccer team, church, or volunteer group.
Finally, going to school close to where you grew up often means that your parents and support network are almost immediately available to you should there be an emergency. At the same time, you would be able to make it home quickly if anyone there needed your immediate help. Indeed, there are many benefits of going to college close to home.
Drawbacks of Going to College Close to Home
Sometimes, though, staying close to home for college is not all it’s cracked up to be.
For one, living nearby means that your parents will be able to visit frequently and will likely expect you to do the same, which may potentially be a hindrance as you develop greater independence.
You’ll also want to think about the lack of anonymity you’ll have if you go to college close to home. It may not be uncommon for you to run into acquaintances, family friends, high school teachers, or classmates. You may even end up spending most of your time with your family or high school friends. While this is comforting to some, to others it might seem a bit suffocating. Think about how much of a fresh start you are after before choosing to attend college close to home.
Finally, by staying close to home you sometimes sacrifice the opportunity to experience something different for four years. It may not seem like it now, but four years is ultimately not a huge time commitment in your life. The opportunity to experience a different setting or more diverse surroundings for a finite period of time does not surface often in life. If you know you’ve always wanted to try living in the city, the mountains, or just someplace else, this could be a good time to try it.
While there are certainly many benefits to attending a college close by, there are also some disadvantages. You should consider both sides before making a decision.
Benefits of Going to College Far Away
Going to college far away from your home is also an option that presents a number of unique benefits.
For one, by going someplace new on your own, you will inevitably gain more independence. It will be up to you to handle the small logistics you might be used to your parents managing on your behalf. For example, if you get a parking ticket or need to pick up a prescription, those responsibilities will fall squarely on your own shoulders.
You’ll need to find your own way around a new region, locating the resources that you’ll need along the way, but as you do so you will grow in ways that you might not have otherwise. You will take on adult responsibilities and experience what may be your first real-world independence. You will make your own decisions and hold yourself accountable for them.
Another benefit of going to college far from home is the opportunity to experience living in a new region. You might be exposed to new cultures and lifestyles. You might get to experience life in a big city or a rural town for the first time. You’ll get a chance to broaden your horizon. If you’ve always wanted to live in New York City or Southern California or the Rockies, this may be the time to make it happen.
Finally, if you go to college far away, you will get a fresh start. Many students want the chance to reinvent themselves after high school, and when you go to college far away, you can create your new life from scratch. None of your high school mistakes or expectations will follow you. You can pursue new friendships, new activities, and a new lifestyle without the shadow of your high school self following along. For many students, this is a refreshing way to turn over a new leaf.
Drawbacks of Going to College Far Away
Of course, attending college far away is not without its disadvantages. For one, you may experience homesickness when you leave everything you’ve known at home to start anew again. It may take you a while to adjust to your new life or you might not find a new group of friends right away. While this adjustment period is normal, it sometimes takes longer than others and you’ll have to decide if you’re willing to put up with it for however long it lasts.
You will also have to accept that you’ll be missing out on milestones at home. If you’re used to attending your younger brother’s baseball games or your grandmother’s piano concerts, these are more than likely things that you’ll have to miss out on now that you’re far away. There may even be holidays or family events that you can’t attend.
Another potential drawback is the cost of moving far away. You will need to pay for travel to and from your college each time you go, and for some students this means that going home for the holidays is not in the budget. You’ll also need to consider the shipping costs to send your belongings to your new college. If you can’t ship them, there will be things you’ll need to buy when you arrive. Overall, going to school far away tends to involve more logistical costs than staying close to home.
Finally, if there is an emergency and you are attending a college that is far from home, it will take longer to be reunited with your family. If you have to travel home unexpectedly, the costs may be exorbitant. If you have a medical emergency, you will have to cope with it independently until a family member can arrive, if they are able to afford the travel costs.
Distance from home is often a central factor weighed into college-list creation. Some students immediately know their comfort level for being away, and others aren’t quite so sure. In any case, there is nearly always a period of adjustment that occurs when you begin college, whether you do so close to home or on the other side of the country. Discuss your choices with your family and hear their perspective on the issue, too. Some families might even offer to help with travel costs or logistics.

Pros and Cons of Choosing a College Close to Home
By Laura Bulanda Last updated on June 15, 2020
Choosing a college close to home probably sounds like a dream to your parents. They probably love the idea of having you close and maybe you do too, but going to school in the ballpark of your hometown isn’t the right fit for everyone.
So, for those of you trying to decide if staying close to home is right for you, we’ll lay out the pros and cons of choosing a college around the corner from your hometown.
Pros:
1. Food – Not Microwaved
Ramen and nuked mac and cheese can only hold you over for so long. You can only substitute an actual meal with a granola bar for a few weeks until your craving system starts screaming for some food made by Chef Boyar-mom, rather than Chef Boyardee. A quick trip home for a Sunday night dinner gives you a relief from the microwavable meals in the dorms.

2. Escape From Campus
Sometimes a college campus can get a little constricting. You do everything on the college grounds – you eat, study, go to class, hang out with friends, and sleep on campus. Your entire life happens in the same area, and it might leave you feeling trapped mid-semester.
Running home for a quick nap in your own bed or a snuggle with your loving pet can be a relief for the soul and an energizer to finish out the remainder of the semester.
3. No FOMO
The thought of missing out on your little brother’s first home run or your cousin’s final dance recital can give you some serious FOMO (i.e. Fear Of Missing Out). Going home for an hour-long recital isn’t a problem when home is a quick road trip away.
4. Avoid Clothing Clutter
Stuffing all of your clothes for an entire year can be quite the task. Figuring out where to put your winter jacket while your denim shorts take precedence in the early months of classes is a little tougher than you might expect. Finding room for your warm-weather clothing is easier while your cold-climate stuff waits patiently at home.
It’s tough to expect when the weather will take a change for the colder, so having your snow boots nearby to pick up is a definite benefit for choosing a school close to home.
Advertisements
5. Laundry Load
Laundry rooms in the dorms are typically packed, and taking the time out of your busy schedule to watch your clothes dry (which is comparable to watching paint dry) is means for wearing those dirty jeans to class just a couple more times.
But, if you’re close to your mother’s clothing washing talent, you might be able to bribe her into doing a few loads of laundry for you.
6. In-State Tuition
In-state tuition is cheaper than out-of-state – a lot of times, it’s thousands of dollars cheaper. If you’re already fretting about the cost of college, consider your in-state options!
7. Parent Visits
You won’t have to wait for parents weekend to get a free meal. Your parents will miss you, and taking you out to dinner will be a perfect weekend activity for them and you. It’s a good opportunity to keep them updated (and to ask for a little extra cash if they’re feeling generous).
Advertisements
8. Small Holiday Weekends
Unfortunately you won’t get a weeklong break for every national or religious holiday (though it’d be nice…). On those holidays like Easter and Labor Day, you won’t miss out on the yummy meals and unparalleled family memories.
9. Move-in/Move-out Ease
Stuffing your entire life into a U-Haul behind your car is hard enough. Having to make it fit in one trip is even harder. With a campus closer to home, you might be able to con your parents into making a couple (few) trips to get that last bag (or two) of clothes to your dorm.
Cons:
1. Can’t…Let… Go
So, your parents love you. They might joke about getting you out of the house, but they’ll miss you. They’ll miss knowing where you are at all times and knowing that you’ll be home on curfew (or at least close).
Having you close to home might make your parents feel like they’ve still got you for a couple more years. They may have a harder time letting go of being your guidance, making it hard for you to grow independently.

2. “Hello” Marathon
If you go to a college close to where you went to high school, you’ll also be close to the people who went to high school with you. You could find yourself walking to class and feeling like you’re back in the halls of your high school. Seeing familiar faces can be nice, but saying hello to that many people might make the college experience feel a little too familiar.
3. Scenery Clone
Your close-to-home campus is probably surrounded by a lot of the same stores, interstates, and sceneries. Driving from campus to run errands will make you feel a bit of déjà vu, like you’re running to the grocery store for you mom.
Advertisements
4. Too Many Home Visits
Though it might be nice to grab a quick home-style meal from your parents, you might catch yourself doing it a bit too often. You’ll miss out on the college experience if you let yourself run home every weekend. We get it, it’s comfortable there. But, being in uncomfortable situations is part of college!
5. Parental Expectations on Visits
So, maybe you’re not all about going home every weekend. You enjoy your newfound independence. But now mom is like, “honey, I made your favorite dinner tonight. Aren’t you going to come home?” She lays the guilt trip and then you find yourself feeling like you have to make the trip home for that plate of spaghetti.
6. Missing Out on Mr./Miss Independent
Taking your laundry home sounds nice and convenient, but you won’t be able to ask your parents to do your everyday responsibilities forever. Letting yourself avoid those responsibilities could put off your process of growing up.
7. FRIENDS
Making new friends is seriously important in college, and it all starts in the dorms. Hanging out with people from high school is fine, but it can turn your blinders on to possible new friendships. New friendships in college open up your eyes to appreciate the differences in people, and surrounding yourself with high school friends could limit the possibility of making a more diverse group of friends.
Ultimately the decision is yours. If that means you’re 1000 miles away on a campus that you’ve always dreamed about or one you never thought you’d like but it feels like home then that’s great! If you feel that same “this is it!” feeling 5 miles from home? That’s great too. You have to choose the situation that is right for YOU.

A Quantitative Study on Effects of Living Away From Home to the Academic Performance of Undergraduate Students  – Living Away From Home and Academic Performance
A Quantitative Study on Effects of Living Away From Home to the Academic Performance of Undergraduate Students
Glory, Bea. Go, Rossellini-Marie. Gonzales, Michelle Diane. Leviste, Melissa. Santos, Jan Marie. Nozawa, Michiko.
College is one of the biggest events in a person’s life as it involves not only education but also the youth’s culture. During this period, many students choose to live away from their families and live closer to school due to many different reasons such as the school is very far from home, parents live in the province, etc. This living set-up may either help the student or give him/her a hard time in their academics. However, the researchers would like to find out whether this affects the student’s academic performance. Likewise, this study aims to examine the effects of living away from home to the academic performance of undergraduate students. The researchers have constructed a scale that measures how well a student, who lives away from his/her family, performs in his/her academics. The researchers conducted a survey and focused among 50 college students in Manila, 26 males and 24 females. Purposive sampling was used in looking for the possible participants for this study. In this study, the researchers found out that that living alone does not affect the academic performance of students in a negative way. As a matter of fact, it affects students positively in a way that it makes them more independent.
As we all know, entering college is one of the biggest milestones in a person’s life. College is a mixture of higher education and youth culture for its students (Moffatt, 1991.) College life is a youth culture that exists beyond the classroom (Moffatt, 1991). It is how the students interact and what they do within the university or college. College life can be an exciting or a stressful phase in one’s life, a transitional phase from late adolescence to young adulthood. As such, it is a critical developmental for both late adolescence and young adults. Before the start of college life, there is the decision for the need of living away from the family in order to live closer to the university or college and to lessen the burden of the need for long hours of travelling back and forth. Many students decide to do this also because they want to be more independent and to live away from their families. This is a decision that may either help the student, or give him/her a hard time during college. This factor may have an effect on one’s academic performance. The outcome of this decision would make the student experience some changes that he or she has to adapt and cope with. Since living alone could possibly cause a student to experience both positive and negative consequences, this research study aims to examine whether it could affect one’s academic performance.
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
According to a study conducted by Jordyn & Byrd (2003), one of the crucial points in a young adult’s life is when they leave their parents’ home. They face the challenge of living independently on their own with minimal help from their family. Recent studies have shown that living arrangements of young adults in a way affects the different aspects of the personal development of the child. It is said that young adults who do not reside from their home faces greater problems but they use a more direct way of coping with the problems that they encounter. In a parallel study by Goldscheider & DaVanzo (1985), living away from home separates these young adults from their usual habit of day to day interaction with their family. Although the living arrangements are limited to minimal communication and interaction between the child and the family, still the bond between them exists. Children may not also achieve full emotional and financial independence because in a way parental authority and influence is still there.
Aside from the effects on the personal developments of young adults, there were also some studies that focus on the effects of the living arrangements of undergraduate students on their academic performance. López Turley and Wodtke’s (2010) study showed that students who live on campus are more advantaged than those who lived with their families. They showed better performance on their academic subjects and other school activities thus they gain higher GPAs and become more active in school compared with those who lived with their families. These students claimed that they become more ambitious, independent and better prepared when they attend to academic institutions that are away from their families. Most of them also said that they were able to concentrate more on their studies when they are living alone. Walker and Satterwhite (2002) looked into the role of a family to the academic performance of African American and Caucasian college students. They found that though the families of these students affect their performance in school, the effect is just small. Thus the relationship that these students have with their families is not a significant factor in determining their academic performance. This finding could be due to the independent lifestyle that the Westerners practice. From the time they reached the legal age, students in Western countries are expected to move out on their homes and live independently; they are able to develop into well-adjusted individuals. They try to support their own needs in order to survive without the help of their families. However, family variables could have different effects on academic performance of students from different racial ethnicity (Heiss, 1996). The researchers created this study to accommodate the differences of Asian students, particularly undergraduate students in the Philippines, from Western students. According to Watkins and Astilla (1980), the Filipino society is very family-oriented. Filipinos value the concept of family so much to the point that the family members get too attached with each other. It has been a practice in the Philippine society that children would live with their parents until they could already be fully independent and are able to establish a stable life. Filipino youths’ independence cannot be predicted by their age rather, on the level of their maturity. So as most college students in the Philippines are still dependent on their parents, it is interesting to know the effect of their families on their academic performance especially when students have to study away from their family. Given this, the researchers will be examining how living away from one’s family could affect a student when it comes to his or her academic performance.
Studies have shown that students who live on campus are more advantaged than those who lived with their families.
They showed better performance on their academic subjects and other school activities thus they gain higher GPAs
and become more active in school compared with those who lived with their families. López Turley and Wodtke’s (2010)
METHODOLOGY
This chapter discusses the proposed study’s research design. It also describes the target respondents and the corresponding sampling technique, which will be utilized to recruit them. The survey questionnaire will also be discussed as the main instrument of the proposed study. Finally, procedures for conducting the data gathering and data analysis will be discussed as well.
RESEARCH DESIGN
The researches have used a quantitative research design in this study. Quantitative research is a type of research method used for testing objective theories by examining the relationship among variables. These variables, in turn, can be measured, typically on instruments, so that numbered data can be analyzed using statistical procedures. The final written report has a set structure consisting of introduction, literature and theory, methods, results, and discussion (Creswell, 2008). Like qualitative researchers, those who engage in this form of inquiry have assumptions about testing theories deductively, building in protections against bias, controlling for alternative explanations, and being able to generalize and replicate the findings.
SAMPLING & SAMPLING DESIGN
The researchers had 50 participants for this study wherein 24 of the participants were males while 26 were females. The target participants were undergraduate students who live away from their family, e.g. living in dormitories or condominiums, for their stay in their respective universities. The participants were from different universities in Metro Manila. Moreover, participants were encouraged to participate in the study as the researchers gave tokens of appreciation such as chocolates and candies at the end of the study. The said participants have been selected through purposive sampling technique. This is due to the requirements of the researchers that the sample must be undergraduate students who live away from their family. As such, all the participants lived either in dormitories or condominiums near their respective universities. Purposive sampling is usually used in quantitative studies wherein researchers strategically choose with who, where and how they would conduct their study (Given, 2008).
INSTRUMENTS
The instrument that was used in this study is a 25-item survey questionnaire, which aims to measure the effects of living arrangements of undergraduate students to their academic performance and behaviors. The questionnaire is in the form of a 4-point Likert scale wherein 1 is labeled as Strongly Disagree, 2 as Disagree, 3 as Agree, and 4 as Strongly Agree. The survey consists of 20 items. The questions were made according to how the participants view on different situations pertaining to living alone. A sample item is “I am able to focus more on my studies when I am alone.” The entire list of items can be found in Appendix B.
PROCEDURE
The researchers used purposive sampling in looking for the possible participants of this study. The questionnaires were first pilot tested to 20 respondents to check the flow and see how people will respond or react while answering the questionnaire. Upon getting the data from the pilot test, the questionnaires (see Appendix B) were then revised and finalized. The survey questionnaires were distributed to the target participants, which are 50 undergraduate students from Manila who lives away from their family. The researchers used T-test in analyzing the gathered data.
Survey Questions:
1. Living away from my parents makes me independent.
2. Living away from my parents affects my studies.
3. Living away from my parents makes me homesick.
4. I like living alone.
5. I study without being told by my parents.
6. I get high grades.
7. Being alone improves my academic performance.
8. Being alone makes me focus more on my studies.
9. Living alone makes me lazy.
10. I like living alone more than living at home.
11. I find it difficult to do household chores.
12. I am having troubles with time management.
13. I always seek help from my parents.
14. I have good study habits
15. I have a close and open relationship with my family.
16. Living alone stresses me out.
17. I often procrastinate.
18. I am used to living alone.
19. I am able to focus more on my studies when I am alone.
20. I am inspired to study harder when I see my family everyday.
21. Living alone makes me unable to focus with my studies.
22. Living alone is a great opportunity for me to improve my studies.
23. Living alone makes me manage my time more effectively.
24. Living alone makes me unproductive.
25. I prefer living at home more than living alone.
DATA ANALYSIS
The data was analyzed using t-test in that the compared variables are their own perceptions of living alone.
Confidence level is set at 95%, as such the margin for error is 5%. Therefore, when the p-value that comes out from the statistical analysis is less than 0.05, the difference of the answers is statistically significant.
The results show that most participants disagree that living alone can improve their academic performance or that living alone is a chance for them to improve on their academic standing. Although, from their answers as well, the mean for the item “I get high grades” is 3 so even though they don’t feel as though living alone may play a part in their academic performance, they still see themselves as getting high grades.
Results
DISCUSSION
The pairing of items in the analysis was done one items which focused on the views of participants regarding living away from their parents and items which focused on their view on how it affects their academic performance. There was a significant difference between the answers to the items “Living away from my parents makes me independent.” and “Living away from my parents affects my studies.” The mean for the first item is above 3, as such it can be interpreted that many agree to this statement. On the latter item however, the mean is around 2, which can be interpreted as many disagree with the statement. As such, participants view that though living away from ones parents makes a person independent, it does not follow that it will affect ones studies. Their feeling of independence is in line with what literature states though participants don’t view their independence to have an effect on their academic performance. Also with items “I always seek help from my parents.” and “I study without being told by my parents.” These items also depict dependency in which in the first item, the mean is 2 as such participants disagree that they always seek help from their parents and with the latter item they do study without being told. “I like living alone.” and “Being alone improves my academic performance.“ though the means for each item have only a 0.5 difference, it was still enough to place a significance. For the first item, the mean is 2.1 so it falls under disagree. However, the latter has 2.6 as such it may go toward agree, as the questionnaire was a 4-point Lickert Scale. “Living alone makes me lazy. “, “Being alone makes me focus more on my studies.”, “Living alone makes me unable to focus with my studies.” and “Living alone is a great opportunity for me to improve my studies.” are items that focus on the effects of living alone and how the participant perceives it. The results show that most participants disagree that living alone can improve their academic performance or that living alone is a chance for them to improve on their academic standing. Although, from their answers as well, the mean for the item “I get high grades” is 3 so even though they don’t feel as though living alone may play a part in their academic performance, they still see themselves as getting high grades.
Significance:
The researchers created this study to accommodate the differences of Asian students, particularly undergraduate students in the Philippines, from Western students.
Filipino youths’ independence cannot be predicted by their age rather, on the level of their maturity. So as most college students in the Philippines are still dependent on their parents, it is interesting to know the effect of their families on their academic performance especially when students have to study away from their family.
CONCLUSION
Although living away from ones family is difficult, especially in a time of crucial transition such as college life, it may also bring positive effects. Though participants are aware that living away from the family makes them more independent, they are not aware that this may also affect their academic performance in a positive light.
METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
As this study focused on a very small population of undergraduate students who live away from their family particularly in Manila, the sample size of this study became very limited. Likewise, the items on the survey questionnaires were also very few which made the result less accurate. Furthermore, due to the limited number of participants in this study, the transferability of results could not also be ensured and generalized to all undergraduates who live away from their families.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Since the researchers had concentrated only on the effects to the academic performance of students who live away from home, future researchers may explore more on the different aspects such as the social exposure, emotional aspect, depression, sibling relationships, problem solving, etc. In this way, studies about students who live away from home can be thoroughly investigated thus it will broaden knowledge about this topic. In addition, the researchers suggest that data should be gathered from a larger sample in order to attain more accurate findings. The researchers also suggest that participants should also be gathered from participants from other parts of the country who reside in Manila while they are studying, as opposed to only gathering participants who live in Manila and whose family is also in Manila. This is to have a more balanced data analysis. Another suggestion for future research is to incorporate other factors into the study, such as how often the students get to see their families. Factors such as this should be taken into account to see whether it imposes effects on the academic performance of the students, aside from the fact that they live away from their families. Another recommendation the researchers have is to allot more time in data gathering to avoid biased and affected results.

Pros and Cons of Attending College Out-of-State
This post is from a student, parent, or professional contributor. The opinions expressed by the author are their own and do not necessarily reflect the positions, viewpoints, or policies of Niche.
Deciding to attend an out-of-state state college or university is a big commitment for anyone, especially high school seniors who have practically spent their entire lives in the same town. Leaving the people you’ve known and the places you’ve loved can be scary and nerve-wracking.
It might be harder to gain acceptance to certain universities and qualify for important scholarship opportunities, not to mention the homesickness you might feel from being away from your family.
However, some people see college as one of the only times in their life where they have a blank slate. Maybe they want to live somewhere where the sun shines all year, leave their small town for a big city, or to simply have more options when it comes down to applying to schools.
If you find yourself struggling to decide what exactly you want out of your college experience, we’re here to break down the pros and cons of attending an out-of-state school into simple terms. Read on to find out!
Pro #1: Gaining Independence
College involves a major adjustment period for everyone. You’ll be expected to take care of yourself, wake up on time, attend all your classes, do your homework, and participate in part-time work or extracurricular activities without anyone holding you accountable.
While learning how to do these things by yourself is hard, it’s when you’ll learn the most lessons. Overslept and missed class? You need to make sure you’re going to bed on time. Did poorly on an exam? You need to reach out to the professor on your own.
For some students who attend school near where they grew up, they might be tempted to come home frequently or have their parents do their laundry and grocery shop for them. While it’s obviously easier to rely on your parents for day-to-day help while you’re in school, those who attend college or university far away will end up maturing faster.
By booking all your appointments, budgeting, keeping your space clean, and eating healthily on your own, you’ll be in charge of your own life and future. If nothing else, it’ll be a great crash course for becoming a confident adult.
Pro #2: More Choices
This one is more obvious, but by looking at schools outside of your home state, you’ll have so many more options for colleges to apply to. If you live in a more rural area without many colleges nearby, you have 49 other states to explore!
Check out college- and university-dense areas like the east and west coast if you don’t already live there. While these areas offer widely different college experiences when compared to one another, you’ll still have many more options to choose from than if you only looked locally.
Private, public, small, large, religious, non-sectarian, research, liberal arts, and HBCUs: the world of colleges is unlimited.

Pro #3: Different Weather
The weather can have a big impact on your mood and overall attitude. When it’s gloomy outside, you’re probably going to be tired no matter how much sleep you got last night. If it’s sunny and warm, you may be more excited to start your day and enjoy walking to class in the sunshine.
As previously mentioned, attending school out-of-state gives you more options so you’re free to get out of your rainy and cold town and into a place where the sun shines all year if you so choose.
Or, if you’re a native of a place where outdoor pools in the winter are common, maybe you’re looking for a spot you can enjoy snowy activities during the holiday season.
No matter what you’re looking for or where you’re coming from, there’s a school for everyone in every kind of weather. Check out our articles on the top 100 sunniest schools here or the 6 best college campuses for snow lovers here.
Pro #4: Exploring a New Area
There’s a whole world out there, so now’s the time to explore it. With hundreds of cities in the U.S. offering different cultural experiences, anyone can find their home away from home.
Looking to go to a school that’s a world leader in higher education while enjoying fantastic sports and delicious Italian food? Check out Boston.
Interested in studying politics and U.S. history while having access to incredible internships that set you up for success after graduation? Look into the Washington, D.C. area.
Want to attend a ‘Public Ivy’ while enjoying year-round sunshine and hipster cafes? Research schools in the California area.
Whichever city you feel drawn to, make sure to do thorough research into not only the schools in the area but also things like internship and job opportunities, cost of living, transportation options, crime rates, and the local scene and culture.
Con #1: Price
Now, we’ll be getting into some of the cons of attending an out-of-state school, with the first being potentially higher tuition rates for some state colleges and universities.
State schools are funded by resident’s tax dollars and also receive money from the local government, which is often why public institutions are cheaper than private colleges. If you don’t live in the state that the public school is located in, you won’t be eligible for that sweet in-state tuition.
Instead, you’ll have to pay out-of-state tuition, which is often thousands of dollars more, especially at top public research universities that receive many non-local applicants like the University of California (UC) System or the University of North Carolina (UNC) System.
If you’re applying out-of-state for private schools, don’t worry: private schools are mainly made up of out-of-state students so there’s generally one flat tuition rate no matter where you’re coming from.
Con #2: Acceptance Rate
In addition to state schools being more expensive for out-of-state students, it’s also harder to get in if you’re not local.
It’s also better for schools to have highly successful graduates who live in the same state it’s located in (hint: donor dollars), so that’s part of the reason why in-state acceptance rates are higher than out-of-state.
For example, the University of North Carolina — Chapel Hill is notoriously difficult to get into if you aren’t a permanent North Carolina resident. For the Fall 2020 admissions cycle, the admissions rate for in-state students was 24% – 48% while out-of-state was just 14%.
However, this doesn’t mean every out-of-state public school is going to be much harder to get into. Do your research and assess all your options. In the end, it might mean applying to more schools than you originally intended.
Con #3: Homesickness
Feeling homesick is a common struggle for almost all college freshmen. It’s probably the longest time you’ve ever been away from your family and friends, not to mention your childhood home and favorite places around town.
While you’ll likely go back home for holidays and breaks, for some people, that time can’t come soon enough. If you find yourself to be a major homebody, going to school out-of-state may only make these feelings worse and could cause you to become distracted from school work and socialization.
If this sounds like you, try to plan the distance from your school to your home accordingly. Maybe you want to go to a school 45 minutes to an hour away so you aren’t always tempted to go home but it’s not too far if you really need help.
Don’t forget that home is just a quick phone call or FaceTime away. Choose a time every week (or every day if you need it) to call the people you love to check-in and get a breath of fresh air. There’s absolutely no shame in missing home, and 9 out of 10 people in college do at some point —they just don’t always admit it.
No matter if you end up choosing an out-of-state school or not, in the long run, it doesn’t really matter what school you go to or where it is. What’s important is that you make the best out of the experience you’re given and have fun while you’re doing it.

Alright, so I've got these search results here. Let's see what they're saying about going to college far away from home. The first one is from The Odyssey Online, and it's titled "Pros and Cons of Going to School Far Away From Home." It seems like a student's personal reflection on the experience. They mention both positives, like experiencing new things and gaining independence, and negatives, such as homesickness and missing out on family events. It's pretty relatable.

The second article is from CollegeVine's blog, and it's called "The Pros and Cons of Attending College Close vs Far From Home." This seems more comprehensive, listing detailed benefits and drawbacks of both staying close to home and going far away. They talk about minimized homesickness and easy access to familiar resources for staying close, but also the opportunity for a fresh start and experiencing new cultures by going far away. They also mention that some students might feel suffocated by staying too close to their high school lives.

The third source is from College Raptor, titled "Pros and Cons of Choosing a College Close to Home." This one focuses more on the advantages of staying close, like easy access to home-cooked meals and parental support, but also notes that it might hinder independence and expose students to less diversity.

The fourth document is a research study on "Effects of Living Away From Home to the Academic Performance of Undergraduate Students." This seems more academic and might provide some empirical evidence on how living arrangements affect students' academic performance. It mentions that living away can make students more independent and positively影响他们的学术表现。

最后一个是来自Niche博客的文章，题为“Attending College Out-of-State的利与弊”。它讨论了州外上学的好处，如获得独立、更多选择、不同气候和探索新地区，但也提到了价格更高、录取率较低和思乡等缺点。

总的来说，这些资源提供了关于在附近或远离家乡上大学的多方面观点。我需要从中提取关键点，以回答为什么有些人选择到远离家乡的地方上大学的问题。

首先，从个人成长的角度来看，远离家乡上大学可以提供一个全新的环境，促使学生更加独立和自立。他们必须自己处理日常生活中的各种问题，这有助于培养重要的生活技能和成熟度。此外，接触不同的文化和社会群体可以拓宽视野，促进个人发展。

其次，教育质量也是一个重要因素。一些顶尖的大学和特定的专业可能位于远离学生家乡的地方，为了追求更好的教育机会，学生们愿意去更远的地方。此外，某些地区的大学可能与特定行业有更强的联系，为学生提供更多的实习和就业机会。

再者，经济因素也可能起作用。尽管州外学费可能更高，但有些学生通过奖学金、助学金或其他财务援助来抵消额外的成本。有时候，长期的投资回报率可能使这一选择值得。

最后，对于一些学生来说，改变生活方式和探索新地方是一种吸引力。他们可能厌倦了熟悉的生活环境，渴望新的冒险和体验。

综合以上几点，人们选择到远离家乡的地方上大学主要是出于对个人成长、教育质量、职业前景和新体验的追求。
