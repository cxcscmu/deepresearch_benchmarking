So I have this question about how minimum wage affects the economy. I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I know that minimum wage is the lowest amount an employer is allowed to pay their workers per hour. Different countries and even different states have different minimum wages. I think in the US, there's a federal minimum wage, but some states have their own higher minimum wages.

I guess the first thing I should do is understand what the purpose of having a minimum wage is. From what I know, it's meant to ensure that workers earn enough to have a basic standard of living. It's a way to reduce poverty and ensure fairness in the labor market. But I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Maybe I should look that up.

Purpose of Minimum Wage
Posted on May 16, 2016 by
Nicole
The purpose of the minimum wage is to provide a base pay rate for employees. That base pay rate is considered to be a fair pay for the work that the employee agrees to. While many employees choose to pay their employees more than the minimum wage, the purpose of the minimum wage is to protect all employees from any alterations in the economy.
The minimum wage was first developed in the U.S. in 1933. While minimum wages had been established in other countries, the U.S. found itself in dire straights in terms of economic vitality in 1933. The country needed to find a way to help employees afford food and housing, even when their work was hard to find. The purpose of the minimum wage was to ensure that all employees were able to afford the basic necessities in the bad Great Depression economy.
Over the years, the base rate for the minimum wage has varied. In 1968, the minimum wage was higher than it has even been. Since 1979, however, the minimum wage has been slowly decreasing. While people generally view the minimum wage as helpful to employees, some economists believe that, despite the purpose of the minimum wage, the minimum wage is ultimately hard on the economy.
In the Clinton administration, it was decided that in addition to a national minimum wage rate, each state could adopt its own minimum wage rate. Some states also gave localities within eh states that right to decide their own minimum wages. When a locality decides its own wage, the purpose of the wage may change. For example, the purpose of the minimum wage in Santa Fe is to provide a living wage for all employees, while the purpose of the minimum wage in other localities and states is simply to ensure that all employees receive fair pay for their work.

Chapter 1: What is a minimum wage
1.1 Definition and purpose
Minimum wages have been defined as “ the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract ”. 1
This definition refers to the binding nature of minimum wages, regardless of the method of fixing them. Minimum wages can be set by statute, decision of a competent authority, a wage board, a wage council, or by industrial or labour courts or tribunals. Minimum wages can also be set by giving the force of law to provisions of collective agreements.
The purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers against unduly low pay. They help ensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection. Minimum wages can also be one element of a policy to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including those between men and women, by promoting the right to equal remuneration for work of equal value.
Minimum wage systems should not be seen or used in isolation, but should be designed in a way to supplement and reinforce other social and employment policies. Several types of measures can be used to tackle income and labour market inequality, including pro-employment policies, social transfers, and creating an enabling environment for sustainable enterprises.
The purpose of a minimum wage, which sets a floor, should also be distinguished from collective bargaining, which can be used to set wages above an existing floor. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical wage distribution with a "minimum wage zone" and a "collective bargaining zone" which can be used to establish minimum standards and to set wages above an existing floor.
Figure 2 illustrates that the effectiveness of minimum wages depends on many factors, including the extent to which they afford protection to all workers in an employment relationship, including women, and youth and migrant workers, regardless of their contractual arrangements, as well as all industries and occupations in the economy (coverage); whether they are set and adjusted at an adequate level that covers the needs of workers and their families, while taking into account economic factors (level); and whether employers comply with minimum wage regulations (compliance).
Figure 1. The distribution of wages (hypothetical wage distribution of a population of 56 wage-earners)
How to read this figure : Figure 1 shows a hypothetical wage distribution of a population of 56 wage-earners before the introduction of a minimum wage. The level of wages is on the horizontal axis, and the number of wage earners is on the vertical axis.
We see the full range of market wages, including a relatively small proportion of workers with extremely low pay on the left end of the wage distribution. For example, 1 employee has a wage of 1$, 2 employees are paid 3$, while 5 employees receive wages of 8$.
The yellow circle called the “minimum wage zone” shows that a minimum wage should in principle remain targeted at the lowest-paid employees, to eliminate “unduly low pay”; the blue circle is the “collective bargaining zone” and illustrates the principle that collective bargaining can be used to set wages above an existing floor.

The U.S. Minimum Wage Is $7.25/Hour: How Do You Compare?

The minimum wage is the lowest legal wage that companies can pay their workers. The purpose of minimum-wage laws is to prevent employers from exploiting workers. The minimum wage should provide enough income to afford a living wage, the amount needed to provide enough food, clothing, and shelter. The U.S. national minimum wage is $7.25 per hour as of January 2022.
Many states and cities have their own minimum wage. Employees receive whichever is higher, the federal or local minimum wage. 1 California has the highest state rate at $15 ($14 for employers with under 26 employees) as of January 1, 2022. 2
Purpose of the Minimum Wage
Although the minimum wage is intended to protect workers from exploitation, it hasn't kept pace with inflation. Workers who earned a minimum wage in 2017 were paid around 27% less than their counterparts were paid almost 50 years before, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The minimum wage would have been $11.62 in 2017 if it had been raised since 1968 at the same growth rate as average wages of typical U.S. workers. 3
Instead, the minimum wage translates to $15,080 a year at 40 hours per week for 52 weeks. That's more than the federal poverty level for a single person. but not for a family of two. 4 A worker would qualify for federal poverty assistance if they were trying to support a family by earning minimum wage.
How much rent can Americans afford on the minimum wage? It could be enough to rent a studio apartment in a rural area or college town in most states, but minimum wage workers may often live with roommates in some states and in many large cities.
History of the Minimum Wage
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) set the first U.S. minimum wage in 1938. President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed it as part of the New Deal to protect workers during the Great Depression. The Depression had caused wages to drop to pennies a day for many. Roosevelt set the minimum wage at $0.25/hour. Fierce competition during the Depression forced companies to slash pay and extend hours just to stay in business.
Another major issue was child labor. According to a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Children's Bureau survey from that time, 25% of 449 American children who were surveyed were working 60 hours a week or more. Public interest grew around the issue, and President Roosevelt called a special session of Congress in 1937 to address matters in a lead-up to establishing the minimum wage.
“The exploitation of child labor and the undercutting of wages and the stretching of the hours of the poorest paid workers in periods of business recession has a serious effect on buying power," Roosevelt said. The FLSA not only established the minimum wage, but it banned oppressive child labor and limited the workweek to 44 hours as a result. 5
The minimum wage was raised by the U.S. Congress several more times. It reached $1/hour by 1956. But the FLSA applied primarily to workers in interstate commerce. Congress amended the Act to include workers in retail and service companies, as well as employees in local transportation, construction, and gas stations, in 1961. The FLSA included state and local government employees, along with workers in service industries such as laundries, hotels, and farms five years later. 6
Racial Discrimination Issues
Critics and scholars have argued that minimum-wage laws created issues of racial discrimination and inequality long before the first federal minimum wage was passed. Congress passed the Davis-Bacon Act in 1931, which required contractors and subcontractors performing on federally funded or assisted contracts to pay their laborers and mechanics “prevailing wages.” 7
But those who are critical of the Act say it was passed with the specific intent to ​​favor white workers in white-only unions over non-unionized black workers for scarce jobs during the Depression. 8
The AFL-CIO, the U.S.’s largest federation of unions, argues that the Davis-Bacon Act was anything but “racist” and that it was intended “to fight back against the worst practices of the construction industry and ensure fair wages for those who build our nation.” 9
Legislation and Action
The most recent amendment to the FLSA was the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. It set these scheduled increases:
Before July 24, 2007: $5.15 per hour
From July 24, 2007 to July 23, 2008: $5.85 per hour
From July 24, 2008 to July 23, 2009: $6.55 per hour
On or after July 24, 2009: $7.25 per hour 10
In 2014, President Obama signed an executive order that said all government contractors must comply with a $10.10 minimum. 11
Democrats have long supported raising the minimum to $15 an hour, but the effort has faced hurdles in Congress. Members are concerned that it would force many small businesses to lay off workers to keep their overall labor costs in line, a sentiment that reflects a 2019 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would take 1.3 million people out of poverty, according to the report, but it would also cost 1.3 million workers their jobs. 12
What Is the Current Minimum Wage?
While some states have implemented their own $15 minimum-wage legislation, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25. 13
President Joe Biden made the $15 minimum wage a priority during election season and continued to push for a federal mandate once he took office. Democratic lawmakers introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 just after Biden took office. 14
A similar bill passed in the House of Representatives in 2019, but it stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. 15
Inaction on the minimum wage issue continues in Congress, but President Biden issued an executive order to raise the minimum wage for contract workers to $15. 16
Arguments for the $15 Minimum Wage
The majority of U.S. adults (62%) favored raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to an April 2021 Pew Research Center study. In particular, 89% of black adults and approximately three-quarters of Latinx and Asian Americans are in favor of the hike. 17 There are five main advantages of the $15 minimum wage.
Boosts Productivity
Workers who can cover the cost of living have better morale. They're more productive if they have a decent standard of living.
Reduces Income Inequality
A higher minimum wage can provide more incentive to work while reducing income inequality, the large disparity in how income is distributed among individuals, groups, populations, social classes, or countries due in part to structural racism or sexism.
Testifying before the House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor when the Raise the Wage Act was first proposed in 2019, Ben Zipperer of the Economic Policy Institute argued that the national minimum wage of $7.25 “hurts women as well as black and Hispanic workers the most.”
Zipperer noted that 56% of those who would benefit from a $15 minimum wage in 2024 are women, despite women making up only 48% of the total U.S. workforce. He added that 40% of all black workers would receive a wage increase, along with 34% of Hispanic workers. 18
To show the potential value of even an incremental minimum-wage increase, a 2019 study from the National Women’s Law Center reported that “for women working full time in states with a minimum wage of $10 per hour or more, the wage gap is 34[%] smaller." 19
Spurs Economic Growth
A higher minimum wage better reflects the actual cost of living. Workers who are able to earn more than the cost of living contribute more to the economy, because they have more money to spend and are less likely to default on debts. That increases demand and business revenue and lowers things like consumer debt, healthcare debt, and evictions.
Promotes Education and Self-Improvement
Workers who have more time and money can then invest in their educations, which can further increase their productivity while improving the attractiveness of the country's labor pool. A more educated workforce can also increase innovation and the number of small businesses.
Improves Employee Retention
Finally, minimum-wage laws benefit individual businesses. Workers are less likely to leave to find a higher-paying job, thus reducing turnover and expensive retraining costs.
Arguments Against the $15 Minimum Wage
Small business organizations, like the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), are among the groups that oppose the minimum wage increase to $15. According to an NFIB ballot from early 2021, 92% of small businesses say that a $15-per-hour minimum wage “would be harmful to Main Street and its job opportunities.” 20
Here are some more specific arguments from the opposition.
Reduction of Private-Sector Employment
A $15 minimum wage proposed in the Raise the Wage Act would reduce private-sector employment by over 1.6 million jobs, according to the NFIB Research Center. It would produce a cumulative U.S. loss of more than $2 trillion in real economic output. 21
Increase in Labor Costs
Minimum-wage laws raise businesses' labor costs, which typically take up a large portion of their budgets. Businesses tend to hire fewer workers to keep their total labor costs the same when the government requires them to pay more per worker. That, in turn, increases the unemployment rate .
It hits workers with income at or below the federal poverty threshold the hardest, because they must compete for fewer jobs. Some smaller companies may not be able to operate with fewer workers, and they may be forced to declare bankruptcy instead.
Small Business and Industry Job Loss
Based on simulation results from the Business Size Insight Module (BSIM), a multi-region economic forecasting and policy analysis model, businesses with fewer than 100 employees are forecast to lose nearly 700,000 jobs, or about 43% of all private-sector jobs lost by 2029. Meanwhile, major industries, including retail, administrative, and support services, are forecast to experience large job losses. Job loss offsets increased wages for workers who are able to keep or find jobs in these industries. 21
Penalizes Labor-Intensive Industries
The minimum wage penalizes companies that are labor-intensive. It rewards those that are in capital-intensive industries by default. It can shift the very fabric of the country's economic base over time.
Increases Outsourcing
Minimum-wage laws may increase job outsourcing. Companies may decided to move their facilities to countries where labor costs are lower.
Increases Unemployment and Poverty
Higher minimum-wage laws may not reduce the country's poverty. They help the workers who have jobs, but they increase unemployment. Research shows that experienced workers receive higher pay and increased job opportunities, while less-experienced workers see a loss in job opportunities, according to a study of Seattle's minimum-wage increase by the National Bureau of Economic Research. 22
Increases the Cost of Living
Finally, minimum wages could raise the cost of living in some areas. A higher minimum wage allows workers to pay more for housing. Landlords could raise rents, creating inflation, as a result.
Who Makes Minimum Wage?
The percentage of hourly paid workers earning the federal minimum wage or less went down from 1.9% in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's well below the 13.4% in 1979, when this data was first collected. In total, 1.1 million workers earned wages at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 in 2020.
Those who earn minimum wage or less tend to be young. Workers under age 25 represented just under 20% of hourly paid workers, but they made up about 48% of those who were paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among workers who were paid hourly rates, 2% of women and 1% of men were paid at or below the federal minimum wage.
Service occupations had the highest percentage of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at about 5%. The industry with the highest percentage of hourly workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage was leisure and hospitality, at 8%. 23
Does Anyone Make Less Than Minimum Wage?
Approximately 1.1 million workers earn less than the minimum wage, because they fall under one of several exemptions. Here are some examples:
Employers who hire full-time students in retail or service stores, agriculture, or colleges and universities can obtain a certificate from the DOL allowing the student to be paid 85% of the minimum wage.
High-school students who are age 16 or older and who are enrolled in vocational education classes may be paid 75% of the minimum wage if their employer obtains a certificate from the DOL. 24
According to 1996 FLSA amendments, those under age 20 may be paid no less than $4.25/hour by their employer in the first 90 calendar days after they are first employed. 25
Workers with disabilities can receive a special minimum wage if the disability lowers their productivity. 26
Tipped employees are paid $2.13/hour if that hourly pay and tips combined make up the equivalent of the federal minimum wage. If not, then the employer is supposed to make up the difference but in many cases may not.
A business that makes less than $500,000 a year can pay less than minimum wage unless it is involved in interstate commerce or is a hospital, school, or government agency. 27
Check the state minimum-wage laws for these worker categories. The state minimum wage will take precedence over the federal minimum-wage law if the amount is higher.
The Wage and Hour Division of the DOL enforces the U.S. minimum-wage law. The FLSA Handy Reference Guide provides information on the minimum wage, overtime pay, and other standards affecting all types of workers.
State Minimum Wages
A total of 26 states have indicated that they will raise their minimum wages effective 2022. 28
Five states—Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee—have not adopted a state minimum wage. Georgia and Wyoming have a minimum wage below $7.25. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 applies in those states. 13
California has the highest minimum-wage requirement at $15 for businesses with 26 or more employees, and at $14 for all others. It will increase to $15 in 2023 and then will mum wabe adjusted annually, based on a set formula and number of employees. 2
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, New Jersey, New York, and Washington are the only other states with a limit of $13 or more per hour in at least some areas effective 2022. 29 Some cities, like San Francisco, New York City, and the District of Columbia, also impose city-level regulations mandating a $15/hour minimum wage or higher. 30
Seven states—Alaska, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, and Vermont—automatically increase their wages based on the cost of living. 13 The U.S. Department of Labor lists the up-to-date minimum-wage laws for each state. It also provides a history of the minimum wage for each state since 1968.
Do Other Countries Have a Minimum Wage?
Many countries have a national minimum wage. Most of them review and adjust it annually, depending on the cost of living. The U.S. minimum wage is lower than those of most other countries around the world, even though its cost of living is higher.
United Kingdom: Varies by age. For example, 8.91 pounds per hour for workers ages 23 and over, or approximately U.S.$12 31
Ireland: 10.50 euros per hour, or approximately U.S.$12, for ages 20 and over; varies from 7.35 euros, depending on age, for younger workers 32
European Union countries: Twenty-one of the EU's 27 members had national minimum wages as of July 2021. The laws apply to all employees. The wages range from a low of 332 euros per month in Bulgaria to a high of 2,202 euros per month in Luxembourg. These are roughly equivalent to a range of U.S.$376 to U.S.$2,495 in January 2022. Several EU countries have a minimum wage higher than that of the U.S., including the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. 33
Thailand: Minimum wage ranges from 313 to 336 Baht/day, depending on the province. This was about U.S.$9.29/day to U.S.$9.97/day in January 2022. 34
Australia: AUS$20.33/hour equivalent to roughly U.S.$14.62/hour in January 2022, varying by age and job status 35
U.S. Trade Partners With No National Minimum Wage
Each Canadian province and territory sets its own level instead of a national minimum wage. They range from a low of C$11.75/hour or U.S.$9.29/hour in New Brunswick to C$16.00/hour or U.S.$12.66/hour in Nunavut, as of January 2022. 36
A Mexican commission sets the minimum wage for the highest-paid zone, Zona Libre de la Frontera Norte (ZLFN). That wage is 185.56 pesos, or $9.10, per day. The minimum wage is 123.22 pesos, or $6.04, per day for the rest of the country. 37
China has no national minimum wage, because the cost of living varies so much across the country. Each province sets its own level instead, with general guidance given by the national government. Shanghai's minimum monthly wage is the country's highest at 2,590 RMB/month or US$400/month, while Beijing has the highest hourly wage at 25.3 RMB/US$3.90. 38
The minimum wage for an unskilled worker with is 618 rupees/day or U.S.$8.33/day in cities in India, such as Delhi. There is no national minimum wage. 39
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How many people earn the minimum wage?
In 2020, 1.1 million workers earned the minimum wage or lower in the United States, or 1.5% of all hourly paid workers. 23
Can you support a family on minimum wage?
A person working 40 hours per week for minimum wage would earn $15,080 before taxes. That is below the federal poverty line for a family of two or more people. It is also lower than the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment in the United States in 2020, which was $1,621 per month, or $19,452 per year. 40
How long has the minimum wage stayed the same?
The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since July 2009. Due to inflation, workers would have needed to be paid $9.57 in December 2021 to have the same purchasing power as minimum-wage workers in 2009. 41

How to define a minimum wage?
If you have only 1 minute
Minimum wages have been defined as the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract.
Following this definition, minimum wages exist in more than 90 per cent of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) member States.
The purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers against unduly low pay. They help ensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection. Minimum wages can also be one element of a policy to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including those between men and women.
Minimum wage systems should be defined and designed in a way to supplement and reinforce other social and employment policies, including collective bargaining, which is used to set terms of employment and working conditions.
Historically, the purpose of minimum wages has evolved from a policy tool to be used selectively in a few low-wage sectors to an instrument of much broader coverage.
ILO Conventions reflect this evolution:
The Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928 (No. 26), encouraged countries to implement minimum wages where “no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low”.
Later, the Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 (No. 131) called for coverage of “all groups of wage earners whose terms of employment are such that coverage would be appropriate”. The principle of full consultation with social partners lies at the heart of this Convention.
In defining a minimum wage, it is important to be specific about which components of a wage can be counted in the minimum, the extent and conditions under which payment in-kind can be allowed, how the minimum is calculated for workers with piece rate pay, and if the minimum is an hourly and/or a monthly rate.

Alright, so I've got this question about how minimum wage affects the economy. First things first, I need to understand what minimum wage is and why it exists. From what I recall, minimum wage is the lowest amount that employers are legally allowed to pay their workers per hour. It's meant to ensure that workers earn enough to meet their basic needs and live a decent life. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, so I think I should look that up to get a clearer picture.

Purpose of Minimum Wage
Posted on May 16, 2016 by

The purpose of the minimum wage is to provide a base pay rate for employees. That base pay rate is considered to be a fair pay for the work that the employee agrees to. While many employees choose to pay their employees more than the minimum wage, the purpose of the minimum wage is to protect all employees from any alterations in the economy.
The minimum wage was first developed in the U.S. in 1933. While minimum wages had been established in other countries, the U.S. found itself in dire straights in terms of economic vitality in 1933. The country needed to find a way to help employees afford food and housing, even when their work was hard to find. The purpose of the minimum wage was to ensure that all employees were able to afford the basic necessities in the bad Great Depression economy.
Over the years, the base rate for the minimum wage has varied. In 1968, the minimum wage was higher than it has even been. Since 1979, however, the minimum wage has been slowly decreasing. While people generally view the minimum wage as helpful to employees, some economists believe that, despite the purpose of the minimum wage, the minimum wage is ultimately hard on the economy.
In the Clinton administration, it was decided that in addition to a national minimum wage rate, each state could adopt its own minimum wage rate. Some states also gave localities within eh states that right to decide their own minimum wages. When a locality decides its own wage, the purpose of the wage may change. For example, the purpose of the minimum wage in Santa Fe is to provide a living wage for all employees, while the purpose of the minimum wage in other localities and states is simply to ensure that all employees receive fair pay for their work.

1.1 Definition and purpose
Minimum wages have been defined as “ the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract ”. 1
This definition refers to the binding nature of minimum wages, regardless of the method of fixing them. Minimum wages can be set by statute, decision of a competent authority, a wage board, a wage council, or by industrial or labour courts or tribunals. Minimum wages can also be set by giving the force of law to provisions of collective agreements.
The purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers against unduly low pay. They help ensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection. Minimum wages can also be one element of a policy to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including those between men and women, by promoting the right to equal remuneration for work of equal value.
Minimum wage systems should not be seen or used in isolation, but should be designed in a way to supplement and reinforce other social and employment policies. Several types of measures can be used to tackle income and labour market inequality, including pro-employment policies, social transfers, and creating an enabling environment for sustainable enterprises.
The purpose of a minimum wage, which sets a floor, should also be distinguished from collective bargaining, which can be used to set wages above an existing floor. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical wage distribution with a "minimum wage zone" and a "collective bargaining zone" which can be used to establish minimum standards and to set wages above an existing floor.
Figure 2 illustrates that the effectiveness of minimum wages depends on many factors, including the extent to which they afford protection to all workers in an employment relationship, including women, and youth and migrant workers, regardless of their contractual arrangements, as well as all industries and occupations in the economy (coverage); whether they are set and adjusted at an adequate level that covers the needs of workers and their families, while taking into account economic factors (level); and whether employers comply with minimum wage regulations (compliance).
Figure 1. The distribution of wages (hypothetical wage distribution of a population of 56 wage-earners)
How to read this figure : Figure 1 shows a hypothetical wage distribution of a population of 56 wage-earners before the introduction of a minimum wage. The level of wages is on the horizontal axis, and the number of wage earners is on the vertical axis.
We see the full range of market wages, including a relatively small proportion of workers with extremely low pay on the left end of the wage distribution. For example, 1 employee has a wage of 1$, 2 employees are paid 3$, while 5 employees receive wages of 8$.
The yellow circle called the “minimum wage zone” shows that a minimum wage should in principle remain targeted at the lowest-paid employees, to eliminate “unduly low pay”; the blue circle is the “collective bargaining zone” and illustrates the principle that collective bargaining can be used to set wages above an existing floor.

How to define a minimum wage?
If you have only 1 minute
Minimum wages have been defined as the minimum amount of remuneration that an employer is required to pay wage earners for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract.
Following this definition, minimum wages exist in more than 90 per cent of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) member States.
The purpose of minimum wages is to protect workers against unduly low pay. They help ensure a just and equitable share of the fruits of progress to all, and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection. Minimum wages can also be one element of a policy to overcome poverty and reduce inequality, including those between men and women.
Minimum wage systems should be defined and designed in a way to supplement and reinforce other social and employment policies, including collective bargaining, which is used to set terms of employment and working conditions.
Historically, the purpose of minimum wages has evolved from a policy tool to be used selectively in a few low-wage sectors to an instrument of much broader coverage.
ILO Conventions reflect this evolution:
The Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery Convention, 1928 (No. 26), encouraged countries to implement minimum wages where “no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low”.
Later, the Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1970 (No. 131) called for coverage of “all groups of wage earners whose terms of employment are such that coverage would be appropriate”. The principle of full consultation with social partners lies at the heart of this Convention.
In defining a minimum wage, it is important to be specific about which components of a wage can be counted in the minimum, the extent and conditions under which payment in-kind can be allowed, how the minimum is calculated for workers with piece rate pay, and if the minimum is an hourly and/or a monthly rate.

The U.S. Minimum Wage Is $7.25/Hour: How Do You Compare?

The minimum wage is the lowest legal wage that companies can pay their workers. The purpose of minimum-wage laws is to prevent employers from exploiting workers. The minimum wage should provide enough income to afford a living wage, the amount needed to provide enough food, clothing, and shelter. The U.S. national minimum wage is $7.25 per hour as of January 2022.
Many states and cities have their own minimum wage. Employees receive whichever is higher, the federal or local minimum wage. 1 California has the highest state rate at $15 ($14 for employers with under 26 employees) as of January 1, 2022. 2
Purpose of the Minimum Wage
Although the minimum wage is intended to protect workers from exploitation, it hasn't kept pace with inflation. Workers who earned a minimum wage in 2017 were paid around 27% less than their counterparts were paid almost 50 years before, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The minimum wage would have been $11.62 in 2017 if it had been raised since 1968 at the same growth rate as average wages of typical U.S. workers. 3
Instead, the minimum wage translates to $15,080 a year at 40 hours per week for 52 weeks. That's more than the federal poverty level for a single person. but not for a family of two. 4 A worker would qualify for federal poverty assistance if they were trying to support a family by earning minimum wage.
How much rent can Americans afford on the minimum wage? It could be enough to rent a studio apartment in a rural area or college town in most states, but minimum wage workers may often live with roommates in some states and in many large cities.
History of the Minimum Wage
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) set the first U.S. minimum wage in 1938. President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed it as part of the New Deal to protect workers during the Great Depression. The Depression had caused wages to drop to pennies a day for many. Roosevelt set the minimum wage at $0.25/hour. Fierce competition during the Depression forced companies to slash pay and extend hours just to stay in business.
Another major issue was child labor. According to a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Children's Bureau survey from that time, 25% of 449 American children who were surveyed were working 60 hours a week or more. Public interest grew around the issue, and President Roosevelt called a special session of Congress in 1937 to address matters in a lead-up to establishing the minimum wage.
“The exploitation of child labor and the undercutting of wages and the stretching of the hours of the poorest paid workers in periods of business recession has a serious effect on buying power," Roosevelt said. The FLSA not only established the minimum wage, but it banned oppressive child labor and limited the workweek to 44 hours as a result. 5
The minimum wage was raised by the U.S. Congress several more times. It reached $1/hour by 1956. But the FLSA applied primarily to workers in interstate commerce. Congress amended the Act to include workers in retail and service companies, as well as employees in local transportation, construction, and gas stations, in 1961. The FLSA included state and local government employees, along with workers in service industries such as laundries, hotels, and farms five years later. 6
Racial Discrimination Issues
Critics and scholars have argued that minimum-wage laws created issues of racial discrimination and inequality long before the first federal minimum wage was passed. Congress passed the Davis-Bacon Act in 1931, which required contractors and subcontractors performing on federally funded or assisted contracts to pay their laborers and mechanics “prevailing wages.” 7
But those who are critical of the Act say it was passed with the specific intent to ​​favor white workers in white-only unions over non-unionized black workers for scarce jobs during the Depression. 8
The AFL-CIO, the U.S.’s largest federation of unions, argues that the Davis-Bacon Act was anything but “racist” and that it was intended “to fight back against the worst practices of the construction industry and ensure fair wages for those who build our nation.” 9
Legislation and Action
The most recent amendment to the FLSA was the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. It set these scheduled increases:
Before July 24, 2007: $5.15 per hour
From July 24, 2007 to July 23, 2008: $5.85 per hour
From July 24, 2008 to July 23, 2009: $6.55 per hour
On or after July 24, 2009: $7.25 per hour 10
In 2014, President Obama signed an executive order that said all government contractors must comply with a $10.10 minimum. 11
Democrats have long supported raising the minimum to $15 an hour, but the effort has faced hurdles in Congress. Members are concerned that it would force many small businesses to lay off workers to keep their overall labor costs in line, a sentiment that reflects a 2019 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would take 1.3 million people out of poverty, according to the report, but it would also cost 1.3 million workers their jobs. 12
What Is the Current Minimum Wage?
While some states have implemented their own $15 minimum-wage legislation, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25. 13
President Joe Biden made the $15 minimum wage a priority during election season and continued to push for a federal mandate once he took office. Democratic lawmakers introduced the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025 just after Biden took office. 14
A similar bill passed in the House of Representatives in 2019, but it stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. 15
Inaction on the minimum wage issue continues in Congress, but President Biden issued an executive order to raise the minimum wage for contract workers to $15. 16
Arguments for the $15 Minimum Wage
The majority of U.S. adults (62%) favored raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to an April 2021 Pew Research Center study. In particular, 89% of black adults and approximately three-quarters of Latinx and Asian Americans are in favor of the hike. 17 There are five main advantages of the $15 minimum wage.
Boosts Productivity
Workers who can cover the cost of living have better morale. They're more productive if they have a decent standard of living.
Reduces Income Inequality
A higher minimum wage can provide more incentive to work while reducing income inequality, the large disparity in how income is distributed among individuals, groups, populations, social classes, or countries due in part to structural racism or sexism.
Testifying before the House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor when the Raise the Wage Act was first proposed in 2019, Ben Zipperer of the Economic Policy Institute argued that the national minimum wage of $7.25 “hurts women as well as black and Hispanic workers the most.”
Zipperer noted that 56% of those who would benefit from a $15 minimum wage in 2024 are women, despite women making up only 48% of the total U.S. workforce. He added that 40% of all black workers would receive a wage increase, along with 34% of Hispanic workers. 18
To show the potential value of even an incremental minimum-wage increase, a 2019 study from the National Women’s Law Center reported that “for women working full time in states with a minimum wage of $10 per hour or more, the wage gap is 34[%] smaller." 19
Spurs Economic Growth
A higher minimum wage better reflects the actual cost of living. Workers who are able to earn more than the cost of living contribute more to the economy, because they have more money to spend and are less likely to default on debts. That increases demand and business revenue and lowers things like consumer debt, healthcare debt, and evictions.
Promotes Education and Self-Improvement
Workers who have more time and money can then invest in their educations, which can further increase their productivity while improving the attractiveness of the country's labor pool. A more educated workforce can also increase innovation and the number of small businesses.
Improves Employee Retention
Finally, minimum-wage laws benefit individual businesses. Workers are less likely to leave to find a higher-paying job, thus reducing turnover and expensive retraining costs.
Arguments Against the $15 Minimum Wage
Small business organizations, like the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), are among the groups that oppose the minimum wage increase to $15. According to an NFIB ballot from early 2021, 92% of small businesses say that a $15-per-hour minimum wage “would be harmful to Main Street and its job opportunities.” 20
Here are some more specific arguments from the opposition.
Reduction of Private-Sector Employment
A $15 minimum wage proposed in the Raise the Wage Act would reduce private-sector employment by over 1.6 million jobs, according to the NFIB Research Center. It would produce a cumulative U.S. loss of more than $2 trillion in real economic output. 21
Increase in Labor Costs
Minimum-wage laws raise businesses' labor costs, which typically take up a large portion of their budgets. Businesses tend to hire fewer workers to keep their total labor costs the same when the government requires them to pay more per worker. That, in turn, increases the unemployment rate .
It hits workers with income at or below the federal poverty threshold the hardest, because they must compete for fewer jobs. Some smaller companies may not be able to operate with fewer workers, and they may be forced to declare bankruptcy instead.
Small Business and Industry Job Loss
Based on simulation results from the Business Size Insight Module (BSIM), a multi-region economic forecasting and policy analysis model, businesses with fewer than 100 employees are forecast to lose nearly 700,000 jobs, or about 43% of all private-sector jobs lost by 2029. Meanwhile, major industries, including retail, administrative, and support services, are forecast to experience large job losses. Job loss offsets increased wages for workers who are able to keep or find jobs in these industries. 21
Penalizes Labor-Intensive Industries
The minimum wage penalizes companies that are labor-intensive. It rewards those that are in capital-intensive industries by default. It can shift the very fabric of the country's economic base over time.
Increases Outsourcing
Minimum-wage laws may increase job outsourcing. Companies may decided to move their facilities to countries where labor costs are lower.
Increases Unemployment and Poverty
Higher minimum-wage laws may not reduce the country's poverty. They help the workers who have jobs, but they increase unemployment. Research shows that experienced workers receive higher pay and increased job opportunities, while less-experienced workers see a loss in job opportunities, according to a study of Seattle's minimum-wage increase by the National Bureau of Economic Research. 22
Increases the Cost of Living
Finally, minimum wages could raise the cost of living in some areas. A higher minimum wage allows workers to pay more for housing. Landlords could raise rents, creating inflation, as a result.
Who Makes Minimum Wage?
The percentage of hourly paid workers earning the federal minimum wage or less went down from 1.9% in 2019 to 1.5% in 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's well below the 13.4% in 1979, when this data was first collected. In total, 1.1 million workers earned wages at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 in 2020.
Those who earn minimum wage or less tend to be young. Workers under age 25 represented just under 20% of hourly paid workers, but they made up about 48% of those who were paid the federal minimum wage or less. Among workers who were paid hourly rates, 2% of women and 1% of men were paid at or below the federal minimum wage.
Service occupations had the highest percentage of hourly paid workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage, at about 5%. The industry with the highest percentage of hourly workers earning at or below the federal minimum wage was leisure and hospitality, at 8%. 23
Does Anyone Make Less Than Minimum Wage?
Approximately 1.1 million workers earn less than the minimum wage, because they fall under one of several exemptions. Here are some examples:
Employers who hire full-time students in retail or service stores, agriculture, or colleges and universities can obtain a certificate from the DOL allowing the student to be paid 85% of the minimum wage.
High-school students who are age 16 or older and who are enrolled in vocational education classes may be paid 75% of the minimum wage if their employer obtains a certificate from the DOL. 24
According to 1996 FLSA amendments, those under age 20 may be paid no less than $4.25/hour by their employer in the first 90 calendar days after they are first employed. 25
Workers with disabilities can receive a special minimum wage if the disability lowers their productivity. 26
Tipped employees are paid $2.13/hour if that hourly pay and tips combined make up the equivalent of the federal minimum wage. If not, then the employer is supposed to make up the difference but in many cases may not.
A business that makes less than $500,000 a year can pay less than minimum wage unless it is involved in interstate commerce or is a hospital, school, or government agency. 27
Check the state minimum-wage laws for these worker categories. The state minimum wage will take precedence over the federal minimum-wage law if the amount is higher.
The Wage and Hour Division of the DOL enforces the U.S. minimum-wage law. The FLSA Handy Reference Guide provides information on the minimum wage, overtime pay, and other standards affecting all types of workers.
State Minimum Wages
A total of 26 states have indicated that they will raise their minimum wages effective 2022. 28
Five states—Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee—have not adopted a state minimum wage. Georgia and Wyoming have a minimum wage below $7.25. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 applies in those states. 13
California has the highest minimum-wage requirement at $15 for businesses with 26 or more employees, and at $14 for all others. It will increase to $15 in 2023 and then will mum wabe adjusted annually, based on a set formula and number of employees. 2
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, New Jersey, New York, and Washington are the only other states with a limit of $13 or more per hour in at least some areas effective 2022. 29 Some cities, like San Francisco, New York City, and the District of Columbia, also impose city-level regulations mandating a $15/hour minimum wage or higher. 30
Seven states—Alaska, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, South Dakota, and Vermont—automatically increase their wages based on the cost of living. 13 The U.S. Department of Labor lists the up-to-date minimum-wage laws for each state. It also provides a history of the minimum wage for each state since 1968.
Do Other Countries Have a Minimum Wage?
Many countries have a national minimum wage. Most of them review and adjust it annually, depending on the cost of living. The U.S. minimum wage is lower than those of most other countries around the world, even though its cost of living is higher.
United Kingdom: Varies by age. For example, 8.91 pounds per hour for workers ages 23 and over, or approximately U.S.$12 31
Ireland: 10.50 euros per hour, or approximately U.S.$12, for ages 20 and over; varies from 7.35 euros, depending on age, for younger workers 32
European Union countries: Twenty-one of the EU's 27 members had national minimum wages as of July 2021. The laws apply to all employees. The wages range from a low of 332 euros per month in Bulgaria to a high of 2,202 euros per month in Luxembourg. These are roughly equivalent to a range of U.S.$376 to U.S.$2,495 in January 2022. Several EU countries have a minimum wage higher than that of the U.S., including the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg. 33
Thailand: Minimum wage ranges from 313 to 336 Baht/day, depending on the province. This was about U.S.$9.29/day to U.S.$9.97/day in January 2022. 34
Australia: AUS$20.33/hour equivalent to roughly U.S.$14.62/hour in January 2022, varying by age and job status 35
U.S. Trade Partners With No National Minimum Wage
Each Canadian province and territory sets its own level instead of a national minimum wage. They range from a low of C$11.75/hour or U.S.$9.29/hour in New Brunswick to C$16.00/hour or U.S.$12.66/hour in Nunavut, as of January 2022. 36
A Mexican commission sets the minimum wage for the highest-paid zone, Zona Libre de la Frontera Norte (ZLFN). That wage is 185.56 pesos, or $9.10, per day. The minimum wage is 123.22 pesos, or $6.04, per day for the rest of the country. 37
China has no national minimum wage, because the cost of living varies so much across the country. Each province sets its own level instead, with general guidance given by the national government. Shanghai's minimum monthly wage is the country's highest at 2,590 RMB/month or US$400/month, while Beijing has the highest hourly wage at 25.3 RMB/US$3.90. 38
The minimum wage for an unskilled worker with is 618 rupees/day or U.S.$8.33/day in cities in India, such as Delhi. There is no national minimum wage. 39
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Okay, so from these sources, it seems that the minimum wage is set to protect workers from being paid too little for their work. It's meant to ensure that they can afford basic necessities like food and shelter. The idea is to prevent exploitation by employers and to promote fairness in the labor market.

Looking back at the history, it was first introduced in the U.S. in 1938 during the Great Depression when wages were very low, and many workers were struggling to make ends meet. Over time, it has been adjusted, but not always in line with inflation or the cost of living, which means that its real value has fluctuated.

Now, the question is about how minimum wage affects the economy. I think there are a few key areas to consider here: employment levels, business costs, consumer spending, income inequality, and poverty rates.

First, let's think about employment levels. One common argument against raising the minimum wage is that it could lead to job losses because businesses might not be able to afford to pay higher wages and therefore might hire fewer workers or even lay off some employees. This is based on the idea that if the cost of labor increases, businesses might look for ways to cut costs, such as automating processes or reducing their workforce.

On the other hand, some studies suggest that moderate increases in minimum wage don't necessarily lead to significant job losses, and might even stimulate the economy by putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers who are likely to spend that extra income immediately, thereby boosting demand and potentially creating more jobs.

Second, business costs are obviously affected by wage levels. Higher minimum wages mean higher labor costs for businesses, which they might pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices, or they might absorb the costs themselves, potentially reducing their profits.

However, some argue that higher wages can lead to increased productivity and lower turnover rates, which can offset the increased costs. For example, if employees are paid more, they might be more motivated and efficient, and the company might save on training costs because employees are less likely to leave for better-paying jobs.

Third, consumer spending is an important aspect of the economy, and low-wage workers who see an increase in their wages might spend more, which could stimulate the economy. Conversely, if the minimum wage is too low, workers might not have enough disposable income to drive demand for goods and services.

Fourth, income inequality is a broad issue, but minimum wage policies can play a role in addressing it. By setting a floor on wages, minimum wage laws can help reduce the gap between low-income and high-income earners. However, some critics argue that it might not be the most effective way to tackle income inequality, and that other policies, like progressive taxation or social welfare programs, might be more impactful.

Lastly, poverty rates are directly affected by wage levels. A higher minimum wage can lift some workers out of poverty, especially if it's set at a level that allows them to meet their basic needs. However, as we saw in one of the articles, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour could potentially lead to job losses, which might offset some of the benefits for those who keep their jobs.

Given all these factors, it's clear that the impact of minimum wage on the economy is complex and multifaceted. It's not a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship; rather, it involves a interplay of various economic variables.

I think to get a better understanding, I should look into some specific examples or studies that have examined the effects of minimum wage changes on the economy.

The Minimum wage has been a topic that has shaped our Ideas in political, social, and economic issues in our society. The constant debate that has everyone wondering, is should the minimum wage be raised or kept the same. To decide whether the minimum wage should be raised or lowered depends on a couple of factors; such as The impact on jobs (such as the unemployment rate), effect on families for example, incomes and living conditions, Impacts on businesses and the growth of our economy.
The biggest question regarding the Minimum Wage is will bumping the price up affect our jobs. Yes and no to the change having an impact on our jobs. If the Minimum Wage is increased it is less likely for businesses to let go of their employees due to the inability to pay them. The United States Department of Labor reviewed 64 studies about how the unemployment income is dependent on the increase of minimum wage and they found zero proof on how they both have a connection. However the amount of turnovers regarding employees decreases because of new workers being employed and trained. Thus the increase of new workers defeats the myth that employees will be cut loose from jobs. Proving my point increasing the minimum wage will have an impact on jobs in a positive way by adding more workers but In another way looking on the other hand the Minimum Wage won’t have an impact on our jobs on the unemployment topic, which is a hot topic that politicians like to stir debate around.
A HUGE component that greatly impacts our economy are incentives. Incentives drive production and quality of products which are depended upon workers in the economy. If Minimum Wage were to go up incentives for not only our stores and factories but our education regarding college would go down the toilet. Looking at the logical explanation and exploring the mind of a college student, highschool student, an individual that is a highschool dropout According to the information provided by The Bureau Of Labor Statistics in 2012, 284,000 Students who graduated college were working at minimum wage jobs. The amount of graduate students working minimum wage jobs increased to 71% more than it was originally a decade ago in 2013. Graduates were numbered 167,000 in 2002, and 127,000 in 2006. As shown, the total of graduates sucked into minimum wage jobs keeps increasing more and more rapidly over the years. If the minimum wage is actually passed so that it will be raised to $15 the people who take an extra step into their education and go to the college and earn a career will be earning as much as a highschool drop out. If people who didn’t earn a high school diploma get paid the same as someone who earned their masters and drove their way through college including student loans and or earning their way by getting stellar grades and being the highest above their class the person who earned their degree will have what seems like wasted time because they’re most likely to end up at a minimum wage job anyhow which shows that the minimum would completely encourage lazy people.
The final reason I believe the Minimum wage shouldn’t be elevated is The sole fact that minimum wages shouldn’t even be anywhere in the sight of a family’s income. If the argument is that minimum wage is not livable it’s because I truly believe the Minimum wage is meant for high school students and college students. The real surprising thing to me throughout all my research not once have I seen anyone establish who the minimum wage was meant for; Throughout all the debate it’s only said who the minimum wage workers are. However a highlighted fact is that minimum wage workers are indeed young. According to a Direct source of The Bureau of Labor Statistics Report 1054, “Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2014” Workers make up ⅕ of the hourly wage workers but nearly half of wage workers payee minimum or less. Teenagers ages 16 to 19 are made up of the 15 % that earn the minimum wage or even lower than that versus the 3 % who are 25 years of age or older. On the gender side woman are made up of 5% and men are at 3%. The workers who are in the service industry such as fast food and restaurants make up ⅔ the hourly jobs. About 10% of hourly wage workers worked less than 35 hours a week which brings me to my point about the minimum being most suitable for teenagers and college students due to busy schedules and school to attend.
We should not raise minimum wage due to the reasons on it having little impact on our jobs, the decreased motivation of people to further their education thus equalling little value in college degrees, and people arguing that the minimum wage isn’t livable proves the point that the minimum wage wasn’t mean for a family of four to survive on. If people want livable wages and better lives they should invest their time into college although there is still a risk of ending up in a minimum wage but the percentage will be way lower to be stuck in low income job and a better chance to have better working conditions. People who want a higher minimum wage are composed of people who didn’t go to college or people who got stuck in a hole and who got sidetracked by life such as having a family.

The evidence on the effects of minimum wage - American Experiment
Economy
Written by Martha Njolomole|January 25, 2021
The evidence on the effects of minimum wage
On January 14, President Joe Biden announced a sweeping $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief stimulus plan. Among other things, the plan includes funding for Covid-19 testing, vaccine rollout, grants to small businesses affected by the virus, and additional checks to households. The plan also includes a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 in order to fight poverty.
The fight for a higher minimum wage is not new, although it has been intensified by current events. Among calls for social justice and providing a “living wage,” t here is indeed also evidence showing that the consensus on the negative effects of the minimum wage has been waning among researchers in recent years .  More and more research has come out in favor of raising the minimum citing little to no negative effects of minimum wage on employment.
However, this phenomenon, as it turns out, is less about rigorous research actually supporting minimum wage. It is, instead, more about misinterpretation or misrepresentation of some evidence. Upon closer inspection, evidence supporting a higher minimum wage tends to be either overstated or mistaken, as illustrated by Cato. The reality remains that robust evidence exists showing the negative effects of the minimum wage.
The literature on minimum wage
Historically, researchers have used variations in state minimum wage laws to analyze the impact of minimum wage on employment. Generally, disagreements exist among researchers on their findings. While some researchers report little to no effect of minimum wage on employment, others report significant negative impacts. This is also true among studies that summarise studies detailing the effect of the minimum wage.
However, according to the authors of a new NBER paper, this lack of consensus is largely due to studies “discarding” or “ignoring” most of the evidence on the negative effect of the minimum wage, and not about actual effects. The authors, David Neumark and Peter Shirley, who utilize preferred estimates instead of reported estimates, instead find that most evidence largely supports a negative relationship between minimum wage and employment.
To explain further, reported estimates are usually all findings that authors include in their findings. These, sometimes, may include results that even the authors do not view as credible. On the other hand, preferred estimates are essentially conclusions that an author of a study drew and would likely report as their core finding. Preferred estimates are able to capture the main finding of a study; at least its unique contribution to literature.
And based on this approach, the authors conclude that;
(i) there is a clear preponderance of negative estimates in the literature; (ii) this evidence is stronger for teens and young adults as well as the less-educated; (iii) the evidence from studies of directly-affected workers points even more strongly to negative employment effects; and (iv) the evidence from studies of low-wage industries is less one-sided.
This is directly in contrast to proponents of the minimum wage that tend to pick studies or parts of studies to support their view. The fact remains that the minimum wage is harmful especially to low skilled workers. And doubling it to $15 should be expected to be even more harmful.

“. . . what has to be the most exhaustive existing analysis of the question of the impact of minimum wage increases on employment .”  —Jared Bernstein
The minimum wage debate is, among other things, contentious, polarizing, and at the forefront of ongoing political debate. Some argue that raising the minimum wage will pull working individuals and families out of poverty while reducing income inequality at an acceptable cost to society. Others contend that raising the minimum wage is a job killer: that when the cost of labor increases, demand for that labor decreases. Supporters of this argument cite a February 2014 CBO report that points to potential job losses numbering 500,000 as a result of President Obama’s proposed national minimum wage increase to $10.10 an hour. Others, including noted economists, criticize the report for being based on “off-the-shelf estimates” and say that it fails to put an emphasis on the more rigorous studies examined in the report. And while policymakers have voted recently to increase the minimum wage in several states and municipalities, it will be years before the impacts of these increases, if any, will be detectable. The bottom line is that all the debate and recent action by policymakers does little to add clarity to the effects of raising the minimum wage.
A book from the Upjohn Press helps settle the issue. Based on a rigorous meta-analysis of more than 200 scholarly publications published since 1991 (most after 2000) that address the various impacts of raising the minimum wage, What Does the Minimum Wage Do? presents what has to be the most comprehensive, analytical, and unbiased assessment of the effects of minimum wage increases that has ever been produced. Authors Dale Belman and Paul J. Wolfson look at several outcomes influenced by increases in the minimum wage, how long it takes those outcomes to respond, the magnitude of effects, why increases in the minimum wage have the results they do, and the workers most likely to be impacted.
Their painstaking analysis focuses mainly on studies using data from the United States, but also includes studies that focus on Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and other western European nations. This breadth and depth of investigation on the impacts of hikes in the minimum wage clarifies the issues surrounding, among other things, employment, wages, poverty and inequality, and effect by gender, and allows them to conclude the following:
Moderate increases in the minimum wage, characteristic of the United States over the last half of the twentieth century, have the effect that was intended by the original supporters of such action: raising the minimum wage substantially increases the earnings of those at the bottom of the income distribution and reduces wage inequality.
Negative effects on employment resulting from increases in the minimum wage were too small to be statistically detectable in the meta-analysis. Therefore, Belman and Wolfson conclude, employment effects are too modest to have meaningful consequences for public policy in the dynamically changing U.S. labor market.
Evidence of positive spillover effects on the wages of those earning slightly more than the new minimum wage is mixed, but it generally supports their existence, particularly for women.
The minimum wage should be seen as one of a set of policy tools aimed at improving the standard of living of the less well-off, and moderate increases in the minimum wage would likely aid low-income individuals and families, with acceptable costs to the nation.

Effects of Minimum Wage
By David Ingram
A minimum wage is a prescribed wage level that must be met or exceeded by employers in all employment contracts, as set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act. The minimum wage is revised from time to time to adjust for inflating prices. Microeconomics is the study of financial issues from the perspective of individual economic units, such as a single household, small business or individual. The minimum wage has a number of positive and negative effects on businesses, families and individual workers, from a microeconomics perspective.
Effects on Business
Businesses that rely to a large extent on unskilled labor generally experience dramatic increases in wage expenses as a result of a minimum wage, since a minimum wage virtually eliminates companies' ability to negotiate wages for their lowest-level employees. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the minimum wage increased about twenty four percent between 2007 and 2009, going from $5.85 to $7.25 per hour. Businesses that employ unskilled labor see their profit margins diminish and their expenses increase, presenting a challenge to their economic growth and introducing a new variable to economic decision-making.
Local Employment
Many companies see the minimum wage as a large expense for an unskilled worker, which can cause them to impose stricter decision criteria for hiring or cut back on hiring altogether. Minimum wage jobs are often suited for young people entering the workforce for the first time, but, according to the Employment Policy Institute, every 10 percent increase in the minimum wage causes a five to nine percent decrease in youth employment. This can cause a situation where individuals with little experience who might happily accept a lower wage find themselves unable to find a job. If this trend continues in specific regions, local unemployment could rise, possibly raising homelessness and crime rates as well.
Effects on Individuals
Employees experience direct benefits from a minimum wage, but there are a number of drawbacks to consider as well. The obvious benefit to unskilled workers is the guaranteed boost in discretionary income provided by a guaranteed wage. Highly skilled and experienced workers experience a boost in income as well, since a raise in the lowest wage pushes all other wages upward as well. It can be argued that the minimum wage has never been high enough to fully support a family. According to the U.S. Census, only around seventeen percent of minimum wage earners are supporting families on their own. The effects of business's reactions to the minimum wage can be detrimental to employees in the long run as well. Companies may turn to automation or outsourcing to control the increase in wage expenses. This could reduce the number of jobs available in the marketplace for unskilled workers, again resulting in higher unemployment. Younger employees can benefit greatly from the minimum wage. Employees entering the workforce for the first time, with no experience, can count on the minimum wage to provide them the income they need to handle their first expenses. This, in turn, allows heads-of-household more discretionary income to spend on family needs.

Alright, so I've got some information on the minimum wage and its purpose. It seems like the main goal is to ensure that workers are paid a fair wage that allows them to meet their basic needs. It's interesting to see that it was first introduced during the Great Depression when wages were really low, and it's been adjusted over time, although not always keeping up with inflation.

Now, the question is about how the minimum wage affects the economy. From the information I have, it seems like there are a few key areas to consider: employment levels, business costs, consumer spending, income inequality, and poverty rates.

First, employment levels. Some people argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses because businesses might not be able to afford higher wages and therefore hire fewer workers or even lay off some employees. This makes sense because if the cost of labor increases, businesses might look for ways to cut costs, like automating processes or reducing their workforce.

On the other hand, some studies suggest that moderate increases in the minimum wage don't necessarily lead to significant job losses and might even stimulate the economy by putting more money in the pockets of low-wage workers who are likely to spend that extra income immediately, thereby boosting demand and potentially creating more jobs.

Second, business costs are obviously affected by wage levels. Higher minimum wages mean higher labor costs for businesses, which they might pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices, or they might absorb the costs themselves, potentially reducing their profits.

However, some argue that higher wages can lead to increased productivity and lower turnover rates, which can offset the increased costs. For example, if employees are paid more, they might be more motivated and efficient, and the company might save on training costs because employees are less likely to leave for better-paying jobs.

Third, consumer spending is crucial for the economy, and low-wage workers who see an increase in their wages might spend more, which could stimulate the economy. Conversely, if the minimum wage is too low, workers might not have enough disposable income to drive demand for goods and services.

Fourth, income inequality is a broad issue, but minimum wage policies can play a role in addressing it. By setting a floor on wages, minimum wage laws can help reduce the gap between low-income and high-income earners. However, some critics argue that it might not be the most effective way to tackle income inequality and that other policies, like progressive taxation or social welfare programs, might be more impactful.

Lastly, poverty rates are directly affected by wage levels. A higher minimum wage can lift some workers out of poverty, especially if it's set at a level that allows them to meet their basic needs. However, as mentioned earlier, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour could potentially lead to job losses, which might offset some of the benefits for those who keep their jobs.

Looking at these factors, it's clear that the impact of the minimum wage on the economy is complex and involves a interplay of various economic variables.

I came across an essay that discusses the impacts of the minimum wage on jobs, families, businesses, and economic growth. It argues that increasing the minimum wage could have both positive and negative effects. For instance, it might reduce employee turnover and attract more workers, but it could also discourage people from pursuing higher education since the wage gap narrows.

Another source I found is from the American Experiment, which cites a study saying that there's a preponderance of evidence showing a negative relationship between the minimum wage and employment, especially for teens and less-educated workers. This suggests that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses for these groups.

However, I also found a book from the Upjohn Institute that presents a comprehensive analysis of the minimum wage's effects. According to their meta-analysis of over 200 scholarly publications, moderate increases in the minimum wage have the intended effect of raising earnings for those at the bottom of the income distribution and reducing wage inequality. They also found that negative employment effects are too small to be statistically significant.

This seems contradictory to the earlier claim. So, perhaps the impact depends on the magnitude of the wage increase. A moderate increase might not have a significant negative effect on employment, while a substantial increase could lead to job losses.

Moreover, the book mentions positive spillover effects on the wages of those earning slightly above the new minimum wage, which supports the idea that raising the minimum wage can have broader positive impacts on income distribution.

From a microeconomic perspective, the minimum wage affects individual businesses and workers differently. For businesses relying heavily on unskilled labor, a higher minimum wage increases their wage expenses, which could squeeze profit margins. However, as the Upjohn Institute's book suggests, these increases might not necessarily lead to job cuts, at least not to a significant extent.

On the other hand, for workers, especially those in low-skilled jobs, a higher minimum wage directly increases their income, which can improve their standard of living and reduce poverty. It can also have a positive impact on worker morale and productivity.

But there's also the potential downside that some low-skilled workers might lose their jobs if businesses cannot afford to pay higher wages, or that businesses might resort to automation or outsourcing to cut costs.

Additionally, there's the argument that a higher minimum wage could lead to inflation if businesses pass on the increased labor costs to consumers through higher prices. This could negate some of the benefits for workers if their increased wages are eaten up by higher prices.

However, studies seem to suggest that the impact on prices is minimal. A report by the Congressional Budget Office found that a $15 minimum wage could increase prices by about 0.3%, which is a very small increase.

Furthermore, some economists argue that a higher minimum wage could actually benefit businesses by reducing turnover rates, as workers are more likely to stay with a company that pays them well. This can lead to cost savings from reduced hiring and training expenses.

Another perspective is that raising the minimum wage could stimulate the economy by increasing consumer spending, as low-wage workers are more likely to spend any additional income they receive.

However, opponents argue that businesses might hire fewer workers or cut back on hours, which could offset any gains from higher wages.

It's also worth considering that the effects of the minimum wage can vary depending on the local cost of living. In areas with a higher cost of living, a minimum wage that is sufficient in one place might not be adequate in another.

That's why some states and cities have implemented higher minimum wages than the federal level. For example, California and several cities have a minimum wage of $15 per hour.

Moreover, the composition of the workforce affects the impact of the minimum wage. As mentioned earlier, teenagers and young adults are disproportionately affected by changes in the minimum wage because they make up a larger share of low-wage workers.

A study by the Employment Policy Institute suggested that a 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to a 5-9% decrease in youth employment. This is a significant concern because it could limit opportunities for young people to enter the workforce and gain valuable experience.

However, other studies have questioned the strength of this relationship, suggesting that the employment effects might be minimal or that other factors play a bigger role in youth employment rates.

Another angle to consider is the impact on small businesses versus large corporations. Small businesses might have less flexibility to absorb increased labor costs, whereas larger companies with bigger profit margins could more easily accommodate wage increases.

Therefore, raising the minimum wage could disproportionately affect small businesses, potentially leading to closures or reductions in staff.

But again, the Upjohn Institute's meta-analysis suggests that employment effects are too small to have meaningful consequences for public policy, which contradicts this concern.

Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between. Moderate increases in the minimum wage might not have a significant negative impact on employment, but larger increases could lead to job losses, especially for vulnerable groups like teenagers and low-skilled workers.

Moreover, the long-term effects might differ from the short-term effects. In the short term, businesses might adjust by cutting hours or positions, but in the long term, they could invest in labor-saving technologies or find other ways to become more efficient.

It's also essential to consider the alternative methods of supporting low-wage workers, such as wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, or universal basic income. These approaches might have different effects on the labor market and could be more effective in reducing poverty without discouraging employment.

For example, wage subsidies can help boost workers' incomes without directly increasing labor costs for employers, which might mitigate potential negative employment effects.

Similarly, earned income tax credits provide supplemental income to low-wage workers through the tax system, which can help them make ends meet without putting pressure on employers to raise wages.

Universal basic income is a more radical approach that provides all citizens with a regular, unconditional sum of money, regardless of their employment status. This could potentially alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality without distorting labor markets.

Each of these alternatives has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and their effectiveness would depend on how they are designed and implemented.

In conclusion, the minimum wage is a complex issue with both positive and negative effects on the economy. While it can help raise incomes for low-wage workers and reduce inequality, there is a risk that it could lead to job losses, especially for vulnerable groups.

The evidence is mixed, with some studies showing negligible employment effects and others indicating potential negative impacts. The magnitude of the wage increase likely plays a role, with moderate increases being less problematic than substantial jumps.

Therefore, policymakers need to carefully consider the potential trade-offs and perhaps opt for gradual increases in the minimum wage paired with other supportive measures like training programs or wage subsidies to help workers adapt to a changing labor market.

## Final Answer
\[ \boxed{\text{The minimum wage affects the economy by influencing employment levels, business costs, consumer spending, income inequality, and poverty rates. While it can raise incomes for low-wage workers and reduce inequality, there is a risk of job losses, particularly for vulnerable groups. The impact varies based on the size of the wage increase and the local economic context.}} \]
