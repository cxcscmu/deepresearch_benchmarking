Alright, so I need to figure out why petrol prices have been rising. I don't know much about this topic off the top of my head, so I think I should start by doing some research to understand the factors that affect petrol prices.

First, I need to understand what petrol is and how its price is determined. I know that petrol is a fossil fuel derived from crude oil, which is refined into various products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. So, maybe the price of crude oil affects the price of petrol. I should look into that.

Let me consider conducting a search to get more information. I'll search for "factors affecting petrol prices" or something similar. That should give me a good starting point.

Hi,
Petrol prices in India are fluctuating very frequently in recent past because of many factors as mentioned below:
Influencing factors for price rise of petrol:
1. Cost of crude oil:
Increase in crude oil prices in the international market is one important factor responsible for increase in petrol prices in Indian domestic market. Increases international demands, low production rate and any political disturbances in crude oil producing countries of the world influence seriously prices of fuels like petrol.
2. Increased demand:
Strong economic growth of India and other developing countries in Asia have increased huge demand of petrol  and  other related essential fuels resulted price hike in petrol in India.
3. Mismatch of supply and demand:
Indian oil companies face problem to meet demands of petrol with shortage of  production and supply from oil refineries due to high input cost in crude oil price.
4. Tax burden:
Prices of petrol and other petroleum products varies according to local government policies in imposing taxes on fuels. Whenever government of India increases tax on fuels the oil companies in India have no other alternative to increase the petrol price to recover losses and maintaining marginal profits in oil business in India.

High demand of oil due to high population of India is the major reason of increase in the prices of oil. We can control the prices if we use the method of limited purchase of petrol (oil). If everyone make a routine to not to fill the full tank of oil and buy only Rs. 200 petrol. Then the tanks of oil companies will always full due to full production capacity. There will be not high demand of oil from petrol pumps as the tanks of petrol pumps will always full. No storage capacity can be increased. The prices of oil will automatically come down to low level. We should need to make an unity and follow the rule not to purchase oil for more than INR 200.

Petrol prices in India are affected by various factors,some of which are out of the control of even the government itself. The price of crude oil are set according to the oil producing nations like the Gulf countries. Although the government provides subsidy from the cost it bares from the international market, but it also has to take care of the interest of the oil companies and adjust according to the international conditions.

Hi,
Petrol prices keep rising and falling throughout the year. These fluctuations are due to many reasons. The single most important long term reason is the variations in the price of crude oil. The variations in prices of crude oil directly affects the petrol prices. The main reason for the variations in crude oil prices may be:
-> Strong global requirement.
-> Limited production capacity.
->Political issues in oil producing countries.
Further the various short term reasons are:
-> Increasing taxation.
-> Government Regulations.
-> Geographical location.
-> Increase in Demand.
-> Competition.
-> Supply-demand imbalances.
Regards,
Ruchi

India is importing oil from Arab countries. The price is fixed OPEC countries. Government of India is giving subsidy to this product due to which the oil companies are loosing crores of rupees. To reduce the loss for certain extent Government is increasing the oil price.

Determining Fuel Prices
Why do petrol prices rise and fall?
Consumers worldwide have watched the cost of petroleum continue to fluctuate throughout the year. In the long term, the greatest single factor influencing petroleum prices is the cost of crude oil. However, market place forces of supply, demand and competition can have a significant effect on the price of petroleum in the short term.
The cost of crude
The cost of crude oil contributes to almost 50 percent of the retail price of petroleum, and has the most significant long-term impact. Crude oil prices have risen dramatically over the last few years, driven by a strong global demand, limited spare oil production capacity, and continuing political instability in certain oil producing regions.
So when the price of crude goes up, average petroleum prices rise significantly too.
Increase in international energy demand
Surging crude oil demand is driven by strong economic growth, particularly in non-OECD nations. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that total world consumption of marketed energy is expected to increase by 44 percent from 2006 to 2030. Reduced spare oil production capacity leaves very little room to compensate for unanticipated supply disruptions or spikes in demand. The tenuous balance between supply and demand is even more of a concern when you consider that most of the world’s oil is located in some of the more politically unstable parts of the world. As such, supply disruptions, whether real or perceived, can have dramatic effects on the price of crude oil.
Global economic expansion is driving what the U.S. International Energy Agency (IEA) says is the biggest increase in oil demand in 24 years. In particular, energy consumption in the emerging economies of non-OECD countries is expected to increase by 73 percent between 2006 and 2030. The driver behind the fast-paced growth in energy demand in these countries is strong long-term GDP growth.
Oil supply – uncertainty places pressure on price
Crude oil is refined to produce petrol and diesel and the cost of crude oil is traditionally the greatest single factor affecting fuel prices over time. However, with the shortage of refineries to refine the crude, we’re in a unique situation where the price difference between crude oil and refined product can be large.
Supply remains volatile. With rising demand, this places tremendous pressure on pricing. Political volatility in oil producing regions has historically impacted on crude oil prices and the political situation in the Middle East is of global concern.TaxationTax takes up a significant component of the price of every litre of fuel, but it varies from product to product, and country to country. In some countries where Caltex operates, tax rates can be as high as almost half the cost of fuel.
Other factors that influence petroleum price
Although the cost of crude oil has the most impact on average petroleum prices in the long term, local market conditions (including the forces of supply, demand, competition, and government regulation) can also have a significant impact on petroleum prices and explain some of the pricing variations across different markets.
In any market situation, supply and demand imbalances can affect prices in the short term. Supply shortages typically cause upward price pressure and can result from an unplanned refinery outage, pipeline problems, or an unforeseen increase in demand. Conversely, downward price pressure can happen when supply exceeds demand.
Other factors affecting pricing include foreign exchange and geographic location.
Local competition, reflected by the number of choices in the market place, can also affect pricing. Almost everyone has experienced the difference in petroleum prices between a lone station on a lengthy interstate and in town, where many intersections may have two or three service stations to choose from.
Generally, price adjustments in the market affect short-term supply-demand imbalances and bring supply and demand back into balance. Whether in a situation of supply tightness or length, price will eventually bring the supply-demand balance into equilibrium by attracting additional supply or influencing demand.
The future
No one can say with certainty what will happen in the future with crude oil and petroleum prices. Caltex, as a Chevron brand, supports a comprehensive national energy policy that would address both conservation (reducing demand) and increasing the supply of crude oil and refined products. This includes streamlined permitting for petroleum infrastructure, as well as increasing domestic crude oil production in an environmentally responsible manner. Caltex is committed to taking all appropriate steps to supply our customers reliably and safely with the motor fuel products they want.
Prices for petrol are determined by global supply and demand and the market decides the price. Caltex will continue to monitor the situation closely and will adjust the prices accordingly in the direction of the market. Caltex is aware of customers’ concerns on price sensitivity and we’ll always strive to price products competitively.

Petrol Price in India
In today’s time, people love travelling by road as vehicles are now easily available and the roads too have become safe to travel. This has made petrol an essential commodity as it is important for the purpose of transportation. However, due to increase in the demand for petrol and various other factors, petrol prices have witnessed a heavy rise. The constant increase in petrol price has put an additional pressure on the consumer, thus leaving him with no choice but to pay the petrol price prevailing on that day. It is important for an individual to check the petrol price today to understand the 1 litre price and purchase it accordingly. Recently, few states in India have witnessed a heavy rise in petrol price due to a number of factors that have had a direct impact on its price.
Factors Affecting Petrol Price in India
To help you understand why the petrol prices change every day, here are the few factors that have a direct impact on its cost.
Crude oil cost: This is one of the most important factors that has a direct impact on the petrol price in the Indian domestic market. Known as unrefined oil, crude oil is an international commodity and any change in its cost impacts the Indian fuel price. The cost of the crude oil is mainly increased due its demand and supply, international political relations and future supplies and reserves.
Rise in demand: With an increase in the number of people owning private vehicles, the demand for the fuel has increased, contributing towards the petrol price hike.
Supply and demand ratio: Petrol is produced by processing crude oil, the cost of which affects the fuel price in India. Oil refinery companies in India face problem to meet the rising demand of petrol as the cost of crude oil is rising, thus resulting in less supply of petrol.
Taxes: Petrol prices in India change in accordance with the changes in government policies that impose tax on fuels. To get marginal returns and recover the losses, Indian oil companies change their rate depending on the changing rate of taxes.
Rupee and dollar: This is one of the very important factors having a huge impact on petrol price in India. Oil imported in India is traded in dollars. So, when the dollar strengthens against the Indian rupee, the buying cost goes high, thus impacting the cost of petrol.
Refinery consumption ratio : The imported crude oil is sent to refineries for further processing. A low refinery ratio leads to lower quantity of petrol available for sale, thus increasing the cost of petrol.
How is Petrol Price in India calculated?
Price of petrol in India is rapidly increasing, which makes it necessary for an individual to understand how the price is calculated.
Petrol is one commodity in India that has been kept out of the purview of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). The retail selling price of petrol in India is based on a crude oil, OMC margin, transportation cost, freight costs, central government taxes, state government taxes, excise duty and other taxes.
Crude oil: India is one of the biggest importers of crude oil and one of the biggest components of the retail selling price of petrol. Since crude oil is required for processing petrol, oil manufacturing companies in India pay overseas crude oil companies addition charges along with the freight and insurance charges to obtain the oil.
For example: If one barrel of crude oil (equivalent to 159 litres) costs Rs. 4200, then per litre crude oil costs Rs. 26.42
OMC Costs: Oil marketing companies refine crude oil into petrol and then sell it to the dealers. These companies sell petrol to dealers adding their own profit margin, which includes transportation cost, operational costs, refinery processing cost and others.
VAT : The value added tax on petrol varies from state to state which is why the petrol prices differ across different states and cities.
Central and state taxes: The excise duty on petrol is the same across all the nations. Currently the excise duty levied on petrol by the Indian Government is Rs.21.48 a litre.

Impact of GST on Petrol Prices in India
GST is the Goods and Service Tax Act that came into effect in the country in July 2017. Petrol, and its related products, is a commodity that has been kept out of the GST regime. Currently, petroleum products such as crude oil, natural gas, LPG, diesel and petrol are not under the ambit of GST and are subject to central excise duty and state specific VAT. The addition of these taxes seems to exceed the cost of petrol and diesel in the country. The levy of central and excise duty increases the cost of petrol.
The below chart explains the tax structure levied on petrol in India
Excise Duty on Petrol
Rs 21.48 per Litre
VAT on Basic Price on Petrol
27% on Basic Price
Dealer's commission
Rs 3.23 per Litre
Excise Duty on Diesel
Rs 17.33 per Litre
VAT on Basic Price on Diesel
27% on Basic Price
Dealer's commission
Rs 2.17 per Litre
Let’s consider the below example to understand what happens if petrol comes under the ambit of GST.
As on September 2018 in Delhi, an individual has to pay Rs 70.52 to purchase a litre of petrol. If you minus the excise duty (Rs. 21.48) charged on per litre of petrol by the centre, also the 27% VAT charged by the state government (calculated to be Rs 14.96), dealers commission (Rs 3.24), the actual cost of petrol comes to Rs. 30.85 per litre.
For example, as of September 2018 in Delhi, an individual has to pay Rs. 70.52 for purchasing 1 litre of petrol. If the excise duty i.e. Rs. 21.48 per litre is taken out and 27% VAT i.e. Rs. 14.96 on price of the petrol, dealer’s commission i.e. Rs.3. 24 is waived off, then the actual cost of petrol comes around to be Rs. 30.85 per litre.
So what happens if petrol comes under GST ambit?
If we assume that the Indian Government brings petrol prices under
12 % GST bracket, then petrol price could come down to Rs 38.1 in Delhi
At 18 % GST bracket, petrol price will be Rs. 40.05 per litre
And at 28% GST bracket, petrol will cost Rs. 43.44 a litre in Delhi.
Note: The above calculations are assumptions based on current petrol price in Delhi i.e. Rs. 70-71 per litre in September, 2018.

Why is the price of petrol going up? - Ask the Car Expert
Driving
Why is the price of petrol going up?
Since May last year, the price of fuel has been on the rise. Whether it’s petrol or diesel, the price is rising and if it continues, it won’t be long before it gets to a 10-year high.
Why are prices rising?
The rises seem constant and extreme but this is largely a result of fuel prices being at an almost historic low by the end of April 2020. This is because the world was at a virtual standstill during the first month of the pandemic. Factories and other production facilities were shut, and travel – both internationally and nationally – were severely curtailed.
That led to a significant cut in demand for fuel. But fuel suppliers can’t just turn off the taps at a moment’s notice. With supply hugely outstripping demand, the law of economics saw prices fall.
What governs the price of fuel?
In addition to the simple rules of supply and demand, there are numerous other factors that dictate the price of fuel. The global price of crude oil is one. Crude oil is the base product for petrol and diesel. It needs to be refined so refinery capacity is another factor. Then there’s the pound to dollar exchange rate. Fuel is sold in US $ so a favourable exchange rate can lower the price we pay at the pump.
Distribution costs play a part too. With a shortage of HGV drivers following Brexit and the pandemic, this is likely to be high too and it won’t be getting any lower in the short term.
The final governing factors haven’t changed in the short term. These are taxes such as VAT (at 20%) and fuel duty which is currently 57.95p per litre.
What will happen going forwards?
We think the price of petrol (and diesel) in the UK is going to continue rising for the foreseeable future. And that’s obviously bad news for car drivers.
Unless the pandemic returns with a vengeance, demand for fuel in the short term is likely to go in just one direction: up. Increasing numbers of people are working from home. That means we’re not using our cars as much. The result? According to the Petrol Retailers Association, miles travelled in May 2021 was only 92% of the January and February 2020 average. And the first two months of the year are usually the quietest. What that means is demand is likely to increase further, causing prices to rise higher.
What’s more, the continuing shortage of HGV drivers will put pressure on the supply chain going forwards. Again, the result will be rising prices.
Why do prices go up quicker than they come down?
Petrol retailers are quick to defend this but prices do seem to go up quicker than they come down. When the wholesale price of fuel goes up, it cuts into the retailers’ profit margin. When it comes down, it inflates their profits. They’re businesses and must make a profit to survive, hence why they’re quick to put prices up, not so speedy when it comes to cutting them.

Factors that Affect Fuel Prices in India
9 Factors affecting fuel prices in India
The rising prices of petrol and diesel have been a major concern for the citizens of the country. There are a number of factors that affect the fuel prices in India. Some of the most important factors that affect the prices of fossil fuels in India can be summed up as follows:
Cost of crude oil:
Crude oil or unrefined oil is a commodity of the international market. The changes in the price of this commodity directly affect the price of petrol and diesel in our country. Whenever there is a change in the demand and supply of crude oil, the prices vary. In addition to that, international political relations and future reserves and supplies also have direct effects on the price of crude oil.
Price charged to dealers:
The crude oil is acquired and distributed by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs). The price charged by the OMCs to the dealers is an important deciding factor of the price of the fossil fuels. This price is also based on a number of factors which include the freight charges, the refining cost, and so on.
Commission for dealers:
The Oil Marketing Companies or OMCs pay a commission to the fuel dealers. The petrol pump owners have their earnings, cost, and profit covered in this commission. This is one of the components which makes up the price of the fuel.
Central excise duty:
The central government levies the excise duty on petrol and diesel. It should be kept in mind that the central excise duty is a pre-defined amount of money and not a percentage. Thus, the duty does not fluctuate with the price of the fuels. Over the past few years, the Government of India has increased the excise duty manifold. The current duty charged on petrol is Rs.32.98 per litre and that for diesel is Rs.31.83 per litre. This amount is constant irrespective of the rise or fall in the price of the crude oil.
Sales Tax or Value Added Tax (VAT):
This tax is imposed by the respective state governments. The VAT or sales tax is calculated after taking a few other factors into consideration such as the excise duty charged by the centre, the commission of the dealers, and so on.
Taxes imposed by the government:
The Government of India imposes a tax on both petrol and diesel. There are certain policies on the basis of which, the centre might change the tax structure. The change in this structure is mainly base on the marginal returns from the fossil fuels and the recovery of losses. The price of the fuels also changes on the basis of these taxes.
Demand for fuel:
With the number of two-wheelers and four-wheelers steadily increasing on the Indian roads, the demand for both petrol and diesel have been increasing as well. As the oil refinery companies in India have to acquire crude oil from the international market in order to process the same into petrol and diesel, the supply cannot be always fulfilled. When the supply is less and the demand is more, as per the laws of economics, the price of both the fuel is bound to increase.
Consumption ratio of refineries:
The crude oil imported to India are sent across to the refineries for processing. If the number of refineries is lower, then the overall quantity of petrol or diesel which will be available for sale will also be lower. This would also mean that the supply will be lower, which in turn, will make the price of the fuel higher.
Valuation of INR against USD:
One major factor that is responsible for the alteration of prices of petrol and diesel in India is the value of the Indian Rupee against the American Dollar. The crude oil which is refined for petrol and diesel is bought from the international market and the transaction is done in dollars. Thus, the strength of the USD against INR is a direct factor. If the American Dollar is stronger, the cost of purchasing crude oil will be higher. This will mean that the price of the finished products will also be higher.

Alright, so I've got some information from these documents about what affects petrol prices. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, it seems that the cost of crude oil is a big factor. Crude oil is the raw material that's refined into petrol and other products. So, if the price of crude oil goes up, that tends to drive up the price of petrol in the long run. Document 2 from Caltex Philippines mentions that the cost of crude contributes to almost 50% of the retail price of petrol.

Next, there's the issue of supply and demand. Document 1 from IndiaStudyChannel talks about how increased demand from India and other developing countries is putting pressure on petrol prices. Also, if there are supply shortages due to refinery outages or pipeline problems, that can cause prices to spike in the short term.

Taxes also play a significant role. Both central and state governments impose taxes on petrol, and these can vary by location. Document 3 from Coverfox explains that petrol is not subject to GST in India, and the retail price includes excise duty, VAT, and other taxes. So, any changes in tax rates can directly affect the price at the pump.

Another factor is the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the US dollar, since crude oil is traded in dollars internationally. If the rupee weakens against the dollar, it costs more in rupees to buy the same amount of crude oil, which can lead to higher petrol prices.

There's also the role of oil marketing companies like Indian Oil, BPCL, and HPCL. They refine the crude oil and set the price at which they sell petrol to dealers. Their costs, including refining expenses and transportation, are factored into the final price.

It's interesting to note that in some states, the VAT on petrol is higher than in others, which explains why petrol prices can vary from one state to another.

Moreover, geopolitical factors can influence petrol prices. For instance, political instability in oil-producing regions can disrupt supply and cause prices to rise.

Looking at Document 4 from Ask the Car Expert, it seems that similar dynamics apply in other countries like the UK. Supply and demand, crude oil prices, exchange rates, and distribution costs all affect fuel prices there as well.

Document 5 from BankBazaar adds that the commission paid to dealers is another component of the final petrol price. So, the profits that petrol pump owners make are also built into the price.

One thing I'm noticing is that there are many variables at play here, and they can all influence the final price in different ways. It's complex, and that's probably why petrol prices can seem unpredictable to consumers.

I think to summarize, the main factors affecting petrol prices are:

1. Cost of crude oil

2. Supply and demand dynamics

3. Taxes imposed by central and state governments

4. Exchange rates, particularly the value of the rupee against the dollar

5. Refining and distribution costs

6. Commission for dealers

7. Geopolitical factors affecting oil supply

Given all these factors, it's no wonder that petrol prices can fluctuate quite a bit over time.

Now, considering all this information, I need to answer the question: "Why have petrol prices risen?"

Well, based on what I've read, there are several possible reasons:

- An increase in the international price of crude oil

- Higher demand for petrol due to economic growth and more people owning vehicles

- Supply constraints, perhaps due to refinery issues or disruptions in oil supply chains

- Increases in taxes imposed by the government

- A weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, making imports more expensive

- Geopolitical tensions that affect oil production and supply

It's likely that a combination of these factors is contributing to the rise in petrol prices.

I should also consider that sometimes, oil marketing companies may adjust their prices based on their own costs and profit margins.

Furthermore, as Document 1 mentions, sometimes oil companies face losses due to high input costs, and they may pass those costs on to consumers by raising prices.

It's also worth noting that in some cases, petrol prices may rise more quickly than they fall when crude oil prices change. This could be because retailers are quicker to pass on cost increases than to reduce prices when costs decrease.

Overall, the rise in petrol prices is influenced by a interplay of global market forces, domestic economic conditions, and government policies.

I think to get a more precise answer, I'd need to look at the specific context and time frame in question. For example, if petrol prices have been rising recently, it might be useful to see what's happening in the global oil market, whether there are any supply disruptions, and if there have been any changes in tax policies.

But based on the general information available, it's clear that multiple factors contribute to petrol price increases.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Petrol prices have risen due to a combination of factors including increases in the cost of crude oil, higher demand from economic growth, supply constraints, tax hikes, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.}}\]
