Alright, so I need to figure out how religion shapes public policy. Hmm, this seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, I need to understand what public policy is. Public policy are the laws, regulations, and actions that governments take to address issues and govern society. So, it's basically how a government decides to manage various aspects of public life.

Now, religion is a set of beliefs, practices, and moral values centered around the supernatural or spiritual. Different religions have different teachings and principles that guide the behavior and actions of their followers.

So, how does religion influence public policy? I think there are several ways this can happen.

One way is through the personal beliefs of policymakers. Many politicians have religious backgrounds, and their faith may influence their views on certain issues. For example, a politician who is strongly Catholic might oppose abortion based on their religious beliefs, and this could affect the policies they support or create.

Another way is through religious organizations getting involved in politics. Churches, mosques, synagogues, and other religious institutions often have positions on various social and political issues. They may advocate for certain policies or even lobby lawmakers to support their views.

Religious voters also play a role. In many countries, including the United States, religious groups can be powerful voting blocs. Politicians may cater to these groups to gain their support during elections, which can influence the policies they promote.

Moreover, in some countries, religion is directly entwined with the government. For example, in Saudi Arabia, the government follows Sharia law, which is based on Islamic principles. So, in such cases, religion directly shapes public policy.

But let's consider more secular societies, like in Europe or Canada. Even in these places, religion can still influence public policy, albeit to a lesser extent. For instance, debates on issues like same-sex marriage, euthanasia, or stem cell research often involve religious perspectives.

I think it's also important to note that religion can provide a moral framework that informs public policy. Many laws are based on ethical considerations, and religion often provides a set of ethics for its followers. So, policies that align with religious morals may gain support from religious communities.

On the other hand, there's also the concept of separation of church and state, which is enshrined in some constitutions, like the U.S. Constitution. This principle aims to prevent any one religion from dominating public policy and to ensure religious freedom for all.

Despite this separation, religion can still indirectly influence public policy through the avenues I mentioned earlier—through the beliefs of policymakers, religious organizations' advocacy, and the voting preferences of religious constituents.

Let me try to think of some specific examples to illustrate this.

Take the issue of abortion. In many countries, the stance on abortion is heavily influenced by religious beliefs. For instance, the Catholic Church is strongly against abortion, and in countries with large Catholic populations, this can translate into more restrictive abortion laws.

Another example is same-sex marriage. Many religions have traditional views on marriage being between a man and a woman, and this has led to religious groups opposing the legalization of same-sex marriage in some places.

Conversely, in some instances, religion has driven positive social change. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States was greatly supported by religious leaders and organizations, such as Martin Luther King Jr., who was a Baptist minister.

So, religion can shape public policy in both conservative and progressive ways, depending on the issue and the religious beliefs involved.

I should also consider how public policy can affect religion. For example, laws regarding religious freedom, education, and taxation can all impact religious institutions and practices.

In some countries, religious minorities may face discrimination or suppression through public policy, while in others, policies are designed to protect and accommodate religious diversity.

It's a two-way street, really. Religion influences public policy, and public policy influences religion.

Wait a minute, maybe I should look up some academic sources to get a better understanding of this relationship.

Religious Values and Public Policy

Speaking Today
Religious Values and Public Policy
Elder Dallin H. Oaks
Of the Quorum of the Twelve
From an address given 29 February 1992 to the Brigham Young University Management Society, Washington, D.C.
Last April my Church duties took me to Albania. Elder Hans B. Ringger and I were some of the first Western visitors to that newly opened country. We conferred with government officials about the reception our church’s missionaries would receive in Albania, which had banned all churches in 1967. They told us the government regretted its actions against religion, and that it now welcomed churches back to Albania. One explained, “We need the help of churches to rebuild the moral base of our country, which was destroyed by communism.” During the past months I have heard this same reaction during discussions with government and other leaders in Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine.
In contrast, consider what we hear about religion from some prominent persons in the United States. Some question the legitimacy of religious-based values in public policy debates. Some question the appropriateness of churches or religious leaders taking any public position on political issues.
Provoked by that contrast, I will use this occasion to speak about the role of religion-based values and religious leaders in public policy debates.
Questions of Right and Wrong
Fundamental to the role of religion in public policy is this most important question: Are there moral absolutes? Speaking to our BYU students earlier this year, President Rex E. Lee said:
“I cannot think of anything more important than for each of you to build a firm, personal testimony that there are in this life some absolutes, things that never change, regardless of time, place, or circumstances. They are eternal truths, eternal principles and, as Paul tells us, they are and will be the same yesterday, today, and forever.” 1
Unfortunately, other educators deny the existence of God or deem God irrelevant to the human condition. Persons who accept this view deny the existence of moral absolutes. They maintain that right and wrong are relative concepts, and morality is merely a matter of personal choice or expediency. For example, a university professor reported that her students lacked what she called “moral common sense.” She said they believed that “there was no such thing as right or wrong, just good or bad arguments.” 2 In that view, even the most fundamental moral questions have at least two sides, and every assertion of right or wrong is open to debate.
I believe that these contrasting approaches underlie the whole discussion of religious values in public policy. Many differences of opinion over the role of religion in public life simply mirror a difference of opinion over whether there are moral absolutes. But this underlying difference is rarely made explicit. It is as if those who assume that all values are relative have established their assumption by law or tradition and have rendered illegitimate the fundamental belief of those who hold that some values are absolute.
One of the consequences of shifting from moral absolutes to moral relativism in public policy is that this produces a corresponding shift of emphasis from responsibilities to rights. Responsibilities originate in moral absolutes. In contrast, rights find their origin in legal principles, which are easily manipulated by moral relativism. Sooner or later the substance of rights must depend on either the voluntary fulfillment of responsibilities or the legal enforcement of duties. When our laws or our public leaders question the existence of absolute moral values, they undercut the basis for the voluntary fulfillment of responsibilities, which is economical, and compel our society to rely more and more on the legal enforcement of rights, which is expensive.
Some moral absolutes or convictions must be at the foundation of any system of law. This does not mean that all laws are so based. Many laws and administrative actions are simply a matter of wisdom or expediency. But many laws and administrative actions are based upon the moral standards of our society. If most of us believe that it is wrong to kill or steal or lie, our laws will include punishment for those acts. If most of us believe that it is right to care for the poor and needy, our laws will accomplish or facilitate those activities. Society continually legislates morality. The only question is whose morality and what legislation.
In the United States, the moral absolutes are the ones derived from what we refer to as the Judeo-Christian tradition, as set forth in the Bible—Old Testament and New Testament.
Despite ample evidence of majority adherence to moral absolutes, some still question the legitimacy of a moral foundation for our laws and public policy. To avoid any suggestion of adopting or contradicting any particular religious absolute, some secularists argue that our laws must be entirely neutral, with no discernable relation to any particular religious tradition. Such proposed neutrality is unrealistic, unless we are willing to cut away the entire idea that there are moral absolutes.
Of course, not all moral absolutes are based on traditional religion. A substantial segment of society has subscribed to the environmental movement, which Robert Nisbet, a distinguished American sociologist, has characterized as a “national religion,” with a “universalized social, economic, and political agenda.” 3 So far as I am aware, there has been no responsible public challenge to the legitimacy of laws based on the environmentalists’ set of values. I don’t think there should be. My point is that religious values are just as legitimate as those based on any other comprehensive set of beliefs.
Religion and the Public Sector
Let us apply these thoughts to the role of religions, churches, and church leaders in the public sector.
Some reject the infusion of religious-based values in public policy by urging that much of the violence and social divisiveness of the modern world is attributable to religious controversies. But all should remember that the most horrible moral atrocities of the twentieth century in terms of death and human misery have been committed by regimes that are unambiguously secular, not religious.
Even though we cannot reject religious values in law-making on the basis of their bad record by comparison with other values, there are examples of hostility to religious values in the public sector. For example, less than a decade ago, the United States Department of Justice challenged a federal judge’s right to sit on a case involving the Equal Rights Amendment on the ground that his religious views would prejudice him. The judge was Marion Callister. The religious views were LDS. In that same decade, the American Civil Liberties Union took the position that any pro-life abortion law was illegitimate because it must necessarily be founded on religious belief. 4
A few years ago some Protestant and Jewish clergymen challenged a federally financed program to promote abstinence from sexual activity among teenage youngsters. The grant recipients included BYU and some Catholic charities in Virginia and Michigan. The ACLU attorney who filed this challenge declared that “the ‘chastity law’ is unconstitutional because it violates the requirement for separation of church and state” because taxpayer dollars “are going to religious institutions, which use the funds to teach religious doctrines opposing teen-age sex and abortion.” 5 In the meantime, the “value” judgments that permit public schools to distribute birth control devices to teenagers supposedly violate no constitutional prohibition because the doctrine that opposes chastity is secular.
During this same period, Professor Henry Steele Commager criticized the Moral Majority and the Roman Catholic Church for “inject[ing] religion into politics more wantonly than at any time since the Know-Nothing crusade of the 1850’s.” Writing in a New York Times column, this distinguished scholar asserted that “what the Framers [of the U. S. Constitution] had in mind was more than separating church and state: it was separating religion from politics.” While conceding that no one could question the right to preach “morality and religion,” Commager argued that churchmen of all denominations crossed an impermissible line “when they connect morality with a particular brand of religious faith and this, in turn, with political policies.” 6
Apparently, churchmen can preach morality and religion as long as they do not suggest that their particular brand of religion has any connection with morality or that the resulting morality has any connection with political policies. Stated otherwise, religious preaching is okay so long as it has no practical impact on the listeners’ day-to-day behavior, especially any behavior that has anything to do with political activity or public policy.
As we know, the idea that there is an absolute right and wrong comes from religion, and the absolute values that have influenced law and public policy are most commonly rooted in religion. In contrast, the values that generally prevail in today’s academic community are relative values.
I have read serious academic arguments to the effect that religious people can participate in public debate only if they conceal the religious origin of their values by translating them into secular dialect. In a nation committed to pluralism, this kind of hostility to religion should be legally illegitimate and morally unacceptable. It is also irrational and unworkable, for reasons explained by BYU law professor Frederick Mark Gedicks:
“Secularism has not solved the problem posed by religion in public life so much as it has buried it. By placing religion on the far side of the boundary marking the limit of the real world, secularism prevents public life from taking religion seriously. Secularism does not teach us to live with those who are religious; rather, it demands that we ignore them and their views. Such a ‘solution’ can remain stable only so long as those who are ignored acquiesce in their social situation.” 7
Fortunately, the Supreme Court has never held that citizens could not join together to translate their moral beliefs into laws or public policies even when those beliefs are derived from religious doctrine. Indeed, there are many sophisticated and articulate spokesmen for the proposition that the separation of church and state never intended to exclude religiously grounded values from the public square. For example, I offer the words of Richard John Neuhaus:
“In a democracy that is free and robust, an opinion is no more disqualified for being ‘religious’ than for being atheistic, or psychoanalytic, or Marxist, or just plain dumb. There is no legal or constitutional question about the admission of religion to the public square; there is only a question about the free and equal participation of citizens in our public business. Religion is not a reified ‘thing’ that threatens to intrude upon our common life. Religion in public is but the public opinion of those citizens who are religious.
“As with individual citizens, so also with the associations that citizens form to advance their opinions. Religious institutions may understand themselves to be brought into being by God, but for the purposes of this democratic polity they are free associations of citizens. As such, they are guaranteed the same access to the public square as are the citizens who comprise them.” 8
No person with values based on religious beliefs should apologize for taking those values into the public square. Religious persons need to be skillful in how they do so, but they need not yield to an adversary’s assumption that the whole effort is illegitimate. We should remind others of the important instances in which the efforts of churches and clergy in the political arena have influenced American public policies in great historical controversies whose outcome is virtually unquestioned today. The slavery controversy was seen as a great moral issue and became the major political issue of the nineteenth century because of the preaching of clergy and the political action of churches. A century later, churches played an indispensable role in the civil rights movement, and, a decade later, clergymen and churches of various denominations were an influential part of the antiwar movement that contributed to the end of the war in Vietnam.
Many sincere religious people believe there should be no limitations on religious arguments on political issues so long as the speaker genuinely believes those issues can be resolved as a matter of right or wrong.
I believe that questions of right and wrong, whether based on religious principles or any other source of values, are legitimate in any debate over laws or public policy. Is there anything more important to debate than what is right or wrong? And those arguments should be open across the entire political spectrum. There is no logical way to contend that religious arguments or lobbying are legitimate on the question of abstinence from nuclear war by nations but not on the question of abstinence from sexual relations by teenagers.
Church Participation in Political Debate
What limitations should churches and their leaders observe when they choose to participate in public debate on political issues?
I emphasize at the outset that I am discussing limits to guide all churches across a broad spectrum of circumstances. I am not seeking to define or defend a Mormon position. As a matter of prudence, our church has confined its own political participation within a far smaller range than is required by the law or the Constitution. Other churches have chosen to assert the full latitude of their constitutional privileges and, in the opinion of some, have even exceeded them.
Where should we draw the line between what is and is not permissible for church and church-leader participation in public policy making?
At one extreme, we hear shrill complaints about political participation by any persons whose political views are attributable to religious beliefs or the teachings of their church. The words “blind obedience” are usually included in such complaints. Complaints there are, but I am not aware of any serious or rational position that would ban religious believers from participation in the political process. The serious challenges concern the participation of churches and church leaders.
Perhaps the root fear of those who object to official church participation in political debates is power: They fear that believers will choose to follow the directions or counsel of their religious leaders. Those who have this fear should remember the celebrated maxim of Jefferson: “Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.” 9 Some may believe that reason is not free when religious leaders have spoken, but I doubt that any religious leader in twentieth-century America has such a grip on followers that they cannot make a reasoned choice in the privacy of the voting booth. In fact, I have a hard time believing that the teachings of religions or churches deprive their adherents of any more autonomy in exerting the rights of citizenship than the teachings and practices of labor unions, civil rights groups, environmental organizations, political parties, or any other membership group in our society.
I submit that religious leaders should have at least as many privileges as any other leaders, and that churches should stand on at least as strong a footing as any other corporation when they enter the public square to participate in public policy debates. The precious constitutional right of petition does not exclude any individual or any group. The same is true of freedom of speech and the press. When religion has a special constitutional right to its free exercise, religious leaders and churches should have more freedom than other persons and organizations, not less.
If churches and church leaders should have full rights to participate in public policy debates, should there be any limits on such participation?
Of course there are limits that apply specially to churches and church officials, as manifest in the United States Constitution’s prohibition against Congress’s making any law respecting an establishment of religion. Some linkages between churches and governments are obviously illegitimate. It would clearly violate this prohibition if a church or church official were to exercise government power or dictate government policies or direct the action of government officials independent of legal procedures or political processes.
Fundamentally, I submit that there is no persuasive objection in law or principle to a church or church leader taking a position on any legislative matter, if it or he or she chooses to do so.
Now, relative to church participation in public debate, when churches or church leaders choose to enter the public sector to engage in debate on a matter of public policy, they should be admitted to the debate and they should expect to participate in it on the same basis as all other participants. In other words, if churches or church leaders choose to oppose or favor a particular piece of legislation, their opinions should be received on the same basis as the opinions offered by other knowledgeable organizations or persons, and they should be considered on their merits.
By the same token, churches and church leaders should expect the same broad latitude of discussion of their views that conventionally applies to everyone else’s participation in public policy debates. A church can claim access to higher authority on moral questions, but its opinions on the application of those moral questions to specific legislation will inevitably be challenged by and measured against secular-based legislative or political judgments. As James E. Wood observed, “While denunciations of injustice, racism, sexism, and nationalism may be clearly rooted in one’s religious faith, their political applications to legislative remedy and public policy are by no means always clear.” 10
Finally, if church leaders were also to exhibit openness and tolerance of opposing views, they would help to overcome the suspicion and resentment sometimes directed toward church or church-leader participation in public debate.
In summary, I have pointed out that many U.S. laws are based on the absolute moral values most Americans affirm, and I have suggested that it cannot be otherwise. I have contended that religious-based values are just as legitimate a basis for political action as any other values. And I have argued that churches and church leaders should be able to participate in public policy debates on the same basis as other persons and organizations, favoring or opposing specific legislative proposals or candidates if they choose to do so.
Politicians sometimes seek to use religion for political purposes, and they sometimes even seek to manipulate churches or church leaders. Ultimately this is always self-defeating. Whenever a church (or a church leader) becomes a pawn or servant of government or a political leader, it loses its status and the credibility it needs to perform its religious mission.
Churches or their leaders can also be the aggressors in the pursuit of intimacy with government. The probable results of this excess have been ably described as “the seduction of the churches to political arrogance and political innocence or even the politicizing of moral absolutes.” 11
The relationship in the world between church and state and between church leaders and politicians should be respectful and distant, as befits two parties who need one another but share the realization that a relationship too close can deprive a pluralistic government of its legitimacy and a divine church of its spiritual mission. Despite that desirable distance, government need not be hostile to religion or pretend to ignore God.

FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE STRUGGLING ON HIS CHRISTMAS EVE DAY, HOW CAN WE HAVE POLICY THAT BENEFITS THE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE? THAT SHOULD BE BIPARTISAN. THAT SHOULDN'T THE REPUBLICAN WERE DEMOCRAT. PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE MOST MARGINAL. THE BIBLE MAKES CLEAR IN THE SCRIPTURES THAT THE PROPHET SAY THAT A NATION WILL BE JUDGED NOT BY ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, ITS MILITARY POWER, ITS CULTURE BUT HOW IT TREATS THE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE. THAT'S THE CHRISTMAS STORY IN THAT DIRECTLY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE DOING.

RIGHT NOW, WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE CRITICAL NATURE OF VOTING RIGHTS. THEIR OPENING EVENT WAS ABOUT HOW VOTING RIGHTS IS REALLY A SACRED CAUSE. A VOTE IS
A SICKER THING. -- IS A SACRED THING. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS ENERGY BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY IS LITERALLY AT STAKE RIGHT NOW. OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN GREAT PERIL. VOTING RIGHTS WILL BE THE TEST OF DEMOCRACY AND I THINK OF FAITH AS WELL. THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS BEING PUT FORWARD TO VOTING RIGHTS IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE LAWS THAT WOULD OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF FREE AND FAIR LOCAL ELECTIONS. WE ARE FACING, LIKE WE HAVEN'T SINCE 1860, A CRISIS IN DEMOCRACY WHERE EVERYTHING NOW IS AT STAKE. A NUMBER OF FAITH LEADERS ARE SAYING THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA OF PUBLIC LIFE RIGHT NOW, TO SECURE VOTING RIGHTS. BASED ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE BIBLE WHERE IT SAYS GOD CREATED ALL OF US IN GOD'S IMAGE, IN GOD'S LIKENESS, THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. DO WE BELIEVE WE ARE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD, EQUALLY MADE IN THE IMAGE? IF SO, VOTER SUPPRESSION, TO DENY A VOTE TO SOMEONE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR SKIN COLOR FOR EXAMPLE IS AN INSULT ON THE IMAGE OF GOD. IT IS THROWING IT AWAY. IT'S NOT JUST A POLITICAL ISSUE BUT A FAITH ISSUE AS WELL. YOU WILL SAVE MOBILIZATION OF FAITH COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS BECAUSE THAT IS PROTECTING THE IMAGE OF GOD IN EACH AND EVERY CITIZEN.

YOU HEARD SOME STORIES IN THE LAST SHOW ABOUT PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES ARE IN GREAT DANGER. THERE IS -- THEY ARE PROPOSING CHILDCARE FOR MOTHERS WHO WANT TO WORK. IT'S EDUCATION FOR ALL OUR KIDS. THE CHILD TAX CREDIT WHICH HAS TURNED POVERTY AROUND BUT IS EXPIRED NOW BECAUSE THE BILL BACK BETTER HAS NOT PASSED YET. THESE THINGS ARE CRITICAL IN THE BILL ADDRESSES THE -- ADDRESSES THEM DIRECTLY. MOST BILLS IN WASHINGTON AREN'T ALWAYS SO CRITICAL BUT THIS ONE IS. IT ADDRESSES THOSE WHO ARE POOREST. THE BUILD BACK BETTER BILL REALLY NEEDS TO PASS AND THEN I THINK VOTING RIGHTS BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY IN THE COUNTRY. BY MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY WHICH IS COMING UP SOON, VOTING RIGHTS MUST TAKE CENTER STAGE AND IT SHOULD BE A BIPARTISAN PASSING OF VOTING RIGHTS. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE.

FIRST OF ALL, OFTEN SENATORS ARE NOT CLOSE TO THOSE WHO ARE POOR. THEY DON'T SEE THEIR FACES OR THEIR LIVES AND WHEN YOU ARE CLOSER TO THOSE FAMILIES,
YOU SEE THE KNEE THAT IS THERE. I AM NOT AGAINST MEANS TESTING IN TERMS OF FAMILIES WHO MOST NEED THIS. THAT'S WHERE THE FOCUS SHOULD BE. WORK REQUIREMENTS WOULD PUT POOR PEOPLE BACK INTO POVERTY. PEOPLE DON'T WORK BECAUSE OF DISABILITIES IN ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS. THE FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE POOREST AND MOST VULNERABLE IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD DO. YOU CANNOT REALLY -- LET'S BE ACCOUNTABLE. SENATOR MANCHIN VOTED FOR A MILITARY SPENDING BILL. IT WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE BUILD BACK BETTER BILL. WHY IS THERE A VOTE FOR VERY EXPENSIVE, OFTEN CORRUPT MILITARY SPENDING AND NOT FOR THIS. THERE IS A CONTRADICTION HERE AND I WANT SENATOR MANCHIN TO KNOW AND BE CLOSE TO THOSE FAMILIES IN WEST VIRGINIA WHO NEED THIS HELP. AND WHETHER SOMEBODY WHO IS MAKING $400,000 SHOULD GET IT, THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION BUT IT HAS TO BE DIRECTED AT THE POOREST FAMILIES. BECAUSE HE IS NOT PASSING THIS BILL, FAMILIES HAVE LOST THEIR CHILD TAX CREDIT BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL. YOU CANNOT DO THAT. YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THOSE FAMILIES IN YOUR STATE WHO ARE IN DESPERATE NEED FOR THIS KIND OF HELP. SO LET'S DO THAT THAT THE FIRST OF THE YEAR.

THANK YOU, C-SPAN. I WANT TO CHALLENGE REVEREND WALLACE ON A PARTICULAR THAT'S NEVER ADDRESSED BY THE DIOCESE THESE DAYS. IN THE GLOBAL SENSE, PEOPLE ARE TALKING
ABOUT IMMIGRATION BUT WHAT THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IS THE CARTELS, THE CORRUPTION AND THE U.S. COMPLICITY WITH THOSE CARTELS. WHAT WE SEE IS THEIR URBAN CITIES BEING CORRUPTED AND BEING CONTROLLED UNDER ARMED GANGS, THOUSANDS OF OUR CHILDREN ARE BEING KILLED IN THE STREETS AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNSAFE. MY CHALLENGE TO THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS, DECADES AGO, THERE WAS A WITNESS WITHIN LATIN AMERICA WHERE THE CHRISTIAN TRINITY CAME FORWARD AND STOOD SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN LET THEM HAVE THEIR LANDS USURPED BY THE CARTELS. WHERE ARE YOU NOW? THEY NEED YOU. THE FACT IS, WITH THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION THAT'S BEEN MADE AN OPEN BORDERS, RATHER THAN SAFETY AND PRESERVATION OF TRADITIONAL LAND -- HOST: LET'S GET A RESPONSE.

THAT'S TRUE. CHRISTIANS HAVE STOOD ALONGSIDE PEOPLE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. MANY ARE STILL DOING THAT STUFF I CERTAINLY FAVOR THAT. I HAVE -- WE HAVE BEEN THREATENED
BY GANGS OWN CITIES AND TOWNS BUT IMMIGRATION IS HOW WE WELCOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THOSE GANGS WERE IMPACTED BY GLOBAL WARMING WHICH IS MADE THEIR LAND IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM. THEY COME HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE DESPERATE SO WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE FOREIGN POLICY FOR IMMIGRATION WHICH BRINGS PEOPLE IN. NOBODY IS FOR OPEN BORDERS BUT WELCOMING A STRANGER, WELCOME THE IMMIGRANT IS A CHRISTIAN VALUE AND ITS CLEAR IN ALL THE SCRIPTURES SO HOW DO WE WELCOME THE IMMIGRANT AT THE SAME TIME CLEAR -- STAND CLEARLY AGAINST THE CARTELS AND GANGS. I HAVE WORKED AGAINST A GANGS IN THE U.S. FOR A LONG TIME AND FRIENDS OF MINE ARE DOING THAT AROUND THE WORLD WILL STOP WE SHOULD STAND AGAINST THOSE GANGS AND ALONGSIDE THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING. AT THE SAME TIME, JESUS SAYS HOW YOU TREAT THE STRANGER, THE IMMIGRANT, IS HOW YOU TREAT ME. THERE IS A BIG QUESTION THERE ABOUT TREATING IMMIGRANTS THE WAY WE TREAT CHRIST HIMSELF.

I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD FAVOR SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE EXTREMES. I REALLY THINK THERE ARE TWO LIVES AT STAKE HERE. I'M NOT A CATHOLIC IN THE CATHOLIC TRADITION, THERE IS A CONSISTENT ETHIC OF LIFE WHERE HUMAN DIGNITY EXTENDS TO POVERTY , THE DEATH PENALTY AND INCLUDES ABORTION AS WELL. I THINK LATE-TERM ABORTIONS ARE A PROBLEM. I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION TO RAISE. HOW DO YOU BALANCE TO LIVES, WOMAN'S LIFE AND THE LIFE OF THE CHILD? WE HAVE TO BRING THAT TOGETHER AND FIND A VERY COMPASSIONATE SOLUTION. I DON'T WANT TO CRIMINALIZE WHAT IS OFTEN A DESPERATE VERY VULNERABLE CHOICE BY A WOMAN IN GREAT JEOPARDY. AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK LATE-TERM ABORTION IS A VERY REAL PROBLEM AND WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL. THERE IS NO CLEAR WAY FORWARD. SOMETHING THAT PROTECTS THE WOMAN AND THE CHILD IS IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD IN THIS COUNTRY IS SO POLARIZED ON BOTH PRO-LIFE AND PRO-CHOICE THAT WE HAVE MISSED PERHAPS A WAY THAT WOULD BE A MIDDLE GROUND THAT MOST AMERICANS WOULD SUPPORT LATE TERM WORSENS FOR ME AS A MORAL PROBLEM. ALSO THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN. WHY DO WE SUPPORT WOMEN WITH NUTRITION AND HEALTH CARE? THAT REDUCES ABORTION SIGNIFICANTLY. IF WE SUPPORT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN THAT SITUATION, WE COULD REDUCE ABORTIONS ON BOTH SIDES BE IN FAVOR OF REDUCING ABORTION SUBSTANTIALLY WITHOUT CRIMINALIZING A WOMAN'S VULNERABLE AND DESPERATE CHOICE WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE FACING NOW.

GOT GRANDPARENTS RAISING CHILDREN. I LIVE CLOSE TO CASINOS IN MISSISSIPPI. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FLOODED IN THE CASINOS. THEY HAVE HAD EXTRA MONEY. IF I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE, 95% OF THE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING CARS ON THE ROAD THAT ARE UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD. I DRIVE A 20-YEAR-OLD VEHICLE.

THE PROBLEM IS THE VERY RELIABLE DATA SHOWS THAT FAMILIES ARE SPENDING CHILD TAX CREDITS ON GROCERIES, ON DIAPERS, ON THINGS THEY CRITICALLY NEED. THERE
IS LOTS OF DATA. IT'S NOT TRUE THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SENT JUST SPENT AT CASINOS OR WHATEVER. IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO THOSE FAMILIES AND I AM, ALL THE GROUPS THAT I WORK WITH ARE WORKING WITH THOSE FAMILIES, CATHOLIC CHARITIES FOR EXAMPLE. IT DOESN'T AGREE WITH YOU AT ALL. THEY WORK WITH FAMILIES ALL THE TIME AND THEY SEE HOW THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT FOR SURVIVAL FOR THOSE FAMILIES CHILD CARE, FOOD ON THE TABLE, PAYING FOR YOUR KIDS LUNCHES AND PAYING YOUR RENT OR PAY FOR CHILD CARE. WHAT JOE MANCHIN IS SAYING ISN'T TRUE AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ISN'T TRUE IN THE CATHOLIC CHARITY PEOPLE AND THE SALVATION ARMY PEOPLE, PAUL WORK WITH THE POOR EVERY DAY AND ARE TELLING ME THAT THE MONEY -- IT IS BEING SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS, BY THE SALVATION ARMY, BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BECAUSE WE KNOW THE FAMILIES. THEY ARE CRITICALLY NEEDING THOSE GROCERIES AND THOSE DIAPERS AND THOSE CHILD CARE BILLS. IT'S NOT TRUE IT'S BEING WASTED. THAT'S A MYTH FROM THE RIGHT WING.

YOU RAISE TWO QUESTIONS. ONE IS WITH THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT THE POOR. THERE ARE 2000 VERSES IN THE BIBLE ABOUT THE POOR. IT'S ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE
CARE OF THE POOR, 2000 VERSES SO THAT IS CLEAR IN THE BIBLE. I WISH SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS WOULD READ THEIR BIBLES. SECOND, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GOD'S CREATION. GOD CREATED ALL OF US AND CREATED HUMAN BEINGS TO BE THE STEWARDS TO TAKE CARE OF THE GARDEN AND TAKE CARE GOD'S CREATION. IS VERY BIBLICAL TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CREATION. MANY PEOPLE, MOST SCIENTISTS LEAVE WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. TO TAKE CARE OF GOD'S CREATION MEANS TO DEAL WITH HOW WE, BUYER HUMAN BEHAVIOR, ARE IMPACTING THE CLIMATE AND HOW THAT IS IMPACTING SO MANY THINGS INCLUDING OUR CATASTROPHIC WEATHER AND ALL THE REST. THESE THINGS ARE IN FACT RELATED TO HOW THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING BECAUSE OF OUR HUMAN ACTIVITY AND ARE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS. I THINK THAT IS VERY CLEAR. TO DO WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO WHICH IS TO TAKE CARE OF GOD'S CREATION, WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW WE ARE IMPACTING AND RUINING THE CREATION THAT GOD ASKED US TO TAKE CARE OF. TO FIGHT THAT KIND OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM IS IN FACT WHAT WE SHOULD DO AS GOD'S CHILDREN. WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING GOOD STEWARDS. STEWARDS OF THIS ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS GOD'S CREATION. THE CARE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IS VERY CHRISTIAN AND -- IN BIBLICAL AND IT TAKES OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ENVIRONMENT, FOR THIS WORLD, FOR THIS CREATION VERY SERIOUSLY.

The Role of Religious Ethics in Public Policy
We have to get beyond the 'religion or secularism' dichotomy regarding moral values and to do so some basic points need to be made.

Frank G. Kirkpatrick, Contributor

It is not uncommon these days for some people to regard religion as an unwanted guest when people start discussing social ills and their resolution. They regard the role of religion when it advances a moral position in the public square as poisonous because it is often suspected of seeking to impose that position on everyone else without their consent. Unfortunately some religious bodies have earned this suspicion because of their attempts to control the public dimension through an enforced and reactionary moral code. Wars have been fought over religious ideology (even though there were usually more basic political and economic issues at stake which used religious symbolism to mask their real interests). But we have to get beyond the 'religion or secularism' dichotomy regarding moral values and to do so some basic points need to be made.
First, morality is part of every human life and society. No one would claim to live an entirely a-moral life or live in a society without some commonly accepted moral principles guiding its social policies. But morality does not belong solely to people with religious motivations. The power of the ethical is part of every human life. And it can arise from a variety of diverse sources, from religious to secular.
Second, religious conviction, the source of moral values for religious people, takes a variety of forms, even within the same religious tradition. Progressive and fundamentalist Christians, for example, would claim a common religious tradition but reach quite different moral positions on issues such as homosexuality, the limits of the free market, the rights of women, health care, and pacifism vs. just war. And of course there are multiple religious traditions, from those accepting Abrahamic monotheism, to, among others, Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Baha'i, Unitarian, Confucian, Native American, and Wiccan forms of religion. There are also multiple shades of secularism, from the aggressively atheistic to the milder forms of agnosticism. So to rail against religiously grounded morality is like railing against the weather. It doesn't specify the issues at stake. Weather is too general a term and does not help us to know what particular climatological conditions we are concerned with. Religions and religiously inspired morality came in a variety of forms and expressions. And third, the religious voice has as much right to speak in the democratic public square as any other voice. As the First Amendment reminds us, in addition to no establishment of religion, no restrictions (save for the public safety) shall be placed in the way of the free exercise of religious convictions.
So where does this leave us? Back in the public square where each individual and group gets a chance to articulate its moral vision regarding issues of public concern. There are many issues, of course, that are of concern only within religious communities: e.g., the right of women to be ordained, the obligation to be baptized before gaining a vote in a congregation's affairs, who has the right to read the Torah scroll, and so forth. There are other issues that are central to the development of public policy, such as the civil rights of women and gay persons to be treated equally under the laws of the nation, the justice of which are also of concern to religious communities. Most religions have an interest in issues of justice and the social welfare of the nations in which they find a home. And as participants in the political affairs of those nations their members have a right to speak for what they regard as the moral dimension of public policy. They have no more but no less a right to try to persuade people of different convictions that their prescription for public policy is the best available for advancing the common social good. And the means of persuasion are those available to all members of the polity: namely, politics, persuasion, and the passage of laws that have secure sufficient support in legislatures. If you don't like the ethical positions of a religious group, provide an alternative moral position. You can't beat a particular moral value with an a-moral value since values are inherently moral. If you don't like the moral values of a particular religious group, challenge them with some of your own.
The first step toward a healthy robust democracy is to identify those public issues whose resolution will positively affect the common good. The second step is to marshal all the resources necessary to advance that resolution. Among those resources will be the moral voices of religious as well as non-religious individuals and communities. Often some religious voices will have more in common with secular voices than they will with other voices within their own religious tradition. But that is as it should be: a multitude of voices from a variety of moral convictions, coalescing around a common moral conviction that seeks to shape the best possible policies for the common weal. Let moral values compete for the allegiance of the electorate and may the most persuasive value win.

I have an example from the Slovak countryside. Public policy making - especially stages related to problem initiation, estimation, and policy selection - is influenced by local elites. And priests can play a leading role in these processes. Furthermore, in some cases there is a clear religious cleavage - quite often between Roman Catholics and Protestants - and for instance if majority of municipal population belongs to the Catholics, usually not only majority of local political representation belongs to the same religious group but also decision making is strongly influenced by this fact. We conducted a research in this field quite recently but, unfortunately, the results are published only in Slovak:  CHORVAT, T. (ed.) (2011).

Hi,
today Hungarian politics represents an interesting example for the case, which  is worth some evaluation. Since 2010, we have had a formally people's party and christian democrat coalition on government. with the support of the christian democrats, the government has a two-third majority, first time since the transition period of the country. this means they don't need any support of the other parliamentarian parties for any constitutional changes either. radical changes are going on, mainly in the direction of centralization, budget constrain, socialist-like economic and conservative political changes, but i wouldn't like to evaluate them now.
what I consider relevant issues from your point, for instance, how the regulation of the concept of 'family' has altered (one woman-one man-children, e.g. no gay marriage), how the concept of 'human being' has become included in the new basic law (implicit border against abortus). these are regulated in laws.
some changes are of lower legal status. for instance the change of the Hungarian national basic educational plan (for primary and secondary schools). obligatory religion class has been implemented, instead of which parents can only chose ethics. however, the centrally planned content of this ethics class contains lots of degrading, traditional concepts of women and their role in society.
if u're interested in this, i can look for some articles on this in English.

We are currently exploring a natural setting to investigate whether religious preferences have an influence on voting decisions (paper is not finished yet but I add a preliminary table).
We have the possibility to identify religious preferences for different Christian (Protestants and Catholics) because we use Swiss referenda and they represent preference rankings of the issue presented in a referendum against the status quo (see https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230751326_Evaluating_the_median_voter_model%27s_explanatory_power ). There is a variation in Swiss cantons regarding their share of  Catholics and Protestants. In some cantons there is a clear Catholic majority whereas in other cantons Catholics are in a minority.
If religious preferences play a role for real voting decisions today, we would expect that Catholics tend to follow Catholic preferences. Similarly, Protestants should follow Protestant preferences. The attached table shows that if the religious groups have the same preferences, then there are no large differences between catholic and protestant cantons. However, when catholic and protestant preferences diverge, there is a strong difference in difference effect, i.e. we observe divergence in voting results.
These are just some very preliminary results. I suppose that we will have a first paper draft by the end of summer and I will then post it here. If you have already comments or questions on the attached results, just write a comment.

First question is: are we talking about religious influence or influence of religious organisations. Religious influence is part of decision-makers personal characteristics, that will not be visible to others but for sure they will strongly influence ones position in policy advocacy (for sure in "women issues").
If the question is about the influence of religious organisations, than the influence is rather indirect (by advertising to the believers for whom to vote or who said smart things in certain issues - priests became opinion makers in this sense). Church can also publicly (via own newspapers, radio or TV program) advertise its position. So from this perspective religion will affect policy decisions in any case. However in most of the cases we are not able to recognise it because the influence is indirect or sub-conscious (in this it will be hard to measure).

Dear David and Uros,
First thank you very much for your insightful comments and files. I am in the very beginning of this paper. But one thing, i like you share that religion has played the main role for creating Pakistan and Bangladesh was part of Pakistan until 1971. We got our independence in 1971 with the help of India. During in the 1971 war, many people in Bangladesh  form Al Badar, Al Shams , Razakar Bahini in support of Pakistani Military. There main argument was India is breaking Muslim brotherhood, means Pakistan and will make Bangladesh a colony. These groups killed intellectuals people to destroy the nation. I will request you to read my thesis , page 27 to know details about religion and politics issues in Bangladesh.

Dear Zahid,
Your last explanation changes the perspective now. Before the question was about the influence of religion/religious organisations on policies. But now you are much more talking about politics. I am not familiar with the situation of 1971 Bangladesh and also understanding of the religion changes with location (western hemisphere pretends that religion is separated from public sphere  while Islam somehow understand that everything is Allah's will). However, killing people according to my interpretation of what i know about Islam is not Allah's will in any case.
So my suggestion would be that you limit yourself to the question of religious influence on women’s issues (which is about policy) or you discuss about politics and religion (which Bangladesh independence is influenced by) - however i would suggest that you stress the difference among religions and explain how in Islam society is understood, in western perspective we often forget about the fact that Islamic countries are based on religion and not on technocratic rationality (Allah's will is above and in everything - however some groups, as said, misunderstand and misuse this).

Hi, as promised in July, we have managed to finish a working paper which directly explores the influence of religious preferences on voting outcomes. Here is a link to the paper: http://ideas.repec.org/p/cra/wpaper/2013-20.html.
We show that religious preferences still matter today for actual voting decisions by exploiting a particularily interesting setting. In Switzerland, two key church institutions - the Conference of Swiss Bishops (CSB) and the Federation of Protestant Churches (FPC) - make public recommendations on how to vote for certain referenda. We leverage this unique situation to directly measure religious organizations' power to shape human decision making. We employ an objective measure of voters' commitment to their religious organization to determine whether they are more likely to vote in line with this organization's recommendations. We find that voting recommendations do indeed matter, implying that even in a secularized world, religion plays a crucial role in voting decisions. The quantitative effects are relatively large: on policy topics where church organizations try to exercise power, over one fourth of actual voting behavior can be explained by the leverage provided by a higher share of the respective congregation.
We think that our study makes a valuable contribution to the power literature, which has struggled in its attempts to quantify the power of churches. It also sheds new light on the behavioral implications of the social or integrative power of loyalty and identification.
Kindly let me know your thoughts.

Public policy making is for the welfare of the people .The end is to carry out the maximum the good of the maximum people.
Creation of the policy makers have to keep the above facts into consideration & this demands a moral code & ethics of the creators of policy .In my humble way i feel that whatever being religion,it helps every human being to establish a moral code of conduct & the way of good living life according to the Norms & thinking of the person concerned .
In this light  we can not affort to establish a dogma of religion on any human being but at the same time the governing principle of any religion of us the guideline of thinking for carrying out the policy in right direction .

Like so many, I am shocked and saddened at seeing war break out in Europe. My thoughts – and those of the ResearchGate team – are with the people of Ukraine and everyone affected.
ResearchGate is an international company, whose purpose is to enable scientists across the world to work together openly and collaboratively, regardless of borders or nationality. We have people from over 40 countries on our staff of around 200, and being based in Berlin, we are profoundly aware of the human cost of conflicts, the echoes of which have shaped and scarred our home city. We join with the international community in condemning the actions of the Russian state.
We have been asking ourselves: What can we do?
From today, we will offer free advertising space worth $2.5 million on our network to humanitarian organizations working to respond to the crisis. ResearchGate benefits from over 50 million visitors every month, and we hope this initiative can help raise funds and awareness for those organizations that are having direct impact and need support.

HI,
I've got four coders who coded some classroom observation data (all are categorical). I need to conduct an inter-rater reliability check across the four coders.
It seems that Cohen's Kappa can only be used in the case of two raters? And ICC (intraclass correlation) can only be used for testing numerical data?
It is possible to calculate the agreement percentage using the method specified here (https://www.statisticshowto.com/inter-rater-reliability/ ), but it seems to be not as rigid as the other methods?
Thank you!

I  ran a CFA with a 200 sample size to test convergent and discriminant  validities. After removing 4 items, convergent validity seems to be  established as all standardised factor loadings are above 0.5 and fit  indices are acceptable. The components have good reliability.
I  ran a CFA with a 200 sample size to test convergent and discriminant  validities. After removing 4 items, convergent validity seems to be  established as all standardised factor loadings are above 0.5 and fit  indices are acceptables. The components have good reliability.
However,  when running a Chi-square test for discriminant validity, the  difference is 3.05 and the CFA says the correlation between the  components is 0.91.
If I add 4 error covariances (3 are within-component and 1 between component),  the correlation becomes 0.88 and  Chi-square  difference becomes 6.5.
Any suggestions?

I often come across so many paid journals indexed in SCOPUS, which are publishing unreliable/unprofessional research papers by taking money from scholars and academicians. Scopus database has been looked upon as a source of critical research from around the world. Such journals should not be a part of Scopus database. Isn't this time to address this issue?

Public opinion plays a significant role in a democracy. Crucial in decoding the process of public policy, from its planning to implementation, it demystifies the working politics behind it.

Rules matter. It appears a simple claim, but we often neglect its myriad implications for politics.

Religion and the Public Sphere

Introduction
Religion in the public sphere (hereafter RPS) refers to the intermingling of religion with issues of politics, governance, the state, and institutions of civil society. That it is a topic of interest to academics across the humanities and social sciences is itself a reflection of the gradual separation—over many centuries—of religion from public affairs in modern, largely secular, societies of the West. The readmission of religion to the public sphere raises several key issues, not least around secularization (and the extent to which religion has been disassociated from public life and policymaking), but also about the resurgence of religious conservatism as an attempt to close the gap opened up in modernity between religion and politics. The renewal of interest in religion as a social, cultural, and political force—a feature of what some are now calling the “post-secular”—has proved especially contentious in diverse, multifaith liberal democracies, where attempts to divorce religion from public life can be seen to undermine the inclusion of religious minorities and the expression of religious identities. Academic interest in the intersection between religion and public life has been concentrated largely among sociologists (of religion) and political scientists. The revival of religion in the public sphere confounds a widely held assumption among modern social and political theorists; namely, that religion would wither as a feature of public life as societies underwent a process of modernization—and where religion continued to exist at all, it would be confined to the private, domestic sphere and that of individual belief. Particular interest has been generated by controversies that expose the vexed nature of attempts to limit or bar the admission of religion in public life; such as the 1962 ruling by the US Supreme Court removing prayer from public schools (in the spirit of the First Amendment of the US Constitution), or, more recently, the banning of religious headscarves (and other “ostentatious” symbols of religion) from public schools in 2004 by the French authorities (in the spirit of secularism—or laïcité) enshrined in Article 1 of the French Constitution). Attempts to undo the “wall of separation” between religion and state first envisioned by Thomas Jefferson can be seen in attempts by American religious conservatives to overturn “progressive” legislation on abortion, gay rights, and same-sex marriage. Recent opposition in the United Kingdom by Muslim conservatives to LGBT education in public schools illustrates the sensitivities and tensions surrounding expressions of RPS in contemporary Western societies.
Textbooks
There are no textbooks devoted solely to religion and the public sphere. Instead, most textbooks in the sociology of religion devote some space to coverage of RPS. Many draw upon case studies related to RPS in regard of specific sociohistorical formations, especially modern nation-states. Roberts and Yamane 2016 and Johnstone 2016 discuss specific instances in the United States when religion enters the public sphere. Davie 2013 highlights the re-emergence—in post-secular European societies—of religion in public life, as an expression of religious minority identities and rights. Such discussion illustrates the tension produced when religion enters the public sphere, not least because it confounds assumptions that secularism inevitably follows modernization. Furseth and Repstad 2006 remind readers that the privatization of religion and its splitting-off from public life and the political realm extends only as far as modern industrialized countries of the West—a feature underlined by the fact that, until relatively recently, discussions of RPS were couched in terms of “church-state” relations, a distinction largely unknown outside the Christian world. RPS takes a variety of forms. Furseth and Repstad 2006 employ the following nomenclature as an organizing principle: (1) societies in which there exists an official religion of the state; (2) societies in which there is said to exist a “civil religion,” such as the United States, where all members of society, whatever their faith, are united in a common set of values and beliefs; (3) “public religion,” whereby grass-roots religious movements attempt to contribute to public debate on a whole range of social, political, economic, and moral issues; (4) instances where religion operates explicitly as a vehicle to legitimize political power; and (5) “political religion” or “religious nationalism,” by which the nation is sacralized as an object of popular mythology—totalitarian regimes such as the USSR and Nazi Germany being cases in point. Aldridge 2007 provides illuminating discussion of the latter alongside applications of the concept of “civil religion.” Christiano, et al. 2015 discuss RPS in expressions of fundamentalism following 9/11, as well as in historical attempts by Quaker women to exert religious influence in their opposition to slavery and campaigns for temperance, prison reform, and female suffrage.
Aldridge, Alan. 2007. Religion in the contemporary world: A sociological introduction. 2d ed. Cambridge, UK: Polity.
RPS is dealt with in chapter 7, providing a useful and lively introduction to successful and failed applications of “civil religion”—in the United States, Canada, and Northern Ireland; and to “political religion” in the case of the former USSR and Nazi Germany. The third edition, published in 2013, includes a discussion of the deeply contested nature of the European Union as an “unfinished project” of pan-European cultural identity.
Christiano, Kevin J., William H. Swatos Jr., and Peter Kivisto. 2015. Sociology of religion: Contemporary developments. 3d ed. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield.
RPS is discussed briefly (in chapter 7) in reference to women’s exclusion from public life and leadership roles in organized religion; but also in terms of their influence upon the public sphere through, for example, Quaker women’s ministerial activity and involvement in social reform movements. Provides insightful discussion (in chapter 9) of the mixture of religion and politics by the Christian Right in the United States following 9/11.
Davie, Grace. 2013. The sociology of religion: A critical agenda. 2d ed. Los Angeles: SAGE.
RPS is discussed—as part of the book’s “critical agenda”—as central to debates around secularization, modernization, fundamentalism, and identity. Long-term processes of secularization are discussed as occurring simultaneous to the revival of RPS. Provides useful discussion of the ways in which religious-cultural identities have begun to permeate the public sphere, not least in France, where the assertion of minority religious identities has served to undermine the principle of laïcité.
Furseth, Inger, and Pal Repstad. 2006. An introduction to the sociology of religion: Classical and contemporary perspectives. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate.
Contains a chapter on RPS (chapter 6) that is helpful in providing a panoramic overview of the field. Introduces readers to different expressions of RPS using a taxonomy (above) to illustrate its particular forms. Useful for those new to the field, especially in mapping the terrain, introducing theoretical and empirical studies, and providing suggestions for further research.
Johnstone, Ronald L. 2016. Religion in society: A sociology of religion. 8th ed. Abingdon, UK: Routledge.
Covers the relationship between religion and voting behavior in the United States and the influence of religion—as an attempt to legislate morality—upon the formation of public policy, where abortion, prayer in public schools, and Prohibition provide a focus for case studies. The blurring of religion and politics is discussed in a chapter on fundamentalism (chapter 8), and the influence of religion upon the economy is discussed in chapter 9.
Roberts, Keith A., and David Yamane. 2016. Religion in sociological perspective. 6th ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.
Coverage of RPS is discussed in reference to secularization (chapter 13). Includes a section devoted to Bellah’s notion of “civil religion,” examples from the United States of when religion has entered the public sphere, and illustration of when private beliefs intersect with wider public policy. The text is accompanied by online instructor resources and “critical thinking” questions to stimulate student engagement.

Alright, I have this question: "How does religion shape public policy?" It seems like a pretty big topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what public policy is. Public policy refers to the laws, regulations, and actions that governments take to address issues and govern society. So, it's essentially how a government decides to manage various aspects of public life.

Now, religion is a set of beliefs, practices, and moral values centered around the supernatural or spiritual. Different religions have different teachings and principles that guide the behavior and actions of their followers.

So, how does religion influence public policy? I think there are several ways this can happen.

One way is through the personal beliefs of policymakers. Many politicians have religious backgrounds, and their faith may influence their views on certain issues. For example, a politician who is strongly Catholic might oppose abortion based on their religious beliefs, and this could affect the policies they support or create.

Another way is through religious organizations getting involved in politics. Churches, mosques, synagogues, and other religious institutions often have positions on various social and political issues. They may advocate for certain policies or even lobby lawmakers to support their views.

Religious voters also play a role. In many countries, including the United States, religious groups can be powerful voting blocs. Politicians may cater to these groups to gain their support during elections, which can influence the policies they promote.

Moreover, in some countries, religion is directly entwined with the government. For example, in Saudi Arabia, the government follows Sharia law, which is based on Islamic principles. So, in such cases, religion directly shapes public policy.

But let's consider more secular societies, like in Europe or Canada. Even in these places, religion can still influence public policy, albeit to a lesser extent. For instance, debates on issues like same-sex marriage, euthanasia, or stem cell research often involve religious perspectives.

I think it's also important to note that religion can provide a moral framework that informs public policy. Many laws are based on ethical considerations, and religion often provides a set of ethics for its followers. So, policies that align with religious morals may gain support from religious communities.

On the other hand, there's also the concept of separation of church and state, which is enshrined in some constitutions, like the U.S. Constitution. This principle aims to prevent any one religion from dominating public policy and to ensure religious freedom for all.

Despite this separation, religion can still indirectly influence public policy through the avenues I mentioned earlier—through the beliefs of policymakers, religious organizations' advocacy, and the voting preferences of religious constituents.

Let me try to think of some specific examples to illustrate this.

Take the issue of abortion. In many countries, the stance on abortion is heavily influenced by religious beliefs. For instance, the Catholic Church is strongly against abortion, and in countries with large Catholic populations, this can translate into more restrictive abortion laws.

Another example is same-sex marriage. Many religions have traditional views on marriage being between a man and a woman, and this has led to religious groups opposing the legalization of same-sex marriage in some places.

Conversely, in some instances, religion has driven positive social change. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States was greatly supported by religious leaders and organizations, such as Martin Luther King Jr., who was a Baptist minister.

So, religion can shape public policy in both conservative and progressive ways, depending on the issue and the religious beliefs involved.

I should also consider how public policy can affect religion. For example, laws regarding religious freedom, education, and taxation can all impact religious institutions and practices.

In some countries, religious minorities may face discrimination or suppression through public policy, while in others, policies are designed to protect and accommodate religious diversity.

It's a two-way street, really. Religion influences public policy, and public policy influences religion.

Wait a minute, maybe I should look up some academic sources to get a better understanding of this relationship.
