So I have this question: "What causes long-term climate change?" Hmm, climate change is a big topic, and when they say "long-term," I guess they mean changes that happen over many years or even centuries, not just seasonal changes or short-term fluctuations. I need to think about what factors can affect the Earth's climate on such a large scale.

First off, I know that climate is different from weather. Weather is what happens day to day, but climate is the average pattern over time. So, long-term climate change would be significant shifts in these average patterns.

I remember hearing about the greenhouse effect. That's where certain gases in the atmosphere trap heat and keep the Earth warm. Without them, the Earth would be much colder. But if these gases increase too much, it can lead to global warming, which is a type of climate change.

So, one cause could be changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Human activities, like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture, release more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which can lead to long-term climate change.

But I think there are other natural factors that can cause long-term climate change as well. For example, variations in the Earth's orbit around the sun, known as Milankovitch cycles, can affect how much solar radiation reaches the Earth's surface. Over thousands of years, these cycles can lead to ice ages and warmer periods.

Also, solar activity itself can vary. The sun goes through cycles of higher and lower energy output, which can influence the Earth's climate. Although these changes are relatively small, over long periods, they might have a noticeable effect.

Volcanic eruptions are another natural factor. When volcanoes erupt, they can release大量灰尘和气溶胶进入大气层，这些物质可以反射太阳光，导致全球温度短期下降。但如果火山活动非常频繁或剧烈，可能会对长期气候产生影响。

还有地壳运动，比如板块构造的移动，可以改变地形和海洋流动，进而影响气候模式。例如，山脉的形成可以阻挡风流，影响降水分布。

此外，地球的轴倾斜角度也在缓慢变化，这会影响不同地区接收到的太阳辐射量，从而影响气候。

我觉得生物活动 also plays a role in long-term climate change. For instance, large-scale changes in vegetation can alter the reflectivity of the Earth's surface and affect carbon dioxide levels.

Wait, maybe I should organize my thoughts better. Let me list out the possible causes:

1. Greenhouse gas concentrations (both natural and human-induced)

2. Changes in solar radiation (solar cycles, Milankovitch cycles)

3. Volcanic activity

4. Geological activities (plate tectonics, mountain building)

5. Biological processes (vegetation changes, carbon cycle)

Is there anything else? Maybe changes in ocean currents, which can distribute heat around the globe. These currents can be affected by various factors, including temperature and salinity changes, as well as geological shifts.

Oh, and asteroid impacts. Major impacts can throw debris into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and causing temporary climate cooling, sometimes called "impact winter." While rare, this can be a significant factor in long-term climate change.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stretching a bit there. But it's true that such events have occurred in the past and had profound effects on the Earth's climate.

Now, I need to prioritize these factors and see which ones are most significant in causing long-term climate change.

First, greenhouse gas concentrations seem to be a major player. We've seen in recent decades how human activities have increased CO2 levels, leading to global warming. But naturally, over geological timescales, changes in vegetation and carbon cycles can also affect greenhouse gas levels.

Second, the Milankovitch cycles are well-documented and have been linked to glacial and interglacial periods over the past million years or so. These orbital variations slowly change the amount of solar energy received at different latitudes and seasons, which can trigger climate changes.

Third, volcanic activity can have both short-term and long-term effects. While individual eruptions cause temporary cooling, sustained volcanic activity over long periods could have more lasting impacts.

Fourth, geological activities like plate tectonics can alter the positions of continents and oceans, affecting global climate patterns. For example, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama changed ocean currents and is thought to have influenced the onset of recent ice ages.

Fifth, biological processes, especially those involving carbon sequestration, can influence climate over long timescales. For instance, the evolution of photosynthetic life led to a gradual increase in atmospheric oxygen and a decrease in CO2 levels over hundreds of millions of years.

Ocean currents are also crucial, as they transport heat around the planet. Changes in these currents, whether due to temperature, salinity, or geological changes, can significantly impact climate.

Lastly, while asteroid impacts are infrequent, their potential to cause abrupt and drastic climate changes makes them an important factor to consider, especially in the context of Earth's history.

I think it's important to note that these factors often interact with each other in complex ways. For example, changes in solar radiation due to Milankovitch cycles can initiate ice age cycles, which in turn affect greenhouse gas concentrations and ocean currents, leading to feedback loops that amplify the initial climate change.

Similarly, human-induced increases in greenhouse gases can lead to global warming, which might melt polar ice caps, altering albedo and further increasing warming. Or it could affect ocean circulation, potentially leading to more abrupt climate changes.

So, in summary, long-term climate change is caused by a combination of natural processes and human activities. Key natural factors include changes in solar radiation, volcanic activity, geological processes, and biological processes. Human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, have become a significant driver of long-term climate change in recent times.

I should probably look up some specific examples or studies that support these points to make my answer more robust.

Let me consider performing a search to gather more precise information.

## Final Solution
To answer the question "What causes long-term climate change?", we need to consider both natural processes and human activities that influence the Earth's climate over extended periods. Here’s a step-by-step exploration of the key factors:

1. **Greenhouse Gas Concentrations**:
   - **Human-Induced**: Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices increase CO₂, methane, and nitrous oxide, leading to global warming.
   - **Natural**: Changes in vegetation and carbon cycles affect greenhouse gas levels over geological timescales.

2. **Solar Radiation Variations**:
   - **Milankovitch Cycles**: Orbital changes alter the Earth's position and orientation, affecting solar energy distribution and triggering glacial and interglacial periods.
   - **Solar Activity**: Fluctuations in the sun's energy output influence climate, though these changes are relatively small.

3. **Volcanic Activity**:
   - Eruptions release dust and aerosols that reflect sunlight, causing短期冷却。持续的火山活动可能对长期气候有影响。

4. **Geological Activities**:
   - **Plate Tectonics and Mountain Building**: Alter terrain and ocean currents, impacting climate patterns. For example, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama changed ocean currents and influenced recent ice ages.

5. **Biological Processes**:
   - Changes in vegetation affect reflectivity and carbon dioxide levels. The evolution of photosynthetic life has gradually altered atmospheric composition over millions of years.

6. **Ocean Currents**:
   - Distribute heat globally; changes due to temperature, salinity, or geological shifts can significantly impact climate.

7. **Asteroid Impacts**:
   - Rare but can cause abrupt climate changes, such as "impact winter," by throwing debris into the atmosphere and blocking sunlight.

These factors often interact in complex feedback loops. For instance, orbital changes can initiate ice ages, which in turn reduce greenhouse gas levels, further amplifying cooling.

In conclusion, long-term climate change is driven by a combination of natural processes and human activities, with greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation variations, volcanic activity, geological processes, and biological processes being key factors.
