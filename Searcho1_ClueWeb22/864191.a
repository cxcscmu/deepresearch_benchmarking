As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences, but I can certainly help explain how Hinduism began based on historical and scholarly perspectives.

Hinduism is one of the oldest living religions in the world, and its origins are shrouded in antiquity. It doesn't have a single founder or a specific time of origin like many other religions. Instead, it evolved over thousands of years through the synthesis of various beliefs and practices.

The roots of Hinduism can be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished around 2500 BCE in the northwestern region of the Indian subcontinent. Archaeological findings from this period suggest the presence of a religion with concepts that later became integral to Hinduism, such as ritual bathing and fire worship.

Another significant influence came from the Aryans, who migrated into India around 1500 BCE. They brought with them their own religious beliefs and practices, which gradually merged with the existing indigenous traditions. The sacred texts of Hinduism, the Vedas, are believed to have been composed during this time.

Over the centuries, Hinduism continued to evolve, incorporating diverse philosophical and theological ideas. Key developments include the composition of the Upanishads, which explored metaphysical questions; the rise of bhakti movements, which emphasized personal devotion to deities; and the synthesis of various spiritual paths in texts like the Bhagavad Gita.

Today, Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion, characterized by a wide range of beliefs, practices, and deities. It plays a central role in the culture and society of India, where the majority of Hindus live, and has also spread to other parts of the world through migration and conversion.

In summary, Hinduism didn't begin at a particular point in time or through the teachings of a single individual. Instead, it emerged gradually through the intermingling of various cultural and religious traditions over millennia.
