Alright, so I've got this question here: "How does a hypercompetitive environment change the strategic approach for a company?" Hmm, okay, first things first, I need to understand what a hypercompetitive environment is. I think it has something to do with really intense competition, but I should probably look that up to make sure I've got the right definition.

So, I'll start by searching for "hypercompetitive environment definition." Let me write that down.

Hypercompetition
describes competition that is excessive such that it creates inherent instability and necessitates constant disruptive change for firms in the competitive landscape.
strategic management process
is the full set of commitments, decisions, and actions required for a firm to achieve strategic competitiveness and earn above-average return
Average returns
are returns equal to those an investor expects to earn from other investments with a similar amount of risk.
Above-average returns
are returns in excess of what an investor expects to earn from other investments with a similar amount of risk
global economy
is one in which goods, services, people, skills, and ideas move freely across geographic borders.
Factors driving Hyper competition
The emergence of a global economy and technology, specifically rapid technological change, are the two primary drivers of hyper competitive environments and the nature of today's competitive landscape.
Perpetual innovation
a term used to describe how rapidly and consistently new, information-intensive technologies replace older ones.
Strategic flexibility
y is a set of capabilities used to respond to various demands and opportunities existing in a dynamic and uncertain competitive environment.
The industrial organization (I/O) model of above-average returns
the external environment's dominant influence on a firm's strategic actions. The model specifies that the industry or segment of an industry in which a company chooses to compete has a stronger influence on performance than do the choices managers make inside their organizations.76
e I/O model has four underlying assumptions.
1.First, the external environment is assumed to impose pressures and constraints that determine the strategies that would result in above-average returns
2.Second, most firms competing within an industry or within a segment of that industry are assumed to control similar strategically relevant resources and to pursue similar strategies in light of those resources.
3.Third, resources used to implement strategies are assumed to be highly mobile across firms, so any resource differences that might develop between firms will be short-lived.
4.Fourth, organizational decision makers are assumed to be rational and committed to acting in the firm's best interests, as shown by their profit-maximizing behaviors.
The five forces model of competition(how to identify and choose an attractive industry)
is an analytical tool used to help firms find the industry that is the most attractive for them.encompasses several variables and tries to capture the complexity of competition. The five forces model suggests that an industry's profitability (i.e., its rate of return on invested capital relative to its cost of capital) is a function of interactions among five forces: suppliers, buyers, competitive rivalry among firms currently in the industry, product substitutes, and potential entrants to the industry
I/O Model steps
1. Study the external environment, especially the industry environment.
2. Locate an industry with high potential for above- average returns.
3. Identify the strategy called for by the attractive industry to earn above- average returns.
4. Develop or acquire assets and skills needed to implement the strategy.
5. Use the firm's strengths (its developed or acquired assets and skills) to implement the strategy.
Resources
are inputs into a firm's production process, such as capital equipment, the skills of individual employees, patents, finances, and talented managers.
capability
is the capacity for a set of resources to perform a task or an activity in an integrative manner.
Core competencies
are capabilities that serve as a source of competitive advantage for a firm over its rivals.

Home ¬ª Strategic Management ¬ª Hypercompetition
Hypercompetition
Hypercompetition is a relatively new term in strategic management, ¬†coined by Richard D‚ÄôAveni, professor of business strategy at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College, ¬†in his book ‚ÄúHypercompetition: Managing the Dynamics of Strategic Maneuvering.‚Äù In this book he defines hypercompetition as;
‚Äúan environment characterized by intense and rapid competitive moves, in which competitors must move quickly to build advantage and erode the advantage of their rivals.‚Äù Richard D‚ÄôAveni ¬†(1994: 217-218)
Hypercompetition results from the dynamics of strategic maneuvering among global and innovative combatants. It is a condition of rapidly escalating competition based on price-quality positioning, competition to create new know-how and establish first-mover advantage, competition to protect or invade established product or geographic markets, and competition based on deep pockets and the creating of even deeper pockets dalliances. In hypercompetitions the frequency, boldness, and aggressiveness of dynamic movement by the players accelerates to create a condition of constant disequilibrium and change. Market stability is threatened by short product life cycles, short product design cycles, new technologies, frequent entry by unexpected outsiders, repositioning by incumbents, and radical redefinitions of market boundaries as diverse industries merge. In other words, environments escalate toward higher and higher levels of uncertainty, dynamism, heterogeneity of the players, and hostility. ¬†Hypercompetitive behavior is the process of continuously generating new competitive advantages and destroying, obsoleting, or neutralizing the opponent‚Äôs competitive advantage.
It is not just fast-moving, high-tech industries, such as computers, or industries shaken by deregulation, such as the airlines, that are facing this aggressive competition. There is evidence that competition is heating up across the board, even in what once seemed the most sedate industries. From software to soft drinks, from microchips to corn chips, from package delivery services, there are few industries that have escaped hypercompetition.
As Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, commented, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be brutal. When I said a while back that the 1980s were going to be a white-knuckle decade and the 1990s would be even tougher, I may have understated how hard it‚Äôs going to get.‚Äù
There are few industries and companies that have escaped this shift in competitiveness. American corporations have traditionally sought established markets wherein sustainable profits were attainable. They have done so by looking for low or moderate levels of competition. Low and moderate-intensity competition occurs if a company has a monopoly (or quasi monopoly protected by entry barriers) or if competitors implicitly or explicitly collude, allowing each other to ‚Äúsustain‚Äù an advantage in one or more industries or market segments. Collusion‚Äôs or cooperation, while it can be useful in limiting aggressiveness, is limited because there in incentive to cheat on the collusive agreement and gain advantage. Entry and mobility barriers are destroyed by firms seeking the profit potential of industries or segments with low or moderate levels of competition. Gentlemanly agreements to stay out of each others turf fall apart as firms learn how to break the barriers inexpensively. As competition shifts toward higher intensity, companies begin to develop new advantages rapidly and attempt to destroy competitors‚Äô advantages. This leads to a further escalation of competitions into hypercompetition, at which stage companies actively work t string together a series of temporary movers that undermine competitors in an endless cycle of jockeying for position. Just one hypercompetitive player ¬† (often from abroad) is enough to trigger this cycle.
At each point firms press forward to gain new advantages or tear down those of their rivals. This movement, however, takes the industry to faster and more intense levels of competition. The most interesting aspect of this movement is that, as firms maneuver and outmaneuver each other, they are constantly pushing toward perfect competition, where no one has an advantage. However, while firms push toward perfect competition, they must attempt to avoid it because abnormal profits are not at all possible in perfectly competitive markets. ¬† In hypercompetitive markets it is possible to make temporary profits. Thus, even though perfect competition is treated as the ‚Äúequilibrium‚Äù state in static economic models, it is neither a desired nor a sustainable state from the perspective f corporations seeking profits. They would prefer low and moderate levels of competition but often settle for hypercompetitive markers because the presence of a small number of aggressive foreign corporations won‚Äôt cooperate enough to allow the old, more genteel levels of competition that existed in the past.

Hypercompetition, a term first coined in business strategy by Richard D‚ÄôAveni, [1] [2] describes a dynamic competitive world in which no action or advantage can be sustained for long. Hypercompetition is a key feature of the new global digital economy. Not only is there more competition, there is also tougher and smarter competition. It is a state in which the rate of change in the competitive rules of the game are in such flux that only the most adaptive, fleet, and nimble organizations will survive. [3][unreliable source?] Hypercompetitive markets are also characterized by a ‚Äúquick-strike mentality‚Äù to disrupt, neutralize, or moot the competitive advantage of market leaders and important rivals. [3]
Often a hypercompetitive market is triggered by new technologies, new offerings, and falling entry barriers that cause market leaders to be dethroned, causing standards and rules to be in flux. This results in near chaotic competition that confuses management and causes the destruction of the core competencies of established firms. While most firms are blindsided and lose their competitive advantage, other firms find opportunities to enrich themselves through reinvention and rapid escalation of competition. [4]
The empirical evidence for the concept of hypercompetition is somewhat equivocal. McNamara, Vaaler and Devers, Vaaler and McNamara, as well as Lindskov, Sund, and Dreyer, have for example contested the existence of a universal state of hypercompetition. [5] [6] [7] Lindskov, Sund and Dreyer conclude that instead it may be that some industries, regions or time-periods could be associated to hypercompetition, others not. [5]
In D‚ÄôAveni's conceptualization of hypercompetition, the only source of a truly sustainable competitive advantage is a company‚Äôs ability to string together a sequence of temporary advantages. Firms manage their dynamic strategic interactions with competitors by means of frequent movements and counter-movements that maintain a relative position of strength in each of four arenas. [8]
According to D‚ÄôAveni‚Äôs model, competition unfolds in a series of dynamic strategic interactions in four arena‚Äôs: cost/quality, timing and know-how, strongholds, and deep pockets. [8] Each of the four arenas represents different types of competitive advantage. The price/quality arena represents the competitive advantage from product positioning. The timing and know-how arena represents the competitive advantage from tacit and explicit knowledge and the timing of their deployment ‚Äì first movers, fast followers and cautious followers. The strongholds arena represents the competitive advantage from high barriers of entry, but more importantly, from the ability to circumvent, neutralize, and destroy entry barriers. The deep pockets arena represents the competitive advantage from size including financial and political clout.

The Four Arenas[edit]
Price / Quality[edit]
In his book Competitive Strategy, Michael Porter stated that there are only two basic competitive advantages, and thus only two main generic strategies: cost leadership and differentiation, and further, that attempts to achieve both at once will result in doing neither well. [9] Porter assumes a tradeoff between quality and price. [10]
In contrast, D'Aveni takes a dynamic and multidimensional view of price and quality relationships using graphical analysis. By plotting price vs. quality for various marketing strategies, it is possible to plot the movements of different firms, creating a multidimensional view of the overall market. [11] Adding a time dimension to this analysis creates a more dynamic view.
Graphical analysis also reveals strategic groups, if any, that develop around different points on the graph. [12] [13] D'Aveni‚Äôs price-quality mapping not only subsumes Porter's strategic groups, allowing not only for "within-segment positioning" but also "between-segment position", where nearby clusters can begin to directly or indirectly compete with firms that previously were not direct competitors. [13] [12]
Competition in the first arena, price/quality, occurs via seven dynamic strategic interactions: price wars, quality and price positioning, ‚Äúthe middle path‚Äù, ‚Äúcover all niches‚Äù, outflanking and niching, the move toward an ultimate value marketplace, and escaping from the ultimate value marketplace by restarting the cycle. [4]
Based on research using price-quality graphs, some interesting lessons have been learned. Consider the price-quality graph below which shows all of the iPods that were released over a five-year period. This graph illustrates many of the dynamic principles in hypercompetition including movement towards the ultimate value (lower right hand corner), and how Apple built momentum toward it. Apple led the race to the bottom, but planned for the future by inventing the iPhone, which obsolesced the portable music player market. In addition, Apple maintained a full line of iPods that made it difficult to tell which product was stuck in the middle. In a sense, almost all the products were stuck in the middle between two other products.
Even more insights can be found if competitors are plotted on the same graph or if different types of quality are used for the graph. It is preferable to use the primary quality in the eyes of the consumer. Primary quality is determined by what is most important to consumers. Other definitions of quality are considered secondary qualities which can be used to redefine the primary quality and create a new playing field. [4] [12] [14]
Because different segments of a market may view primary quality differently, it is sometimes best to perform price/quality analyses for different segments. For example, the sports car segment of the automobile market primarily values engine performance. Meanwhile, the soccer mom segment primarily values safety; the commuter segment primarily values fuel efficiency; and the luxury segment primarily values brand perception such as product prestige. Surprisingly, reliability is not on this list because it is now table stakes,[clarification needed] and not a point of differentiation.[citation needed]
Also surprisingly, safety features such as seatbelts were not valued when they cost $150 each. But when competitors produced seatbelts in such volume that they only cost $10 each, seatbelts became much more important, eventually being mandated by the government. So, it is not only the consumers that define perceived quality, but competition and regulations can affect it as well.[citation needed]
Timing and know-how[edit]
The second arena for hypercompetition is the timing and know-how arena. [8] This arena represents the true chess game of innovation and imitation that underlies product evolution and the successful adaptations firms undertake to stay in the game. [13] While all of the arenas incorporate an explicit hypercompetitive view of sequential advantages, this arena's focus on moves and countermoves implicitly explores the ability to manage and organize various types of resources dynamically.
This arena of competition is based on knowledge and the timing with which it is deployed. A firm that has the skills to be a 'first mover' and arrives first in a market has achieved a timing advantage. [8] A knowledge advantage includes the technology underlying the product, knowledge about customers, the skills that underlie each stage of a firm's value-added chain, as well as the specialized knowledge that underlies culture, and expert knowledge of physical and digital assets. This knowledge may be tacit or explicit. In addition, the knowledge may be the know-how associated with a new method of doing business that allows the firm to create an entirely new product, market, service or business model. [13] This arena also implies that all knowledge, even the skills to invent a new business model and the skills needed to be a first-mover or follower, erodes with hypercompetitive maneuvering.[citation needed]
The first level is the static resource-based view. The second level represents hypercompetition‚Äôs contribution to dynamic capabilities. The third level is hypercompetition‚Äôs contribution to knowledge-based theories of competitive advantage.
D'Aveni identifies six dynamic strategic interactions that drive competition in this arena:
capturing first-mover advantages;
imitation and improvement by followers;
creating impediments to imitation;
overcoming the impediments;
transformation or leapfrogging;
downstream vertical integration. [8]
Timing moves are predicated on neutralizing or destroying the opponent's advantages. A first mover tries to create impediments on imitation by subsequent followers. The followers replicate the leader's resource base and overcome these impediments. They gradually become better and faster at imitation [9] until the knowledge becomes commoditized or "table stakes ".
The first mover then adopts a strategy of leapfrogging innovations, building on large technological advantages that require entirely new resources and know-how. These moves become increasingly more expensive and risky for the firm. Eventually because of the speed with which imitators catch up, the leapfrogging strategy becomes unsustainable. [9]
The three major conclusions to take away from the timing and know-how arena are:
Speed. This cycle of dynamic strategic interactions is speeding up, driving more frequent transformations, leapfrog moves, and downstream vertical integration. Knowledge/know-how is commoditizing faster and first-mover advantages are eroding more quickly as well. [15][unreliable source?][4]
Aggressiveness. Even though many of these timing and know-how advantages appear in Porter's five forces as static barriers to entry, hypercompetition urges potential entrants to use these advantages to destroy, neutralize or moot the strengths of rivals. Porter‚Äôs model represents established firms on the defense.D‚ÄôAveni‚Äôs model represents outsiders seeking to get in or to grow their positions. [13]
Imitation and Improvement. Although imitation is frequently discussed, D'Aveni's addition of the word "improvement" changes the playing field. Whereas many authors only discuss pure imitation (knockoffs), D'Aveni notes that it is often the improvements made by imitators that change the nature of the game. [13]
Strongholds[edit]
The third arena is based on strongholds ‚Äì a firm's product and geographic position best protected by barriers to entry and substitutes. These barriers include economies of scale, product differentiation, capital investments, switching costs, access to distribution channels, cost advantages other than scale, and government policies. [8]
Firms compete for different positions in their competitive space. A competitive space can be mapped using a two dimensional grid based on product (rows) and geography (columns). A firm and its rivals can be visualized by plotting them on this grid. If any firm takes significant market share in a specific geo-product position, it has created a stronghold which it will attempt to protect using its own barriers to entry. Once a firm has established a secure stronghold, it typically will diversify around that core to create a sphere of influence. Each geo-product position should have a defensive or offensive purpose such as buffer zones and forward positions, respectively. [16]
Firms try to take positions that not only allow them to protect their core stronghold but also enable strikes into the core or buffer zones of rivals. Frequently some spheres of influence overlap. If they do, they may eventually settle on a tacit division of the market. Otherwise, the firms perpetually engage in skirmishes, use allies to fight a ‚Äúproxy war,‚Äù or continue to diversify until they get spread too thin. [16] [17] Many other strategies for the dynamic strategic interaction of strongholds have been discovered by empirical studies by D'Aveni. [18]
Not all firms are able to create a stronghold or sphere of influence. However, niche firms create strongholds or spheres of influence within tiny slivers of the competitive space. [16] [17] Similarly, not all industries can be described by hypercompetition. Competitive advantages can be institutionalized by government regulations and patents, giving firms permanent entry barriers and localized monopolies.
D'Aveni has found that being hypercompetitive is not black or white. Some industries are hybrids. Firms can establish d√©tente using oligopolistic behaviors with a select group of competitors so that they can free up resources to hypercompete against different rivals or to grow into new markets. For example, in the 1990s, the American car companies generally did not compete aggressively against each other so that they could focus on competition against Asian rivals. Also in the 1990s, the big three airlines (Delta, United, American) acquired failing airlines in such a way that they ended up with approximately equal market shares and some relatively uncontested airports. This allowed them to free up resources for hypercompeting against Continental, Northwest, Trans World Airlines, Eastern and Pan Am, driving some of them into bankruptcy. As these weaker rivals failed, the big 3 continued to acquire gates left behind by their rivals, resulting in a strengthening of the oligopoly among the big three. This then freed up resources for the big 3 to compete for international routes. [18]
The strongholds arena is the best example of the dynamic versus static approaches. In Porter's concept of "five forces"", entry barriers are present or not, and if present, reduce the threat of new entrants coming into the industry to increase competition. D'Aveni's strategic interactions, on the other hand, posit strategies for jumping over or slipping under or going around entry barriers, so that even in the presence of strong entry barriers, incumbent firms should not feel safe. [13] D'Aveni suggests that firms need to unequivocally signal their intent to defend their strongholds or alternatively to attack those of their rivals. [9] D'Aveni's model about spheres of influence and the balance of power explore a whole new level of competition. In contrast to those who have looked at multimarket contacts, [19] D'Aveni's model does not predict mutual forbearance as the only outcome of multimarket contact. He argues that in some cases the multimarket contacts will result in escalating rivalry when those contacts have created separate coalitions with an imbalance of power or when the coalitions lack cohesiveness. [4] [17]
The strongholds arena maps onto Porter's entry barriers in the five forces model, but again the hypercompetition model is dynamic rather than static. [13] Entry barriers can be erected in a number of ways, [10] but while entry barriers may temporarily slow down rivals, determined opponents can always find a way to circumvent or vault over entry barriers through employing a variety of tactics. [4] [9] D'Aveni has identified eight strategic interactions in this arena:
building barriers;
launching forays into a competitors stronghold;
the incumbents short-run counterresponses to a guerilla attack on its home turf;
the incumbent's delayed reaction;
overcoming the barriers;
long-run counterresponses to the attack;
slow learners and the incumbent's reaction to entrants who don't get the message;
and unstable standoffs. [4]
Over time, a stronghold erodes as entry barriers are overcome. D'Aveni is in agreement with Peter Drucker, who long counseled that the role of marketing is innovation and the creation of new markets. Innovation begins with abandonment of the old and obsolete. The age of strategic planning is fast evolving into the era or organizational learning. Likewise, D'Aveni urges managers to reconsider and reevaluate the use of what he believes are old strategic tools and maxims. [8]
He warns of the dangers of commitment to a given strategy or course of action. The flexible, unpredictable player may have an advantage over the inflexible, committed opponent. D'Aveni notes that, in hypercompetition, pursuit of generic strategies results in short-term advantage at best. The winning companies are the ones that successfully move up the ladder of escalating competition, not the ones that lock into a fixed position. D'Aveni is also critical of the five forces model. The best entry barrier, he argues, is maintaining the initiative, not mounting a defensive attempt to exclude new entrants. [8]
The strongholds arena offers a substantive set of options for addressing the entry barriers once capable of providing long-term competitive advantages. Basically, hypercompetition changed the impression of rock-walled castle strongholds to sandcastles ever susceptible to new tides and constant rebuilding. Importantly, it did not depict stronghold competition as fruitless, but transitory. [13]
Deep Pockets[edit]
Hypercompetition theory depicts the deep pockets arena as not based on unassailable advantages. Conventional views say that large firms have several deep pocket advantages including a wider margin for error, global or national reach, political power, market power, and financial clout. ‚ÄúHypercompetition provides strategies that advise both large firms with deep pockets and a small agile competitor." [13][failed verification]
Starting with the conventional view, D'Aveni suggests that firms can derive advantage through a larger resource base and superior concentration of focus to crush a smaller competitor through brute force.  These advantages however can be neutralized fairly quickly. [20][unreliable source?] ‚ÄúFor instance, competitors can use mergers and acquisitions to develop equally-matched or even deeper-pockets‚Ä¶ Alternatively, franchise and partnership arrangements can neutralize the [deep pocket] advantages‚Ä¶ And, large firms always face the potential of an anti-competitive government legal action." [20]
The strategic interactions in this arena include "drive 'em out," using the courts or Congress to derail the deep-pocketed firm, large firm thwarting the antitrust suit, small firms neutralizing the advantage of the deep pocket, and the rise of a countervailing power. [4] [13]
Although the deep pockets arena is the least remarkable of the four, it does offer some hope for the small firm when facing a Microsoft or a Google. [13] "The world is changing very fast‚Ä¶ big will not beat small anymore‚Ä¶ it will be the fast beating the slow.‚Äù [3] In the deep-pockets arena, D‚ÄôAveni concludes that brawn is no match for brains. [20]
Hypercompetition vs traditional strategy[edit]
Hypercompetitive strategy differs from The Five Forces Model/oligopoly theory of strategy in at least four distinctive ways.
Stakeholder strategy[edit]
The Five Forces Model/oligopoly theory of strategy promotes friendly relations with rivals to prevent competition or slow it down. It fosters building oligopolistic bargains amongst rivals while improving margins by reducing the power of suppliers and buyers. Hypercompetition inspires the opposite. It fosters fiercer and faster competition amongst rivals while generating margins by creating value for customers and forming alliances with suppliers. In sum, the five forces model treats rivals nicely and suppliers and customers poorly. The hypercompetition model treats customers and suppliers nicely while treating rivals aggressively. [21]
The nature of competitive advantage[edit]
National oligopolies and their long-term sustainable advantages were destroyed by foreign competition, an influx of technology and other disruptive forces that made it difficult to sustain competitive advantage. Hypercompetition is based on unsustainable, temporary competitive advantages. There is considerable evidence in the financial, accounting, economic, and strategy literatures that suggests an increase in temporary advantages. In macroeconomics, studies have demonstrated the steady increase in the magnitude of volatility in growth of unemployment, sales, earnings, capital expenditures and total factor productivity since 1950, [22] suggesting that sustainable competitive advantage is becoming more difficult. In finance, research has documented an increase in the volatility of returns for US equity prices. [23] In the strategy literature, Thomas and D‚ÄôAveni [24] also found increased volatility and decreased duration of stock returns from 1950 to 2002.
The competitive advantage of established industry leaders has become shorter over time and more likely to erode in several studies. [25] [26] [27] Market share erosion and dethronement of market leaders have been found to be more frequent over time, indicating that even the most established and profitable players are experiencing a loss of competitive advantage. [28] [29]
The relationship between rivalry and performance[edit]
Hypercompetition suggests that increased rivalry leads to higher performance while oligopoly theory / The Five Forces Model suggest that decreased rivalry is associated with higher performance. L. G Thomas found that rivalry and performance were positively corelated in over 200 manufacturing industries from 1950 to 1996, supporting Hypercompetition theory. [30]
The relationship between rivalry and performance is controversial. While Porter [10] recommended oligopolistic behavior which is based on the idea that higher competition leads to lower performance. However, in his extensive study of national economies (1990), he found the opposite. Countries with the highest levels of hypercompetition performed better in global markets than those dominated by oligopolies.
The reasons for the high-performance high-rivalry finding are numerous. They include the many significant benefits of a competitive aggressive approach. By constantly improving a product, a firm delivers superior value to its customers and generates new demand. An aggressive series of actions also delays rival responses and creates temporary monopolistic positions, allowing firms to charge premium prices and earn higher profit margins. [21] L. G Thomas found evidence that over time, the within-industry variance of profits increased, suggesting that the positive relationship between rivalry and industry performance is partially due to a few firms that have the resources to master the art of hypercompetition. [30] Firms that are flexible and able to bear the costs of aggressive actions become winners but the costs of aggressiveness can increase as the pace of competition intensifies. There are inefficiencies caused by rushed planning and execution including mistakes, poor judgement, and lack of coordination among departments and suppliers. [31]
Competitive aggressiveness can certainly be a winning strategy in newly developed markets or highly dynamic industries such as consumer electronics, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve accumulated a lot of evidence that aggressiveness matters, that it really improves performance, especially in these highly dynamic environments,‚Äù says Goce Andrevski, associate professor and Distinguished Faculty Fellow of Strategy at Smith School of Business. Consistent with L.G Thomas‚Äô within-industry findings, competitive aggressiveness pays for firms with the proper resources ‚Äì such as technological know-how, and dense networks of reliable partners and suppliers. It also pays when firms have the resources to generate a series of many temporary advantages at a rapid pace, relentlessly rolling out new products, price cuts, marketing campaigns, or similar actions designed to create superior value for customers, confuse rivals, and disrupt, destroy or neutralize the core competency of an opponent. [31]
The type of strategic actions recommended[edit]
Sequences of temporary competitive advantages are a means of gaining momentum and destroying, mooting, or otherwise neutralizing the core competencies of oligopolists. For example, Hypercompetition includes undermining the core competence of industry leaders, building off of one‚Äôs weaknesses to create surprise, and to circumvent entry barriers, making them moot.
Traditional strategy often uses SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis as a tool to identify, measure and leverage core competencies. This analysis typically suggests firms leverage, strengthen, and exploit their strengths, i.e their core competencies. [32] And, to use these strengths against the opportunities, which derive from the weaknesses of competitors. No decisive victory can be achieved by using strengths to attack weaknesses. The traditional approach leaves a rival intact and manages competition to keep its level down to a slower speed and reduce the aggressiveness of rivals, behaviors which support existing oligopolies. [15]
In contrast, hypercompetition encourages using strengths against the strengths of rivals. To be successful at attacking the strengths of a rival, a firm must build its weaknesses so that the attack will be a surprise. In hypercompetition, only temporary advantages are possible. This suggests the surprising implication that leveraging core competencies is a mistake in hypercompetition because those strengths will often turn into disadvantages weighing down the firm with assets that create inflexibilities.
Truly decisive victories only come from strengths overwhelming strengths. [33] In most cases, before attacking the strength of a rival, firms prepare for counterattacks and build their weaknesses. Destroying or eroding the strengths of rivals enables firms to undermine, neutralize or eventually moot their advantages. Faced with relentless withering attacks, rivals can also become exhausted and demoralized when they are constantly playing catch-up to a hypercompetitor on the loose.

Hypercompetition brings pressure to b ig brands like Marlboro and Kraft. Similarly, the presence of online retail also undermines conventional business models. Among them, no one excelled in the long run. Today the company might win, but one more year, it can be destroyed and bankrupt.
Competitive pressure is getting stronger, along with advancing technological innovation. Barriers to entry are also low because globalization makes geographical distances closer.
Furthermore, buyer pressure is also higher because, now, they can easily compare prices. That encourages them to demand a combination of better quality and lower prices.
It all happened in a hypercompetitive market. What is hypercompetition? What are its characteristics? Why did that come up? ‚Ä¶ Those are some of the questions that are the topic of this article.
Definition of hypercompetition
In strategic management, hypercompetition is a condition when the competition is so intense, creating instability in the market. These conditions require companies to change strategies continuously. Companies maneuver with each other so that changing market dynamics quickly. As a result, the strategic competitiveness of a company can disappear immediately.
Companies often aggressively challenge their competitors. With that, they hope to improve their competitive position and, ultimately, their performance. The basis of maneuvering may be related to:
The positioning of quality and prices
Efforts for new knowledge
Efforts to protect or attack existing geographic products or markets.
Characteristics of hypercompetition
Ad
The following is a list of hypercompetitive market characteristics:
High level of rivalry among the players
Strategic maneuvers occur at a quick, intense and unexpected pace
Rapid technological and structural changes
Adoption of flexible strategies is common because the competitive landscape is changing rapidly
Low entry barriers, allowing new players to enter and challenge existing companies.
The competitive advantage is temporary. The new strategic competitiveness would immediately appear, destroy, and replace the old ones.
Hypercompetition is common in new and emerging industries. An example of a hypercompetitive industry is the eCommerce industry.
Causes of hypercompetition
Several factors gave rise to a very competitive environment. Globalization increases corporate mobility between countries and reduces barriers to market entry. Also, trade bloc (such as the European Union) leads to free entry and exit of companies between member countries.
The next factor is the ongoing technological innovation. At present, new technology is beginning to disrupt conventional business models. It also brings competition across national boundaries. The company does not only compete with local companies but also global companies. Online channels allow orders to be available from abroad more easily.
The bargaining power of buyers is also getting stronger, bringing higher pressure to producers. Through technology, consumers nowadays are easy to compare prices between products. They can easily switch to competing products when unsatisfied with a product. That, in turn, drives them to want not only higher quality products but also cheaper ones.
Hypercompetitive market implications
Under hypercompetitive conditions, companies cannot enjoy long-term advantages. It only lasts a while.
Ad
New companies emerge with a competitive advantage. But, the strategic maneuverability of their competitors quickly erodes and destroys it. Furthermore, the maneuver will eventually also be destroyed by another movement.
The strategic approach by the company
Because competition continues to change, companies will prefer a surprise strategy. In a sense, the company designs it to disrupt the conventional market by introducing innovations and new business models.
Businesses will also continue to try to manipulate the competitive landscape. They will introduce innovations quickly. Also, they followed up on innovation with manufacturing, distribution, and marketing as fast. They also focus on short-term sustainable successes. That way, they can survive until the market approaches a mature phase.

Abstract
Hypercompetition is created by the acceleration of competitive moves in an industry where firms must react quickly to develop their competitive advantage and to erode the advantages of competitors. The objective of hypercompetitive firms is to thrive in dynamic markets by unsettling existing standards and norms of operation, and by generating a constant flow of short-term advantages. In hypercompetitive environments, profits and competitive advantages are temporary and will soon be challenged by the next wave of disruptors. The strategic framework for hypercompetition adopts a dynamic approach that is in tune with the intensity of change in turbulent industries. Three sets of strategy-building tools are proposed for the analysis of competitive markets by D'Aveni. The ?four arenas? explores how competition builds up in the areas of cost and quality (C?Q), timing and know-how (T?K), strongholds (S), and deep pockets (D) referring to financial resources. The ?four lenses? analysis looks at how a single competitive action affects the four arenas of an industry. The ?new 7-Ss? framework proposes a set of hypercompetitive approaches to realign strategy. The objective is to develop strategies in three categories: vision for disruption, capabilities for disruption, and tactics for disruption.

Alright, so from these search results, I can see that hypercompetition is a concept in strategic management that describes a highly competitive business environment where competition is intense, dynamic, and ever-changing. It was introduced by Richard D'Aveni in his book "Hypercompetition."

First, I need to understand what exactly hypercompetition entails. According to the sources, hypercompetition is characterized by rapid and intense competitive moves where companies have to continually innovate and adapt to maintain their competitive edge. It's a scenario where no competitive advantage is sustainable in the long term; advantages are temporary and can be quickly eroded by rivals.

From Doc 1, which seems to be flashcards from a strategic management course, hypercompetition is defined as "competition that is excessive such that it creates inherent instability and necessitates constant disruptive change for firms in the competitive landscape." This aligns with what I've read elsewhere.

Doc 2 is an article from MBA Knowledge Base that provides a more detailed explanation. It mentions that hypercompetition isn't just limited to high-tech or deregulated industries but is becoming prevalent across various sectors. The article also highlights that in hypercompetitive environments, companies must engage in continuous strategic maneuvering to gain and maintain advantages.

Doc 3 is from Wikipedia, which confirms the definition and adds that hypercompetition is a key feature of the global digital economy, marked by increased competition and smarter competitors. It also mentions that some researchers have questioned whether hypercompetition is universally present or confined to specific industries, regions, or time periods.

Doc 4 is from Penpoin.com and lists the characteristics of hypercompetition, such as high rivalry, rapid strategic maneuvers, technological and structural changes, flexible strategies, low entry barriers, and temporary competitive advantages.

Doc 5 is an academic paper discussing hypercompetition, likely providing a more in-depth theoretical framework.

Given this, I need to think about how a hypercompetitive environment affects a company's strategic approach. Traditionally, companies aim for sustainable competitive advantages through unique resources, capabilities, or positions. However, in hypercompetition, these advantages are fleeting, so the strategic approach must adapt accordingly.

Let me consider what strategies companies might employ in such an environment. First, they need to be more agile and flexible, able to adapt quickly to changes and new competitive threats. This likely involves investing in innovation and R&D to stay ahead of the curve.

Second, building strong, adaptable organizational cultures that encourage creativity and quick decision-making would be crucial. Companies need to foster an environment where employees are not only innovative but also willing to take calculated risks.

Third, forming strategic partnerships and alliances could help companies access new technologies, markets, or capabilities without having to develop them internally, thus saving time and resources.

Fourth, focusing on customer-centric approaches, understanding and anticipating customer needs and preferences, can help companies stay relevant and capture market share.

Fifth, leveraging data and analytics to gain insights into market trends, competitor moves, and customer behavior can provide a competitive edge in decision-making.

Sixth, perhaps companies need to adopt a more proactive stance, constantly seeking to disrupt their own businesses before competitors do, ensuring they stay ahead of the game.

Moreover, in hypercompetitive environments, the traditional notion of sustaining competitive advantage through static barriers to entry may no longer hold. Instead, companies might need to focus on dynamic capabilities‚Äîthe ability to sense, seize, and reconfigure internal and external resources to address rapidly changing environments.

It's also worth considering that in such volatile markets, companies might need to diversify their product portfolios or expand into new markets to spread risk and ensure continued growth.

However, there are challenges to this approach. Constantly innovating and adapting requires significant resources and can be financially draining. There's also the risk of spreading resources too thin, leading to a lack of focus.

Additionally, the fast pace of change might lead to strategic drift if companies aren't careful, where they lose sight of their core competencies and values in the pursuit of staying ahead.

Moreover, the pressure to innovate rapidly can lead to ethical compromises or overlooking potential risks in new ventures.

Therefore, while hypercompetition demands a more dynamic strategic approach, companies must also ensure they maintain their core values, manage resources effectively, and make informed, ethical decisions.

In summary, in a hypercompetitive environment, a company's strategic approach should emphasize agility, innovation, adaptability, customer focus, strategic partnerships, and the development of dynamic capabilities, while managing the associated risks and challenges.
