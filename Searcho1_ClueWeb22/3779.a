So I have this question: "How did the rise of dictators cause World War II?" Hmm, I need to think about this carefully. First off, I know that World War II started in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. But why did that happen? Well, it's connected to the rise of dictators in several countries, especially in Germany, Italy, and Japan. So, I need to understand how these leaders came to power and how their actions led to the war.

Let me start with Germany. The leader there was Adolf Hitler, who was the dictator or what they called the Führer. He led the Nazi Party, which was very nationalist and aggressive. I think understanding how Hitler came to power is crucial. Maybe I should look into that.

Does Right-to-Work hurt unions?
States with Right-to-Work laws require union contracts to cover all workers, not just the ones who are members of the union. This problem can reduce the union’s bargaining strength, which ultimately results in lower wages and benefits.
Does Right to Work create jobs?
Union contracts frequently require employees to pay union dues or lose their jobs. Right-to-work laws reduce the financial benefit from organizing workplaces where unions have limited support. This makes unions less aggressive and encourages business investment, creating jobs.
Is Right to Work Good or Bad?
Recent Gallup polling finds Americans support right-to-work laws by a 71 percent to 22 percent margin—better than 3 to 1. The arguments against right-to-work laws do not withstand scrutiny. Right-to-work laws give workers a choice over where their money goes. This freedom forces unions to earn their members’ support.
Who created right to work?
President Harry Truman in 1947 amended parts of the NLRA when he passed the Taft-Harley Act. This Act created the current right-to-work law, which allows states to prohibit compulsory membership with a union as a condition for employment in the public and private sectors of the country.
Does right to work mean I can be fired for any reason?
The right-to-work doctrine, originally established in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, gives employees the option to refrain from engaging in collective activity such as labor organizing and union representation. The employment relationship can be terminated for any reason or no reason at all.
Why right to work laws are bad?
Right-to-work laws do not improve business conditions in states. Right to work is not a deciding factor in where businesses locate. High-tech companies that provide good-paying, American jobs favor states where unions have a strong presence, because unions provide a high-skilled workforce and decrease turnover.
What is the right to work explain?
The right to work is a foundation for the realization of other human rights and for life with dignity. It includes the opportunity to earn a livelihood by work freely chosen or accepted. States are obliged to ensure fair wages, equal pay for equal work, and equal remuneration for work of equal value.
What laws protect the rights of workers?
U.S. Labor Laws
Norris-LaGuardia Act (1932)
National Labor Relations Act (1935)
Fair Labor Standards Act (1938)
Taft-Hartley Act (1947)
Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (1959)
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (1964)
Age Discrimination in Employment Act (1967)
Occupational Safety and Health Act (1970)
Why are workers rights important?
It helps to ensure that workers and employers have an equal voice in negotiations and provides workers the opportunity to seek to improve their living and working conditions.
What is 100 days work in India?
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) guarantees 100 days of employment in a financial year to any rural household whose adult members are willing to do unskilled manual work. This Act is an important step towards the realization of the right to work.

How did Hitler become the Dictator and Fuhrer of Germany - DailyHistory.org
How did Hitler become the Dictator and Fuhrer of Germany
(Redirected from How did Hitler become the Dictator and Fuhrer of Germany?)
Adolf Hitler
In 1934, after the death of German President Paul von Hindenburg, Chancellor Adolf Hitler became the absolute dictator of Germany under the title Fuhrer or “Leader”. He ruled Germany with an iron fist until he committed suicide in 1945 as the Russian army closed in on Berlin.
The German army took an oath of allegiance to its new commander-in-chief, and the last remnants of Germany’s democratic government were dismantled to make way for Hitler’s Third Reich. The Fuhrer assured his people that the Third Reich would last for at least a thousand years. However, the National Socialist Party's Germany collapsed just 11 years later.
Early life: apathy and disappointment with civilian life
Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on 20 April 1889. As a young man, he aspired to become a renowned painter, but he received little public recognition and had to live in poverty in Vienna. He wished to study art but failed to secure entry to the Academy of Fine Arts since he had not obtained even a secondary school diploma. Unsurprisingly, during the next few years, Hitler lived a lonely, insecure, and isolated life in poverty, earning a precarious livelihood by painting postcards and advertisements and often drifting from one municipal hostel to another. By that time, young Adolf had already shown traits that characterized his later life: features as loneliness and secretiveness, hatred of cosmopolitism, and last but not least - intense dislike for the multinational and multicultural character of Vienna.
Adolf Hitler as a child
Hitler was also drafted for Austrian military service but was not accepted due to a lack of fitness. In 1913, Hitler moved to Munich. At the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered to serve in the Bavarian army. He was accepted in August 1914 and received special permission to enlist as a German soldier and a member of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment, though he was still an Austrian citizen.  Despite the fact that Hitler spent much of his time away from the front lines, he was still present at a number of significant battles - Hitler managed to take part and was wounded in some of the fiercest struggles of the war. [1] He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.
Hitler greeted the war with enthusiasm, as a great relief from the frustration and aimlessness of civilian life. He found discipline and comradeship very satisfying and soldiered on his belief in the heroic virtues of the war. However, after the collapse of the war effort, the sad experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, as he was shocked by Germany’s surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that civilian leaders and Marxists from within (mainly German communists and Jews) had betrayed the German army. Later, in 1941, Hitler already as German Fuhrer would reveal the degree to which his career and its terrible legacy had been shaped by the First World War, writing himself that “I brought back home with me my experiences at the front; out of them I built my National Socialist community.”
Post WWI resentment and Hitler’s appetite for political and war revival of the nation
Adolf Hitler in 1923
After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. As an army political agent in September 1919, he joined the small German Workers’ Party in Munich. In 1920 Hitler was put in charge of the party’s propaganda and left the army completely devoting himself to improving his position within the party, which in that year was renamed National Socialist German Workers’ party. During the post-war insecure years of poverty, conditions were ripe for further development of such a party. World War I ended in 1919 with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which was not only a military defeat but also a psychological defeat for the German state since the German people were expecting victory. The severe peace terms of the Treaty that caused the most resentment in Germany were the loss of territory, the war guilt placed solely on Germany for starting the war, the deliberate demilitarization and the reparations demands. [2]
The Bavarian region of Germany was famous for its traditional separatism and the region’s popular dislike of the republican government in Berlin. Munich, as the Bavarian centre, was a gathering place for dissatisfied service members and soldiers that were unwilling to return to civilian life, and for political plotters against the “old” republic. Unsurprisingly, many of those groups joined the National Socialist Party, including Ernst Rohm who played a great role in furthering Hitler’s rise within the party. Rohn recruited the “strong arm” squads used by Hitler to protect himself and party meetings, to attack socialists and communists, and to exploit violence for the impression of strength of the “purified Aryan race”. In 1921, these squads were formally organized under Rohm into a private party army, called the SA.
The severe conditions at the time were extremely favorable for the fast growth of the small party, and Hitler was keenly perceptive and shrewd enough as to take advantage of them. In July 1921, backed up by Ernst Rohm and supported by the vast majority of the remaining party staff, he became the party’s sole chief leader with almost unlimited power. From the very beginning, he set out to create a mass movement, whose mystique and power had to bind its members in loyalty to him. Hitler entirely devoted himself to his ideas and engaged in unrelenting propaganda through the party own newspaper called the “Popular Observer”. Hitler led regular meetings whose audiences soon grew from a handful to thousands.
The Rise of Hitler as the Leader of the National Socialist Party
Portrait of Adolf Hitler in 1933
Moreover, the climax of the National Socialist Party's rapid growth in Bavaria came in an earnest attempt to seize the German government and political power by force. In November 1923, Hitler tried to take advantage of the prevailing confusion and opposition to the payment of war reparations to Britain and France. At a public meeting of 3000 people in Munich, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new right wing government.
Hitler hoped that his nationalist revolution in Bavaria would spread to the entire unsatisfied German army, which in turn would shortly bring down the government in Berlin. However, the uprising was almost immediately suppressed giving Hitler a vital lesson – his movement must achieve power by legal means. Due to his actions, Hitler was effectively sentenced to prison for the next nine months. He used the time to dictate the first volume of Mein Kampf. [3] He sharpened his anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist beliefs in the book and laid out his plans for conquest. Hitler also developed his concept of the Fuhrer as an absolute dictator who would bring unity to German people and lead the Aryan race to world supremacy.
Later, Hitler himself would accept the Fuhrer title symbolizing and expressing his power as the harsh and oppressive German absolute ruler and dictator. However, During Hitler’s absence and while in prison, the National Socialist Party fell into disrepair. After his release, Hitler faced even further difficulties that had not existed before 1923. The ruling party had achieved relative economic stability and legitimized the Weimar Republic. The standard of living began to slowly improve the quality of life. Additionally, Hitler was forbidden to make public speeches, first in Bavaria, then across the entire nation.
The Great Depression in 1929 brought a fresh new opportunity for Hitler and the National Socialist Party to solidify their power. [4] In 1930, Hitler made a critical alliance with the Nationalist Alfred Hugenberg, using his newspapers to reach a nationwide audience for the first time. The union let Hitler gain financial support from business leaders who controlled political funds and were anxious to use them to establish a strong anti-socialist right wing. The funds placed the National Socialist party on a secure financial footing and enabled Hitler to attract more people from Germany's lower middle class and the unemployed by promising to end Germany’s financial troubles.  He also reassured them that he sought to reassert Germany's natural greatness. For what it was worth, Hitler’s most significant achievement at the time was the establishment of a true national party, uniting people from throughout Germany under his lead.
From National Socialist Party leader to First Chancellor, Commander, and Fuhrer of all Germany
In the following 1930 general elections, the National Socialist Party won 6 million votes, making the party the second largest in Germany. Unremitting propaganda, set against the failure of the government to improve conditions during the Great Depression, produced a steadily mounting electoral strength for the National Socialists. In 1932, Hitler ran for the presidential elections but lost, yet capturing a remarkable 36.8 percent of the votes on the second ballot. Finding himself already in a strong position, he entered into a series of intrigues with the conservatives: both the fear of communism and the rejection of the Social Democrats effortlessly bound them together. Moreover, Hitler insisted that the chancellorship was the only office he would accept. On January 30, 1933, already in poor health, President Hindenburg offered Hitler the chancellorship of Germany, hoping to meet Hitler’s appetite for power.
However, Hindenburg underestimated Hitler’s political audacity and failed to satisfy his main political rival making him part of the ruling party and cabinet. Instead, one of the new chancellor’s first acts was to start an intensified campaign of violence through the branches of the National Socialist Party and to exploit the burning of the Reichstag (the house of the German parliament) building as a pretext for calling new early general elections. Hitler and his party used the fire as firm “evidence” that communists were plotting against the German government. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research to date.
However, the National Socialist Party effectively accused the Comintern of the act regardless of the official version that the working class started the fire as a protest against intolerable working conditions. Some historians even agree, as proposed by the Communist Party, that the fire was planned and ordered by Hitler as a false flag operation. [5] Whatever the truth, Hitler used the fire to solidify their power and eliminate the communists as political rivals. Crucially, the National Socialists won the polling registering 43.9 percent of the votes. On March 23, 1933, the Enabling Bill, giving full powers to Hitler, was passed in the Reichstag by the combined votes of the National Socialists, the Nationalists, and the Center party deputies.
Suppression and Purges of Competitors to Hitler's power
Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic harsh suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June 1933 all non-National Socialist parties, organizations, and labor unions practically ceased to exist. On July 14, 1933, Hitler’s National Socialist Party declared itself the one and only true legal political party in Germany.
Hitler even purged and purified the National Socialist Party’s own SA paramilitary organization in a successful effort to win support from the official national German army. The demands of SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. The Night of the Long Knives let Hitler's regime carry out a series of political extra-judicial executions. Hitler moved against the SA because he saw SA's independence and its growing free street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. In addition, the new German Chancellor wanted to conciliate leaders of the official German military who feared the SA, particularly for Rohm’s ambition to absorb the official army into the SA under his own leadership. [6] Ernst Rohm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler’s political enemies, conservative anti-National Socialists, even former chancellors, were rounded up and shot. Once done, nothing stood between Hitler and absolute power in Germany except 87-year-old German President Hindenburg.
Dismissing Hindenburg
Hitler decided that he should succeed Hindenburg, however, not as a resident, but instead as a Fuhrer (supreme leader) of the German people. Since Hitler effectively governed the entire Reichstag, within hours after the President’s death, Hitler declared the office of President vacant. The Reichstag immediately introduced a special law to merge and combine the offices of the Reich President and the Reich Chancellor. In effect - all existing authority of the President had to be transferred to the effective Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor, Adolf Hitler. [7] The new law was technically illegal since it violated the German Constitution concerning presidential succession as well as the Enabling Act of 1933, which forbade Hitler from altering the presidency. However, none of that did matter because the National Socialist's already exercised absolute authority. Critics of Hitler’s new regime were eliminated, and Hitler became the ultimate arbiter of the law. Adolf proclaimed and introduced himself as the Reich Chancellor, Fuhrer of all Germans, and Head of state.
Furthermore, immediately following the announcement of the new Fuhrer law, the German Officer Corps and every individual soldier in the official German army were forced to swear a brand new oath of allegiance to Hitler personally, not to the German state or Constitution, contrasting the “old regimes”. All men in uniform, in accordance with their military code of honor, would now regard obedience to Hitler as their sacred duty, thus making the entire German army act as the true personal lethal weapon of the Fuhrer. He practically succeeded in merging and uniting SA and official German arm forces under his dictatorship. [8]
After the President’s funeral, the National Socialists even prepared a nationwide vote giving the German people an opportunity to express their “free will” and approval of the Fuhrer’s new powers and thus legitimize Hitler’s position in the eyes of the world. On August 19, 1934, about 95 percent of registered voters in Germany went to the polls and 90 percent of them gave Hitler a positive vote. Therefore, Hitler could now officially claim himself as Fuhrer of the German nation with the overwhelming approval of his people. In the end, Hitler had finally triumphed achieving total control and absolute power across Germany.
Conclusion
Hitler's rise to power was swift and brutal. He had risen from a corporal in the German army to Fuhrer in just 15 years. Hitler had consolidated power by uniting various nationalist factions and successfully placed himself at the head of the Nationalist Socialist Power. He used violence to fight both the opposition and purge his allies when they became inconvenient. His speeches mesmerized the German citizenry and successfully the public that he was more than just a ruthless thug. The early chaos of Germany transformed him into a prominent national voice, and the Great Depression gave him the argument that convinced Germany to follow him. Unfortunately, Hitler would lead Germany to a destructive spiral of violence, hatred, and genocide that would destroy the country and millions of lives.

How was Hitler able become Fuhrer of Germany by August 1934? (10 Marks)
There were a number of events which enabled Hitler to declare himself Fuhrer by August 1934. In February 1933 the Reichstag was set on fire. It was believed that this was an attack by a Communist, and as a result, Hitler was able to convince Hindenburg to pass an Emergency Decree which meant that Hitler was able to imprison many Communist leaders. This prevented them from campaigning in the upcoming election. The Nazi party was able to win 288 seats, however they still required the use of intimidation by the SA to ensure that two thirds of the Reichstag voted to pass the Enabling Act. Once this was passed, it provided Hitler with the power to pass laws without the Reichstag’s consent. This was a major development in Hitler becoming Fuhrer as it removed the Reichstag as a source of opposition. With the use of the Enabling Act he banned all political parties, except the Nazis, making Germany a one-party state, here removing all other external political opposition.
Between June 1933 and the August 1934, Hitler worked to further consolidate his power. He worked to infiltrate regional governments by placing Nazis in each area of Germany. He also removed opposition which he felt he faced within the Nazi party in a series of murders which became known as ‘The Night of the Long Knives’. Hitler ordered the SS to kill a number of his opponents including Ernst Rohm, the leader of the SA, and around 400 of its members. This was a clear exercise of Hitler’s willingness to use brutality in order to remove opposition, including that within the Nazi party itself. Hitler took a number of other steps to consolidate power such as banning Trade Unions, however, the final step in Hitler becoming Fuhrer was the death of President Hindenburg. With Hindenburg dead, Hitler merged the roles of chancellor and president, making him head of the army and providing him with the position of Fuhrer – ‘absolute leader’.

Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany from 1933 to 1945
Adolf Hitler (1889 – 1945) was the leader or Führer of Germany from 1933 until he committed suicide in 1945. He was the cause of World War II and responsible for the deaths of nearly 11 million people, 6 million of which were Jewish (Rosenberg). There were several factors that aided in Hitler’s diplomatic and military successes and these factors played a role in why the West was so slow in responding to the war that Hitler started.
The Weimar Republic was the government that was formed in Germany at the end of World War I. The people of Germany associated the Republic with the humiliating Treaty of Versailles and there was an overall distaste for it. Hitler came along and made a lot of promises to the German people, who already had a bitter taste left in their mouths from World War I. He promised to cure economic hardship and to reestablish Germany to the position of a world power. He was very good at convincing the German people that the Weimar Republic betrayed the German people and that a new government was necessary. (Kishlansky, Geary and O’Brien. 2008)
Adolf Hitler shaking hands with Paul von Hindenburg
Though he was a great speaker and had a lot of support, Hitler lost the presidential election and Paul von Hindenburg (1925 – 1934) was elected president of Germany. On January 30, 1933, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as chancellor of Germany, which gave Hitler a firm footing to carry out his plans. Hitler made claims that Germany was nearing Communist revolution and convinced the president to pass emergency laws that consisted of outlawing the freedom to press, the freedom to public meeting and allowed for the use of violence against the communists and socialists.
After just a year and a half, President Hindenburg died and Hitler was able to take over as president. He combined the role with the chancellor position and created the position of supreme leader, otherwise known as Führer. Hitler was now the legal dictator of Germany, with a lot of support from the German people. His dreams of expansion for Germany were now possible.
The expansion of Nazi Germany under Hitler's rule
Britain, France and America were blind to the threat that was Nazi Germany. They did not understand what the Nazi party and Hitler had planned in the crusade to make Germany the biggest and strongest empire. The world was also very sensitive about war. World War I was devastating to most countries. Many countries were broke and still struggling to rebuild both physically and financially. This allowed Hitler to annex Austria in 1938 without a single fight (Rosenberg). The world just sat by and watched. When Hitler set his sights on Czechoslovakia, the mediation at Munich took place. Neville Chamberlain (1869 – 1940), the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom attempted to reason with Hitler (Neville Chamberlain). Chamberlain assumed that Hitler was, as the rest of the world, interested in preventing war. The mediation ended with Hitler getting everything that he wanted and the rest of the world assuming that there was now a peace for Europe (Kishlansky, Geary and O’Brien. 2008). It was not until he set his eyes on Poland that the world began to take action against Germany.
The people of Germany trusted and respected Adolf Hitler.
Hitler had taken full control of Germany. He was making sure to remove any critics from their positions of power and replacing them with Nazis that were loyal to him. He successfully convinced the German people that he was there in the best interest of the people and he was able to keep the world at bay while he did what he wanted for a time. The world was incredibly sensitive to the idea of another war and would have allowed Hitler to do as he pleased, until he took his expansion too far.
“All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach” – Adolf Hitler

StitchTheDamned (author) from Clifton Park, NY on July 17, 2013:
Thank you for the advice! I will keep that in mind and work on adding some more details to this on in time!
Thomas M D Hemsley from Leeds on July 17, 2013:
An overall nicely written hub with accurate information. I would recommend some tweaking though, such as explaining in a bit more detail with some points (For example, more detail on the Weimar years or explaining the claims of communist revolution with the Reichstag Fire). Also, 11-17 million people were killed in the Holocaust but only 6 million Jews were among that number, a mistake in your first paragraph you should correct. Overall, well done!

How and why did Hitler become a dictator?
Hitler rose to the position of chancellor in January 1933, as a result of the poorly prepared treaty of Versailles, the resulting economic hardship and his apparent strong leadership. In the next 18 months however Hitler seized absolute power and created a total dictatorship through his ability to exploit opportunities, a manipulation of his country through a reign of fear and a ruthless and systematic repression of all opposition.
Hitler used the Reichstag fire to unite the population against the communists. He used the fact that a communist was found at the scene of the fire to accuse the whole communist party. This way everybody would be scared of the communists, they would have a common enemy, which in some ways would unify them. The fear of communism also weakened the Weimar republic. Hitler took advantage of that and asked the Reichstag and the President to accept the “Enabling law”. The Enabling law was a law that gave Hitler an unlimited right to create “emergency” laws without consulting anyone else. They both accepted, as much as Hindenburg (the president) hated Hitler, he hated communism even more. When Hindenburg died Hitler took hold of the whole power. Regardless of whether these events were a question of chance or provoked (some consider that Hitler ordered the burning of the Reichstag himself) Hitler was an expert at turning these events to his advantage.
Hitler led the Nazis to power in the March 1933 elections using underhand means. To get elected and eventually seize absolute power, Hitler used the SA to intimidate the voters, to disrupt his opponent’s meetings, and to arrest or kill anyone who got in his way. This reign of terror eventually led to the Nazis gaining 44% of the seats in the parliament. His use of fear, both of communism and of the SA was a major factor in Hitler’s ability to take the power.
Hitler also systematically eliminated his opponents. In May 1933, Hitler arrested the trade

Why did Hitler become Chancellor?
Many Historians agree the key event of Hitler´s rise to power was his appointment of Chancellor the 30th of January 1933 by the former German President von Hindenburg, who ruled the country since 1925 and was reelected in 1932. Although in the elections of July 1932 Hitler won 37.5% of the parliamentary seats (230), making the Nazi party the largest in the Reichstag, whereas he should have been Chancellor, he did not rise to power, as Hindenburg did not appoint…

Alright, so I've got some information about how Hitler came to power. Let's see, the question is about how the rise of dictators caused World War II, and Hitler is definitely a key figure there. So, from what I've read, Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then eventually the absolute dictator after President Hindenburg died in 1934. He used various tactics to consolidate his power, like the Reichstag fire, the Enabling Act, and purging his opponents in the Night of the Long Knives.

But I need to think about how this rise to power led to World War II. I remember that after Hitler became the dictator, he started to rebuild the German military, which was against the Treaty of Versailles. He annexed Austria and parts of Czechoslovakia, and then invaded Poland in 1939, which directly led to Britain and France declaring war on Germany.

So, the rise of Hitler as a dictator enabled him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy that eventually caused the war. Without his dictatorial powers, he wouldn't have been able to undertake such risky and expansionist actions.

But the question mentions "dictators," plural. So, besides Hitler, there were other dictators around that time who also played a role in causing World War II. I think of Benito Mussolini in Italy and Emperor Hirohito in Japan. So, maybe I should look into how their rise to power contributed to the war as well.

Let me start with Mussolini in Italy. I know he was called "Il Duce," which means "the leader," and he established a fascist dictatorship in Italy. When did he come to power?

Benito Mussolini declares himself dictator of Italy
Similar to Adolf Hitler, Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini did not become the dictator of a totalitarian regime overnight. For several years, he and his allies worked more or less within the confines of the Italian constitution to accrue power, eroding democratic institutions until the moment came for them to be done away with entirely. It is generally agreed that that moment came in speech Mussolini gave to the Italian parliament on January 3, 1925, in which he asserted his right to supreme power and effectively became the dictator of Italy.
Mussolini had been a schoolteacher and an avowed socialist, but after World War I he became a leader of the nascent Fascist movement. Like much of Europe, Italy was rife with social turmoil in the wake of the war, with paramilitary groups and street gangs frequently clashing over their competing visions for the new political order. A close confidant of Mussolini formed a Fascist paramilitary group, known as the Blackshirts or squadristi, as Mussolini led the political party, and they found that government fears of a communist revolution allowed them to operate without state intervention. By 1921, Mussolini had been elected to parliament as the leader of the growing National Fascist Party.
Soon after Mussolini's election, armed Blackshirts marched on Rome, demanding that the king install Mussolini as Prime Minister. In a decision that utterly changed the course of Italian and European history, King Victor Emmanuel III ignored Prime Minister Luigi Facta's pleas that he declare martial law, leading to Facta's resignation and Emmanuel's invitation to Mussolini to form a new government. The Fascists and their moderate allies set about dismantling Italy's democratic institutions. He was proclaimed dictator for a year and increasingly merged his party and its paramilitary wing with the state and the official military. He also undertook a program of privatizations and anti-union legislation in order to assure industrialists and aristocrats that fascism would protect them from socialism.
Despite these reforms, many Fascists felt Mussolini was moving too slowly. In 1924, assassins with ties to Mussolini killed socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti, leading most of the parliamentary opposition to boycott Mussolini's legislature. The Fascists felt that their moment had come. On December 31, they issued an ultimatum to Mussolini. Three days later, he addressed the remainder of parliament, declaring "I, and I alone, assume the political, moral, and historical responsibility for all that has happened," obliquely referring to the assassination of Matteotti. In doing so, Mussolini dared prosecutors and the rest of Italy's democratic institutions, as well as the king, to challenge his authority. None did. Thus, from 1925 onward, Mussolini was able to operate openly as a dictator, styling himself Il Duce and fusing the state and the Fascist Party. Two decades of suppression and brutality followed, culminating in Mussolini's alliance with Nazi Germany and the Second World War.

How did Mussolini Rise to Power as the Dictator of Italy - DailyHistory.org
How did Mussolini Rise to Power as the Dictator of Italy
Benito Mussolini
In 1922, Benito Mussolini (Il Duce) came to power as the prime minister of Italy and the National Fascist Party leader. At first, he ruled democratically and constitutionally, but in 1925, he turned Italy into a one-party, totalitarian state and ruled as Italy's dictator. He forcefully governed Italy until 1943, when the Allied invasion of the country led to his downfall and execution.
His rise to power was remarkable. He went from being a journalist and a minor political figure to becoming prime minister of Italy within five years. The fear of a communist revolution abetted his remarkable rise and allowed Mussolini and his fascist party to seize power, with little opposition.
Who was Mussolini?
Before 1914, Mussolini was a committed socialist. [1] However, when the socialists adopted a neutrality policy in World War One, Mussolini opposed it and was later expelled from the party. [2]
Mussolini was a well-known journalist and had strongly advocated for Italy’s entrance into the war in his newspaper in 1914. Mussolini was an Italian Nationalist, and he wanted to unify his country. He regularly employed nationalist rhetoric that portrayed Italy as a great power to eliminate regional loyalties that had kept the country divided despite the country's official unification in 1871.
When Italy entered the war on the Allies in 1915, Mussolini volunteered and served with distinction on the front.  He was severely injured in 1917 and was forced to leave the army. [3] Mussolini, like Hitler, Mussolini was deeply influenced by the war, and he came to believe that war was essential for a nation, as it would allow it and its people to achieve greatness. Later on, as Italy's leader, he would seize every opportunity to become involved in war and conflict. The war also confirmed Mussolini's belief that action mattered more than debate and reason, which was central to his fascist ideology. In turn, this led to the glorification of violence. [4]
After the war, Mussolini founded the Italian Fascist Party. The ideology of the party was a fusion of socialism and nationalism. The Party called for a strong nation led by an elite to guide Italy and solve its interminable social and economic problems. [5] Mussolini’s new party was attractive to many, especially ex-soldiers.  The party soon had genuine mass appeal, and much of this was based on Mussolini's calls that all Italians unite and overcome their class differences. [6] As the war ended, many war veterans joined the new Fascist Party and believed that it offered Italy's best hope.
Many of these men were unemployed after the war, and they felt that their sacrifices during the war had been in vain. Mussolini cleverly formed these veterans' squadrons and employed them against all those he declared to be the enemies of Italy.  These former soldiers' squads became known as ‘Blackshirts,’ and they proved to be a formidable paramilitary force. [7]
How did World War I change Italy?
Italy’s military performed dismally during the war and had sustained extremely high casualties, and there had also been mass desertions. Many people, and especially soldiers, were disenchanted with the political class’s handling of the war. They were widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and many held them personally responsible for the country's failings during the war. The Italian political system, though technically a democracy, was dominated by the traditional landowning and business elite. [8]
The Italians had entered into the First World War on the Allies' side, and they had been promised new territories and colonies. Many Italians had supported the country’s entry into the war in the belief that Italy would finally be elevated to a major European power by acquiring colonies. After the Treaty of Versailles, the Italians, though technically on the winning side, were not accorded equal status as the other major allied states such as France and the United Kingdom. [9] Furthermore, the country did not receive the territories or the new colonies that many Italians had been promised. It soon appears that the country's sacrifices during the war were all in vain and pointless. [10]
The Italian middle class, which was very nationalistic, was especially disappointed. Many grew disenchanted with the country's democratic government model. They came to believe that it could never truly unite the nation and establish it as a world power like France or Britain.
Like many Germans, Italians believed that the old political elite had betrayed the nation. The general population, primarily the Italian middle-class, became increasingly disenchanted with the nation’s political class and system. [11] Mussolini never lost an opportunity to denounce the political class, which increased his popularity.
The end of the war also led to a significant economic crisis in Italy. Unemployment was widespread, as was hunger, especially among the urban poor and in the South of Italy.  This made the Italian political class and even the King, Victor Emanuelle III, extremely unpopular. By 1920, the old political parties were deeply unpopular, and there was a widespread sense in Italian society that change or some revolution was needed to save the country. [12] The postwar economic and political circumstances in Italy created a great deal of unrest and disillusionment. Mussolini was fully prepared to exploit the opportunities.
How did Mussolini's Fascist Organizations become powerful and popular?
By 1920, Mussolini and his fascists were a force to be reckoned with in the land, especially in the industrial north. Within a short period, Mussolini and his party were almost a state within a state. They were soon running a parallel administration in many towns. Mussolini's rise was aided by several factors that were exacerbated by World War I.
There was no leadership at the national or state level. The Italian government was divided, as the country's democratic parties could not come together. The Italian Liberal Party and the Catholic Party refused to work together because of Church-State relations in Italy. This division meant that the country lacked a strong government in the vital period of the war, which, in turn, allowed the Fascists to become a powerful force in the land. [13] Additionally, many people in the government, civil service, and the army were conservatives and somewhat sympathetic to the aims and the rhetoric of Mussolini. His ideology appealed to them.
Mussolini's appeal and the government's weakness meant that Mussolini was rapidly able to build up his power in the country. Mussolini and his Fascists also effectively used violence and terror to gain control. The Black Shirt Squads used violence to intimidate, torture, or even kill those who opposed Mussolini's will. They were feared by many. However, many in the confused post-war period saw them as a source of stability and security, which won them a measure of popular support among many in the middle class. [14]
Why did the Rise of Communism help Mussolini's Rise to Power?
Benito Mussolini and the March on Rome, 1922
The radical left was particularly strong in Italy during the Great War, as it benefitted from the government's unpopularity and the war among the poor and the working class. In 1917, the Italian Socialist Party allied itself with the Soviet Union and agitated for Italy's revolution.
Industrial workers in the major Italian cities had formed themselves into powerful trade unions. During the difficult war years, they frequently went on strike and were often brutally repressed by the Italian police and armies. [15] After the end of the First World War, these strikes paralyzed many cities, and these actions greatly alarmed the middle class and wealthy Italians.
The Italian Socialists usually supported the strikers, and many politicians and commentators believed that there was a real threat of a Russian style revolution in Italy.  Mussolini played upon these fears and exaggerated the threat of a Communist revolution. [16] The Italian middle class was very concerned about the rise of Communism and Socialism because they believed that in any revolution, that they would have their property seized as had been the case in Russia. Many Italians were Catholics, and the rise of the 'Reds' or Socialists was viewed with horror, as they were frequently anti-Catholic and anti-religious. [17]
From 1919, Mussolini’s Fascist Black Shirts fought with Socialists and others in the streets of Italy. The Black Shirt squads were very effective, and they managed to break many strikes and intimidated, injured, and killed many socialists and trade unionists.  This made them very popular among those who feared a revolution. This meant that many in the Italian middle class and elite began to see the Fascists capable of saving Italy from a 'Red' revolution as in Russia. However, many, even some conservatives, were not in favor of Mussolini and his party. Still, he was seen as the lesser of two evils and anything, was better than Communism and Socialism for many upper-class Italians. [18]
What role did Fascist Propaganda play in consolidating Mussolini's power?
The Fascists presented themselves as the saviors of Italy by Mussolini, who was a skillful propagandist. Propaganda is a method of persuading people to do things and commit actions to further some interest group or faction. Mussolini was a pioneer in its use, and an admiring Adolf Hitler would model his public speaking on Mussolini. The Italian Fascists leader was a charismatic speaker, and he spoke in an emotive style that appealed to Italians, which won him many supporters. The Fascists used a series of symbols to associate themselves with Rome and Italy's past glories. The party was named after the Roman symbol of justice - the Fascii. [19]
The use of symbols of such symbols appealed to many Italians when they felt that their nation had been humiliated in the war and by the Treaty of Versailles. Above all, Mussolini's anti-communist rhetoric won him a substantial following in Italy, among all classes. It seems that most Italians, the middle class, the elite and Catholics, all feared communism, particularly, and lived in fear of a revolution. Mussolini was able to portray himself and his party as the defenders of Italy as the only ones who could save the country from the red menace. [20]
What was the March on Rome in 1921?
Fascists March on Rome
However, Mussolini though increasingly popular, was unable to secure power through constitutional means. The Italian Fascist party only won 35 seats in 1921, far less than the Socialists. Still, Mussolini was determined to win power for himself and his Party.  The coalition government was very unpopular, and during a period of instability, the Fascists descended on Rome in their thousands to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister. [21] Some 30,000 Blackshirts traveled from all over Italy, demanding a government change. This became known as the ‘March on Rome.’
Typical of Mussolini, the event was stage-managed and theatrical. The Black Shirts were well drilled and disciplined. This was a deliberate policy of demonstrating that the Fascists were a force that supported law and order and the opposite of the Communists and Socialists, who were seen as dangerous and destabilizing. During the March on Rome, Mussolini made sure he was photographed with the marchers and made many speeches when he repeatedly stated that Itlay was in danger and that only he and his party could save the country. The March on Rome was a theater designed to win him and his party the popular support they needed to seize the country's government. The Fascists arrived in Rome, and many wondered what would occur. Mussolini and others feared that there would be bloodshed and that the army would fire on the marchers. [22]
Was there a right-wing conspiracy to install Mussolini as Prime Minister of Italy?
The Italian army and police could easily have dispersed the Blackshirts, who were unarmed. However, they were allowed to congregate in Rome, and they forced the government from power, and Mussolini became Prime Minister of Italy. [23] Many argued at the time. Since that, this was part of a strategy by the Italian Monarchy, army, landowners, industrialists, and the Catholic Church to allow Mussolini to seize power. They were so afraid of an imminent revolution led by Socialists or Communists that they allowed the Fascists to take power. Many in the conservative elite believed that Mussolini was the only alternative to a ‘Red Revolution.’ [24]
They did not really like Mussolini but believed that he could secure their interests and prevent the country from a Soviet-style revolution. However, they believed that they could manage him and agree not to interfere with their privileges. When Mussolini became Prime Minister, he set about to create a one-party state. However, he did not attempt to interfere with the interests of the Monarchy, army, church, and other members of the elite, who had allowed him to seize power. This was their reward for allowing Mussolini to become the undisputed leader of Italy ‘Il Duce.’ [25]
Conclusion
The Italian Fascists would later portray their seizure of power as a ‘revolution.’ Powerful elites in Italy allowed them to take control in 1921. Italian elites wanted to ensure that Italy did not become a Socialist or Communist country. They saw the establishment of the Fascist government as the best way to avoid this fate. Without the fear of a ‘Red Revolution,’ the Italian army, monarchy, and others would never have allowed Mussolini to assume Rome's power. Mussolini and the Fascists were not the most popular group in Italy, and they could never have come to power by purely democratic means. The fear of the Communist Revolution meant that they were permitted to assume power and stay in power.

Mussolini and his Fascists effectively used violence and terror to gain control.
Introduction
In 1922, Benito Mussolini (Il Duce) came to power as the prime minister of Italy and the leader of the National Fascist Party. At first, he ruled democratically and constitutionally, but in 1925, he turned Italy into a one-party, totalitarian state, and ruled as Italy’s dictator. He forcefully governed Italy until 1943 when the Allied invasion of the country led to his downfall and execution. His rise to power was remarkable. He went from being a journalist and a minor political figure to becoming prime minister of Italy within the space of five years. The fear of a communist revolution abetted his remarkable rise and allowed Mussolini and his fascist party to seize power, with little opposition.
Background
Prior to 1914, Mussolini was a committed socialist. [1] However, when the socialists adopted a policy of neutrality in World War One, Mussolini opposed it and was later expelled from the party. [2] Mussolini was a well-known journalist and had strongly advocated for Italy’s entrance into the war in his newspaper, in 1914. Mussolini was an Italian Nationalist, and he wanted to unify his country, he regularly employed nationalist rhetoric that portrayed Italy as a great power to eliminate regional loyalties that had kept the country divided despite the official unification of the country in 1871.
When Italy did enter the war on the side of the Allies in 1915, Mussolini volunteered and served with distinction on the front. He was severely injured in 1917 and was forced to leave the army. [3] Mussolini, like Hitler, was deeply influenced by the war, and he came to believe that war was essential for a nation, as it would allow it and its people to achieve greatness. Later on, as leader of Italy, he would seize every opportunity to become involved in war and conflict. The war also confirmed Mussolini in his belief that action mattered more than debate and reason, and this was central to his fascist ideology, in turn, this led to the glorification of violence. [4]
After the war, Mussolini founded the Italian Fascist Party. The ideology of the party was a fusion of socialism and nationalism. The Party called for a strong nation led by an elite to guide Italy and to solve its interminable social and economic problems. [5] Mussolini’s new party was attractive to many, especially ex-soldiers. The party soon had genuine mass appeal, and much of this was based on his calls that all Italians unite and overcome their class differences. [6] As the war ended many war veterans joined the new Fascist Party and believed that it offered the best hope for Italy.
Many of these men were unemployed after the war, and they felt that their sacrifices during the war had been in vain. Mussolini cleverly formed squadrons of these veterans and employed them against all those he declared to be the enemies of Italy. These squads of former soldiers became known as ‘Blackshirts,’ and they proved to be a formidable paramilitary force. [7]
Impact of World War I

Italy’s military performed dismally during the war and had sustained extremely high casualties, and there had also been mass desertions. Many people and especially soldiers were disenchanted with the political class’ handling of the war. They were widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and many held them personally responsible for the country’s failings during the war. The Italian political system, though technically a democracy was in reality dominated by the traditional landowning and business elite. [8]
The Italians had entered into the First World War on the side of the Allies, and they had been promised new territories and colonies. Many Italians had supported the country’s entry into the war in the belief that Italy would finally be elevated to a major European power by acquiring colonies. After the Treaty of Versailles, the Italians, though technically on the winning side, were not accorded equal status as the other major allied states such as France and the United Kingdom. [9] Furthermore, the country did not receive the territories or the new colonies that many Italians, they had been promised and it soon appears that the country’s sacrifices during the war, were all in vain and pointless. [10]
The Italian middle class, which was very nationalistic were especially disappointed, and many grow disenchanted with the country’s democratic model of government and came to believe that it could never truly unite the nation and establish it as a world power, like France or Britain.
Like many Germans, Italians believed that the old political elite had betrayed the nation. The general population, primarily the Italian middle-class, became increasingly disenchanted with the nation’s political class and system. [11] Mussolini never lost an opportunity to denounce the political class, and this increased his popularity.
The end of the war also led to a significant economic crisis in Italy. Unemployment was widespread, as was hunger, especially among the urban poor and in the South of Italy. This made the Italian political class and even the King, Victor Emanuelle III, extremely unpopular. By 1920, the old political parties were deeply unpopular, and there was a widespread sense in Italian society that change or some revolution was needed to save the country. [12] The postwar economic and political circumstances in Italy created a great deal or unrest and disillusionment and Mussolini was fully prepared to exploit the opportunities.
Fascist Organizations and Use of Violence

By 1920, Mussolini and his Fascists were a force to be reckoned with in the land, especially in the industrial north. Within a short period, he and his party were almost a state within a state. They were soon running a parallel administration in many towns. Mussolini’s rise was aided by several factors that were exacerbated by World War I.
There was no leadership at the national or state level. The Italian government was divided, as the country’s democratic parties could not come together. The Italian Liberal party and the Catholic Party refused to work together, because of the issue of Church-State relations in Italy. This division meant that the country lacked a strong government in the vital period of the war and this, in turn, allowed the Fascists to become a powerful force in the land. [13] Additionally, many people in the government, civil service, and the army were conservatives and somewhat sympathetic to the aims and the rhetoric of Mussolini. His ideology appealed to them.
Mussolini’s appeal and the weakness of the government meant that Mussolini was rapidly able to build up his power in the country. Mussolini and his Fascists also effectively used violence and terror to gain control. The Black Shirt Squads who used violence to intimidate, torture or even kill those who opposed the will of Mussolini. They were feared by many, however, many in the confused post-war period saw them as a source of stability and security, and this won them a measure of popular support, among many in the middle class. [14]
The Rise of Communism

The radical left was particularly strong in Italy during the Great War, as it benefitted from the unpopularity of the government, and the war among the poor and the working class. In 1917, the Italian Socialist Party allied itself with the Soviet Union and agitated for a revolution in Italy. Industrial workers in the major Italian cities had formed themselves into powerful trade unions. They frequently went on strike, during the difficult war years, and were often brutally repressed by the Italian police and armies. [15] After the end of the First World War, many cities were paralyzed by these strikes and these actions greatly alarmed the middle class and wealthy Italians.
The Italian Socialists usually supported the strikers and many politicians and commentators believed that there was a real threat of a Russian style revolution in Italy. Mussolini played upon these fears and exaggerated the threat of a Communist revolution. [16] The Italian middle class was very concerned about the rise of Communism and Socialism because they believed that in any revolution, that they would have their property seized as had been the case in Russia. Many Italians were Catholics, and the rise of the ‘Reds’ or Socialists was viewed with horror, as they were frequently anti-Catholic and anti-religious. [17]
From 1919, Mussolini’s Fascist Black Shirts fought with Socialists and others in the streets of Italy. The Black Shirt squads were very effective, and they managed to break many strikes and intimidated, injured and killed many socialists and trade unionists. This made them very popular among those who feared a revolution. This meant that many in the Italian middle class and elite began to see the Fascists as capable of saving Italy from a ‘Red’ revolution as in Russia. However, many, even some conservatives were not in favor of Mussolini and his party, but he was seen as the lesser of two evils and anything was better than Communism and Socialism for many upper-class Italians. [18]
Fascist Propaganda
The Fascists presented themselves as the saviors of Italy by Mussolini who was a skillful propagandist. Propaganda is a method of persuading people to do things and commit actions to further some interest group or faction. Mussolini was a pioneer in its use, and an admiring Adolf Hitler would model his public speaking on Mussolini. The leader of the Italian Fascists was a charismatic speaker, and he spoke in an emotive style that appealed to Italians, and this won him many supporters. The Fascists used a series of symbols to associate themselves with Rome and the glories of Italy’s past. The party was named after the Roman symbol of justice – the Fascii. [19] The use of symbols of such symbols appealed to many Italians at a time when they felt that their nation had been humiliated in the war and by the Treaty of Versailles. Above all, it was Mussolini’s anti-communist rhetoric that won him a substantial following in Italy, among all classes. It seems that the majority of Italians, the middle class, the elite and Catholics, all feared communism, in particular, and lived in fear of a revolution. Mussolini was able to portray himself and his party as the defenders of Italy as the only one’s who could save the country from the red menace. [20]
March on Rome

However, Mussolini though increasingly popular was unable to secure power through constitutional means. The Italian Fascist party only won 35 seats in the election of 1921, far less than the Socialists. Still, Mussolini was determined to win power for himself and his Party. The coalition government was very unpopular and during a period of instability, the Fascists descended on Rome in their thousands, to demand the resignation of the Prime Minister. [21] Some 30,000 Blackshirts traveled from all over Italy demanding a change in the government. This became known as the ‘March on Rome’.
Typical of Mussolini the event was stage managed and theatrical. The Black Shirts were well drilled and disciplined. This was a deliberate policy of demonstrating that the Fascists were a force that supported law and order and the opposite of the Communists and Socialists who were seen as dangerous and destabilizing. During the March on Rome, Mussolini made sure he was photographed with the marchers and made many speeches when he repeatedly stated that Itlay was in danger and that only he and his party could save the country. the March on Rome was a piece of theater designed to win him and his party the popular support they needed to seize the government of the country. The Fascists arrived in Rome and many wondered what would occur. Mussolini and others feared that there would be bloodshed and that the army would fire on the marchers. [22]
A Conspiracy?
The Italian army and police could easily have dispersed the Blackshirts, who were unarmed. However, they were allowed to congregate in Rome and they forced the government from power and Mussolini became Prime Minister of Italy. [23] Many argued at the time and since that this was part of a strategy by the Italian Monarchy, army, landowners, industrialists and the Catholic Church to allow Mussolini to seize power. They were so afraid of an imminent revolution led by Socialists or Communists that they allowed the Fascist to take power. Many in the conservative elite believed that Mussolini was the only alternative to a ‘Red Revolution.’ [24] They did not really like Mussolini but believed that he could secure their interests and prevent the country from a Soviet-style revolution. However, they believed that they could manage him and that he would agree not to interfere with their privileges. When Mussolini became Prime Minister, he set about to create a one-party state. However, he did not attempt to interfere with the interests of the Monarchy, army, church and other members of the elite, who had allowed him to seize power. This was their reward for allowing Mussolini to become the undisputed leader of Italy ‘Il Duce.’ [25]
Conclusion
The Italian Fascists would later portray their seizure of power as a ‘revolution.’ Powerful elites in Italy allowed them to take control in 1921. Italian elites wanted to ensure that Italy did not become a Socialist or Communist country. They saw the establishment of the Fascist government as the best way to avoid this fate. Without the fear of a ‘Red Revolution,’ the Italian army, monarchy, and others would never have allowed Mussolini to assume power in Rome. Mussolini and the Fascists were not the most popular group in Italy and they could never have come to power by purely democratic means. The fear of Communist Revolution meant that they were permitted to assume power and stay in power.

Okay, so I have some information about Mussolini and his rise to power. It seems that he was initially a socialist but shifted his views after World War I and formed the Italian Fascist Party. His party gained popularity due to the economic and political turmoil in Italy after the war, and he used violence and propaganda to suppress opposition and seize power.

I need to connect this to how his rise to power contributed to World War II. So, once Mussolini became the dictator of Italy, he formed an alliance with Hitler, which was known as the Axis powers. Together, they pursued aggressive expansionist policies, which eventually led to the outbreak of World War II.

Mussolini's alliance with Hitler provided Germany with additional military support and helped to spread the war beyond Europe. So, his rise to power was instrumental in the formation of the Axis powers and the expansion of the war.

Now, moving on to Japan and Emperor Hirohito. I need to find out how his leadership contributed to the causes of World War II.

What Did Emperor Hirohito Do in WWII?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 31, 2020
Underwood Archives/Archive Photos/Getty Images
Emperor HIrohito had a big role in Japan’s attacks on not only other Asian countries during World War II, but against the United States as well. The most notable of these attacks was the Pearl Harbor attack on Dec. 7, 1941.
Hirohito allied Japan with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in 1940. He signed a pact with the other leaders promising to support the other countries when needed. This pact came to fruition in 1941 with Pearl Harbor. Although the United States had not yet entered the war, this attack propelled them into World War II with a vengeance. While the United States fought Germany on one front, it battled Japan on another as the later settled into several island countries in Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies and British Singapore. Despite the United State’s position of power in the region in 1942, Hirohito refused to surrender until the atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Aug. 15, 1945. Days later Hirohito admitted defeat.
World War II devastated Japan. Hirohito’s power was stripped from him, and he became nothing more than a figurehead with the real power going to elected officials. He remained as monarch until his death in 1989.

Emperor Hirohito
Born in 1901, Hirohito was Emperor of Japan from 1926-1989.
Under his rule, Japan emerged as one of the greatest economic powers in the world. As the only one of the leaders listed here to have inherited his power, there was no contested election: when his father died in 1926, he assumed the throne.
His early years in power saw economic difficulties throughout the country, and an increased military presence in government. In February 1936, a military coup was attempted, which he quickly had quashed. In the early 1930s, Japan was engaged in the Sino-Japanese War, during which Hirohito controversially authorised the use of chemical weapons against the Chinese. In 1940, Japan entered into the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, despite the fact that Hirohito expressed reluctance where the war was concerned. He emphasised his desire for peaceful resolutions, but the consensus at the Imperial Conference was in favour of war. In December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, declaring war on the Allied forces.
Once Japan had entered into the war, Hirohito sought to boost spirits around the country, and took an active interest in the progress of the Japanese Army. In the latter years of the war, the public were being told of great victories when there were none, and discontentment grew as Japan neared defeat. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Hirohito told his ministers to hasten a surrender, which eventually came in August 1945.
There has been much academic and historical debate as to whether or not Hirohito should have been tried as a war criminal after the war, and how much control he had over the actions of the Japanese armed forces during the conflict. There was immediate pressure after Japan’s surrender for Hirohito to abdicate, which he refused to do. He was later forced to abandon claims that he – as Emperor – had divine power over Japan, and in 1946, his title changed from ‘imperial sovereign’ to ‘constitutional monarch’. The rest of his life was spent in a way appropriate of a constitutional monarch, attempting to repair the damage to Japan’s diplomatic relations with visits overseas. He died in 1989.

Hirohito Facts
On December 26, 1926, Hirohito became the 124 th Emperor of Japan. Like the monarchs of Europe, Hirohito's power was limited; but by all accounts he supported the military's actions before and during World War II and was in favor of the alliance with Germany and Italy. The first time Hirohito was heard by his people was when he announced Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, which due to the type of language he used, was only understood by the most educated Japanese. After the war, American prosecutors believed that Hirohito did not wield enough power to be held responsible for war crimes, so he was not prosecuted and was allowed to continue his reign as emperor. With that said, many scholars and experts believe that Hirohito was equally culpable of war crimes as some of Japan's leaders who were executed. Hirohito was born on April 29, 1901 to crown prince and future emperor of Japan, Taisho, and the future empress Teimei. As the eldest son of his parents, he was the crown prince and trained to be the emperor from a young age. He married the Princess Nagako Kuni, who later was known as the Empiress Kojun, in 1924. The couple would have seven children.
Interesting Hirohito Facts:
Hirohito is known referred to as "Showa" or "Emperor Showa" as that was the era of his rule.
Hirohito survived an assassination attempt in 1923 by a Japanese communist.
Show means "enlightened peace" in Japanese.
Hirohito survived a second and even closer assassination attempt in 1932. The would be assassin was a Korean independence activist named Lee Bong-chang.
There was also a 1925 plot against Hirohito's life, but in that case the would be assassins were arrested in the planning stage.
Although many in Japan have mitigated Hirohito's role in World War II, all of the evidence shows that he fully supported Japan's imperial ambitions in Asia and supported the alliance with Germany and Italy. With that said, the emperor was clearly influenced by his cabinet, advisors, and military high-command.
The imperial family decided to choose a non-royal as prime minister before the war to give the family a degree of cover. Hirohito chose Hideki Tojo, who was a hardline militarist and pro-fascist.
After the war, the American military occupation forces saw Hirohito as a figure head who was manipulated by career politicians and the military high-command. This attitude was reflected in the Asian war crimes trials where most of those tried and convicted were members of the Japanese military.
Although there were calls from within the Japanese royal family for Hirohito to abdicate his throne, General MacArthur and other members of the U.S. military supported his rule so he stayed in power.
Despite not being tried for war crimes or stripped of his title, Hirohito was forced to denounce his claim to divinity.
Hirohito's post-war leadership was peaceful and focused on bringing investment to Japan. Thanks in part to Hirohito's efforts, Japan experienced an economic boom after the war that lasted until the early 1990s.
Hirohito died on January 7, 1989 of cancer at the age of eighty-seven.

Emperor Hirohito
Hirohito (1901-1989), known posthumously as Emperor Shōwa, was emperor of Japan during World War II and is Japan’s longest-serving monarch in history.
BACKGROUND
Hirohito was born in Tokyo during the Meiji Period to the son of the reigning emperor. His father ascended the throne in 1912. In 1921, Hirohito visited Europe; a first for a crown prince of Japan. He was married in 1924 and became emperor in 1926 (after serving as regent for his father).
The emperor was regarded by many as a divine figure according to the traditions of Buddhist and Shinto sects in Japan. In this same tradition, the Japanese nation and race were divinely chosen and protected. The divinity of the emperor was a key component of the concept of the “imperial way,” or kodo, an ideology comparable to manifest destiny in the United States. Kodo promoted subordination of individual citizens to the state and encouraged imperialist expansion. Hirohito’s government advocated this philosophy throughout the period leading up to World War II and this ideology was pervasive throughout society including government and education.
Hirohito presided over the invasion of China, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and eventually, the Japanese surrender to the Allies. Many historical sources have portrayed Hirohito as powerless. Often these sorces characterized the emperor as constrained by military advisers that were making all the decisions. Some sources have even portrayed him as pacifist. Hirohito was not tried for war crimes, as many members of the Japanese government were. Some leaders of the occupying Allied forces went to great lengths to corroborate his innocence because they believed that preserving the emperor’s office would be useful for carrying out governmental change.
THE DEBATE OVER HIS ROLE
But a growing number of scholars, including Herbert P. Bix in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, have said that Hirohito wielded more power than he was given credit for by these types of sources. Scholars who back this alternative narrative attribute the public perception that he was powerless to a concerted effort in Japan to exonerate the emperor. This group of scholars believe that there was an advantage to portraying Hirohito as not responsible for the state’s actions at the end of the war. There are clear historical instances, however, where Hirohito decisively exercised his power. In one instance, in 1936, he moved swiftly to put down a coup among Japanese military leaders. When Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe stepped down in 1941, Hirohito rejected Konoe’s nomination for a replacement. This cleared the way for the elevation of the hawkish and dictatorial Hideki Tojo.
Bix and other authors fault Hirohito for some of the more egregious crimes committed by the Japanese military. The emperor’s office signed off on uses of chemical weapons during the war in China. They posit that Hirohito also knew about the mistreatment of prisoners of war and about the murder of civilians in Nanking, but did not try to stop these war crimes or punish military leaders despite his ability to do so. These cases fit a larger pattern of blame being place upon Hirohito's inaction.
This inaction persisted even where action could have prevented war. The invasion of Manchuria started without orders from Tokyo, but Hirohito acquiesced after being assured that the military could succeed in expanding his empire. Before the war with the US, he underestimated American objections to his foreign policy of formally allying himself with Germany and Italy. He also indicated initial reluctance to go to war, but later confirmed the plan to attack Pearl Harbor despite the objections of some of his advisers. He increased his control over military affairs in the lead-up to Pearl Harbor and attended the Conference of Military Councillors (which was unusual). Additonally he asked for more details on the plans for attack. According to an aide, he showed visible joy at the news of the success of the surprise attacks.
THE SURRENDER DECISION
Hirohito first becomes relevant to the history of the Manhattan Project when he approved of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941. America's official declaration of war against the Axis accelerated the research effort towards creating an atomic weapon. Additionally, the attack on Pearl Harbor was later used as part of President Truman’s rationale for using nuclear weapons against Japan. Some historians point to evidence that Emperor Hirohito had a chance to end the war earlier when it became clear that Japan could not win. Prince Fumimaro Konoe was the only senior statesman that implored Hirohito to start discussing terms of surrender when the emperor called a meeting of his advisors on February 14, 1945. However, Hirohito did not take Konoe's advice, maintaining hope through August that the Soviet Union could serve as an intermediary for a negotiated peace. Maintaining the emperor’s office was also a key concern of many other Japanese officials, which caused them to reject demands for unconditional surrender, including the Potsdam Declaration.
Hirohito is generally considered to not have had a very "hands on" role in commanding Japan's military, despite his ability to order a surrender. This, along with the idea that the Japanese people would be too demoralized by the complete removal of their emperor, is why Hirohito was not tried for war crimes in the same manner as Prime Minister Hideki Tojo after surrender. Because of this, Hirohito's next significant connection to the history of the Manhattan Project came at the end of the war when surrender began to be discussed later on in 1945.
Hirohito learned of the nuclear attack on Hiroshima at 7:50 pm, local time, on August 6, 1945; approximately twelve hours after it had taken place. Two days later, the emperor admitted that the war could not continue. However, neither the emperor nor the Japanese Cabinet were willing to accept unconditional surrender at that time. On August 9th, the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and the Soviet Union began its invasion of Japanese occupied territory and the next day, the emperor's cabinet drafted an "Imperial Rescript ending the War." On August 12th, Hirohito declared his intention to accept the Potsdam Declaration to the imperial family.
However, this acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration was not yet officially recognized as the end of the war. Cabinet officials continued to debate conditions of surrender, including how best to preserve imperial power and status. Additionally, during this period after Hirohito's acceptance of the need to surrender but before its official declaration to the Allied forces, there was an unsuccessful attempted coup by a group who wanted to continue the war. Hirohito’s decision was final, however, and his loss of faith in the war effort forced the hands of both politicians and military men who might have prolonged the fighting.
Hirohito announced his surrender to the Japanese people in an historic radio broadcast. This broadcast was the first time that a Japanese emperor had ever addressed the nation in such a manner. Delivered in formal and elaborate form of Japanese, the “Jewel Voice Broadcast”  was notable both for what Hirohito did not say―he never used the word “surrender”―and for what he did say. Emperor Hirohito continued to justify Japan’s aggression during the war, but also put forth a new national mission: “To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects.” This new mission was very different from the traditional imperial ideologies of Hakko Ichiu and Kodo, which the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1948 sites as, "a constitutional rallying-point, and an appeal to the patriotism of the Japanese people" to support imperialist and militarist policies.
The Jewel Voice Broadcast also addressed the existance of “a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to damage is indeed incalculable.” However, historians continue to debate how much the bomb actually influenced Japan's decision to surrender. Herbert P. Bix, the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning book Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, does not dispute the impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but he emphasizes Japanese leaders’ fears of a populist uprising. Others, including Tsuyoshi Hasegawa, have argued that the Soviet invasion was more influential in the decision to surrender than the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Soviet invasion destroyed Hirohito’s last hope of a negotiated peace, although, unbeknownst to him, the Soviets had been planning this invasion for months.
AFTER THE WAR AND LATER LIFE
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Hirohito renounced the divinity of the emperor and signed a new constitution drafted by the occupying US forces. This new constitution reduced the emperor's power to that of a figurehead. Hirohito visited Hiroshima in 1947 and continued to publicly mourn the deaths that took place during the atomic attacks throughout his life. He also expressed some contrition for his role in the war. In 1971, Emperor Hirohito expressed that there were parts of the war that he felt “personally sorry for.”
After the war, Hirohito became more open than any emperor had been before. He regularly appeared in public and made details of his life publicly available. He visited the United States in 1975, meeting with President Ford and placing a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Hirohito pursued a life-long interest of his by conducting research in marine biology. The emperor died in 1989 at the Imperial Palace and was succeeded by his son Akihito. In Japan, the emperor takes the name of his era once he dies. The name for his era was chosen early on in his reign and now Hirohito is posthumously referred to as “Shōwa.”

“That’s all you have to say! I think the highest symbol of human irresponsibility is the Emperor! Followed by officers like you!”
​- Okuzaki, The Wages of Guilt: Memories of War in Germany and Japan.
Skip to main content
​Emperor Hirohito was a complex political figure of war: he was responsible for the rise and fall of Imperial Japan before and after World War 2.  He ascended to the Japanese throne on December 25th, 1926; a significant time in history for Japanese imperialism view which led to expansionism until Japan’s surrender to the Allied forces at the end of the war. Although he was as responsible as the rest of his army in committing crimes in the Pacific Asia War, he was able to negotiate with the west to escape prosecution. In fact, he was not even called as a witness during the whole Tokyo Trial as his deal with the United States kept the Supreme Shrine out of the trial. Under his leadership, not only did Japan would rise industrially in just 80 years, Japan would emerge a new era in the reconstruction of modern Japan.
Since the day he was born, he was regarded as a deity traditionally by the nation-state a symbol of Japanese unity and imperial greatness. However, the people on the political left did not feel the same about imperialism as the right, and on February 26th 1926, a coup was staged by young officers disgruntled by the upper classes neglect of their citizens and only focusing on building their own wealth. Emperor Hirohito was almost assassinated through this episode of the uprising.  Although this coup failed and the young officers were executed causing social chaos, this incident shaped the way he ruled. He was more careful than any other emperors before him and hid behind his counsel. The right used this incident to make the monarchy to shift his policies more right and nationalistic.
​This rising nationalistic sentiment was transferred into the education system. Racism against their neighboring countries was introduced in the schools. Children were taught that they were better than people from other nations. Racism would make it easier for them to erase any guilt when murdering their supposed inferiors.
During his reign, Hirohito was known as a man of mystery. His notes and letters were often confusing to his cabinet. In his notes, he did not initially want to pursue the war but went along the decisions of ministers that saw war as a method to generate revenue and escape their depression to boost their economy. Although there are myths after the war that depict him as merely a figurehead of the Japanese state influenced by the sole decision making by the military, it was far from the truth. Hirohito often reprimanded his generals when they took decisive military action without his stamp of approval.
For example, on September 8th, 1937, the Marco Polo bridge incident in China would escalate into a full- scale war led to full-scale Sino-Japanese war, Hirohito played an active role in directing his military. According to Bix, author of Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, “But once he had learned the true facts, he not only failed to punish the wrongdoers but actively joined in aiding and abetting the army’s seizure of Manchuria. In these ways, Hirohito allowed the military in general and army field commanders, in particular, to effectively take over Japan’s China policy and turn it openly aggressive”. The myth of the Emperor not having significant military influence as a passive emperor has been debunked and his decision making during the war was a national effort between his general, cabinets, and ministers. He also had the reservation to either approve or disapprove judgments to declare war. He was aware of the atrocities during the Pacific Asia War but did nothing to stop them.
He was also briefed and consulted about the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 and the Kamikaze attacks on the American Island that housed their naval fleet and American troops that were harmed during this attack which propelled American participation into the Pacific War. Since the Emperor part of the decision making during the war, the myth of him being a political figurehead or “puppet Emperor” was eliminated. Hirohito’s most trusted adviser Hideki Tojo strategically wanted to eliminate any possible help that Chiang Kai Sheik's troops would have from the Americans. One of their motives were that they were slighted by the United States decision to sell them oil and steel which they desperately needed to further their war efforts. Thus, expanding their territories into places where they would have resources that they would need for survival in the war to support their troops, manufacture weapons, as well as general labor from their territories. Pearl Harbor was an entryway to accessing the Philippines as well which was an American territory at the time. The Philippines were also attacked 10 hours after Pearl Harbor. There were three main reasons why the Japanese went to seize the Philippines right after Pearl Harbor. One was to remove it as a base for Americans, supplies, and lastly to connect the lines of communications for them and the home islands. The outcome was a success and it was noted that the Emperor was very pleased with the outcome of the attack on Pearl Harbor by his adviser Hideki Tojo.
Near the end of the war, he refused to surrender after the first atomic bomb was dropped. At this point in the war, it was obvious that Japan had no opportunity of winning the war. His refusal to surrender only led to the 2nd atomic bomb, which got him desperate to surrender. But he was also too afraid to face justice and decided to strike a deal with MacArthur to avoid facing trial.
Near the end of the war, he would be denying any allegations of him as a war criminal that provided a written account of what his responsibilities were during the war that depicted his innocence.
After his announcement of his decision to surrender to the Japanese populace on August 5th, 1945 he was the first Emperor to directly speak to the general public. After the war, he was protected by the Cold War as well as the United States. Emperor Hirohito became an ordinary again after the war and Japan became an important base for the United States during the Cold War.  MacArthur protected him from facing trials as a war criminal not only due to the Cold War strategy but also due to the necessity in keeping Japan unified during post-war reconstruction to prevent revolts from those who were devastated by the atomic bomb. He remained on the throne as a constitutional monarch for 42 years until his death on January 7th, 1989.

Alright, so I've got some information about Emperor Hirohito of Japan. He was the emperor during World War II and played a significant role in Japan's involvement in the war. It seems that there's some debate about how much direct control he had over the military's actions, but many historians believe that he was actively involved and supportive of Japan's expansionist policies.

From what I've read, Hirohito was emperor from 1926 to 1989, making him the longest-reigning monarch in Japanese history. He was seen as a divine figure in Japanese culture, which added to his authority and influence. During his rule, Japan underwent rapid industrialization and sought to expand its empire, leading to conflicts in Asia and eventually World War II.

One key event was Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, which Hirohito reportedly approved, although there's some controversy about the extent of his involvement. He also supported Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy in 1940. The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, which brought the United States into the war, was authorized by Hirohito.

During the war, Hirohito was informed about various atrocities committed by the Japanese military, such as the use of chemical weapons in China and the mistreatment of prisoners of war, but there's debate about whether he took any action to stop these practices.

As the war turned against Japan, particularly after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Hirohito finally agreed to surrender. He made a radio address to the nation announcing Japan's capitulation, which was a significant moment because it was the first time many Japanese people had heard his voice.

After the war, Hirohito was not tried for war crimes, partly due to the efforts of Allied leaders who believed that maintaining his position would help stabilize Japan during the occupation. His role was downplayed, and he was portrayed as a figurehead who was manipulated by the military leadership.

However, some historians argue that Hirohito had more direct control and was complicit in war crimes. For example, Herbert P. Bix's book "Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan" presents evidence that Hirohito was deeply involved in决策-making and even approved the use of certain tactics, including the use of chemical weapons.

In summary, Hirohito's role in World War II is complex and subject to differing interpretations. While some see him as a reluctant leader who was manipulated by the military, others view him as an active participant in Japan's aggressive policies and war crimes.

Now, connecting this back to the original question: how did the rise of dictators cause World War II? Well, in the case of Japan, Hirohito's leadership and support for expansionist policies were key factors in Japan's entry into the war and its aggressive actions in Asia and the Pacific.

Similarly, in Germany, Hitler's rise to power and his aggressive foreign policies led to the invasion of Poland in 1939, which directly triggered World War II in Europe.

In Italy, Mussolini's fascist regime aligned with Hitler and expanded the conflict, particularly in North Africa and the Mediterranean.

So, the rise of these dictators and their authoritarian regimes, coupled with their expansionist ambitions and aggressive policies, were central causes of World War II.

I think I have a good understanding now of how these leaders came to power and how their actions led to the outbreak of the war. It's clear that their dictatorial rule and pursuit of power and territory created an environment that inevitably led to global conflict.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The rise of dictators such as Hitler in Germany, Mussolini in Italy, and Hirohito in Japan, with their expansionist policies and aggressive actions, directly contributed to the outbreak of World War II.}} \]
