Alright, so I need to figure out how people feel about taxation. That seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, taxation is something that affects everyone in some way, right? It's how governments fund their operations and provide public services. So, people's feelings about taxation might vary based on their personal experiences, political views, and economic situations.

I think it would be helpful to look at this from different perspectives. Maybe start by considering different age groups, income levels, and political affiliations. For example, younger people might feel differently about taxation compared to older adults, especially if they perceive that their tax dollars are being used for programs that benefit different demographics.

Also, people's opinions might be influenced by how they see their tax money being spent. If they feel that the government is efficient and transparent in its use of funds, they might be more positive about paying taxes. On the other hand, if there's a perception of waste or corruption, that could lead to resentment towards taxation.

It might also be useful to look at historical perspectives. How have attitudes towards taxation changed over time? Maybe there are trends or patterns that can give insight into current feelings.

Moreover, the level of taxation probably plays a role. People might be more accepting of higher taxes if they receive more benefits in return, like better public services or social safety nets. Conversely, those who believe in smaller government might prefer lower taxes even if that means less government intervention in various areas.

I should also consider international perspectives. Different countries have different tax systems and cultural attitudes towards taxation. Comparing these could provide a broader understanding of how people feel about taxation in general.

Maybe I can look up some polls or studies that have been conducted on this topic. Seeing actual data on people's opinions would be really helpful. I can search for recent surveys or articles that discuss public sentiment towards taxation.

Let me try to structure this better. Perhaps I can think about the following aspects:

1. **Perception of Fairness:** Do people feel that the tax system is fair? Is it progressive, regressive, or flat? How does this affect their feelings?

2. **Trust in Government:** As I mentioned earlier, trust in how tax money is used is crucial. If people trust their government, they might be more willing to pay taxes.

3. **Economic Impact:** How do taxes affect individuals' wallets? Are people satisfied with the trade-off between taxes and public services?

4. **Political Ideology:** Different political ideologies have varying views on the role of government and, consequently, on taxation.

5. **Educational Level:** Does understanding of how tax systems work influence people's opinions?

6. **Media Influence:** How does media coverage shape public opinion on taxation?

I should probably start by gathering some general information on taxation and public opinion. Maybe look at resources like Pew Research Center, Gallup polls, or other reputable sources that conduct surveys on public sentiment.

Let me consider performing a web search to find some recent data on this topic.

U.S. Public Opinion and the 2017 Tax Law
Polling Matters
April 29, 2019
U.S. Public Opinion and the 2017 Tax Law
by Frank Newport
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is not turning out like President Donald Trump and the Republicans hoped it would -- at least, based on the public opinion data we have to date. Americans remain more likely to disapprove than approve of the law, with 40% approval and 49% disapproval in Gallup's latest update. Other recent polls confirm that the tax reform law is viewed more negatively than positively -- including surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center (36% approve/49% disapprove), Monmouth University (34% approve/43% disapprove), and Economist/YouGov (34% support/40% oppose).
Shortly after the law was passed, Trump claimed that it had "set off a tidal wave of good news that continues to grow every single day," and he more recently re-emphasized his view of the positive impact of the law: "We promised that these tax cuts would be rocket fuel for the American economy, and we were absolutely right."
But the public remains less than enthusiastic. Here are five reasons why:
1. Partisanship
The law was created by and highly identified with Trump and the Republicans; not one Democratic member of the House or the Senate voted in favor of the bill. This extreme partisanship is evident in views of the bill across partisan groups. As my colleague Megan Brennan found in Gallup's most recent update on taxes: "Democrats' approval of the law is 16% and Republicans' is 78%. Independents' approval stands at 32%."
The remarkable impact of partisanship these days means that Republicans and Democrats look at much of what is going on around them (and to a degree what is going on in their personal lives) through the lens of their party affiliation. The tax situation is no different. Republicans extol the virtues of the new law, while Democrats decry it. With these baked-in attitudes, it becomes difficult for the law to gain majority approval.
2. Americans are confused about changes in their taxes and find it hard to compute the new law's impact.
Gallup's data show that 43% of Americans are unsure how the 2017 bill affected their taxes. Pew research similarly shows that over four in 10 Americans don't know what effect the TCJA had on their taxes -- and that only 26% of Americans say they understand the new tax law "very well."
In reality, taxes did go down for the majority of Americans in 2018 as a result of the new law, and few saw them go up. As the Tax Policy Center concluded: "About 65% of households paid less in individual income taxes in 2018 as a result of the TCJA. About 6% paid more. The rest paid about the same."
However, and this is a real key, there is no evidence of widespread recognition of this reality on Americans' part. In addition to those who can't say what effect the law had, Gallup's latest survey shows that 21% of Americans say their taxes went up in 2018, compared with only 14% who say their taxes went down (21% say they stayed the same). A number of other surveys show the same type of result.
Part of this no doubt has to do with Americans' confusing their tax refunds with what they actually paid in taxes in 2018 (two significantly different things). The IRS adjusted workers' withholding in 2018 to take the new law into account, meaning that many Americans had a reduction in withholding from their paychecks in 2018. As a result, many got smaller refunds when they filed their taxes in 2019. This is a good thing in principle, according to experts (why loan the government money all year and receive no interest?) but many Americans may believe that getting a lower refund equates with having paid more in taxes.
Had the IRS not adjusted withholding in 2018, Americans would have gotten larger refunds than they were used to this year, which might in turn have led to a more positive view of the impact of the new law.
3. Americans were not all that enthusiastic about the new tax law to begin with.
There is little evidence that Americans were clamoring for a new tax law in 2017 before it was passed. The tax law received a very negative reading from the public in early December 2017, and, as I have noted, Americans have been negative about it ever since. Trump and Republican leaders have been unable to alter these apparently set-in-stone attitudes; the public as a whole remains negative.
All of this arises out of Americans' complex set of attitudes about taxes. Americans in recent years have generally been divided on whether the amount they pay in taxes is too high, about right or too low, although the "too high" percentage went up in 2016 and has edged down for the past two years. At the same time, a majority have continued to report that the amount they pay in taxes is fair.
My reading of these and other data is that -- everything else being equal -- Americans are OK with the concept of cutting taxes. In January 2017, in fact, "reduc[ing] income taxes for all Americans" scored high on the list for priorities for the new Trump administration. But despite this positive reaction to the general idea of cutting taxes, we have little evidence that taxes are a pressing priority based on open-ended, top-of-mind data. At no point in all of 2017 did more than 2% of Americans mention taxes as the most important problem facing the nation. Taxes have not appeared in "most important problem" lists in any significant way in years.
So, while the general idea of cutting taxes resonates with a reasonable percentage of the population, and while slightly more than half of Americans said their taxes were too high in 2017, these underlying sentiments did not result (and have not resulted) in strong approbation for the TCJA. Americans were negative on the law before Congress voted on it in late 2017, and once established, these views haven't moved much since.
4. Americans are not convinced that tax cuts for the rich and for corporations are beneficial.
A majority of Americans have long believed that upper-income Americans and corporations pay too little in taxes. Did the new law address this situation? Americans say "no." Polling evidence shows that Americans (correctly) perceived that the law did little to change this and in fact benefited corporations and the rich.
A CNBC poll in March found that Americans were about seven times as likely to say the federal tax cut benefited large corporations a lot as they were to say it benefited them personally a lot (48% vs. 7%). Almost half of Americans said the new tax law had not benefited them at all, compared with only 7% who said it had not benefited large corporations.
A CBS News poll found that large majorities of Americans believe the tax law had benefited corporations and the wealthy, while a much smaller percentage said the tax law had made their own taxes go down.
And a Pew Research poll conducted in late March showed that Americans were much more concerned about the amount of taxes the wealthy and corporations pay than they were about the amount they paid themselves.
To be sure, tax-law supporters didn't claim the law would increase taxes on the rich and on corporations, but rather argued that cuts in taxes for these groups would in classic trickle-down fashion produce broad economic benefits.
And, since the bill's passage, the economy has been strong. There has been more hiring and reduced unemployment, and the stock market has risen to new heights. Gallup data show that Americans have recognized the increasingly positive economy over the past several years, and have seen a much-improved job market.
But we don't have evidence that the public believes the tax law's cuts in taxes for corporations and the rich were directly responsible for these economic improvements. It appears difficult to get the average American to buy into the idea that everyone benefits from giving more money to large corporations (about which the public tends to hold quite negative attitudes) and to their already well-paid executives. Trump and the Republicans have apparently failed to connect these dots in the minds of the average American, dampening potential approval for the TCJA.
5. The tax bill did not address the huge elephant in the room: massive citizen distrust of government.
Americans have great distrust and lack of confidence in government. One might think that giving government less money in taxes fits in with those sentiments (that is, sending less money to a government they distrust), but I think it's more complex than that. Americans, in my view, are as interested in how government spends the money it has as they are in incremental reductions in how much they send the government.
Keep in mind that the government and the way it operates is the No. 1 problem facing the nation, according to Americans, and has been, with a few exceptions, for several years now. By contrast, as I have noted, few Americans tell us that high taxes are the most important problem facing the nation.
So massive new legislation that mainly reduces taxes addresses only one side of the "money in-money out" equation. The TCJA does little to attempt to fix "money out" side -- the way the government uses the tax money it does get. Despite broad distrust of government, the public appreciates a lot of things government does, even if revenues are cut down somewhat through tax cuts.
The law thus missed the mark in addressing the public's priorities, and this is, I believe, part of the reason we find Americans more negative than positive when asked about the TCJA. Had the bill coupled tax cuts with changes in how government operates, the public likely would be more positive about it at this point in time.

How Americans Really Feel About Taxes
How Americans Really Feel About Taxes
Research turns conventional wisdom about tax attitudes on its head.

This article is part of the series Flashcards
Press, pundits, and elected officials—Left and Right—drum a message into our heads: “Americans hate taxes.”
But Vanessa Williamson, fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and author of the book Read My Lips: Why Americans Are Proud to Pay Taxes, says that the notion that Americans hate taxes “has become a truism without the benefit of being true.”
Williamson’s research digs into a pervasive but largely buried alternative to the conventional wisdom:
Pollsters have been asking Americans whether “it is every American’s civic duty to pay their fair share of taxes.” Every year, about nine in 10 Americans agree with that sentiment. In 2009, 3 percent of respondents disagreed. That level of accord is very rare. To give you a point of reference: About 6 percent of Americans think the Apollo 11 moon landing was faked. On the civic responsibility of taxpaying, Americans are about as close to consensus as they ever get.
So how do Americans feel? Williamson says that “paying your fair share of taxes is a norm that a vast majority of Americans hold dear.” When you ask Americans about taxes (and she has been asking—for nearly a decade), their thoughts are anything but small. “They talk about what their country means to them,” she says, “and about the world they hope to leave for their children and grandchildren.” For better and for worse, people connect taxes to their core values and sense of community identity—and of right and wrong.
Especially around “tax season,” most Americans participate in customary griping and complaining, but Williamson finds that Americans view paying taxes as something to be proud of. “It is evidence that one is a responsible, contributing, and upstanding member of society,” she writes, “a person worthy of respect in the community and representation in the government.”
This is a double-edged sword. Broadly held patriotic pride in paying taxes signals promise for more productive conversations about government investments, revenue, and reform. But, as Williamson tells us, a belief among many Americans that they themselves pay taxes, but that many others, especially the very rich and the poor, do not pay their share is deeply corrosive to the social fabric. “The widespread misperception that immigrants, the poor, and working-class families pay little or no taxes,” she writes, “substantially reduces public support for progressive spending programs and undercuts the political standing of low-income people.”
What’s set up is a dangerous litmus test for civic “worthiness” or “who counts as American,” and it is exacerbated by racial and national prejudice.
But it’s unfounded. Lower income Americans as well as undocumented immigrants pay a substantial part of their income in sales taxes, payroll taxes, and fees. But a mainstream—and sometimes politically strategic— preoccupation with income taxes renders these other contributions nearly invisible. The point is, income taxes aren’t the only way people uphold their sacred civic duty.
When pollsters ask what bothers people most about taxes, “Americans overwhelmingly say the feeling that the wealthy and corporations are not paying their fair share .” Corporate loopholes and overseas tax havens are viewed by Americans as very unpatriotic. Even when corporate tax avoidance is legal, Williamson says, most Americans believe corporations should be punished for taking advantage of the system. This goes back a while. She points out that the original Boston Tea Party is wrongly remembered as “founding example” of anti-tax fervor. It was not motivated by high taxes, but rather it was “an act of resistance against what we might deride today as a corporate tax loophole.” A 2017 IRS survey found that “The majority of Americans (88%) say it is not at all acceptable to cheat on taxes; this ethical attitude is not changing over time.” Corporate tax avoidance—even when carried out legally—inflicts damage not only as lost revenue, but by eroding Americans’ trust in government. Here again is an opening for discussions of taxes as patriotic and an argument for more corporate accountability as paramount to a healthy, responsive democracy.
So, what do we make of this? We have work to do to overpower the default thinking established by decades—even centuries—of relentless anti-tax rhetoric. The good news is that Americans are fundamentally more favorable about taxes than that rhetoric insists. In fact, for more than 30 years, Williamson shows, Americans have remained committed to the principle of taxpaying and they have grown markedly more receptive to tax increases in recent years. The data are surprising: “Voters today are as likely as not to approve a state tax increase.”
Of course, polling and Williamson’s interviews revealed what many Americans feel in their gut; when the government fails to live up to its democratic ideal, any pride people might feel in taxpaying is subverted. In that context, better messages about taxes aren’t an adequate fix. Still, we can make good progress on many policy fronts by building on the sturdy foundations for positive tax attitudes that Williamson has uncovered, especially because those foundations are so often invisible and buried. Here are some ways to start:

I recommend this Planet Money podcast for more surprising American tax tidbits like:
Tax Day is a uniquely American phenomenon. In most other countries around the world the day federal taxes are due is not a national event, in part because there’s no culture of anti-tax fanfare and, more important, because in most places filling out the forms and paying is far simpler.
But anti-tax operatives like Grover Norquist prefer to keep tax filing cumbersome and frustrating. The logic is that “if paying taxes is difficult, people will hate taxes and vote against them.”
Simplifying the process for filing tax returns is opposed not only by anti-tax political operatives, but also by the tax preparation industry lobby. Right now the US Congress is considering a measure that would permanently bar the Internal Revenue Service from offering a simple, free tax preparation service online —competition for products such as TurboTax. It already passed the House.
Also: A US House bill to abolish the IRS currently has 29 Republican co-sponsors.

U.S. Public Opinion and Increased Taxes on the Rich
Polling Matters
June 4, 2021
U.S. Public Opinion and Increased Taxes on the Rich
by Frank Newport
The Joe Biden White House and Democrats in Congress are focused on increasing taxes on those with high incomes to help fund a sweeping legislative agenda. The majority of Americans, public opinion data show, favor the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy -- a fact of which the White House and Democrats in Congress are well aware. As White House Senior Adviser Anita Dunn wrote in a memo for her White House associates, "The President believes that we need to restore basic fairness to the tax code, and in the process generate revenues to invest in our competitiveness, children, and economy. And, the American people agree."
I entitled my review of Gallup data a couple of years ago "Americans' Long-Standing Interest in Taxing the Rich." Pew Research recently summarized its data: "Far more Americans continue to say they are bothered 'a lot' by the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair share of taxes than by the complexity of the tax system or even the amount they pay in taxes."
Journalists have picked up on the data. The New York Times concluded, "A wide range of polls now show broad public support for tax increases on high earners." A New York Magazine headline stated, "Biden's Tax Hike on the Wealthy Is Incredibly Popular." Axios reported, "The top pollster for Joe Biden's presidential campaign is advising the White House to do something that often makes Democrats nervous: Talk loudly and proudly about raising taxes on the rich. [Pollster] John Anzalone tells Axios his extensive polling and research has found that few issues receive broader support than raising taxes on corporations and people earning more than $400,000 a year." And the list goes on.
Thus, it is clear that the idea of taxing the rich generally resonates with Americans' underlying attitudes. But, as is true with most things in life, nothing is unambiguous, and few things are unequivocal. What follows is a brief review of several considerations I think can be usefully taken into account by policymakers as they move forward on efforts to reduce inequality by raising taxes on the rich and wealthy.
I. Not everyone approves.
Although clear majorities of Americans approve of the idea of taxing the rich, it is by no means 100% support, despite the "incredibly popular" headlines. Naturally enough, opposition is highest among Republicans (over 50% opposed in a recent Quinnipiac survey). Republican congressional leaders echo this negativity among their constituents, leading to the current stalemate on Biden's tax proposals. Thus, as is true with many policy issues, majority support from the people does not always or automatically translate into congressional action.
II. The reduction of income and wealth inequality is not a top priority for Americans.
It is hard to find evidence that reducing inequality is a top priority for Americans. Concern about income inequality (or, for that matter, worry that taxes on the wealthy are not high enough) rarely shows up in Gallup's monthly updates on the most important problem facing the nation. In Gallup's May update, to cite the most recent example, only 2% of Americans mentioned the gap between the rich and the poor as the biggest problem facing the nation.
Gallup's research from 2019 found that "the distribution of income and wealth" tied for last place in a list of possible priorities for Congress and the president. Pew Research last year concluded that "relatively few see [economic inequality] as a top policy priority for the federal government." Other more recent Gallup research shows that when placed in the context of many other worries, reducing inequality of income and wealth scores at about the middle range of all issues tested.
With that said, the Biden administration is pitching higher taxes on the wealthy as a practical way to fund Biden's social agenda, including expanded education, childcare, paid leave, combatting climate change, and in other ways expanding the nation's social safety net. An increased sense of priority for increased taxes on the rich could be generated to the degree that such actions are positioned as a means of achieving desirable policy objectives. And polling shows that most of these policies are, in fact, favored by the American public.
III. Americans like having a rich class and don't want it abolished.
Gallup, over the years, has done interesting research on the "rich," and the conclusion I keep coming back to is that Americans, in some ways, like having a rich class. The majority of Americans themselves would like to be rich someday. Further, Americans believe that having rich people in society is good for that society.
Americans thus do not harbor the heavy resentment toward the rich that might be assumed from their agreement that income inequality should be reduced. It appears that while Americans think the rich should pay more into the tax system, Americans don't broadly view them as evil or as of no benefit to our society. Demonizing the rich thus may not be the most advisable course of action for politicians -- even as they propose to raise their taxes. President Biden has taken note of this fact and has been cautious about making it clear that he doesn't want to eradicate the rich as a class, just to force them to pay more in taxes (As Biden opined, "We're not going to deprive any of these executives of their second or third home, travel privately by jet," adding, "It's [the tax increase] not going to affect their standard of living at all.")
IV. There is always an undercurrent of concern about too much government intervention into American life, particularly among Republicans.
Americans are not all enthusiastic about the idea of government intervention in the economic system. This is in part because not all Americans are enthusiastic about the government in general. For example, our annual update on views of governance last fall showed that while 83% of Democrats want the government to do more to solve the nation's problems, only 22% of Republicans agree. As I've written about extensively, the exact determination of what the government's role should or should not be in American society today is one of the contentious issues that has confronted the nation since its founding almost 250 years ago.
I should note that reducing income inequality does not have to be done by the government. Companies can make voluntary decisions to limit how much they pay their high-ranking employees, for example, and individuals in those roles could decline to accept high levels of compensation or restrict how much they are paid. One should not hold one's breath, however, that enough of this type of voluntary reduction in high incomes will occur to make a significant difference.
V. Reducing income and wealth inequality does not address the more complex and controversial issue of inequality in access to income and wealth, particularly when correlated with what sociologists refer to as "ascriptive" characteristics -- that is, qualities fixed at birth.
Reducing inequality of income and wealth does not deal with the other important dimension involved in any discussion of the topic -- who gets to be rich and wealthy and who doesn't. The process by which each generation of Americans is sorted into socioeconomic strata is highly complex but not random by any means. There are significant relationships between one's income and wealth and the income and wealth of one's parents, one's zip code of birth, one's physical attributes (including physical attractiveness and height), and one's gender, race and ethnic status. Thus, even though we may approve of the structure of income and wealth distributions, we may not approve of the process by which individuals are sorted out and end up at the various levels of income and wealth acquisition.
In other words, altering inequality of results does not directly address concerns with inequality of opportunity. Critics may be happy that the gap in income between rich and poor is reduced but may remain unhappy about who gets to be rich, to begin with.
Bottom Line
I would summarize American public opinion on this topic by saying that a majority of Americans on average are fine with addressing income and wealth inequality by increasing taxes on the rich, but I would at the same time advise policymakers to move forward along these lines with some caution. Any increase in the use of the government to intervene in Americans' economic life walks a tightrope between desirable objectives and trepidation about government overreach, and the idea of increasing taxes on the rich provides no exception.

Americans want the wealthy and corporations to pay more taxes, but are elected officials listening?
Isabel V. Sawhill and Christopher Pulliam Thursday, March 14, 2019
Economic inequality is on the rise in the United States and has been for the past 40 years. Prominent Democrats have offered several proposals to curb inequality by taxing those at the very top. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a wealth tax of two percent on those holding more than $50 million in wealth and three percent for those holding more than $1 billion. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has floated a top marginal income tax rate of 70 percent on those making more than $10 million. Senator Bernie Sanders has proposed an expanded estate tax with a top rate of 77 percent for estates valued at more than $1 billion.
Public opinion towards these three proposals varies. Senator Warren’s wealth tax is by far the most popular. Sixty-one percent of voters favor the measure. This majority holds across Democrats and Independents, at 75 percent and 56 percent, respectively. However, Republicans are divided on the measure, with 50 percent supporting.

In contrast, Americans tepidly support a 70 percent top marginal rate. A plurality of registered voters, 45 percent, favor the proposal. A majority of Democrats favor the proposal, but Republicans and Independents are less favorable.

While polling is not available for Senator Sanders’ specific proposal to expand the estate tax, there is a wealth of public opinion data on the estate tax more generally. Americans tend to favor repeal, though support for repeal has waned over time with only 48 percent of voters now agreeing that repealing the estate tax is a “good idea.”

Stepping back from policy specifics, most Americans support increasing taxes on the rich. Recent data from the American National Election Study show that, in 2016, 67 percent of Americans favored a “tax on millionaires.” Among Democrats, the proportion was 80 percent; among Republicans it was weaker at 50 percent.

This preference towards taxing the rich is not new. Gallup polling data show that the public consistently thinks that “upper-income people” and corporations do not pay their fair share in federal taxes.

This dissatisfaction with how much the rich pay in taxes is high relative to other concerns about the tax system. When Americans are asked what bothers them about the federal tax system, a sense that corporations and the wealthy are not paying their fair share top the list.

Popular support for raising taxes on the rich reflects public dissatisfaction with inequality. Two-thirds of Americans are dissatisfied with “the way income and wealth are distributed in the U.S.,” with 43 percent being very dissatisfied, and 23 percent being somewhat dissatisfied.

Based on classical democratic theory, we would expect that government would be responsive to the public’s preferences for higher taxes on the rich. Indeed, in their classic work, Meltzer and Richard (1981) predicted that increasing inequality would lead to higher taxes on the rich.
But that hasn’t been the case. In fact, average federal tax rates on the top one percent have remained stable since 1979, ranging from 25 to 35 percent.

More recent work suggests that elected officials are more responsive to economic elites and business interest groups compared to mass-based interest groups and the average citizen. Policymaking is much more responsive to the views of those at the 90 th percentile of the income distribution compared to those at the median or the 10 th percentile. This phenomenon is even more powerful when these groups disagree. Rising inequality combined with policymaking that is unresponsive to the average voter suggests a disturbing cycle in which inequality begets more inequality.
How do we reconcile the public’s desire for higher taxes on the wealthy with lukewarm support for a top rate of 70 percent? In her recent book, Read My Lips: Why American are Proud to Pay Taxes, our colleague Vanessa Williamson finds that Americans see taxpaying as a civic duty. She notes that come tax season, deductions and credits are at the forefront of tax filing, not marginal tax rates. As such, Americans think that corporations and upper-income Americans don’t “pay their fair share” because they can take advantage of more, and larger, “loopholes.” In fact, many of Williamson’s respondents supported the idea of a flat tax rather than higher rates on the wealthy not because they want to maintain low rates on the rich, but because they see the flat tax as a means to eliminate loopholes for the wealthy, thus increasing their tax burden, on net. What they do not realize is that moving to a flat tax would lower taxes on the rich and raise taxes on the poor and middle class.
In sum, Americans want a simple and transparent tax system to ensure that the rich are paying taxes on the money they make, rather than using loopholes and tax shelters to reduce their tax liability. Of course, there are large tax expenditures that favor the rich, such as the new pass-through deduction for small businesses and reduced rates on dividends and long-term capital gains. However, there are also large tax expenditures that benefit the middle and upper-middle classes, such as the exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance and tax benefits for retirement plans.
While base-broadening and raising taxes on the rich are worthy policy goals, we are pessimistic about the politics. Regardless of how well a given policy polls, American democracy is more responsive to the affluent and business interest groups. So, will Americans get their wish and see raised taxes on the rich? We seriously doubt it.

Growing Partisan Divide Over Fairness of the Nation’s Tax System
Only about a third of Americans approve of 2017 tax law
As the April 15 tax deadline approaches, overall public views of the fairness of the nation’s tax system have changed only modestly since 2017, before passage of major tax legislation. However, partisan differences on tax fairness have increased considerably since then, and now are wider than at any point in at least two decades.
Two years ago, Republicans and Democrats had similar views of the fairness of the tax system. Today, 64% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the present tax system is very or moderately fair; just half as many Democrats and Democratic leaners (32%) view the tax system as fair. The share of Republicans who say the tax system is fair has increased 21 percentage points since 2017. Over this period, the share of Democrats viewing the tax system as fair has declined nine points.
The survey by Pew Research Center, conducted March 20-25 among 1,503 adults, finds that more than a year after the new tax law was enacted, public approval remains relatively unchanged (36% approve of the tax law, while 49% disapprove). However, fewer Republicans strongly approve of the law than did so in January 2018.
About seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) approve of the tax law, including 43% who strongly approve. Early last year, about the same share of Republicans approved of the tax law (75%), but a majority (57%) strongly approved.
Most Democrats continue to express negative views of the tax law. Today, 79% of Democrats disapprove, including 59% who strongly disapprove.
Americans are about as likely to say they understand how the tax law affects them as was the case in January 2018. A majority of Americans say they understand how the tax law has affected them and their family “very well” (26%) or “somewhat well” (37%). However, a third say they understand the law’s impact not too well or not at all well.
The public’s overall frustrations with the federal tax system have changed little since April 2017, the survey finds.
Overall, about six-in-ten Americans say they are bothered “a lot” by the feeling that some corporations (62%) and wealthy people (60%) do not pay their fair share in taxes.
Fewer American express strong concerns about the complexity of the tax system (39% say they are bothered a lot by this), the amount they pay in taxes (27%) and whether poor people pay their fair share in taxes (16%).
The public’s views of the fairness of the U.S. economic system have changed little in recent years – and remain deeply divided along partisan lines. Currently, 63% of Americans say the “economic system unfairly favors powerful interests,” while just 34% say it is “generally fair to most Americans.” About twice as many Democrats (81%) as Republicans (40%) say the country’s economic system is unfair.
Similarly, opinions on whether corporate profits are excessive have been stable. A 56% majority says business corporations make too much profit, compared with 39% who say their profits are “fair and reasonable.” While 72% of Democrats say corporations make too much profit, only 38% of Republicans say the same.
Partisans close divisions on some concerns over the tax system as other divisions widen
While increasing shares of Democrats say they are bothered “a lot” by the feeling that some corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair share in taxes (79% of Democrats say this about each), Republicans’ concerns over these issues have lessened.
Today, 42% of Republicans say they are bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations do not pay their fair share of taxes (down from 55% in 2015). And just 37% of Republicans are bothered a great deal by the feeling that some wealthy people do not pay their fair share (49% said this in 2015).
Republicans’ concerns over the complexity of the tax system and how much they pay in taxes also have declined. About four-in-ten Republicans (39%) say they are bothered a lot by the complexity of the tax system, down 15 percentage points since 2015 and 10 points since 2017. Democrats’ views have changed little since 2015; today, 40% say they are bothered a lot by the complexity of the tax system.
There has been a modest decrease in the share of Republicans who say they are bothered a lot by the amount they pay in taxes (27% now, 35% two years ago). Over the past two years, there has been a comparable rise in the share of Democrats saying they are bothered a lot by how much they pay in taxes (28% now, 21% in 2017).
Stark differences in views of tax fairness between higher-income Republicans and Democrats
Today, about two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners (64%) say the present federal tax system is very or moderately fair; only about a third of Democrats and Democratic leaners (32%) say the same. In October 2017, there was not a significant gap in Republicans’ and Democrats’ views of the fairness of the tax system.
While Republicans and Democrats across income categories differ in their views of tax fairness, the gaps are widest – and the shift most pronounced – among those with family incomes of $75,000 or more. Currently, 68% of Republicans with incomes of at least $75,000 say the tax system is very or moderately fair, up from just 37% in 2017. By contrast, the share of Democrats who view the tax system as fair has declined 19 percentage points since then (from 40% to 21%).
Assessments of 2017 tax law more negative than positive in many demographic groups
Across many demographic groups, assessments of the 2017 tax law are more negative than positive overall. And partisan differences in the law, which were evident in January 2018 shortly after it was enacted, are about as wide today as they were then.
Democrats, regardless of ideology, overwhelmingly disapprove of the tax law, while there are wider ideological differences among Republicans.
Overall, 71% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve of the law. Conservative Republicans are more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans to approve of the tax law (80%, compared with 55%).
By contrast, sizable majorities of both liberal (80%) and conservative and moderate (77%) Democrats and Democratic leaners say they disapprove of the law.
Adults 65 and older are divided in their views of the tax law: 43% approve, while 41% disapprove. Among younger age cohorts, more disapprove than approve of the law.
While views of the tax law are more negative than positive across all educational groups, those with postgraduate degrees are more likely than others to say they disapprove of the law (60% say this, compared to 48% of those with less education).
Among whites, views of the tax law are significantly different between those with and without a college degree. About half of whites with a college degree or more (51%) disapprove of the law, while 37% approve. Among whites without a college degree, the balance of opinion is roughly the reverse: 47% approve; 32% disapprove.
Views of economic fairness
Most Americans (63%) say the economic system in the United States unfairly favors powerful interests; only about a third (34%) say it is generally fair to most Americans. The share saying the economic system is unfair has remained largely stable since 2014.
Republicans’ and Democrats’ attitudes about the fairness of the economic system have been moving in opposite directions over the past few years. In 2014, there was a 20 percentage-point gap between the shares of Republicans (51%) and Democrats (71%) who said the economy unfairly favors powerful interests; that gap is now 41 points (40% of Republicans vs. 81% of Democrats). While about eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners say the economic system is unfair, a majority of Republicans and Republican leaners (56%) now say the economic system is generally fair to most Americans.
The public continues to say that “business corporations make too much profit.” Today, 56% of the public says corporations make too much profit; 39% say “most corporation make a fair and reasonable amount of profit.” These views have held largely steady since 1994.
Nearly three-quarters of Democrats and Democratic leaners (72%) say corporations make too much profit, while about a quarter (24%) say corporate profits are reasonable. Conversely, 56% of Republicans and Republican leaners say most businesses’ profits are fair and reasonable, while 38% say businesses are profiting too much.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's an article from Gallup about public opinion on the 2017 tax law. It seems like the law wasn't very popular, with more people disapproving than approving. It mentions that partisanship plays a big role, with Republicans mostly approving and Democrats disapproving. Also, a lot of people were confused about how the law affected their taxes, which might have influenced their opinions.

Another article from Sightline Institute talks about how Americans have a deeper, more positive attitude towards paying taxes than the common narrative suggests. It mentions that around nine in ten Americans believe it's their civic duty to pay their fair share of taxes. That's really interesting—so maybe people don't necessarily hate taxes, but have specific concerns about them.

Then, there's another Gallup article about public opinion on increasing taxes on the rich. It shows that most Americans favor higher taxes on the wealthy, but there's still opposition, especially among Republicans. It also points out that reducing income inequality isn't a top priority for many Americans, although they support specific policies that could help achieve that.

A Brookings Institution article discusses how Americans want the wealthy and corporations to pay more taxes, but elected officials might not be listening. It mentions that public opinion supports taxing the rich, but actual policies don't reflect that as much. The article also touches on the complexity of the tax system and how people perceive loopholes.

Lastly, a Pew Research Center report highlights a growing partisan divide over the fairness of the nation's tax system. It shows that Republicans are more likely to see the tax system as fair now compared to a few years ago, while Democrats are less likely to see it as fair. Overall, there's a shift in partisan opinions on tax fairness.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems like Americans have a nuanced view of taxation. On one hand, there's a sense of civic duty and pride in paying taxes, seeing it as a contribution to society and public services. On the other hand, there are specific grievances, such as feeling that the wealthy and corporations aren't paying their fair share, and confusion about how taxes affect individuals.

Partisanship plays a significant role in shaping opinions, with Republicans more likely to approve of tax laws and see the system as fair, especially after legislation they support is passed, and Democrats more critical of the system and more likely to see it as unfair.

Additionally, while there's general support for raising taxes on the rich, it's not a top priority for many Americans, and there's a disconnect between public opinion and actual policy outcomes, possibly due to political gridlock and influence from wealthy interests.

Moreover, the complexity of the tax system seems to be a source of frustration for many, with people feeling that it's too complicated and that there are too many loopholes that allow some to avoid paying their fair share.

In conclusion, people's feelings about taxation are multifaceted. There's a underlying acceptance and even pride in paying taxes, coupled with specific concerns about fairness and the efficiency of the system. Public opinion tends to favor higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, but actual policy changes don't always align with these views, leading to ongoing debates and disagreements about the role and nature of taxation in society.
