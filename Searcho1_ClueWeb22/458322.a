Alright, I need to understand how money laundering works. It sounds like a complex process, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First off, I know that money laundering is illegal, and it's about making dirty money look clean. But what does that really mean? I think I need to start by understanding the basic definition and then dive into the methods used.

Let me think about where to begin. Maybe I should look up what money laundering is exactly. From what I recall, it's the process of taking illicitly gained money and making it appear legitimate so that it can be used without drawing suspicion. So, the main goal is to integrate dirty money into the legal economy.

I've heard of the term "dirty money" or "criminal proceeds." This is money obtained through illegal activities like drug trafficking, fraud, corruption, and so on. Money laundering allows criminals to use this money without being detected by authorities. It seems like there are several stages involved in this process.

I think the classic model of money laundering has three main stages: placement, layering, and integration. Let me see if I can understand each of these stages.

First, placement is about getting the dirty money into the financial system. Since large amounts of cash are suspicious, launderers need to find ways to deposit this cash into banks or other financial institutions without raising red flags. One common method is structuring deposits to stay under reporting thresholds. For example, instead of depositing $100,000 at once, which would likely be reported, they might make several smaller deposits over time.

Another method for placement could be using currency exchanges, casinos, or businesses that deal with a lot of cash, like restaurants or retail stores, to deposit the money on their behalf. This way, the money enters the financial system appearing as legitimate business revenue.

Next is layering, which is the process of complicating the trail of money to obfuscate its origins. This is done by moving the money through a series of transactions across different accounts, sometimes in different countries, to make it hard for authorities to trace back to the original source.

Layering can involve things like wire transfers, purchasing and selling assets, or investing in shell companies. The idea is to create a maze of financial transactions so that the paper trail becomes too complicated to follow.

Finally, there's integration, where the laundered money is re-introduced into the economy in a way that makes it appear legitimate. This could be through investments in real estate, stocks, or starting legitimate businesses. Essentially, the criminals can now use this money openly without fear of it being linked back to their illegal activities.

So, those are the three main stages: placement, layering, and integration. But I'm sure there are various techniques and methods within each stage. Maybe I should look into some specific examples to better understand how this works in practice.

Let me consider drug trafficking as an example. Drug dealers receive large amounts of cash from selling drugs, which is obviously illegal. They need to find a way to deposit this cash into banks to invest or spend it without attracting attention. One way is to set up a front business, like a check-cashing service or a money transfer business, that deals with a lot of cash transactions. The dealer can then deposit the drug money through this business, claiming it as part of the business revenue.

Alternatively, they might use smurfing, where multiple people make small deposits below the reporting threshold on behalf of the criminal organization. This way, no single deposit is large enough to trigger suspicion, but collectively, they are depositing substantial amounts of money.

In terms of layering, the launderer might transfer the deposited money to another account in a different name or in a different country, especially one with less stringent banking regulations. They could also purchase high-value items like real estate or luxury cars, then sell them and claim the proceeds as legitimate sales.

For integration, perhaps they set up a legitimate business and mix the laundered money with legitimate business revenues. Over time, it becomes difficult to distinguish between the two sources of funds.

Another area where money laundering is common is corruption. Public officials embezzling funds or accepting bribes need to legitimize that money. They might use similar methods, like setting up offshore accounts or investing in foreign markets where tracking the funds is more challenging.

I've also heard about terrorist financing, which sometimes overlaps with money laundering. Terrorist organizations need to move funds secretly to support their operations. They might use hawala or other informal value transfer systems to avoid detection by authorities.

It seems like money laundering is a global issue, and different countries have varying degrees of regulation and enforcement when it comes to preventing it. International cooperation is crucial in tackling money laundering, given that funds often cross borders.

I wonder what measures are in place to prevent money laundering. I know that financial institutions are required to report suspicious activities through something called SARs, which stands for Suspicious Activity Reports. Also, there are Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations that require banks to verify the identity of their clients and understand the nature of their transactions.

Additionally, there are international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that set standards and recommendations for anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures.

But despite these efforts, money laundering continues to be a significant problem. Perhaps because the methods evolve, and criminals find new ways to exploit loopholes in the system.

Maybe I should look into some high-profile money laundering cases to see how it plays out in reality. For instance, the Panama Papers leak revealed how wealthy individuals and politicians used offshore entities to hide their assets and potentially launder money.

Another example is the Danske Bank scandal, where billions of euros were transferred through the bank's Estonian branch, raising questions about money laundering activities.

These cases show that even with regulations in place, money laundering can still occur on a massive scale.

Perhaps one of the challenges is the complexity of the financial system, with its many layers and international connections. It can be difficult for regulators and law enforcement to keep up with the sophistication of money laundering schemes.

Also, privacy laws and the use of encrypted communications can make it harder to trace illicit funds. Cryptocurrencies have also become a concern in recent years, as they offer a degree of anonymity that can be exploited for money laundering purposes.

But at the same time, cryptocurrencies also leave a digital trail on the blockchain, which can be analyzed to uncover patterns and connections. So, it's a double-edged sword.

I think it's important to note that money laundering isn't just about moving money; it's also about concealing the true origin and ownership of those funds. That's why layering is such a critical component.

Moreover, money laundering enables further criminal activities by providing funding. If criminals can't launder their money, it limits their ability to reinvest in more illegal operations or to lead a lavish lifestyle.

Therefore, combating money laundering is not only about punishing past crimes but also about preventing future ones by cutting off the financial lifeline of criminal organizations.

In summary, money laundering is a process by which criminals disguise the illegal origin of funds, making them appear legitimate. It typically involves three stages: placement, layering, and integration. Various methods are employed within each stage, and international cooperation is essential to combat this global issue.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Money laundering is the process of converting illegally obtained money into apparently legitimate funds by hiding its true origin through a series of transactions and movements, typically involving placement, layering, and integration stages.}} \]
