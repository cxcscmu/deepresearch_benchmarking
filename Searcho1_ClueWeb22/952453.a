Alright, I need to understand the sociological factors of crime. So, first things first, what exactly are sociological factors? I think these are the elements in society that influence individual behavior, particularly when it comes to committing crimes. Things like poverty, education level, family structure, peer influence, and maybe even cultural norms could play a role here.

But I need to dig deeper. Maybe there are specific theories in sociology that explain why certain factors lead to higher crime rates. For example, I've heard of strain theory, which suggests that when people can't achieve their goals through legitimate means, they might turn to illegal activities instead. So, poverty could be a big factor there, because if someone is poor and sees no way to improve their situation legally, they might resort to crime.

Also, there's something called social learning theory, which proposes that people learn criminal behaviors by interacting with others who engage in crime. So, if someone grows up in a neighborhood where crime is common, they might be more likely to become involved in it themselves.

Furthermore, I think gender plays a role too. Statistics show that males are more likely to commit crimes than females, but I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's societal expectations or differences in upbringing.

Wait, maybe I should look into how family structures affect crime rates. Single-parent families, for instance, might have higher rates of delinquency because of lack of parental supervision or economic struggles.

And what about education? Does lacking a good education lead to higher crime rates because people don't have the skills to get decent jobs?

I also recall that urban areas often have higher crime rates than rural areas. Is that because of greater population density, more anonymity, or perhaps worse socioeconomic conditions?

Perhaps I should consider the role of law enforcement and the justice system. If certain communities feel targeted or unfairly treated by the police, that might lead to mistrust and increased criminal behavior.

Hmm, maybe I need to look into some specific studies or research that has been done on this topic. It would be helpful to have some data to back up these theories.

Let me try to organize my thoughts. I'll make a list of potential sociological factors:

1. Poverty and economic inequality

2. Education level and access to quality education

3. Family structure and parental involvement

4. Peer influence and social networks

5. Gender roles and expectations

6. Urbanization and community environment

7. Law enforcement and criminal justice policies

8. Cultural norms and values

Now, I need to explore each of these factors and see how they relate to crime rates.

Starting with poverty and economic inequality, it seems intuitive that lacking resources would drive some people to commit crimes to meet their basic needs or to seek financial gain illegally. There's probably a correlation between low income levels and higher crime rates.

Next, education. If someone doesn't have a good education, their job prospects might be limited, which could increase the temptation to turn to crime. Also, schools in impoverished areas might be underfunded, leading to poorer educational outcomes and higher dropout rates, which in turn could contribute to higher crime rates.

Family structure is another important factor. Children from single-parent homes or those with absent parents might be at higher risk for delinquency due to lack of supervision or guidance. Additionally, dysfunctional family environments with abuse or neglect can contribute to antisocial behavior.

Peer influence is significant during adolescence. If teens associate with delinquent peers, they're more likely to engage in criminal activities themselves. This could be due to peer pressure or identifying with a deviant subculture.

Gender also plays a role, as males are overrepresented in crime statistics. Maybe traditional masculine norms encourage aggression and risk-taking, which can lead to criminal behavior.

Urbanization might contribute to crime rates because cities often have higher levels of poverty, more anonymous relationships, and greater opportunities for crime. However, I've also heard that well-designed urban environments can promote safety and reduce crime.

Law enforcement practices can either deter crime or exacerbate it, depending on how they're implemented. For example, community policing aims to build trust between police and residents, which can lead to lower crime rates. On the other hand, heavy-handed tactics or racial profiling can alienate communities and potentially increase criminal activity.

Lastly, cultural norms and values can influence behavior. In some cultures, certain actions might be considered acceptable or even heroic, while in others, they'd be deemed criminal. For instance, in situations of political unrest, acts of civil disobedience might be seen as necessary for change by some and as criminal by authorities.

I think I need to find some reliable sources to support these ideas. Maybe look for academic articles or books on criminology and sociology.

Let me try conducting a search to find more information.

Sociological theories of crime seek to explain observed criminal activity through the societal conditions in which they occur. Learn features of criminology and sociology, and where they are observed in public policy decisions. Updated: 10/25/2021
Criminology
Gemma looks around her and sees lots of problems with her city. There is a high unemployment rate and lots of crime. She wants to do something to make it better, but isn't sure what. Why is crime so high in her city, and what can she do about it?
Criminology is the study of crime and punishment. Criminologists try to answer the question, why do crimes happen? Just as Gemma is trying to figure out why crime is high in her city, criminologists study crime rates and try to figure out the elements that make people turn to a life of crime. Let's look closer at sociological theories of criminology, including how they affect public policy.

Sociological Theories
Gemma wants to know why her city has a crime problem. Why do people commit crimes?
There are several different theories about why people commit crimes. On one hand, some people believe that crime is a rational choice, and criminals weigh the pros and cons of committing a crime before doing it. Others believe that criminals are biologically - or psychologically - different from law-abiding citizens.
The one thing that both of these approaches has in common, though, is that they focus on the individual. That is, they look at crime as an individual problem, not one that involves an entire community. But sociological theories of criminology say that society creates conditions under which a person commits a crime. That is, people are influenced by society to commit crimes. The words 'sociological' and 'society' are linked, so you can remember that sociological theories look at crime as a social problem, not an individual one.
There are many different sociological theories. For example, perhaps Gemma's city has a crime problem because people are learning from each other how to commit crimes, a theory known as social learning theory. Or, perhaps the problem is that there is a big gap in wealth, and class warfare is causing the problem, which is known as social conflict theory.
One key idea that the sociological theories have in common, though, is the idea that criminal behavior is not innate to humans and circumstances affect how people act. That is, people aren't born criminals; it is the environment in which they live that influences how they will turn out.
Gemma understands this. She has noticed that unemployment and poverty are both high in her city. Not only that, she's found that the higher those two things are, the higher crime rates go. It's as if when circumstances get worse for people, they become more likely to turn to a life of crime.
Public Policy
Gemma is starting to see that the crime problem in her city might be partly due to the sociological aspects of her city, like the fact that unemployment and poverty are both at high levels. But what can be done about it?

This post has been written by Drishti Mehra, a student pursuing a B.A, LL.B. from Amity Law School, Noida.
Tracking crime over time is a complex process, because “crime” constitutes hundreds of heterogeneous behaviors that change in their definition and prevalence across persons, time, and space. What is a “crime”? Clearly, the measurement of crime differs by jurisdiction, type of behavior, and social acceptability.
What is Criminology, and how does it relate to Sociology?
In sociology, we typically try to look for social causes of all kinds of phenomena. Criminology is one of the largest and fastest-growing subfields of sociology, and criminologists focus on sociological explanations for causes of crime. They also take a sociological view of how the criminal justice system, including police, prosecutors, and judges, responds to victims and offenders. Of course, criminologists do not ignore individual causes of crime, such as personality and psychological characteristics, but in general, they are especially interested in factors related to the larger world in which individuals live.
Why do people commit crimes?
It is hard to pinpoint “the cause of crime”, not just because criminology is a relatively young field and still has much to discover, but because so much depends on the specific circumstances of a particular time and place. However, there are some regularities that seem pretty well-established. For example, one relatively consistent social predictor of crime is income inequality. Societies with higher levels of income inequality like the U.S. tend to suffer from higher crime rates. You compare yourself to economically well-off members of the community, and for many people, that creates economic strain or stress. This feeling of relative deprivation is associated with many kinds of criminal behavior. On the other hand, it’s probably easier to live with one’s own absolute poverty if everyone else around is also poor.
While economic factors are clearly significant, it is also important to understand what limits or enhances a community’s ability to work together to control crime. For example, a community with many short-term residents or which lacks trust in police may struggle more with crime. Large-scale societal changes are important too. For instance, when women typically stayed at home, their exposure to victimization and opportunity for offending were both limited. The improved status of women brought lifestyle changes that increased exposure to victimization, and also created more potential for crime-inducing feelings of blocked opportunity to fulfill economic goals. Women’s offending and victimization is still quite different from men’s, but these changes should narrow this gap.
Statistics on Social Crime and Class
Sociologists are interested in why people from some social classes are more likely to commit crimes than others, and that the types of crime which people from different classes may commit differ significantly
Social class is an identity based on shared socio & dash; economic status. Different sociologists approach class in different ways: traditional Marxists focus on the bourgeoisie and the proletariat and their separate relationship to the means of production; other sociologists consider class stratification more in relation to job roles and incomes.
Also Read: National Seminar on “Criminal Law Reforms in Recent Times: Issues and Challenges” Sponsored by ICSSR On March 05, 2021 (Friday) is being organized by Faculty of Law, Baba Mast Nath University, Asthal Bohar, Rohtak, Haryana
Many of the functionalist and Marxist theories we have already looked at seek to explain why working & dash; class individuals commit more crimes than others. Whether that be subcultural class from functionalists, or the idea crime might be a proletarian response to capitalism, a great deal of criminology has investigated this particular social distribution.
New Right sociologist Charles Murray developed the idea of an underclass. He suggested that the welfare state created welfare dependency and that there were perverse incentives in the welfare system that created a criminal underclass of jobless, welfare, and dependent, dysfunctional people.
Are the crime statistics are misleading?
Marxists in particular argue that many crimes committed by the wealth do not make their way into crime statistics. The rich are less likely to be investigated or to become suspects and are more likely to be able to afford good lawyers who get them off or indeed even bribe officials so the investigation never gets that far in the first place. Marxist would add that much of the harmful behaviour that the rich do engage in is legal because they are the class that make the laws.
White-collar crime: means crimes committed by the “middle class” (as opposed to “blue collar” workers). Although theoretically, it could mean any crime committed by members of that class, it is generally used to describe the crimes most associated with the middle class, for example, fraud and tax evasion, rather than, for instance, violent crimes that happen to have been committed by a middle-class individual
There are less likely to be convictions in relation to many white-collar crimes because they are harder to detect. Victims are often diffused (e.g. there might be thousands of victims of a fraud, who may never be aware that a crime as taken place) and remote and the crime is often committed at a distance, perhaps by computer, rather than face to face. For both these reasons, victims are unlikely to report a crime and witnesses to the crime are less likely. Historically, these crimes have been treated more leniently, and sometimes the associates of white-collar criminals will help to “brush it under the carpet” in order to avoid the negative publicity
Corporate crime: refers specifically to crimes committed by companies rather than individuals, although individuals might well be found to have ultimate criminal responsibility, e.g. the CEO. Most commonly, corporate crimes will involve fraud or tax evasion. Historically, these crimes have not been routinely prosecuted and, even where companies have been held accountable for these crimes, it is often through arrangements outside the criminal justice system: e.g. between large companies and governments in relation to their tax affairs, as with Starbucks in 2014.

What is Sociological Criminology? (with pictures)
What is Sociological Criminology?
Sarah Valek
Last Modified Date: April 08, 2022
Sociological criminology suggests the neighborhood in which a person grows up in or lives can impact their behavior.
Sociological criminology is the practice of examining crime from a sociological point of view. Specifically, sociologists see crime as an individual and social problem and believe that it cannot be properly understood without examining the surrounding social, political and economical context. People in this field attempt to understand why people commit crimes and what can be done about it, with a focus on the offender as an individual.
Educational background is another factor that is considered in sociological criminology.
Criminology itself is the scientific study of crime and delinquency. It looks at the causes, correction, and prevention of crime and can be viewed through various academic lenses, like sociology. General sociological theory considers criminal behavior to be a normal response to extreme social circumstances.
Offenders are not necessarily viewed as bad people. A sociologist looks at the social context of a person’s situation, examining the offender’s race, neighborhood, social circle, income level, education level, job or career, and type of childhood to determine why a person became delinquent. There are many specific theories within the field to explain criminal behavior, such as differential association, neutralization theory, and the theory of anomie.

Factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency are examined by sociological criminologists.
Differential association theory asserts that criminal behavior is learned via communication with intimate personal groups. A person not only learns techniques needed to commit the crime, but the surrounding attitudes, drive, and rationalizations associated with the criminal act. The person is then surrounded by an excess of favorable definitions of crime that outweigh the unfavorable aspects of breaking the law. Therefore, crime is seen as normal and beneficial.
Sociological criminology looks at the external factors which cause people to commit crimes.
Neutralization theory views a delinquent as someone who redefines deviant behavior to be morally acceptable and therefore justifiable. In that person’s mind, committing a specific crime becomes an explainable, reasonable action, not something viewed as morally objectionable or wrong. The sociological theory of anomie asserts that offenders commit crimes as a last resort. Since the offender was unable to meet his or her goals using legal, socially acceptable means, he or she resorts to illegal tactics to reach the original goal.
According to conflict theory, the less power a person possesses, the more he or she is likely to commit a crime. Dominant groups in society are responsible for making and enforcing laws. Sociological criminology also examines the assumptions society has about criminals and punishment. Students of sociology are taught to question their previously held views of criminals and why people commit crimes.

Many people have different theories as to why crime exists. Some believe crime happens because of the individual’s culture, education (or lack there of), or even their race. Others believe crime is associated with whom we surround ourselves with. There are three sociological theories that suggest why crime happens in society; they are social learning theory, social control theory, and social reaction (labeling) theory. These theories suggest it is our relationships and social interactions that influence our behavior.
Social Learning Theory
The social learning theory states that criminal behavior is learned. Criminals learn their bad behaviors from close relationships they may have with criminal peers (Siegel & Worrall, 2016). Children look up to their parents; they want to be just like them. So, if children grow up surround by crime, they think that it is both normal and acceptable, and it is likely that they will participate in criminal behavior when they are older. As a result of learning this behavior, it is passed down through generations and is never broken. This can also be learned from friendships people may have with negative influences. Young adults and children want to fit in with their peers, so if they are surrounded with those who commit crimes, they are probably going to do the same because “everyone is doing it”.
Social Control Theory
Social bonds in some cases can prevent people from committing a crime. However, if these bonds are broken, criminal behavior

Sociological Theories On Crime
Sociological theories on crime, whether they are macro or micro, look at external factors in determining causative reasons for criminal conduct (Bohm & Vogel, 2011).  This process is very different from biological and psychological crime theories, which focus on internal characteristics of a person (Bohm & Vogel, 2011).  Macrosociological theory accounts for the overall big picture of a society taking into account the physical structure of an area and how it is laid out.  This information is used
Different criminology theories explain the origin of crime and factors influencing offenders to commit a crime. Sociological and social control theories state that every person has the ability and chance to commit criminal offenses, but they choose not to due to social constraints and fear. Through the social strain and learning concepts, people of all ages including the youth engage in criminal activities due to Therefore, juvenile delinquency is viewed as a reflection of an inadequate external
Critically Evaluate a Major Sociological Theory on Crime.              

Crime is defined as an illegal act that violates the written laws that govern a society. ‘Crimes are those actions deemed disturbing or disruptive to society as to justify state intervention’ (Pease, 2002). Deviant behaviour is going against the social ‘norms’ or constructs that society deems appropriate. This deviant behaviour would be controlled using informal sanctions in the form of family, peers and social groups. For instance
The Biological And Sociological Theories Of Crime
Sociological theories of crime are quite different from the biological and psychological theories we previously learned about. Sociological theories attempt to account for the social forces that cause or result in criminal behavior. Macrosociological and microsociological theories are considered sociological theories, which means they tend to look at external factors for crime causation rather than internal factors. Macrosociological theories examine how society can create an environment that can

Learning about the various biological, sociological, and psychological theories of criminality gave me an understanding of what leads individual’s to commit a crime. Theories of the causes of crime is a growing body of evidence about the factors that place people at risk of criminal offending. Biological, sociological, and psychological theories focus on anatomical, physiological or genetic abnormalities and their contributions to crime. “Biological theories about causes of crime focus on the idea that the physical body, though inherited genes, evolutionary factors, brain structures, or the role of hormones, has an influence in an individual’s involvement un criminal behavior” (Causes of Crime, 2009). Biological theory of criminology explore …show more content…
This theory focus on the influence of the organization of society and social conditions. Sociological theory encompasses a wide range of theoretical perspective; but mostly regarding to crime as social phenomenon. It also emphasizes the cultural and social elements of crime behavior. “Sociological theory look at crime as social problem, and not as an individual problem.” (Boyd, 2003). Social learning theory is when people learn from each other how to commit crimes. Another sociological theory is social conflict theory which involves wealthy vs the poor. Meaning more powerful individuals use their power in order to exploit individuals with less power. Overall, people are not born criminals, it is the environment that they live in that turns them that way.
Psychological theories focus of exploring the relationship between crime and individual personality, social factors, cognition, and the developmental factors.  Basically what psychological theory of crime says is that criminal behavior is a result of individual differences in thinking process. Psychological theory focus of the individual, family, group and social psychology. “There are four basic ideas of psychological theories of crime” (Boyd, …show more content…
Or what makes criminals different from the rest of us? Biological, sociological, and psychological theories of criminality try to study people’s behavior as well as their mind to figure out what leads people to commit crime. Learning about different type of theories helped me to understand that people commit crimes for many reasons. The way a children is raised by their family has a big impact on how the child will become when he or she is fully grown. Every person learns through observation, but in some cases what people learn can be the cause of why people turn out to be criminals. For example, learning violence and aggression make people feel that it is okay to commit crimes because that’s what criminals were educated when they were young. Overall, there is a huge difference between criminals and regular people, but the impact can be because of different life

Alright, I have some information now. Let's see what I can gather from these documents.

From Doc 1, it talks about sociological theories of crime and how they differ from individual-focused approaches. It mentions that sociological theories look at society as a whole and how societal conditions influence crime rates. It also introduces the idea that crime can be linked to factors like poverty, education, and family structure.

Doc 2 discusses the effect of sociology and statistics on crime, particularly focusing on how different social classes may be more prone to certain types of crime. It also touches on the idea that crime statistics might be misleading, especially regarding white-collar crimes committed by the upper class, which may not always be accurately represented in official statistics.

Doc 3 explains sociological criminology as examining crime through a sociological lens, considering the social, political, and economic contexts that influence criminal behavior. It emphasizes that offenders are not inherently bad but may turn to crime due to their circumstances.

Doc 4 provides an overview of three sociological theories of crime: social learning theory, social control theory, and social reaction (labeling) theory. It explains how these theories attribute criminal behavior to social interactions and relationships.

Doc 5 compares biological, sociological, and psychological theories of criminality, highlighting that sociological theories focus on social factors rather than individual biological or psychological traits.

So, synthesizing this information, it seems that sociological factors of crime are multifaceted and interconnected. Poverty, education level, family structure, peer influence, and social inequalities are key elements that can contribute to higher crime rates. Additionally, the way society is structured and how different social classes interact can also play a significant role.

I should also consider that crime is not just about individual choices but is embedded within the social fabric. For instance, areas with high unemployment and poor education facilities may see higher crime rates because individuals lack legitimate opportunities to improve their lives, leading some to turn to illicit activities.

Moreover, the way society reacts to crime, through law enforcement and the justice system, can also influence crime rates. If certain communities feel marginalized or unfairly treated, this might lead to increased distrust and potentially more criminal behavior.

It's also important to note that not all crimes are reported or recorded accurately, which can skew statistics. White-collar crimes, for example, might be underrepresented in official data compared to street crimes.

In conclusion, sociological factors of crime encompass a wide range of social, economic, and political elements that shape individual and group behaviors. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and reduce crime.

\boxed{\text{Sociological factors of crime include poverty, education level, family structure, peer influence, social inequalities, and societal reactions to crime.}}
