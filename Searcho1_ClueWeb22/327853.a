Alright, so I need to figure out how HCAHPS impacts insurance reimbursement. I'm not super familiar with HCAHPS, so first things first, I should probably understand what it is.

I think HCAHPS stands for Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems. It's a survey that patients take after they've been discharged from the hospital, and it's designed to rate their experience and the quality of care they received. I believe it covers things like communication with doctors and nurses, pain management, cleanliness, and overall hospital environment.

Now, regarding insurance reimbursement, I know that hospitals get paid by insurance companies, including Medicare and Medicaid, for the care they provide to patients. I also know that there's been a shift towards value-based care, where reimbursement is tied to the quality of care provided, not just the quantity of services.

So, I'm guessing that HCAHPS scores play a role in determining how much hospitals get reimbursed. Maybe hospitals with higher HCAHPS scores receive higher reimbursements or some kind of bonus, while those with lower scores get less money.

But I need to verify this. Maybe I should look up some information about HCAHPS and its relationship to reimbursement.

Let me try searching for "HCAHPS and insurance reimbursement" to see what comes up.

Better HCAHPS Scores Protect Revenue

HCAHPS
patient satisfaction
Providing an excellent patient experience is tied more closely than ever to reimbursements.
This article first appeared in the July/August 2014 issue of HealthLeaders magazine.
It has always been a moral imperative for hospitals and health systems to provide a high-quality patient experience, but now that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is tying reimbursements to HCAHPS scores, it's becoming a financial priority, as well.
Through the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, patients rate their inpatient stay in 27 categories, ranging from communication with doctors and nurses to pain management to facility cleanliness and quietness. Based in part on these scores, hospitals can either lose or gain up to 1.5% of their Medicare payments in fiscal year 2015. CMS will up the ante over the next few years, with 2% of reimbursement dollars ultimately being at risk by fiscal year 2017.
With a growing amount of revenue at stake, hospital leaders are looking for strategies to improve the patient experience and boost their HCAHPS scores.
Focusing on culture
Oxnard, California-based St. John's Hospitals, a Dignity Health member with 330 licensed beds and a $350 million annual operating budget, has been intensely focused on improving patient satisfaction for the past three years.
In 2010 and 2011, St. John's HCAHPS scores ranked in the bottom quartile within Dignity Health. After seeing such disappointing results for two consecutive years, the leadership team set out to improve the patient experience—something CEO Laurie Harting says starts with the overall culture of the organization. Harting also serves as senior vice president of operations for Dignity Health's Southern California West service area.

What can an HRA reimburse?
Written by: Gabrielle Smith
Originally published on May 13, 2021. Last updated January 4, 2022.

Health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) are IRS-approved, employer-sponsored health benefit plans that allow participants to receive reimbursements for a wide variety of out-of-pocket healthcare expenses as well as certain health insurance premiums.
Through an HRA, employees can get reimbursed for all of the items outlined in IRS Publication 502, which includes over 200 eligible expenses!
While you can peruse the full list of IRS-approved expenses here, we’ve broken them all down into two main categories: 1) insurance premiums and 2) out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll also highlight some of the most popular products and services within each of these categories and what documents your employees need to submit in order to get them reimbursed.
Are you a visual learner? Get our infographic summary of the HRA-eligible expenses
1. Insurance premiums
The first category we’ll cover is insurance premiums. According to PeopleKeep customer data, insurance premiums are the number one expense HRA participants get reimbursed.
The following types of insurance premiums are all HRA-qualified, provided they’re not already paid with pre-tax dollars:
Major medical individual health insurance premiums
Dental care and vision care premiums
Medicare Part A or B, Medicare HMO, and employer-sponsored health insurance premiums
Medicare Advantage and Supplement premiums
COBRA premiums
What’s nice about insurance premiums is that since they’re a recurring expense that employees only need to submit once each year, IRB 2006-31 allows employees to receive automatic reimbursement without further review of recurring expenses as long as they match previously approved expenses as to amount, provider, and time period.
2. Out-of-pocket expenses
Next, there’s out-of-pocket expenses. This includes any qualifying medical expenses your employees’ insurance plans don’t already cover, or anything their insurance company expects them to pay for on their own.
Depending on which kind of out-of-pocket costs your employees are paying for, they’ll need to submit different documents in order to get them reimbursed.
There are three categories of out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable with different forms of documentation:
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense and a doctor’s note
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense and a prescription
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense
To start off, some out-of-pocket costs only require the minimum amount of documentation to get reimbursed, and that’s proof of an incurred expense. This could be a receipt or an invoice.
Your employees’ proof must include the following:
The name of the item or service
The name of the vendor
The date of purchase
This category of costs would include any qualifying medical expenses that employees need to pay for before they meet their deductible or out-out-pocket maximum, as well as copayments.
A few popular expenses in this category are doctor’s visits, prescription drugs, dental care, mental health counseling, and chiropractic care.
However, these expenses don’t have to be large. This category also includes several common store items like cold medicine, sunscreens, bandages, eyeglasses and contacts, allergy medicine, pain relievers, and so much more.
Many HRAs don’t rollover year-to-year, so these are the kinds of things employees may choose to stock up on before the new plan year starts to take full advantage of the benefit.
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense and a doctor’s note
Next, let’s talk about the expenses that are reimbursable with both proof and a doctor’s note. Many over-the-counter healthcare products are eligible for reimbursement, but some will need a doctor’s note explaining that they’re medically necessary.
In order for these items to qualify for reimbursement, the doctor’s note needs to include:
The specific names of the items recommended
What medical condition the item is treating
They can’t just be for general health or wellness
Signature of a licensed medical practitioner
Some things that are reimbursable with a doctor’s note are fitness programs, dental veneers, massage therapy, dietary supplements, exercise equipment, and dermatology products.
Costs that are reimbursable with proof of an incurred expense and a prescription
The last category includes out-of-pocket expenses that are reimbursable with proof and a prescription. Common items that employees get reimbursed with prescriptions are vitamins and medicated toothpaste.
While prescription drugs are reimbursable through an HRA, employees don’t need to submit their prescription along with their proof in order to get reimbursed. Prescription drugs already require a prescription in order to purchase them from the pharmacy, so employees won’t be asked for their prescription information again.
Conclusion
An HRA is an ideal way for organizations both big and small to offer a quality health benefit to employees at a cost that you both can afford. Clearly communicating the variety of ways employees can use their HRA not only ensures your employees fully utilize their health benefit, but it also allows you to recruit and retain employees looking for a unique and flexible benefits package from their employer.

Understanding Of Health Reimbursement Agreement (HRA) - Tax Professionals Member Article By Schneiderman and Friedman
Print Posted by Schneiderman and Friedman
Understanding Of Health Reimbursement Agreement (HRA)
What is a health expense reimbursement agreement (HRA)?
A health reimbursement agreement (HRA) is an employer-funded plan that reimburses employees for eligible medical expenses and, in some cases, insurance premiums. Employers can claim a tax deduction for reimbursement they make under these plans, and refunds that employees receive are generally tax-free.
How does a health reimbursement agreement (HRA) work?
A health reimbursement agreement is a plan created by an employer to cover his employees' medical costs. The employer decides how much to invest in the plan, and the employee can claim reimbursement for actual health expenses incurred up to that cost. All employees in the same class bracket must receive the same contribution to the HRA.
An HRA is not an account. Employees cannot withdraw funds in advance and use them to pay their medical bills. Instead, they have to pay the expense first and then reimburse it. Refunds at the time of service are probable if the employer provides an HRA debit card. An employee who has exhausted all funds allocated in the HRA before the end of the year will be required to cover subsequent medical expenses out of their pocket or with funds from a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) if available or Health Savings Account (HSA) for employees with a high deductible health plan (HDHP).
Points to Note
An HRA is not transferable; the employee loses this advantage when he leaves the company.
Depending on the type of HRA, the funds can be used to reimburse premiums for health, dental, and eye insurance and eligible medical expenses.
Employers, not employees, fund HRAs.
Government rules, which employers can enforce, determine what expenses can be reimbursed to employees.
Benefits of health expense reimbursement agreements
In 2019, HRAs were used to pay eligible medical bills, including prescription drugs, insulin, meals paid for during treatment at a medical facility, crutches, an annual physical exam, birth control pills, care from a psychologist or psychiatrist, addiction care, transportation costs incurred for medical treatment and more. According to the Obama administration rules, they cannot be used to pay premiums for individual health insurance.
In January 2020, the HRA changed significantly. The government allows employers to offer their employees a new type of HRA, called HRA with individual coverage, instead of group health insurance.
Employees can use these HRAs to purchase their comprehensive health insurance in pre-tax dollars, inside or outside the Affordable Care Act. HRAs with individual coverage can reimburse employees and eligible health care expenses, such as copayments and deductibles.
Under the new rules, employers who continue to provide traditional group health insurance can offer an exceptional HRA benefit to reimburse employees up to $ 1,800 per year in eligible medical expenses. Employees can purchase an "HRA Exceptional Benefit" even if they decline group health insurance coverage but cannot use the funds to purchase comprehensive health insurance. However, they can use the funds to pay for short-term health insurance, dental and eye insurance premiums, and eligible medical bills.
Employees can use HRA money to cover medical, dental, and vision expenses for spouses and dependents.
Limitations of HRA
An HRA only covers eligible medical and dental expenses. According to the IRS, medical bills are expenses incurred to relieve or prevent physical or mental illness and not expenses to maintain general health, such as vitamins.
Expenses that are not considered necessary medical expenses include, for example, maternity clothes, funeral services, teeth whitening, childcare for a healthy child, marriage counseling, gym membership fees, controlled substances, drugs from other countries, and over-the-counter drugs.
An employer can exclude certain medical expenses, even if the IRS qualifies the expenses. The list of reimbursable medical expenses of the employer will be detailed in the employee's HRA document.
HRA compared to other agreements.
An employee who has an FSA and an HRA and has an eligible expense to reimburse by both plans cannot choose which plans will cover the expenses. Instead, you will be reimbursed by the plan that the employer has set up to pay first. Once this plan is depleted, the second plan will cover subsequent eligible medical expenses reported for refunds.
Here's an in-depth look at other options for funding out-of-pocket medical expenses.
HSA
Compared to an HRA, a Health Savings Account (HSA) is a fully earned tax benefit account that is not subject to losses if funds remain in the account at the end of the year. An HSA is linked with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) to pay medical and dental bills. The account is financed by the employer and/or employee and, like an FSA, cannot be used to pay insurance premiums. Unlike HRA and FSA, employees can keep their HSA if they change employers.
FSA
An FSA is funded by a portion of an employee's pre-tax salary, and unlike an HRA, each employee determines how much money should be allocated annually to these agreements. The unused funds from the HRA can be transferred to the following year at the employer's discretion. Unspent FSA funds generally cannot be used in the next plan year, although an employer can offer a short grace period or allow a transfer of up to $ 500.
HRA funding and portability
The healthcare reimbursement agreement is financed exclusively by the employer, deciding on each employee's maximum annual HRA contribution. With the new HRA rules, employers still determine how much to contribute to employee HRAs, except that all workers in the same category of employees must receive the same contribution, as mentioned above.
Any HRA funds not used until the end of the year can be carried over to the next year, although an employer can set a transfer limit that can be carried over from year to year. Also, if an employee is made redundant or leaves the company to work for another company, they will lose their HRA. This differentiates it from an HSA - a health savings account - which is portable.
HRA tax advantages
As a benefit to employers, HRA refunds are 100% tax-deductible. Instead of more expensive retirement plans, the employer can use an HRA to cover retired employees' health costs. Plus, because the plans are fully employer-funded, they provide predictability, allowing employers to anticipate their approximate maximum HRA health benefits for that year.
Employees can use the agreement to pay a wide range of medical bills not covered by their health insurance policies. Also, reimbursements are exempt from taxes up to a maximum amount for a period of coverage. Some companies may offer employees the added benefit of other employer-offered health benefits, such as the FSA, along with an HRA.

Alright, so from the search results, it seems like HCAHPS is related to patient satisfaction surveys in hospitals, and it affects Medicare reimbursement. But I need to understand how it impacts insurance reimbursement in general, not just Medicare.

Looking at Doc 3, it mentions that "Through the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, patients rate their inpatient stay in 27 categories, ranging from communication with doctors and nurses to pain management to facility cleanliness and quietness. Based in part on these scores, hospitals can either lose or gain up to 1.5% of their Medicare payments in fiscal year 2015. CMS will up the ante over the next few years, with 2% of reimbursement dollars ultimately being at risk by fiscal year 2017."

So, for Medicare, HCAHPS scores affect reimbursement, with potential gains or losses of up to 2% based on performance. But what about other insurance providers? Do they also tie reimbursement to HCAHPS scores?

Looking back at the search results, most of the information is about Medicare and HCAHPS. Maybe I need to dig deeper to see if private insurers also use HCAHPS scores for reimbursement.

Perhaps I should search specifically for "private insurance reimbursement and HCAHPS."

Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs)
Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs)
On June 20, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services issued final rules regarding health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) and other account-based group health plans. Specifically, the final rules allow HRAs and other account-based group health plans to be integrated with individual health insurance coverage or Medicare, if certain conditions are satisfied (an individual coverage HRA). The final rules also set forth conditions under which certain HRAs and other account-based group health plans will be recognized as limited excepted benefits (an excepted benefit HRA).

Employer Shared Responsibility Provisions, Certain Nondiscrimination Rules and Individual Coverage HRAs
On November 19, 2018, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury issued Notice 2018-88 describing the application of the employer shared responsibility provisions in section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) to an applicable large employer that offers an individual coverage HRA, the application of certain nondiscrimination rules in section 105(h) of the Code to certain individual coverage HRAs, and potential safe harbors for those provisions. The IRS and the Department of the Treasury also requested comments on the issues addressed in Notice 2018-88.  On September 30, 2019, the IRS and the Department of the Treasury issued proposed regulations clarifying the application of the employer shared responsibility provisions in Code section 4980H and the nondiscrimination rules in Code section 105(h) to individual coverage HRAs, and providing proposed safe harbors for the application of those provisions to individual coverage HRAs, with certain changes compared to the potential safe harbors described in Notice 2018-88. Generally, taxpayers are permitted to rely on the proposed regulations.

Questions and Answers about Individual Coverage HRAs and Safe Harbors
The proposed regulations under Code section 4980H that were issued on September 30, 2019 provide safe harbors for determining whether an offer of an individual coverage HRA pursuant to the June 2019 final rules is an offer of minimum value, affordable coverage for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions. These regulations are proposed to apply for periods beginning after December 31, 2019. Under the proposed regulations, which may be relied upon for periods during any plan year of an individual coverage HRA beginning before the date that is six months following the publication of any final regulations, an individual coverage HRA that is considered affordable under the applicable safe harbor(s) provides minimum value. Proposed Treas. Reg. § 54.4980H-5(f)(3).
Q. How does an employer determine if an offer of an individual coverage HRA is considered affordable for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions?
A. Whether the offer is affordable for purposes of the employer shared responsibility provisions is based on the lowest cost silver plan for self-only coverage provided for the residence of an employee, or, under the location safe harbor, an employee's primary site of employment. An additional safe harbor allows an employer to determine affordability of an individual coverage HRA with a calendar year plan year using the lowest cost silver plan for self-only coverage for January of the prior year. For an individual coverage HRA that does not have a calendar year plan year, the employer may determine affordability of the HRA using the lowest cost silver plan for self-only coverage for January of the current year. Regulations under Code section 36B PDF provide similar rules referencing the lowest cost silver plan for self-only coverage for the location of an employee's residence for determining the employee's eligibility for a premium tax credit if the employee is offered an individual coverage HRA.
Q. For any location and year, how can an individual or an employer determine the lowest cost silver plan for self-only coverage for a particular month?
A. Individuals and employers may use the Employer Lowest Cost Silver Plan Premium Look-up Table to determine the lowest cost silver plan for any location, for determining if an employer's offer of an individual coverage HRA is affordable either for purposes of whether an individual qualifies for the premium tax credit under Code section 36B, or for purposes of whether the employer's offer of the individual coverage HRA satisfies a safe harbor under the proposed regulations under Code section 4908H.

Private Health Plans: An Overview
ASHA/Practice Management/Reimbursement/Private Plans/
Private Health Plans: An Overview
This page provides an overview of private health plans in relation to audiology and speech-language pathology services including information on coverage, reimbursement, appealing denials, and determining fees.
Private Health Plans and Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Services
Types of Health Plans
Private health plans are offered by commercial insurance companies, such as Aetna, Cigna, and BlueCross BlueShield Plans. Private health plans are either indemnity (fee-for-service) plans, or managed care plans, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Managed care plans control or "manage" health care spending by closely monitoring how providers treat patients. Over time, the distinctions between these kinds of plans have begun to blur. Some indemnity plans offer managed care-type options, while some managed care plans offer members providers who are "outside" of the plan.
Coverage of Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology Services
Outpatient speech-language pathology and audiology services are often covered by health plans, but with limitations. Services delivered to inpatients are routinely included in basic hospital coverage. Many insurance companies provide coverage for communication disorders associated with illnesses or accidents, but often exclude those disorders that have a developmental or congenital etiology.
Nearly all insurers cover audiological diagnostic services which are required by a physician to establish a diagnosis. Evaluations to detect hearing loss and services related to degenerative hearing loss may or may not be covered. Hearing aids are covered by some plans when the hearing loss results from an illness or injury, but many insurers exclude hearing aids.
Clinicians should ask their patients to determine their health plan policy's coverage before the first visit. It is the patient's responsibility to pay for services rendered if the services are not covered. There may be deductibles and copayments even if most charges are covered.
Reimbursement
Reimbursement may be restricted to certain provider settings (hospitals or clinics) or only to licensed practitioners. A physician may have to refer the patient to a service provider or "prescribe" a speech-language pathology or audiology treatment.
Clinicians will need to determine what claim forms to use, and if the enrollee will need to receive written authorization for services from their primary care physician. A patient may be required to see only those speech-language pathologists and audiologists approved by the health plan.
Medical Coding
A key to proper reimbursement is coding your services appropriately. If you want to get paid for what you do, you have to speak the language of coding. There are two basic medical coding systems to use in communicating with payers: the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) which is tied to medical necessity, and the AMA's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) which provides codes for procedures and services.
Additional Resources:
ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Codes Related to Speech, Language, and Swallowing Disorders [PDF]
ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Codes Related to Hearing and Vestibular Disorders [PDF]
Model Superbill for Audiology Services (CPT codes) [DOC]
Model Superbill for Speech-Language Pathology Services (CPT codes) [DOC]
Payment Methods
You can expect to be reimbursed in one of several ways. Discounted fee-for-service where the provider agrees to provide services to enrollees of a health plan at fees below the normal rate is one way, or perhaps by capitation, where the insurer pays the provider an agreed-upon amount of money per enrollee per month for a defined set of services, say $0.40 per enrollee per month to provide audiological services, or $0.04 per enrollee per month for speech-language pathology services. Additional alternative payment models are evolving with healthcare reform.
Before contracting with a payer, obtain a copy of their fee schedule. Payers develop fee schedules in much the same way as providers develop their fee schedules, either using a market-driven approach, a relative value approach (each procedure is assigned a relative work value related to the skill, time and risk involved in performing that service), or a blended approach.
Filing a Claim & Appealing a Denial
Claims
The clinician must decide whether the patient or provider (clinician) will file claims for services rendered. If the patient files, you will need to give the patient the necessary information (a bill with CPT procedure codes, ICD-10 diagnostic codes, charges, and supporting documentation). If you have a signed agreement with a health plan, you may be required to send the claim directly to them.
Remember, health plan coverage is an arrangement between patient and health plan. Providers need to provide necessary documentation, but always make it clear to the patient that they are ultimately responsible for payment of services.
You should be aware of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that addresses privacy of and electronic transmission of patient information. As one clinician noted, HIPAA means you must "pay more attention to records, what patient information is collected, what is transmitted or shared, and how information is stored and protected."
Review the patient's insurance policy to see if audiology or speech-language pathology services are covered. Is the policy clear or vague? Claim decisions are based on contract wording, so review the section describing your services carefully.
The clinician can contact the Provider Relations Department to determine his/her status as a provider. Is your setting recognized (independent practice, outpatient)? Do you need a provider number to file claims? Is there a specific claim form to use? What documentation is necessary (weekly notes, evaluation report)? Is pre-authorization necessary?
Preparing A Claim
You will provide patient information as well as diagnosis (ICD-10) and procedural codes (CPT). You must be able to support your coding decisions with patient history, physician referral notes, evaluation results, and other documentation that supports your professional judgement as to the cause of the patient's condition and required treatment. Be sure to obtain patient permission to supply the health plan with relevant documentation.
National Provider Identifiers (NPIs)
All health care providers and organizations are eligible to receive NPIs. Effective May 27, 2007, providers and organizations that are defined as covered entities under HIPAA will be required to have an NPI in order to identify themselves in HIPAA standard transactions. The NPI will replace the current health care provider numbers. It takes less than 5 minutes to apply online and the number is issued within a few minutes. The provider type is 23 (speech, language, hearing service provider). The taxonomy number for audiologist is 231H00000X. The taxonomy number for SLP is 235Z00000X.
See also: NPI Information
Waiting For A Decision
Most states require health plans to pay or deny a claim within approximately 30 days. If a health plan continues to deny a claim you believe should be paid, or if the health plan fails to make any decision, send a well-documented account of the claim to the state insurance commission.
Appealing a Denial
If you receive a claim denial and do not agree with the decision, consider appealing the denial. Go back and review the patient's insurance policy for coverage information. The explanation of benefits (EOB) letter from the health plan is the key to payment or denial status. If the coverage language supports payment, write an appeal letter describing the disorder and its medical nature, and reference the coverage policy paragraph that shows how your treatment fits coverage criteria.
The health plan may conduct an internal review of the denial. If all levels of appeal are exhausted, and you still believe your treatment meets coverage definitions, consider taking the case to the external claim review level. The Kaiser Family Foundation provides information on State External Appeals Review Processes. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) establishes new standards for external review processes for group health insurance plans and health insurance issuers offering coverage in the group and individual markets. The ACA requirements for appeals and external reviews apply to self-funded and insured plans alike.
Determining Fees
Health care providers have some flexibility when setting private fees. Unlike Medicare, private payers employ a variety of payment methodologies. Clinicians should choose a pricing philosophy and gather available charge information in order to establish a rational fee schedule and to negotiate health care contracts.
Available Fee Data
You can compare your fees with the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Remember, in determining fees for your services, avoid any method that can be construed as price-fixing, such as discussing fees with other local practices. Setting prices in collusion with colleagues is illegal.
Choosing a Pricing Philosophy
Setting medical fees uses two basic pricing philosophies: a market-driven approach and a relative value approach. A market-driven approach (known also as UCR: usual, customary, and reasonable) ties medical pricing to industry trends in local communities and assumes patients are price-sensitive. With a relative value approach, fees are tied to the "worth" of a procedure taking into account provider skill, time, and risk. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule uses the relative value method.
Establishing fees takes care. Fees that are too high will lead to disputes with patients and payers, and fees that are too low will result in inadequate reimbursement.

Okay, so from these search results, it seems like HCAHPS is primarily related to Medicare reimbursement. Doc 3 mentions that HCAHPS scores affect Medicare payments, with potential gains or losses of up to 2% based on performance. However, when I look at the other documents, they don't seem to directly address how HCAHPS impacts private insurance reimbursement.

In Doc 1, it's about reimbursement in general, focusing on Medicare and Medicaid, but doesn't specify about HCAHPS and private insurance. Doc 2 is about qualifying expenses for tax-free reimbursement, which isn't directly related to HCAHPS. Doc 4 is about HRAs and their reimbursement rules, again not directly related to HCAHPS. Doc 5 is about private health plans and reimbursement for audiology and speech-language pathology services, but again, no mention of HCAHPS.

It seems like HCAHPS is mainly used by Medicare to determine reimbursement, but I'm not finding clear information on whether private insurers use HCAHPS scores similarly.

Maybe I should look for information specifically on how private insurers use HCAHPS scores for reimbursement.

Patient Satisfaction & HCAHPS Reimbursement | Relias

Patient Satisfaction & HCAHPS Reimbursement
By Katherine Detwiler and Natalie Vaughn, MBA, on September 11, 2020
There’s no question about it—healthcare is quickly becoming a consumer-driven industry. As a result, healthcare facilities must now compete with one another to gain new patients and maintain their loyalty. For many of these institutions, that means earning high patient satisfaction scores that demonstrate their value to consumers eager to invest in a trusted healthcare partner.
But building a robust consumer base isn’t the only benefit of high patient satisfaction scores. Medicare payment systems have shifted in recent years, inextricably linking patient satisfaction scores with reimbursement rates. These shifts have positioned high-quality patient care as paramount to an institution’s viability and directly shaped every healthcare administrator’s patient satisfaction strategy.
What are HCAHPS Scores?
The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scoring system helps hospitals and their governing bodies evaluate patient satisfaction through quantitative measurements. The HCAHPS survey can be broken down into a series of questions that evaluate key elements of the patient experience, including communication with doctors and nurses, the responsiveness of hospital staff, hospital cleanliness and noise level, pain management, and availability of information. Scores are provided for each of these areas and more and then calculated into a single, overall patient satisfaction rating.
While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the HCAHPS survey in 2006, public reporting of scores did not occur until 2008. In publicizing survey scores, CMS hopes to empower consumers to make objective and meaningful comparisons between healthcare institutions and incentivize those institutions to improve their quality of care.
Do HCAHPS Scores Impact Reimbursement?
Since 2012, HCAHPS patient satisfaction scores have played a pivotal part in hospital reimbursement through the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program. But how exactly does patient satisfaction impact reimbursement? According to the program, the higher a hospital’s HCAHPS scores, the higher their reimbursements will be, and vice versa.
As a result, low HCAHPS scores impact a hospital’s bottom line in two ways: by hindering their reputation among consumers and limiting the amount of funding they receive from Medicare. In 2016 alone, $1.5 billion in value-based incentive payments was available to hospitals. Those that had the highest HCAHPS scores, among other key factors, received the most financial support, while those with exceptionally low scores received financial penalties.
Do High Patient Satisfaction Scores Equal Better Health?
There is substantial debate surrounding the relationship between high patient satisfaction scores and clinical outcomes. While some studies have found a correlation between patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, others question the implications that patient feedback can have on physician behavior.
In an article published in the Journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, a group of physicians expressed concern over healthcare professionals avoiding difficult questions—including those related to a patient’s weight, drug and alcohol usage, and other lifestyle habits—in an effort to increase satisfaction scores. They also pointed to unnecessary hospital admissions, the over-prescription of drugs, and needless testing as further examples of healthcare professionals’ attempts to keep patients happy while jeopardizing the quality of care provided.
These factors are important for healthcare leaders to keep in mind as they navigate HCAHPS scores. For many, the key to achieving higher patient satisfaction and, in turn, reimbursement, lies in having an honest, open, and empathetic approach to care rather than simply satisfying all of a patient’s desires. When done effectively, this approach can simultaneously lead to higher patient satisfaction scores and improved patient outcomes.
How to Improve Patient Satisfaction Scores
Improving patient satisfaction scores is best achieved through a multifaceted approach focused on three crucial elements: improving the quality of care provided, fostering a strong patient-practitioner connection, and creating a space for success.
Improving the Quality of Care Provided
While each hospital has its own unique set of challenges to overcome before it can improve the quality of care it provides, all hospitals, at a baseline level, must focus on:
Conducting Effective Pain Management: No two patient’s pain thresholds are exactly alike. To ensure all patients receive effective pain management, healthcare professionals must be intimately familiar with the methods used to evaluate a patient’s pain levels, including numerical rating scales, visual analog scales, and categorical assessments. Once they have identified their patient’s pain level, healthcare professionals must determine how best to manage it. Administering medication, repositioning the patient, or providing a cold compress are just a few of the many pain management techniques a healthcare professional can deploy. Healthcare professionals should also know how to reassess a patient’s pain after each technique has been administered.
Minimizing Environmental Stressors: A patient’s surroundings can have a significant impact on their experience in a hospital. Loud noises and bright lights in particular may negatively affect their sleep and anxiety levels, disrupting the healing process. Training staff to pay close attention to their surroundings and empowering them to minimize disruptions helps ensure all patients can reside in an environment that facilitates their recovery.
Encouraging Professional Development: As healthcare best practices evolve, so must the practitioners that implement them. Creating an organized, ongoing professional development program helps ensure all clinical staff members are up-to-date on new treatment options, pain management tactics, and clinical care requirements. Professional development opportunities have also been linked to increased employee engagement. The more engaged staff members are in their work, the more invested they are in their patients.
Fostering a Strong Patient-Practitioner Connection
Patients often experience a myriad of emotions when they enter the hospital, including anxiety, vulnerability, and fear. To help ease their patients’ concerns and create a positive, nurturing environment, healthcare professionals must strive to create a strong, respectful connection with their patients by:
Developing a Rapport: Taking a few minutes to engage with a patient before beginning clinical treatment helps healthcare professionals establish a sense of trust with their patients and allay any fears they may be experiencing. The more relaxed a patient is, the better equipped they are to retain important clinical information about their condition.
Making Care Personal: Healthcare professionals demonstrate commitment to their patients when they make a sincere effort to connect with them. Using the patient’s name, asking questions that involve the patient in their own care (“What matters to you?”), and making eye contact instead of distractedly looking at a computer screen are just a few of the many ways healthcare professionals can foster more meaningful care practices. Punctuality also demonstrates respect for the patient and their schedule. If an organization is struggling to see patients on time, it may be time for them to reevaluate their scheduling processes and/or staffing needs.
Communicating Consistently: No patient wants to be left in the dark regarding their health. Keeping patients abreast of any updates to their condition helps alleviate the feelings of confusion and unease that often accompany a visit with a practitioner. Teach-back methods and non-medical language also help healthcare providers improve communication and empower patients to take charge of their health.
Listening: The best insights on how to improve patient satisfaction come from the patients themselves. Hospital administrators are encouraged to examine data from a range of sources to reveal the true voice of the patient rather than relying solely on patient satisfaction scores. Online reviews, social media comments, pulse surveys, and more all help healthcare practitioners glean a comprehensive understanding of the patient experience and identify areas of improvement.
Creating a Space for Success
When it comes to improving patient satisfaction scores, creating a space for success is just as important as improving the quality of care provided and fostering connection. Creating a space for success simply means laying the groundwork for an environment in which all healthcare professionals are supported in their efforts to provide high-quality patient care. This can be achieved through:
Upgrading Outdated Systems: Slow, outdated systems delay treatment and cause frustration among patients and providers alike. Even small updates to appointment scheduling platforms, waiting room systems and signage, and nurse call buttons can increase a provider’s efficiency and positively impact patient satisfaction.
Caring for the Caretakers: Healthcare professionals who feel valued at work and find meaning in their profession create better experiences for their patients than those consumed by frustration and burnout. As a result, healthcare administrators must remain constantly in-sync with their employees and ensure they have access to the professional, psychological, and financial support they need to remain engaged.
Setting Expectations: Healthcare facilities are encouraged to regularly update their website, patient portal, and printed materials to ensure pertinent information is readily available at all times. Including an FAQ section within these materials that addresses prescription refills, after-hours care, and appointment scheduling also helps minimize patient frustration and allow healthcare providers to focus their energy on treatment.
Ensuring Cleanliness: No one wants to receive care in an environment that doesn’t feel sanitary and safe. By implementing exhaustive cleanliness practices that reach every corner of the building, including waiting rooms, bathrooms, and physicians’ offices, healthcare institutions can better protect their patients and put them at ease.
Improve Your Patient Satisfaction Scores
More than ever before, a hospital’s success is contingent on their ability to prioritize the patient experience. HCAHPS scores are directly tied to hospital reimbursement, putting pressure on healthcare administrators across the country to create environments that foster a safe, comfortable patient experience. For many, that means working directly with their staff to improve their quality of care and ensure they remain engaged at all times.

patient satisfaction
Providing an excellent patient experience is tied more closely than ever to reimbursements.
This article first appeared in the July/August 2014 issue of HealthLeaders magazine.
It has always been a moral imperative for hospitals and health systems to provide a high-quality patient experience, but now that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is tying reimbursements to HCAHPS scores, it's becoming a financial priority, as well.
Through the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey, patients rate their inpatient stay in 27 categories, ranging from communication with doctors and nurses to pain management to facility cleanliness and quietness. Based in part on these scores, hospitals can either lose or gain up to 1.5% of their Medicare payments in fiscal year 2015. CMS will up the ante over the next few years, with 2% of reimbursement dollars ultimately being at risk by fiscal year 2017.
With a growing amount of revenue at stake, hospital leaders are looking for strategies to improve the patient experience and boost their HCAHPS scores.
Focusing on culture
Oxnard, California-based St. John's Hospitals, a Dignity Health member with 330 licensed beds and a $350 million annual operating budget, has been intensely focused on improving patient satisfaction for the past three years.
In 2010 and 2011, St. John's HCAHPS scores ranked in the bottom quartile within Dignity Health. After seeing such disappointing results for two consecutive years, the leadership team set out to improve the patient experience—something CEO Laurie Harting says starts with the overall culture of the organization. Harting also serves as senior vice president of operations for Dignity Health's Southern California West service area.

What is the difference between Hcahps and Press Ganey?
While the HCAHPS survey measures patient experience (how often a service was provided), the Press Ganey integrated survey reveals important qualitative details (how well a service was provided) – enabling a balanced perspective on patient care within your organization.
How does the Hcahps score impact reimbursement?
According to the program, the higher a hospital’s HCAHPS scores, the higher their reimbursements will be, and vice versa. As a result, low HCAHPS scores impact a hospital’s bottom line in two ways: by hindering their reputation among consumers and limiting the amount of funding they receive from Medicare.
How does reimbursement impact patient centered care?
Value-based care reimbursement is pushing forward a more patient-centric healthcare delivery system. Value-based care reimbursement is pushing forward a more patient-centric healthcare delivery system, which can be clearly seen due to the creation of accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes.
Why do hospitals want high Hcahps scores?
The purpose of the HCAHPS is to gives hospitals a quality grade. Higher scores on the assessment survey increase a facility’s reimbursement.
What is the purpose of Hcahps and why was it initiated?
While many hospitals collect information on patient satisfaction, HCAHPS (pronounced “H-caps”) created a national standard for collecting and public reporting information that enables valid comparisons to be made across all hospitals to support consumer choice.
How do Hcahps scores affect quality?
HCAHPS and patient outcomes There’s evidence that HCAHPS scores are also tied to favorable outcomes for patients. Additionally, lower mortality hospitals have higher patient satisfaction scores compared to high mortality facilities.
What is the difference between Hcahps and Cahps?
The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) Survey, also known as the CAHPS® Hospital Survey or Hospital CAHPS®, is a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology that has been in use since 2006 to measure patients’ perspectives of hospital care.
What are the Hcahps domains?
The HCAHPS survey contains over 30 questions and touches upon 9 different domains (communication with doctors, communication with nurses, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, cleanliness of the hospital environment, quietness of the hospital …
What is patient satisfaction score?
Patient satisfaction: a subjective measure of whether a patient’s expectations about a health encounter were met.
How is patient satisfaction measured?
HCAHPS measure patient satisfaction The Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) surveys are standardized industry questionnaires used to assess patient satisfaction and experience at various points of care. HCAHPS is the survey used in hospital settings.
What are the 27 Hcahps questions?
The 27 HCAHPS questions ten areas related to the patient experience:
Communication with Nurses.
Communication with Doctors.
The responsiveness of the hospital staff.
Pain management.
Medical providers communication regarding medication.
Information about discharge.
How clean the hospital was.
How quiet the hospital was.

What does Hcahps measure?
HCAHPS (pronounced “H-caps”), also known as the CAHPS Hospital Survey, is a survey instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients’ perceptions of their hospital experience. Second, public reporting of the survey results creates new incentives for hospitals to improve quality of care.
What is an Hcap score?
HCAHPS (the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) is a patient satisfaction survey required by CMS (the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) for all hospitals in the United States. The Survey is for adult inpatients, excluding psychiatric patients.
What is meant by the top box format?
Top Box Score: The top box score is the percentage of responses in the highest possible category for a question, section, or survey (e.g. percentage of ‘Very Good,’ or ‘Always’ responses).
How are Hcahps scores used?
HCAHPS scores are used to enable objective comparisons of hospitals across a variety of metrics, inform healthcare consumers about the relative standard of care at each facility and create incentives for hospitals and healthcare organizations to compete on patient engagement and satisfaction.
Are Hcahps scores public?
HCAHPS results are publicly reported on Hospital Compare as “top-box,” “bottom-box” and “middle-box” scores. The “top-box” is the most positive response to HCAHPS Survey items.
What percentage of the Hcahps is about patient experience?
In 2008, the first year all hospitals had to administer HCAHPS, patient response rates averaged at 33.3 percent. By 2017, that rate dropped to 26.7 percent.
Are patient satisfaction scores public?
Patient satisfaction scores are now available publicly and are tied to Medicare reimbursement incentivizing hospitals to improve patients’ perceptions of their care.
Why does Medicare use Hcahps?
The HCAHPS Survey (pronounced “H-caps”) is a 29-item instrument and data collection methodology for measuring patients’ perceptions of their hospital experience. HCAHPS allows valid comparisons to be made across hospitals — locally, regionally and nationally.
How does patient satisfaction increase revenue?
Patient Experience Leads to Revenue Organizations providing “superior” patient experience achieve net margins 50 percent higher than those providing “average” patient experience. Hospitals with higher patient ratings saw a 0.2% increase in net operating profit margin for every one-point increase in hospital rating.
How does the VBP program measure hospital performance?
HOW DOES THE VBP PROGRAM MEASURE HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE? CMS bases hospital performance on an approved set of measures and dimensions grouped into specific quality domains. CMS assigns domain weights (percentages) which are then used to score each domain.
What are core measures in healthcare?
Core measures are national standards of care and treatment processes for common conditions. These processes are proven to reduce complications and lead to better patient outcomes. Core measure compliance shows how often a hospital provides each recommended treatment for certain medical conditions.
What are the basic healthcare measures?
A) Measures of health status Health status can be measured using pathological and clinical measures and is usually observed by clinicians or measured using instruments. Types of disease measurement include: Signs – blood pressure, temperature, X-ray, tumour size. Symptoms – disease specific checklists.

Home / Why TigerConnect / Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) / What are HCAHPS Scores?
Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Scores
The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) is a patient satisfaction survey that was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in collaboration with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) beginning in 2002.
The HCAHPS survey was designed to help government agencies begin to collect and aggregate data on patient’s perspectives of care at the various healthcare facilities in the United States. HCAHPS scores are used to enable objective comparisons of hospitals across a variety of metrics, inform healthcare consumers about the relative standard of care at each facility and create incentives for hospitals and healthcare organizations to compete on patient engagement and satisfaction.
The HCAHPS survey consists of 27 questions that address six composite topics, two individual items, and two global items:
Composite Topics
Nurse Communication
Responsiveness of Hospital Staff
Physician Communication
Pain Management
Communication about Medicines
Discharge Information
Individual Items
Cleanliness of Hospital Environment
Quietness of Hospital Environment
Global Items
Overall Rating of Hospital
Willingness to Recommend Hospital
Hospitals are not expected to administer the HCAHPS survey to each and every single patient that they discharge. Rather, participating hospitals are expected to obtain at least 300 HCAHPS surveys over a 12-month reporting period by drawing a random sample of eligible patients who meet the following criteria:
18 years of age or older when admitted to the hospital
At least one overnight stay in inpatient care at the facility
Non-psychiatric diagnosis at discharge
Alive at the time of discharge
What are HCAHPS Scores Used For?
Hospitals collect HCAHPS by randomly sampling discharged patients who qualify for the survey. The collected data is submitted to the HCAHPS data warehouse where it is cleaned and analyzed by officials at the United States CMS and publicly reported to consumers on the Hospital Compare website.
On the Hospital Compare website, a web-based application allows users to compare up to three hospitals at a time across several performance categories that are informed by HCAHPS scores. After choosing several hospitals to compare, the user can click on a tab with the name “Survey of patient’s experiences” to see how patients rated their experiences at each facility.
For each hospital, users can see the proportion of patients who:
Reported that their nurses “Always” communicated well
Reported that their doctors “Always” communicated well
Reported that they “Always” received help as soon as they wanted
Reported that staff “Always” explained about medicines before giving it to them
Reported that their room and bathroom were “Always” clean
Reported that their room was “Always” quiet at night
Reported that “YES”, they were given information about what to do during their recovery at home
“Strongly Agree” they understood their care when they left the hospital
Gave their hospital a rating of 9 or 10 on a scale from 0 to 10 for overall performance
Reported that “YES”, they would definitely recommend the hospital
How You Can Improve HCAHPS Scores
The HCAHPS survey encourages hospitals to emphasize patient experience and patient engagement as critical aspects of healthcare delivery. To that end, healthcare providers can improve HCAHPS scores by communicating frequently and clearly with patients, maintaining a positive healthcare environment that promotes wellness and recovery and demonstrating exceptional service and commitment to patient well-being.
Communication and direct engagement with patients are the most important factors influencing HCAHPS scores, as five of the reported metrics are directly linked to communication. Hospitals should ensure that nurses and doctors communicate frequently and effectively with patients, provide them with adequate information about medications, give detailed home recovery instructions, and verify that patients understand their care before discharging them.
Clinical Communication with TigerConnect
TigerConnect offers a robust clinical communication platform that facilitates patient engagement by streamlining communications between patients and their care-givers through a messaging application that promotes information sharing, collaborative patient management, and increased patient engagement.
With TigerConnect, hospitals and healthcare facilities can engage patients and improve their HCAHPS scores, demonstrating their commitment to patient satisfaction.

<|end_search_result|>

From these search results, it's evident that HCAHPS is primarily used by Medicare to determine reimbursement rates for hospitals based on patient satisfaction scores. The higher the HCAHPS scores, the higher the reimbursement rates, and vice versa. This linkage between patient satisfaction and reimbursement is a key component of the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program.

However, when it comes to private insurers, the situation is less clear. None of the search results explicitly state that private insurers use HCAHPS scores for reimbursement purposes. Doc 1 mentions that "healthcare facilities must now compete with one another to gain new patients and maintain their loyalty," suggesting that patient satisfaction is important for attracting and retaining patients, which could indirectly affect reimbursement through patient choice and retention. But it doesn't specify that private insurers directly use HCAHPS scores for reimbursement decisions.

Doc 2 discusses how hospitals are looking to improve HCAHPS scores due to the impact on Medicare reimbursement, but again, there's no mention of private insurers using HCAHPS scores.

Doc 3 compares HCAHPS with another patient satisfaction survey tool, Press Ganey, but doesn't discuss the use of HCAHPS by private insurers.

Doc 4 talks about the importance of HCAHPS in the context of pay-for-performance models and its impact on hospital reimbursement, again focusing on Medicare.

Doc 5 explains what HCAHPS scores are and how they are used by CMS for public reporting and reimbursement adjustments, but doesn't mention private insurers.

Given this information, it seems that HCAHPS is mainly used by Medicare to adjust reimbursement based on patient satisfaction scores, and there's no direct evidence that private insurers use HCAHPS scores for reimbursement purposes. It's possible that private insurers have their own patient satisfaction surveys or use different metrics to assess and adjust reimbursement, but that's speculative based on the provided search results.

Therefore, my conclusion is that HCAHPS primarily impacts insurance reimbursement through Medicare, with no direct impact on private insurance reimbursement based on the available information.
