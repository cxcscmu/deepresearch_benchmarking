Alright, so I've got this question: "What is the role of youth in the creation of a beloved community?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what a "beloved community" is, to be honest. I think it might be related to Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision, but I'm not certain. Maybe I should look that up first.

The Beloved Community - by Lisa Allgood, Executive Presbyter
The Beloved Community
by Lisa Allgood, Executive Presbyter
Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. Romans 12:2
In a recent meeting of some of the Presbytery leadership, as we started to dream about what God wants for us this year, we kept coming to the phrase “Beloved Community”. Over and over. And so it became our theme for the Presbytery for 2022.
You’ll start to see it in many places – our committees, deliberations, musings, planning.  Our blogs this year will focus on the concept of us as a Beloved Community, in all the ways this is seen and understood – a Beloved Community of believers, knit together by faith and place and time here in greater Cincinnati; a Beloved Community of God in unity blessed by His grace and mercy; a Beloved Community working together for the peace and reconciliation of the world – using our love, energy, intelligence and imagination.
We pray this season nurtures us into being a truly Beloved Community within our congregations and across the Presbytery.  That is our goal.  And you are invited into that conversation (submit a blog to us)!
Henri Nouwen, a treasured catholic teacher, activist and pastor, once described beloved community as “the place where the person you least want to live with always lives… That person is always in your community somewhere; in the eyes of others, you might be that person.”
Of course we know not to expect perfection from the communities we join, sometimes especially our church community, or from individual others. Or from ourselves. Or we should – although we don’t always act that way.
Nouwen notes that beloved community requires us to believe that others are worth our effort, and that we will be worth the effort in the eyes of others.  That kind of hopefulness and generosity – towards others or to ourselves – is not easy.  We frail, feeble, fragile, fearful humans tend to run away from that kind of community, not just because it is hard to build, but also because we don’t see that what we hold together is bigger than anything we falsely think divides us.
The work of Beloved Community is bigger than we imagine. It’s not just about building a better world; it’s also about building up each other’s faith, and our trust in each other. It’s about sharing big goals, working together to achieve them; the desire to be in a community that is peaceful, happy, and safe – for us and for our dreams.  Conflict will exist, but in a Beloved Community it is resolved peacefully, nonviolently, and without lingering hostility, ill will, or resentment.  In a Beloved Community, we appreciate and recognize the inherent worth and value of all people, and of all life.  We are a Beloved Community when we are motivated by kindness, compassion, and love – just as we were taught by Jesus. We lift each other up. And so the means we use to navigate and create change are just as kind and compassionate as the ends we seek: carrying forward the light and love of our Lord Jesus the Christ toward a place of peace and reconciliation.
Not only can we create the Beloved Community here, but we can count on it.  We can create a Beloved Community that heals the division between us, and also the doubt within us.
When we act as a truly connectional – dare I say connected? – church, the Beloved Community is what we become, and how we show up to the people around us. A Beloved Community treats everyone with courtesy, compassion, and kindness.  It eschews competitiveness and one-way thinking.  It becomes the visible, tangible, loving, beating heart of a living God to the people we worship with as well as the people we meet randomly on the street.
We can all do the inner work necessary to become members of a Beloved Community by refining our minds and hearts to let go of the greed, prejudice, blame, and falsehood that reside there. Only then can infinite and all-inclusive kindness, compassion, and goodwill – the Light of our Lord – shine through. And then let’s work together.
Presbytery of Cincinnati, I wish every single one of you boundless love, peace, health, joy, and success in 2022 as we work together to create the Beloved Community of the Presbytery of Cincinnati, and a more peaceful, just and loving world.

Beloved Community Quotes – Wisdom Quotes
Beloved Community Quotes
Josiah Royce first used the term “The Beloved Community” to describe a condition of reconciliation.  Royce also founded the Fellowship of Reconciliation, of which the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a member.  King popularized the term.  The Beloved Community was not meant to be a vision of a heaven in the clouds, but a practical possibility humanity could create, on earth, as a spiritual goal.  In Beloved Community, love and justice rule, people of all identities are equal and included, and conflict is solved by nonviolent means of reconciliation.
If we want a beloved community, we must stand for justice, have recognition for difference without attaching privilege to difference.
— bell hooks
Beloved community is formed not by the eradication of difference but by its affirmation, by each of us claiming the identities and cultural legacies that shape who we are and how we live in the world.
— bell hooks
We cannot sit around and talk about the beloved community.
— Cleveland Sellers
We are living in an historic moment. We are each called to take part in a great transformation. Our survival as a species is threatened by global warming, economic meltdown, and an ever-increasing gap between rich and poor. Yet these threats offer an opportunity to awaken as an interconnected and beloved community.
— Desmond Tutu
You are a light. You are the light. Never let anyone — any person or any force — dampen, dim or diminish your light. Study the path of others to make your way easier and more abundant. Lean toward the whispers of your own heart, discover the universal truth, and follow its dictates. […] Release the need to hate, to harbor division, and the enticement of revenge. Release all bitterness. Hold only love, only peace in your heart, knowing that the battle of good to overcome evil is already won. Choose confrontation wisely, but when it is your time don’t be afraid to stand up, speak up, and speak out against injustice. And if you follow your truth down the road to peace and the affirmation of love, if you shine like a beacon for all to see, then the poetry of all the great dreamers and philosophers is yours to manifest in a nation, a world community, and a Beloved Community that is finally at peace with itself.
— John Lewis
We have come a long way in America because of Martin Luther King, Jr. He led a disciplined, nonviolent revolution under the rule of law, a revolution of values, a revolution of ideas. We’ve come a long way, but we still have a distance to go before all of our citizens embrace the idea of a truly interracial democracy, what I like to call the Beloved Community, a nation at peace with itself.
— John Lewis
Democracy is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to help build what we called the Beloved Community, a nation and world society at peace with itself.
— John Lewis
Our goal is to create a beloved community. and this will require a qualitative change in our souls as well as a quantitative change in our lives.
— Martin Luther King Jr.
Love is creative and redemptive. Love builds up and unites; hate tears down and destroys. The aftermath of the ‘fight with fire’ method … is bitterness and chaos, the aftermath of the love method is reconciliation and creation of the beloved community…. Yes , love — which means understanding, creative, redemptive goodwill, even for one’s enemies — is the solution.
— Martin Luther King Jr.
Resistance and nonviolence are not in themselves good. There is another element that must be present in our struggle that then makes our resistance and nonviolence truly meaningful. That element is reconciliation. Our ultimate end must be the creation of the beloved community.
— Martin Luther King Jr.
The way of acquiescence leads to moral and spiritual suicide. The way of violence leads to bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers. But, the way of nonviolence leads to redemption and the creation of the beloved community.
— Martin Luther King Jr.
The end of violence or the aftermath of violence is bitterness. The aftermath of nonviolence is reconciliation and the creation of a beloved community. A boycott is never an end within itself. It is merely a means to awaken a sense of shame within the oppressor but the end is reconciliation, the end is redemption.
— Martin Luther King Jr.
There is an elementary aspiration which undergirds the humane impulse in our history and our culture and binds us together as political activists. This is a simple, irreducible, indisputable aspiration. It is the ‘dream of justice’ for a beloved community, in which the level of terror in people’s lives is sharply reduced or maybe eliminated. It is the belief that extremes and excesses of inequality must be reduced so that each person is free to fully develop his or her full potential. This is why we take precious time out of our lives and give it to politics.
— Paul Wellstone
The larger your beloved community, the more you can accomplish in the world.
— Thich Nhat Hanh

What is Beloved Community? | Becoming Beloved Community
About Becoming Beloved Community
What is Beloved Community?
By
Jane Gerdsen
-
August 14, 2018
The first commandment is, “…you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’  The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
Becoming Beloved Community invites us to grow together as people who love God and love the image of God that we find in our neighbors, in ourselves, and in creation.
Presiding Bishop Michael Curry has lifted up the Jesus Movement and the Way of Love as a path forward for the Episcopal Church. We are challenged to “become instruments of the healing and reconciling love of Jesus, who loving, life-giving, and liberating way we follow.”
The Diocese of Southern Ohio has adopted the Becoming Beloved Community four-fold path and is seeking to live into this call over the next year and beyond.
The  Episcopal Church’s Becoming Beloved Community vision frames a path for Episcopalians to address racial injustice and grow as a community of reconcilers, justice-makers, and healers who share a passion for the dream of God. The Church sees this path in four  areas: Telling the Truth, Proclaiming the Dream, Repairing the Breach, and Practicing the Way of Love.
We invite you to join us in becoming Beloved Community and living into the dream of God.

Becoming A Beloved Community – Beloved Community Initiative in Pittsburgh
Home>Blog>The Vision>Becoming A Beloved Community
Becoming A Beloved Community
December 13, 2021 Pam Berry
As noted on The Episcopal Church website;
Becoming Beloved Community
As the Episcopal branch of the Jesus Movement, we dream and work to foster Beloved Communities where all people may experience dignity and abundant life and see themselves and others as beloved children of God. The Becoming Beloved Community Vision Document and accompanying resources help us to understand and take up the long-term commitments necessary to form loving, liberating and life-giving relationships with each other. Together, we are growing as reconcilers, justice-makers, and healers in the name of Christ.
The Vision
O God, you made us in your own image and redeemed us through Jesus your Son: Look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony
around your heavenly throne; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
– Prayer for the Human Family (Book of Common Prayer, p. 815)
Q: What is the mission of the Church?
A: The mission of the Church is to restore all people to unity with God and each other in Christ.
Q: How does the Church pursue its mission?
A: The Church pursues its mission as it prays and worships, proclaims the Gospel,
and promotes justice, peace, and love.
Q: Through whom does the Church carry out its mission?
A: The Church carries out its mission through the ministry of all its members.
– An Outline of the Faith (Book of Common Prayer, p. 855)

Introduction
“Last summer, the 78th General Convention of our Church did a remarkable thing: the General Convention invited us as a church to take up this Jesus Movement. We made a commitment to live into being the Jesus Movement by committing to evangelism and the work of reconciliation – beginning with racial reconciliation … across the borders and boundaries that divide the human family of God. This is difficult work. But we can do it. It’s about listening and sharing. It’s about God.”
Presiding Bishop Michael B. Curry
Sermon Preached on November 1, 2015
Installation of the 27th Presiding Bishop of The Episcopal Church
The Apostle Paul reminded the people of first-century Corinth: “All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation” (2 Corinthians 5:18). If we have ever needed a community of Jesus followers to take up the ministry of reconciliation and healing across the racial borders that mark the human family of God, we need it now.
Widespread hostility to immigrants from Latin America has led to the deportation of millions and ripped families apart. Structural poverty in indigenous communities has led to alarming youth suicides. Throughout Latin America, indigenous and Afro-Latino peoples still suffer after centuries of systematic devaluation. Videos regularly detail the detention and killing of unarmed black men, women, and children by the state. Across the United States and into Europe, people from the Middle East are profiled as terrorists and enemies of “Western” values. And human trafficking enslaves the most vulnerable in Asia, the Americas, and Europe.
Given these realities and given the call of the gospel of Jesus Christ, many Episcopal dioceses, seminaries, and networks have discerned a fresh commitment to racial justice, reconciliation, and healing. Perhaps because of this church-wide stirring, the 78th General Convention of The Episcopal Church urged the whole church to take a major stride forward by passing Resolution C019 (Establish Response to Systemic Injustice) and allocating $2 million to fund this ministry. C019 charged the leaders of the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies to “lead, direct, and be present to assure and account for the Church’s work of racial justice and reconciliation.”
In February 2016, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, House of
Deputies President Gay Clark Jennings, House of Bishops Vice
President Mary Gray-Reeves and (now former Vice President)
Dean Wolfe, and House of Deputies Vice President Byron
Rushing and Secretary Michael Barlowe met in Austin, Texas, to
follow through on that charge. On March 12, 2016, they shared
their initial direction and priorities with the House of Bishops, the
House of Deputies, and the wider church, and updates have come
before Executive Council throughout the process. After a year of
listening, learning, and discerning – in close partnership with the Presiding Bishop’s staff and in conversation with Executive Council, individuals, and networks across and beyond The Episcopal Church – the Church’s Officers approved a comprehensive strategic vision on February 14, 2017, including a program budget detailing the $2 million allocation. That vision – titled “Becoming Beloved Community: The Episcopal Church’s Long-term Commitment to Racial Healing, Reconciliation, and Justice” – is outlined in the coming pages and to be shared with the church in May 2017.
The end is reconciliation; the end is redemption; the end is the creation of the Beloved Community. It is this type of spirit and this type of love that can transform opponents into friends. … It is this love which will bring about miracles in the hearts of men.
– The Rev. Dr. Martin L. King, Jr.

Along the way, we have learned from and been gifted by many brothers and sisters deeply committed to this work. Here is a partial and growing list:
–  The General Convention Legislative Committees on Social Justice and U.S. Policy and Ms. Diane Pollard
–  Executive Council Standing Committee on Advocacy and Networking for Mission and Dr. Anita George
–  The Beloved Community: Commission on Dismantling Racism in the Diocese of Atlanta and Dr.
Catherine Meeks and Bishop Robert Wright
–  The Committees on Antiracism and Reparations in the Diocese of New York and Ms. Cynthia Copeland
and Brother Reginald Martin
–  VISIONS, Inc., founder Dr. Valerie Batts, and consultant the Rev. Dr. Bill Kondrath
–  The Kaleidoscope Institute and the Rev. Dr. Eric Law
–  The Executive Council Committee on Antiracism
–  Latin American bishops in the Episcopal Church’s Ninth Province
–  The network of Episcopal provincial coordinators and officers
–  Leaders in the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and their allies
–  Leaders of the House of Bishops’ engagement around racial justice and transformation, including
Bishops Mark Beckwith, Ian Douglas, Brian Prior, Prince Singh, and Wendell Gibbs
–  Washington National Cathedral and the Rev. Dr. Canon Kelly Brown Douglas and Ms. Michelle Dibblee
–  The Anne and Chris Flowers Foundation and the J.C. Flowers Foundation and Ms. Susan Lassen
–  The Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music Subcommittee on Racial Justice and Mr. Chris Decatur
–  Trinity Episcopal Church-Wall Street and the Rev. Winnie Varghese
–  Bert Smith of the Prison Entrepreneurship Program
–  The Criminal Justice Roundtable in the Diocese of New York
–  The Organization for Procedural Justice in the Diocese of Southern Ohio and Dr. Merelyn Bates-Mims
–  Leaders in the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, including Ms. Amanda Ziebell-Finley, Ms. Rachel Babbit,
and Mr. Steve Mullaney
–  Ms. Annette Buchanan and the Union of Black Episcopalians
–  The Rev. Dr. Michael Battle and the Tutu Center for Reconciliation at General Theological Seminary
–  The Rev. Dr. Phil Groves
–  The Rev. Hershey Mallette Stephens
–  Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Mpho Tutu
We also give thanks for the tireless staff who have supported and concretized our work: the Rev. Canon Stephanie Spellers, Ms. Heidi Kim, the Rev. Charles “Chuck” Wynder, and Ms. Tara Holley, along with the Rev. Canon Mark Stevenson, the Rev. Glenda McQueen, Mr. Kirk Hadaway, and Ms. Bronwyn Skov.
Each of these partners has reinforced what we have learned in our own spiritual journeys: that this work is less about walking a linear path and more about engaging in a reflective, deliberate spiritual practice. Like walking the labyrinth, we engage and reengage the commitments that lead toward reconciliation, healing, and justice: Telling the Truth, Proclaiming the Dream, Practicing the Way of Love, and Repairing the Breach. We never have the sense that we have mastered or completed any one stage, nor are we naïve enough to imagine anyone ever truly “finishes” the work. The commitment is long-term; the formation is lifelong.
[T]his slow, arduous work is good news because we no longer have to think of reconciliation as a term paper that we have to write ourselves and turn in on time. Think of it as an oak tree growing from a small seedling into a large tree, a process that takes many years and happens only when water, sun, and nutrients are provided. … [U]ltimately, the final work is God’s, and it will be enacted if we cooperate in the process.
– The Rev. Dr. Michael Battle
Practicing Reconciliation in a Violent World

Why Beloved Community?
Jesus laid out the fundamentals for any who would follow him when he said,
The Beloved Community is the body within which we promote the fruits of the spirit and grow to recognize our kinship as people who love God
and love the image of God that we find in our neighbors, in ourselves, and in creation. It provides a positive, theologically and biblically based ideal toward which we can grow in love, rather than framing our justice and reconciliation efforts as fundamentally “against” (as in antiracism, anti-oppression, etc.).
Clarence Skinner describes the vision this way: “Beloved Community is not an organization of individuals; it is a new adventure of consecrated men and women seeking a new world … who forget themselves in their passion to find the common life where the good of all is the quest of each.” Quoting Karl Barth, Charles Marsh writes of the Beloved Community, “[T]he Christian regards the peaceable reign of God as the hidden meaning of all movements for liberation and reconciliation that ‘brings us together for these days as strangers and yet as friends.’”
In other words, Beloved Community is the practical image of the world we pray for when we say, “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” We dream of communities where all people may experience dignity and abundant life, and see themselves and others as beloved children of God. We pray for communities that labor so that the flourishing of every person (and all creation) is seen as the hope of each. Conceived this way, Beloved Community provides a deeply faithful paradigm for transformation, formation, organizing, advocacy, and witness.
Our Long-term Commitment
Becoming Beloved Community represents not so much a set of programs as a journey, a set of interrelated commitments around which we as Episcopalians may organize our many efforts to respond to racial injustice and grow a community of reconcilers, justice-makers, and healers. As you continue to read about this strategic vision, we encourage you to imagine a labyrinth. 1 On the road toward reconciliation and healing, we move around corners and double back into quadrants we have indeed visited before, each time discovering a fresh revelation or challenge …
of all is, ‘Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ The second is this,
‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself’” (Mark 12:29-31).
Telling the Truth
Who are we? What things have we done and left undone regarding racial justice and healing?
Repairing the Breach
What institutions and systems are broken? How will we participate in repair, restoration, and healing of people, institutions, and systems?
Proclaiming the Dream
How can we publicly acknowledge things done and left undone? What does Beloved Community look like in this place? What behaviors and commitments will foster reconciliation, justice, and healing?
Practicing the Way of Love
How will we grow as reconcilers, healers, and justice-bearers? How will we actively grow relationship across dividing walls and seek Christ in the other?
1 We borrow the labyrinth image gratefully from Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Mpho Tutu’s work in The Book of Forgiving, although we have surrounded this labyrinth with The Episcopal Church’s long-term commitments.

“The first [commandment]
There is no single path for every person or even every Episcopalian. People will draw on different resources and experiences and come to diverse answers to similar questions. At the same time, we hope you find it energizing to take up a common spiritual practice of walking and reflection. As the Kenyan proverb states, we will walk further together than we could apart. Transformation may run deeper and broader if/when we pool our wisdom and resources as the Episcopal branch of the Jesus Movement.
For this reason, we have also identified concrete, church-wide initiatives that we hope will 1) root our commitment in the Baptismal Covenant, 2) make real the general practices and questions that encircle the labyrinth, and 3) complement and advance related work already emerging in dioceses, networks, provinces, and congregations.
•Baptismal Promise: We will strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being.
•Core Questions: What institutions and systems are broken? How will we participate in the repair, restoration and healing of people, institutions and systems?
• Church-wide Initiatives: •Criminal Justice
Reform • Re-Entry
Collaboratives with Formerly Incarcerated People Returning to Community
•Partnership with Episcopal Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
•Immigration and Refugee Reform and Advocacy (as of 8/2017)
•Baptismal Promise: We will proclaim by word and example the Good News of God in Christ.
•Core Questions: How can we publicly acknowledge things done and left undone? What does Beloved Community look like? What behaviors and commitments foster healing, reconciliation and justice?
• Church-wide Initiatives: •Regional, Public
Sacred Listening and Learning Engagements
•Baptismal Promise: We will seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving our neighbors as ourselves.
•Core Questions: How will we grow as reconcilers, healers and justice-bearers? How will we actively grow relationship across dividing walls and seek Christ in the other?
• Church-wide Initiatives: •Beloved Community
Story-sharing
Campaign •Reconciliation and
Justice Pilgrimages • Multi-lingual
Formation and
T raining
•Liturgical Resources
for Healing, Reconciliation and Justice
•Baptismal Promise: We will persevere in resisting evil, and whenever you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord.
•Core Questions: Who are we? What have we done and left undone, regarding racial justice and healing?
• Church-wide Initiatives: •Census of the
Church
•Racial Justice Audit of
Episcopal Structures and Systems
The commitment outlined here is intentionally focused on church-wide efforts that support and complement local, diocesan, provincial, and network efforts. It seeks to nourish multiple venues for engaging in the work of justice, healing, and reconciliation, understanding the complexity and specific structural and historical challenges facing a multinational and multilingual church like ours.
Some of the initiatives above are already part of the Church’s life and will only grow. New initiatives will launch between now and December 2018, in an iterative, flexible process that responds to realities on

the ground and the wisdom of partners who share the work. Timelines notwithstanding, the Officers recognize that structural racism is centuries old, which means our commitment must last for generations, not triennia. We will always be committed to tell the truth, proclaim the dream, practice the way of love, and repair the breach. The only question is how.
In presenting this long-term commitment, we Officers are dedicated to growing circles of engagement, partnership, and prayer across and beyond the Church, understanding that we are participating in a multistage journey toward transformation, justice, and healing.
While General Convention tasked us with providing
leadership and casting a vision, it never said that vision would be the only one, nor did it say all the work of racial reconciliation, justice, and healing should be organized at the church-wide level. We have sought to fulfill our charge as leaders of the Episcopal branch of the Jesus Movement, drawing Episcopalians and neighbors across many lands, languages, and cultures to share stories, practices, and transformative action. Together, we can share the journey and become instruments of the healing and reconciling love of Jesus, whose loving, liberating, and life-giving way we follow.
Back to Our Roots: The Baptismal Covenant
Finally, we have said all along that the goal is not simply to present a unified strategy to be applied similarly in all places. Ours is a commitment, an intentional spiritual practice we take up as individuals and as a body who have been baptized into the life, death and ongoing ministry of Jesus. It seemed fitting that, near the conclusion of our work, members of our team looked back and realized that each element of the journey is itself a response to one of the five queries at the conclusion of the Baptismal Covenant.
  The desire to form Beloved Community flows from the first of the five promises: Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship,
in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
  Telling the truth about our Church’s historic and present story around race – who we are and what we’ve done – is part of how we fulfill the second promise:
Will you persevere in resisting evil, and whenever you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord?
  Naming the dream of God in a particular place, casting a compelling vision of Beloved Community, and committing to the work necessary to live into it are directly linked to the third promise:
Will you proclaim by word and example the Good News of God in Christ?
  As we practice the way of love, listening for the voice of God in the voice of the other and honoring the presence of Christ in all those we meet, we take up the fourth promise:
Will you seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving your neighbor as yourself?
We have been given the power to invoke goodness and light, darkness and sorrow. We are endowed by the Creator with power to live our lives for the well-being of all. Heaven and hell are about living (or not) in right relationship with all of creation, of honoring or dishonoring all, and knowing the love of God by sharing it with all of our relatives: human, plants, trees, four-legged, winged, water, and earth all woven together.
– The Rt. Rev. Dr. Carol Gallagher

 And as we expand the circle of God’s love and take responsibility for repairing the brokenness in our communities, our society, and our world – we also affirm the fifth promise:
Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?
The ministry of reconciliation rests at the heart of God’s mission and belongs to everyone who has been baptized into the body of Christ. We welcome our whole Church to move forward with humility, compassion, and prayer, trusting that God who has reconciled us in Christ will also lead and equip us for this great call.
In the deep love of Christ,

Alright, so from these search results, it seems like the "beloved community" is a concept rooted in the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and other religious and social leaders. It appears to be a vision of a society where love, justice, and reconciliation are central values, and where people from all backgrounds can live together in peace and equality.

So, the question is about the role of youth in creating this beloved community. I think to answer this, I need to understand what unique contributions young people can make towards building such a community.

First, maybe I should think about the characteristics of youth. Young people are often energetic, open-minded, and receptive to new ideas. They're also digital natives, which means they're adept at using technology to connect with others and spread messages. These qualities could be assets in promoting the values of the beloved community.

Moreover, youth are the future leaders of society. By培养他们的价值观和技能，我们可以确保这些理想在未来的世代中得以延续和实现。因此，他们的参与对于创建一个持久的、深植于社会结构中的 beloved community 至关重要。

But I should also consider the challenges that youth might face in this endeavor. They might lack experience and resources compared to older generations. Additionally, they could be influenced by negative societal trends or peer pressure, which might hinder their efforts towards positive change.

Perhaps I need to look for examples or programs where youth have successfully contributed to building a beloved community. Maybe there are case studies or initiatives that demonstrate the impact of youth involvement in social justice and reconciliation efforts.

Let me try another search to find some examples.

Stories of Youth Changing the World – Freechild Institute
Stories of Youth Changing the World
February 24, 2016Freechild Institute
The following stories are about young people who decided there was a need in their community, and then took action to meet that need.  Some projects were one-time, and some are on going.  These stories can inspire, infuriate, and empower youth to change the world, and adults to be partners.
1. Cleanin’ It Up and Changing Our Neighborhoods
Katie, 15, from Kansas City, Missouri, decided that her community’s streets were an eye sore and it was time to do something about it. “Cleaning up the streets is needed in my community because it looks trashy and I thought if we could clean it up, we could make a difference not only in my eyes, but other people’s eyes too.  I would like to see a nice clean community that people care what it looks like.”
2. Takin’ Care of Kids: Teens Helping Kids
Rachel, 13, from Nashville, Tennessee, and her friends are concerned about children who have serious emotional disturbance (SED) so they created a hotline for kids to call, get advice or just talk.  They also created a public service announcement about SED.  “The ‘Kid Counselors’ give information and resources to the callers.  We want to help bring awareness to the issues surrounding mental illness and help kids with SED to be accepted as an important part of our community.”
3. Voices of the Past: Recording the History to Affect the Future
Kristen, 14, from Glenshaw, Pennsylvania, records the thoughts and stories of World War II and Korean War veterans.  “I think it will give the youth of my community a better understanding of what happened during the war.  Hopefully, it will also give us a greater respect to the men and women who sacrificed their time, effort, support and sometimes lives so we can be free today.”
4. WE Own Our Communities: Knowledge is Power
Blair, 15, from Moorestown, New Jersey, has joined forces with community leaders to reclaim a neglected community center and continue to transform it into a library with computers for inner city kids.  “Volunteerism opens a myriad of different culture and races, we have a unique opportunity to look at the work through their eyes and ‘walk in their shoes.’”
5. Taking Care of Ourselves: Bringing Youth Towards Economic Independence
Shawneequa, 17, from Norfolk, Virginia, started Youth Empowerment Virginia.  The project is committed to assisting youth in reaching their academic, social and economic potential.  The program fosters independence and responsibility, empowering more youth with their own desires to become active, constructive caring members of the community through better leadership skills, social skills and educational services.
6. Project Unity: Getting Students Voice Heard Through Technology
Project Unity was founded in November of 1999 by a group of students from schools across Washington County, Pennsylvania. Project Unity’s goals are to allow students to discuss school, community, or family problems with each other and to find a solution that will benefit all involved. Using today’s technology, they wish to unite a county and the people within that county to save time, money, and lives. This group feels that they can make a difference by relying on the principles of honesty, hard work, leadership, and perseverance. These students are the leaders of tomorrow, and they’re starting today.

10 Things Youth Frontiers has taught me about community
The Character Movement
September 6, 2018 In Community, Youth Frontiers
10 Things Youth Frontiers Has Taught Me about Community
Fall, for me, has always signaled change. When I was a kid, fall meant a new school year, which led to all sorts of other new’s: new school, new classes, new friends, new perspective — new. As an adult, I know life isn’t always contained within such concrete cycles. Even so, fall, upon its invigorating winds, still always manages to bring change.
This autumn at Youth Frontiers is no exception. As an organization, we’ve moved into our new headquarters, we’re innovating new programming, we’re welcoming new staff, while saying goodbye to some old friends — and all of that change has put my work life into perspective. For me, it has reinforced the importance of a positive, resilient community.
At Youth Frontiers, it’s our mission to inspire character and build community. I can honestly and gratefully say that YF has also internalized that mission. Here are 10 things I’ve learned about community from Youth Frontiers:
1. Say “hello” to people well.
When I interviewed at YF two years ago, the first thing I noticed waiting in the “lobby” (read two low wicker chairs stationed in nearly full view of the whole office) was the warm laughter filling the space. It was a Friday, and while that normally improves the typical nine-to-fiver’s disposition, I could tell the office’s levity stretched beyond the magic of the impending weekend. The snippets of conversation I overheard suggested a deep caring for one another and a positive — and sometimes sassy — rapport. That, almost more than anything I learned during my actual interview, made me want to work there. If the people cared about each other that much, I could only imagine the good their mission accomplished.
2. Identify, develop and lean into your strengths.
Once I was hired, my orientation involved not only becoming more familiar with the organization, but also with myself. YF walks all of its new employees through the StrengthsFinder training. From the start, YF signaled that it wanted to invest in and develop its employees — to make them great at what they already do well. This training also bolsters community. It helped me to further understand in what areas I can most readily support my team, and where I need their help.
3. Do yourself a service by serving others.
Community is made stronger when we look outside of ourselves — and our specific mission — to support the good work others do. YF dedicates a day each year to service. We, as a staff, partner with other organizations to serve our broader community. Most recently, we partnered with The Food Group.
4. Eat lunch with others.
Remember the StrengthsFinder training I mentioned earlier? Well, one of my top five strengths is “achiever.” This strength, the constant urge to accomplish, admittedly makes taking a proper lunch break sometimes hard to do. But, I’ve been reminded many times, just how rewarding having lunch with your coworkers can be. In these brief moments of pause in the middle of busy days, I am reminded of life beyond the office and of the lovely humans I have the pleasure to work (and relax) with.
5. Honor one another for even the little things.
Props Out Card
We make it our goal to see and celebrate the behind-the-scenes efforts of our coworkers. Whenever we’ve spotted something we’d like to spotlight, whether to a large group or just the individual, we write a “Props Out,” a small card acknowledging the deed and the way it supports our organization’s core values: Quality, Caring and Growth. At the end of the year, we celebrate the little things in a big way, with our “Little Big Star” award and with our “Bettermaker Cup.” This year, the first went to a staff member who gave away his homemade BBQ sauce and spicy mustard in exchange for donations to support hurricane relief. The latter, was awarded to the staff member who led our brand evolution and who has helped YF to look (and be) its best for the last six years.
6. Just dance.
At YF, we take our work, but not ourselves too seriously. We break for walks around the block, coffee runs, fitness challenges, story swapping and the occasional office dance party. Yes, we get our goof thing on. These small moments of fun and vulnerability are foundational to the strong camaraderie we build at work.
7. Lead with authenticity, integrity and transparency.
In our old office, we had an open door policy — quite literally in our open space. I’m happy to report that even though we have more office doors now, that policy has not changed in our new space. Our leadership team makes a concerted effort to lead with their humanity and to help us understand their decisions and the direction of the organization. Each year, every employee takes Quantum Workplace’s “Best Places to Work” Survey, to take the pulse of our internal culture. We want to know what we do well and what we need to do better. The leadership team shares with our staff these results as well as the strategies they put in place to move us forward as an organization. In fact, we display these prominently in our office to remind us of, and to show our visitors, the importance of our growth mindset.
8. Take time to retreat.
The concept of our retreats is not just for kids. Each year in late fall, we gather as a staff outside of the office for a day to reflect and connect with one another. These days are usually centered on a theme, like on retreat, and give us a chance to set our intention as we head into the busy holiday season.
9. On Fridays we wear flannel.
Or floral print, in the warmer months. Little things — dressing up as a staff, attending staff-led “Lunch and Learns” (topical discussions on a range of subjects over a shared meal), grilled cheese days, impromptu paper challenges, indoor office four-square — unite us and inspire as a team by helping us to tap into our creativity and our inner desire to balance out the “all work, no play” tendencies of our American culture into YF’s “work hard, play hard” culture.
10. Say “goodbye” to people well.
To end, I want to take a moment to tell you about how we say goodbye to those who leave YF. We believe that it’s just as important to say “goodbye” well as it is to say “hello” well. When a staff member pursues another opportunity, we take time to honor them — with Props Out, with food, with reflection on all the good they’ve done for YF and for our staff. We honor them because though they are no longer employed by YF, we want them to remain a part of our community — because they matter and they matter to us. Because that’s the YF way.
Now that I’ve bragged about my community, I’d love to hear about yours. Tell us about it on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
Written by Sarah Gavigan
This year, on The Character Movement, we are trying something — indeed — new. We’ll be delving into one of our retreat values each month, examining it on our blog and in our Character Challenges. This month’s theme is community.

10 Creative Community Service Projects for Your Youth Group
10 Creative Community Service Projects for Your Youth Group
Lori Hatcher Crosswalk.com Contributing Writer
2018 7 Nov
When my youth minister husband sat down to design a summer mission week for the teens in our church, he knew one thing – it wouldn’t be the typical youth group experience. Instead of going away (there’s nothing wrong with going away), we’d stay local – in the community we were trying to reach. Instead of being heavy on fun (there’s nothing wrong with fun), he wanted the kids to experience the joy of serving others. Instead of tacking on token Bible lessons like commercials during the Super Bowl (there is something wrong with that), he wanted scriptural principles to be the main event.
He called our week-long, stay-in-town mission trip Destination J.O.Y., which stands for Jesus, Others, and You. Built on the pillars that characterized his ministry: biblical teaching, service, outreach, and wholesome fellowship, Destination J.O.Y. was the highlight of the year. Best of all, it became one of the most life-changing events of our students’ lives.
The Jesus component is obvious – relevant, meaty, age-appropriate messages the students could understand and apply. The You component included fun activities like a day at an amusement park, a water park, and a putt-putt/arcade. The Others component involved carefully-chosen service projects to push our students out of their comfort zones and into our community where they could love and serve others.
We organized several Destination J.O.Y. mission weeks during my husband’s years as a youth minister. Here are 10 of our favorite creative community service projects:

1. Sponsor a Peanut Butter and Pizza Night for the homeless.
Every Wednesday night our students enjoyed hot, fresh pizza at youth group. At the same time, members of several local churches were feeding the homeless a potluck meal in a city park. To raise our teens’ awareness and teach them what it feels like to sacrifice for others, we brainstormed Peanut Butter and Pizza Night.
We knew if we asked the students to contribute money or food toward the feeding, it would likely come from their parents, not them. So we took a different approach. On the night of the feeding, we ordered pizza as usual and stacked it on the table in the youth room.
When the time came to eat, however, we announced that we’d be eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and giving the pizza to the homeless. The students eagerly added their pizza to the potluck meal in the park and grinned to see how excited some were to discover pizza on the menu. We knew the lesson had hit home when the students voted to make Peanut Butter and Pizza Night for the Homeless a monthly event.

2. Manicures for the homeless.
During our visit to the park, the students saw a volunteer giving haircuts to some of the homeless men. “Did you notice what a difference a simple haircut made?” one student asked. “That man was kinda slouchy and wouldn’t make eye contact, but after his haircut, he stood up straight and looked people in the eye.”
Mostly men attended the feeding in the park, but there was also a small group of women. “Why don’t we give them manicures?” one teen proposed. “It would show them we care. And make them feel special – and pretty.” So that’s what we did.
We washed their hands with scented soap, massaged them with shea butter lotion, then filed their nails. Two coats of the polish of their choice completed their pampering session. As the women moved from one station to the next, we made small talk. Most were hesitant to say much at first, but by the time they’d made it the length of the table, they were laughing and smiling. So were our students. “That’s the funnest thing I’ve ever done!” one teen said with a grin.

3. Volunteer at a local school.
Every neighborhood has a public school, and ours had two within walking distance of our church. One summer we contacted the principal of one of the schools to ask if we could help in some way. He jumped at the offer. We did everything from clean classrooms, help teachers move their supplies from one room to another, scrub cafeteria tables, and haul away bags of trash. Our kids worked hard, beginning a partnership with the school that continues to this day.

4. Fill baby bottles for a crisis pregnancy center.
Our local crisis pregnancy center distributed plastic baby bottles for a fundraising campaign. We sent each student home with a bottle and challenged them to fill it up with change and bring it back the next week. We encouraged them to tell others about the ministry and invite them to contribute. This way they not only raised money for the center, but helped spread the word about the ministry.

5. Hold a free car wash for church members.
Youth groups often use a car wash to raise money for a mission trip or project, but how often do they hold one simply to bless the members of their church or community? This is what we did one Wednesday night as people arrived for midweek service.
When a church member drove into the parking lot, we directed them to one of three carwash stations. In less than five minutes, their cars were sparkling clean and their faces were smiling. “It’s our way of saying thanks for all you do for us as a youth ministry,” we told each person who came through our line. The hardest part of this service project was convincing people NOT to give us money.

6. Hold a workday at a disabled person's home.
Because many of our teens didn’t know anyone with a disability, we wanted to give them a chance to interact with and serve them in some way. We asked Linda and John, a couple in our church who were confined to wheelchairs, if they’d be willing to help us. They loved the idea of a workday to assist them with tasks around the house.
Linda provided a list of chores our teens could easily do with supervision, things like bathe and brush their service dogs, change light bulbs, put up Christmas decorations, and do yard work. As the teens worked with the couple, their awkwardness changed to curiosity, and then to amazement. They learned that disabled people are no different than anyone else – resourceful, intelligent, creative, and fun. They gained an appreciation for the challenges disabled people face, learned how to offer help without offending, and experienced the satisfaction of investing their time and energy to make someone else’s life a little easier.

7. Buy a goat.
Or a cow, or chicks. Every year Samaritan’s Purse publishes a Gift Catalog filled with ways to help struggling people in war-torn or disaster-affected areas at Christmastime. Six dollars provides a child with a warm blanket. Seven dollars buys hot meals for a week. Ten will give an orphan child a cuddly musical lamb that plays “Jesus Loves Me.”
Our students wanted to raise money for a gift that would help a family for the long term. Fourteen dollars will buy live chicks to raise for food and income, but they set their eyes on a bigger purchase – a milk goat. They learned that milk from a goat or cow is an excellent source of calcium, vitamins, and protein for growing children. Just one nanny goat can produce over two gallons of nutritious milk each week. Any leftover milk and cheese can be sold at a local market to supplement the family income.
We challenged them not to ask their parents for money, but to look for ways to earn the money. Within three weeks, by doing odd jobs, saving their spending money, and babysitting, the students had raised the $70 they needed. “This is the best Christmas present I’ve ever bought,” one student said happily.

8. Partner with the elderly to teach technology.
Some senior citizens are tech savvy, but many aren’t. They struggle with the features on their iPhone, have difficulty navigating the internet, and would love to connect with friends and family on social media but don’t know how to set up accounts.
Teens, however, are technology geniuses. Why not sponsor a Senior Technology Day to pair the two? Announce the event several weeks in advance at your church or partner with a local senior center to offer one-on-one tutorials on Facebook, Instagram, smartphone, and computer basics. Working together helps promote mutual understanding, imparts valuable skills, and builds intergenerational relationships and self-esteem.

9. Adopt a fire station.
Every community has a fire station filled with men and women who risk their lives every day on our behalf. Adopting a fire station is a simple way to raise awareness and build friendships with local firefighters. Once a month or once a quarter, we’d gather our teens together to prepare and deliver a meal to the station. (Sub sandwiches, lasagna, and spaghetti are easy dishes.)
Many stations will allow the students to eat with the firefighters, and some will even give them a tour. Encourage students to ask the firefighters questions about their work. Most are eager to share stories of the drama and drudgery associated with their profession. Before you leave, ask if you can pray over the station and the firefighters and thank them for their service. Remind the students to pray for police and firefighters every time they hear a siren.

10. Hold a thank you dessert and show.
Sadly, many church members view their youth ministry as a part of the church that costs money, makes messes, and gives little back. We wanted to change this perception, so we planned a free church-wide event we called Dessert and a Show.
The teens decorated our fellowship hall to look like a classy dinner theatre and teamed up to provide an evening of entertainment. Their parents provided homemade or store-bought desserts and beverages that the youth (dressed neatly in black shirts and pants) served to their “patrons.” Other students performed comedy skits, musical pieces, and entertaining monologues. “We wanted to express our appreciation to you, our church family, for supporting our youth ministry and helping us grow in faith ,” my husband said as he welcomed everyone to the event. The teens loved putting on the evening and giving back to our church family. Church members talked about it for months afterward.
Sadly, today’s youth have a reputation for being lazy and self-centered – and sometimes they are. By channeling their time, energy, and thoughts toward others, however, we can help them become more aware of those around them. Through creative community service, we can encourage them to make a positive impact on the world. As they serve others, their self-confidence, self-esteem, and self-worth rises. Best of all, they get to be the hands and feet of Jesus to the people around them.

4 Examples of Great Community Service Projects for Students - Yuda Bands
4 Examples of Great Community Service Projects for Students
By Miguel Campaner / April 23, 2017
Whether it’s redesigning a children’s playground, knitting scarves for the homeless or cleaning up a park, community service projects are a fruitful way to bring about positive change.
Why community service counts
Many schools have made it their mission to include community service projects in their curriculum. Here are a few reasons why we believe student volunteers is beneficial.
Teaches students about social responsibility
Helps them develop leadership skills
Aids in self-discovery
Brings people together
Serves as a learning experience
Exposes students to multiculturalism and diversity
Improves the community
Helps students during their university application
Gives a spark of hope and joy to those in need
Examples of community service projects
If your group is currently thinking of creative ways to give back to the community, then you’ve come to the right place.
Below are great examples of community service projects.
1. Work in an animal shelter
One of the many ideas for community service projects is volunteering at your local animal shelter. It’s one place that will always need a helping hand, whether it’s to clean cages, walk the dogs or decorate the waiting room for the holidays. Some even need supplies to care for their furry companions while they await adoption.
Get in touch with your local animal shelter to find out what they need. From here, assemble your team and start a schedule that works for everyone.
2. Conduct a seminar for fellow students
An excellent way to be of service to your community is by sharing your talent. Whether it’s in the area of finance, business, arts or music, it’s one of the most rewarding experiences to know that people are learning from you.
Organize a seminar for younger students that will tackle a single skill and how to develop them. You can ask your school if you can use a room or even your school court to gather everybody around. It will also help if you have a thought leader in the industry that will come in a special guest speaker.
3. Spend time with the elderly
Far too many elderly have spent years alone and waiting in retirement homes. Many of them do not have visitors, which is why depression among retired senior citizens is tragically familiar.
As part of your community service, organize a day program for them where you can bring them food, share with them an entertaining performance or even bring them letters of appreciation to read. Just a stroll down a park can make all the difference.
4. Volunteer at a soup kitchen
Like many shelters, plenty of soup kitchens is always on the lookout for volunteers. There are too many homeless and hungry people who are in a constant state of despair, and a small gesture of reaching out with a plate of warm food can spark hope in them.
Get in touch with your local community to see how you can join and help. If everything is filled up, you can always organize your soup kitchen with your fellow volunteers.

Okay, so from these search results, I can see various examples of youth engaging in community service and social action projects. These projects cover a wide range of areas such as healthcare, environment, community building, and addressing social inequalities.

Looking back at the concept of the beloved community, it seems that youth can play a significant role in creating such a community by participating in these types of projects. Their energy, creativity, and openness to new ideas can drive positive changes and foster a sense of unity and purpose within their communities.

Moreover, involving youth in community service can help instill values of empathy, responsibility, and citizenship from a young age. It can also provide them with valuable skills and experiences that can benefit them in their personal and professional lives.

However, it's essential to ensure that youth are engaged meaningfully and that their contributions are valued and recognized. Simply assigning them tasks without proper guidance or support may not lead to the desired outcomes and could even discourage them from continuing their involvement.

Therefore, perhaps the role of youth in creating a beloved community involves not only their active participation in service projects but also their voices being heard and their ideas being considered in decision-making processes. This way, they can contribute not just as helpers but as partners in shaping the future of their communities.

Maybe I should look for more information on how youth can be empowered to take leadership roles in community initiatives.

Abstract
This issue brief addresses the benefits and challenges of sponsoring a youth-led research project in a school where students and their friends, families, and teachers confront daily the demand-ing challenges posed by poverty and its attendant ills. It finds that a youth-empowerment framework has particular value in this context, but poses unique challenges to program design.

... The Asking for Change Photovoice intervention aimed to bring together a group of homeless youth and adult facilitators in a structured project that served to (1) build relationships and connection, (2) teach social, emotional, leadership, and photography skills, and (3) empower youth to be social change agents. The intervention was guided by a positive youth development and youth empowerment framework, whereby adults provided structure and resources to the group, and youth shared decision-making power in most steps of the project (Anyon & Naughton, 2003; Ozer & Douglas, 2015). The structure of the intervention was articulated in a manual developed by the PIs to provide facilitators with clearly stated objectives and activities for each session, yet facilitators were empowered to use the manually flexibly, incorporating youth voice in decision-making to be responsive to individual groups' needs and interests, while still meeting key objectives.  ...

... Lessons include topics such as team building and communication, understanding the root causes of social problems, research methods, data analysis, developing recommendations, and social action approaches. Studies of YELL in other communities indicate that the program promotes participatory behaviors, sociopolitical awareness, critical thinking, problem-solving behaviors, and public speaking skills (Anyon & Naughton, 2003; Conner & Strobel, 2007;Harden et al., 2015;Kirshner, 2008;.  ...

Guided by a social justice youth development framework, we propose that these results may reflect the unique opportunities afforded to youth in YPAR projects.  ...

... Photovoice, instead, shifts the focus to youth as leaders, cocreators, and helpers. This movement to a youth-voice-orientation challenges the dominant narrative of adults as providers and youth as consumers of knowledge and services (Anyon & Naughton, 2003). Rather, this approach, which has been successful in engaging other youth populations (Anyon & Naughton, 2003), requires the shifting and sharing of power from adults to youth, as youth are thereby highly involved in setting goals, making key decisions, and problem-solving throughout the project (Wong, Zimmerman, & Parker, 2010).  ...

... Although few YPAR projects have undergone such rigorous evaluation, several other reports and qualitative data suggest that YPAR promotes selfconfidence and critical understanding of the sociopolitical environment, which may help youth researchers see themselves as agents of change in their schools or communities. For instance, a YPAR program with ten high-poverty urban youth in Oakland, CA reportedly gave youth a sense of civic responsibility and a belief in their ability to make changes in their community (Anyon & Naughton, 2003). Evidence of the benefits of YPAR for developmental outcomes is sparse but points to improvements in strategic thinking, health outcomes, relationships with adults, engagement in school, and sense of empowerment, efficacy, and perceived control (see Suleiman, Ballard, Hoyt & Ozer, in press, for a review).  ...

Introduction
In recent years much discourse has shaped the relevance in determining the role of youth leadership in community decision-making. Research has revealed that youth program activities, albeit consistently on the rise, engage youth in civic and community activities at rates that have been mediocre at best. In the 1990s the positive youth development movement was set forth by scholars and practitioners (Blythe & Leffert, 1995; Cargo, Grams, Ottoson, Ward, & Green, 2003; Lerner, 1995; Pittman, Irby, & Ferber, 2000) which rallied the importance of all the resources and assets needed for a young person to experience a healthy, productive life. Then in recent years some of these scholars and practitioners noted that in order to maximize their potential young people need more than access to resources with means to build skills, but they must also utilize these skills by serving as active contributors within their communities (Hughes & Curnan, 2000; Lerner, 2004, 2007; Pittman, 2000; Perkins, Borden, & Villarruel, 2001).
There has been a sporadic growth in the interest of youth becoming more involved in the communities in which they live. Although a growing body of literature has promoted youth leadership, there remains limited empirical evidence of how youth benefit from serving as civically-engaged leaders to address community issues. Most of the existing data is a result of qualitative procedures used to explore the youth-adult partnering phenomenon (Camino, 2000; Larson, Walker, & Pearce, 2005). A few studies have found that youth develop leadership skills, social skills, and life skills (Checkoway, et al., 2003; Israel & Ilvento, 1995; Lerner, Dowling, & Anderson, 2003; Perkins & Borden, 2003; Zeldin, McDaniel, Topitzes, & Calvert, 2000) and communities also benefit from the endeavors set forth by such partnerships (Sandefur & Laumann, 1998). However, more studies that take a longitudinal approach to investigating youth leadership development over time are needed.
While youth volunteerism has increased among 12-23 year olds, there is an argument that young people rarely engage with larger civic goals in mind (Case Foundation, 2006). Based on a study by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), 59% of young women ages 15-25 and 57% of young men were not actively engaged in community (civic or political) affairs (Marcelo, Lopez, & Kirby, 2007). With the depth of human and social capital existing among them there must be more efforts in place to profit from the leadership potential among youth which often goes untapped.
As citizens youth have the right to make decisions on civic affairs that directly affect their lives (Camino, 2001). Organizations should take the opportunity to help youth create civic awareness that translates into a sense of community connectedness (Flanagan & Van Horn, 2003; Checkoway, et al., 2003). As with most adults, young people favor being involved in organizations where they enjoy working with their peers and being able to witness that their participation made a difference (Lerner, 2004; Pancer, Rose-Krasnor, & Hoiselle, 2002).
This study addressed the importance of youth having a civic leadership role within programs and community projects and how they can serve as a catalyst for empowering local residents through community-based initiatives. The goal of the projects was to support positive youth development by promoting leadership and civic engagement among youth. The study involved providing volunteer development training for approximately 60 adult leaders, who in turn coordinated leadership development experiences for 164 youth.
Theoretical Framework
There remains a major assumption that in order to reach desired results of advancing community connectedness, youth must play a role in improving their communities. Out-of-school time is filled with promise and the opportunity to bring young people to the level where they can develop those skill sets that are pertinent for a citizen to be productive. From a preventive approach it is often seen as a time for leisure where young people are exposed and vulnerable to a plethora of risk factors (Villaruel & Lerner, 1994). Perkins and Borden (2003) propitiously defined this time as any structured learning activity offered out of school and within programs where youth can serve their communities and connect with positive peers and adults. They further go on to discuss that high quality youth programs infuse reflective learning opportunities which aids youth in gaining an understanding of themselves and others. Jones (2006) also concluded that similar programs that engage youth and adults as decision-makers were more successful when the participants (i.e., youth and adults) were permitted to implement plans, evaluate progress, and rate the quality of their experiences. This supports the notion that just having positive attributes is not enough. Youth must be given the chance to develop those skills that undergird a civic-minded society. A rather advantageous way of ensuring this is by providing youth with the chance to have a role in their development. Hence, there remains a benefit in youth taking on leadership roles.
Youth development, at its core, involves participation of young people at some level to make the transition from childhood to adulthood. The duty of youth service providers is to insist that this experience is indeed an affirming one, thus perpetuating youth to levels of productive growth. Over the course of more than a decade positive youth development has been deemed the mantra for achieving desired developmental outcomes for youth. The phenomenon targets all of the practices, principles, resources, and assets in a community geared towards helping ensure young people have a chance to thrive while growing into healthy, responsible adults (Lerner, 2004; Pittman, Irby, & Ferber, 2000). As a part of this movement, the Carnegie Corporation of New York released a report indicating the needs of adolescents (Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development, 1992). They included opportunities such as: (a) socializing with peers and adults, (b) developing skills that are relevant now and in the future, (c) contributing to the community, (d) belonging to a valued group, and (e) extending feelings of competency. All of these needs are identifiable as resources that make positive youth development attainable. Moreover, they are crucial in the development of youth leadership. Since the Carnegie report, a number of prominent youth serving organizations have presented program models that incorporate proactive means to enforce positive youth development principles and practices (Kress, 2004; Lerner, 2004; Search Institute, 1997; America’s Promise, 2006). Table 1 lists four organizations and their means of quantifying positive youth development. Each of the principles is salient with critical skills needed to instill leadership within youth.

The connection between youth involvement within communities and their involvement as adults have been well documented. Research studies have shown that young people who are civically engaged in their communities are more likely to serve as leaders during their college days and later in adulthood (Eccles & Gootman, 2002; Flanagan, 1998; Youniss, McLellan, & Yates, 1997). One valid reason youth desire to have leadership roles and contribute to their community is because it provides a sense of mattering and feeling of being able to make a difference (Eccles & Gootman, 2002; Flanagan & Van Horn, 2003). In turn, ethics serve as a by-product of service, a characteristic that is valued among all who recognize moral character and civic responsibility as a virtue of leadership. Moreover, service to the community can move young people beyond their idealistic worlds, thus allowing them to be empathetic to the needs of others. As a result, there is a sense of urgency to embrace the concept of being a leader.
While many youth programs should be commended for the support they provide, several struggle with capitalizing on the intrinsic leadership abilities possessed by youth. There is often a focus on building skills instead of giving an opportunity to assess how much their leadership abilities have progressed within a given period of time. Youth should be seen as “experts” who are very much aware of what occurs among peers within their communities (Libby, Rosen, & Sedonaen, 2005).
Their perspective on what young people need is invaluable and should be considered by those youth development specialists who have the task of planning programs. Accordingly, most of the youth participants are given opportunities to practice and refine those skills while building confidence and stronger positive relationships with peers (Libby, Rosen, & Sedonaen, 2005). This intentional form of leadership development affords youth with the ability to overcome any hesitation to take on leadership roles. This is an initial stage in equipping one with what is needed to be an effective leader.
Evidence has also revealed the importance of adults providing critical support to youth so that young people have opportunities to hone in on their skills and are not beset by frustrations that may arise in the decision-making process. Jones & Perkins (2006) conducted a study that examined perceptions and experiences of youth and adults engaged in five types of relationships with adults: (a) adult- centered leadership, (b) adult-led collaborations, (c) youth-adult partnerships, (d) youth-led collaborations, and (e) youth-centered leadership. The findings indicated that adult support was a critical component needed in all types of relationships, particularly in those where youth were serving as equal partners with adults or were leading community projects with minor adult supervision. When adult support was present, youth in youth-led collaborations were significantly more positive towards their ability to serve as leaders in communities.
Several theoretically-based qualitative assessments have been conducted to provide a basis for a new area of scholarship around various forms of youth-adult relationships. Camino (2000) identified specific concepts to assess approaches in identifying youth-adult partnerships such as youth having the opportunity to exercise decision-making power, their role in building strong communities, and the effect of adults’ negative attitudes toward youth in community program activities. Teaching and learning between adults and youth were also viewed as crucial elements which distinguish youth-adult partnerships from traditional youth-adult relationships (e.g., parent-child, teacher-student, and mentoring). Kaplan (1997) also reported that through an action research study involving intergenerational community projects, youth learned “critical thinking skills, and developed a sense of citizenship responsibility” (p. 226). The work of these scholars along with others confirms that youth learn to be leaders by watching and working with those adults who have acquired life skills that young people need to develop. As an assurance that this will occur, positive youth-adult relationships must be created and sustained.
The purpose of this study was to describe how youth perceived their leadership roles within communities. The objectives of the study were to:
Describe the demographic profile of participants,
Determine changes in youth participants’ perceptions toward their role as decision-makers,
Determine changes in youth participants’ perceptions toward their relationships with adults, and
Provide recommendations as sources of information on how future research can assist youth programs in promoting leadership and civic engagement.
Population
This study utilized a purposive sample (Creswell, 2003) of participants involved in the youth leadership program of a state organization serving as an affiliate for America’s Promise. The organization employed adult leaders who were placed within communities to promote leadership development among youth organizations. During their year of service, each adult leader provided leadership development training for youth using a nationally juried 4-H curriculum (i.e., Step Up to Leadership). Youth were recruited from local youth-serving organizations (i.e., community agencies, faith-based institutions, and schools). All youth who completed surveys administered at the beginning and end of the study were included in the study. Youth took a lead in organizing community service projects as a culminating activity of their leadership development training. Those projects included, but were not limited to, cleaning local parks, volunteering at homeless shelters, tutoring elementary students as well as serving on community-based and statewide youth advisory councils.
A total of 164 youth representing 22 communities participated in this study. Fifty- five percent were females. The ethnic background of the participants was comprised of approximately 79% Caucasian/European American, 7% African American, 4% Hispanic American, 2% Asian American, 1% Native American, and 7% who classified themselves as “other.” While 58% indicated they have volunteered to serve their community in some capacity, approximately 33% were never engaged in any community-based volunteer efforts (see Table 2).

Methods
The researcher utilized an instrument that was developed for use with a similar study. The instrument consisted of items to assess demographic variables along with the following attitudinal constructs: youth leadership and decision-making (19 questions); youth relationships with adults (eight questions). All items were on a five-point Likert-type scale with one being Strongly Disagree and five being Strongly Agree. Validity was established using a panel of experts. A previous pilot test was conducted with 4-H youth involved in similar community-based service projects. The pilot test conducted using the instrument yielded consistent reliability coefficients. A post-hoc reliability analysis was also conducted where the results revealed the following alpha coefficients for the constructs: youth leadership and decision-making (.90); youth relationships with adults (.88).
The adult leaders trained youth using the Step Up to Leadership curriculum (National 4-H Cooperative Curriculum System Inc., 2003) which presents critical life skills that are pertinent to developing youth leadership. The Step Up to Leadership curriculum’s mentor guide provides adult leaders with age appropriate activities for youth within various ages and stages. The curriculum’s facilitator guide also helps explain how facilitators should prepare for the sessions, note essential concepts of leadership, and present topics that are relevant through leadership activities.
Survey data were collected during the first meeting between the adult leader and the youth. Data were also collected from the same participants after the community projects were completed. Those youth participants who did not complete the post survey were removed from the analysis. A total of 164 individuals gave complete information. Data were analyzed using frequencies, means, and percentages. Paired and independent t -tests were used to compare perceptions. Adult leaders administered the questionnaire by following a specific script and instructions provided by the researcher. The survey was administered to participants with the assurance of confidentiality. The Internal Review Board approved the policy that passive consent of parents was permitted before students could participate. Students placed completed surveys in an envelope which was sealed and mailed to the researcher.
Results
First, prevalence of youth participation was examined in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, and volunteer efforts. Mean scores were computed for each of the attitudinal constructs, thus creating separate index variables for perceptions toward the role of youth leadership and decision-making and perceptions toward youth relationships with adults. A paired t -test was used to determine significant differences in youth perceptions of the constructs before engaging in this study and upon completion. As shown in Table 3, youth had significantly more positive perceptions of how youth leadership and decision-making was viewed in their community after their involvement in this project (3.48 pre-survey v. 3.76 on post survey). When assessing perceptions of relationships with adults, youth also became more positive towards working with adults (3.41 pre-survey v. 3.68 post survey).

Additional analyses were conducted to make comparisons based on gender. As shown in Table 4, both female and male participants had positive perceptions toward the role of youth leadership and decision-making in their community. However, females were significantly more positive than males on the pre-survey (3.55 v. 3.32). Although not significant, females also had more positive perceptions on the post survey (3.80 v. 3.69). It is interesting to note that although females were more positive, males had a much larger gain between the pre-survey and post survey scores.

In addition to the gender comparisons based on perceptions toward youth leadership, independent t-tests were computed to determine significant differences between females and males based on their perceptions of their relationship with adults (see Table 4). Regardless of whether they were females or males, the post survey reflected that they were more positive at the end of the study. As the mean scores indicated that females had a tendency to be more positive than males, no statistical significance was found.
Independent t -test analyses using data gathered at the beginning of the study compared those youth who volunteer or engage in some form of community service at least one hour per week to those who do not volunteer at all (see Table 5). Youth who volunteered were significantly more positive (3.67) toward the role of youth leadership and decision-making in communities than those youth who never volunteered (3.06).

Table 5 also provides pre-survey data on the comparison between those youth who volunteer and those who do not and their perceptions toward their relationships with adults. When comparing those non-volunteer youth participants to volunteers based on perceptions of their relationships with adults, youth who volunteered were significantly more positive than non-volunteers (3.67 v. 2.87).
No post survey data were analyzed, for at that stage in the project, all youth were considered as having volunteer experience.

Paired t -tests were used to determine any significant differences among the perceptions of non-volunteering youth and their leadership in the community and their relationships with adults before and after the study took place. There were significant differences between the pre and post surveys (see Table 6). Youth who had not served as volunteers developed more positive perceptions of youth leadership and decision-making within communities (Pre-survey of 3.14 v. 3.63 post survey) and relationships with adults (2.95 on pre-survey v. 3.58 post survey). Although those youth who did serve as volunteers prior to this study became slightly more positive on the post survey than what was revealed by the pre-survey, there was no statistically significant difference.
Discussion
This study provides support in the relevance of employing all sources of leadership within communities. Young people are most often seen as being in need of assistance rather than actually being able to assist in community problems. The results provide evidence congruent with other findings which reveal how youth can serve in leadership capacities if they are given ample opportunities to build upon their leadership.
Three major assumptions guided this current investigation. First, it was assumed that participants had formed perceptions about the role of youth and youth-adult relationships in their communities. Although the emphasis of this study explored perceptions of youth in communities, youth leadership was the phenomenon of particular interest. Second, because youth participated within these youth organizations on a voluntary basis, their responses were assumed to reflect their true perceptions and feelings. Third, adult leaders that worked with the youth, who upon being trained to work with youth themselves, were assumed to have adequate skills in effectively recruiting and nurturing youth with leadership potential.
The results of this study are consistent with prior research revealing the benefits of youth being engaged in leadership development opportunities. Perceptions of the youth became significantly more positive toward youth leadership and decision-making in their communities. This is consistent with the scholarship of experiential learning which stresses that the ideal learner is actively engaged in a quality learning process (Dewey, 1938; Kolb, 1984; Smith, 1991). This further confirms what Mezirow (1997) described as transformative learning which encouraged youth in this study to change their frame of reference by reflecting on more positive attitudes.
Youth also developed more positive perceptions of adults. This is quintessential if individuals and agencies are going to provide youth with the positive experience that is tantamount to their attaining a healthy, constructive adult life. With affirming relationships being the center of positive youth development, young people must feel a strong connection with adults and their community if they are to inculcate the skills needed to serve in leadership roles. Research has suggested that focusing on intergenerational experiences where youth and adults interact and share common goals help reduce negative attitudes that can dishearten the ability to nurture youth leadership (Jones, 2006; Piquart, Wenzel, & Sorenson, 2000).
Based on gender comparisons, females were more positive than males when examining both constructs. Similar accounts have been prevalent among research studies as well as programs where practitioners are challenged with engaging males. Youth service providers must be strategic in providing opportunities that stimulate and maintain the interest of males. In contrast to many youth programs that are dominated by female participation, these programs were nearly proportionate. Regardless of gender, all youth indicated more positive perceptions over the course of the program. It is also noteworthy to recognize that males had a more significant increase towards positive perceptions when examining the pre- survey and post survey scores. Hence, youth service providers should consider involving more males in leadership-based experiential learning endeavors. If the goal is to reach their potential, then merely teaching leadership to most youth may not be enough. They should be afforded the chance to put into practice the skills they have acquired.
The findings also revealed a significant difference between the youth who had not previously served as volunteers in their community and those youth who had served as volunteers. Youth who had volunteer experience were more positive towards the role of youth leadership in their communities as well as their perceptions toward relationships with adults. An analysis was conducted to examine the pre-survey data only because the researcher aimed to minimize the influence the experiences of participating in the project would have on their perceptions. However, the pre- and post survey results from a paired t -test did reveal that those youth who had not volunteered developed more positive perceptions. These findings suggest that youth should be encouraged to participate in non-traditional volunteer efforts in order to provide various interrelated outcomes including positive social relationships and improved feelings of intrinsic leadership abilities (Harvard Family Research Project, 2008).
Participants in the communities, who were a part of this project, were purposefully selected as a sample of convenience. These groups were predominately limited to youth who had access to plausible youth serving programs. Therefore, a limitation of this study is that the generalizability of the results does not extend beyond these participants and groups. Based on the sample size of this study, the researcher was also limited in the use of appropriate inferential statistics.
Conclusion
It is concluded that much of this study’s value relates to experiential learning techniques, which, in turn, can serve as a central medium for leadership development among young people. This form of training also played a part in strengthening leadership capacity, as related to the practical skills of the youth. Although the study revealed that perceptions can change towards the affirmative when youth have an opportunity to become civically engaged, there was also evidence that experiential learning can serve a role in developing a solid foundation for building leadership skills among young people.
Practical experiences must be considered when nurturing youth leaders while also giving adults the chance to exert their abilities by serving as allies. Young people are indeed an asset to the communities in which they live. However, in order to put forth efforts that attain impact, they must have access to opportunities as well as the relevant information that provides insight on how they can become change agents. While youth-serving organizations continue striving to achieve positive developmental outcomes, there must be research-based models of application available to aid in the enhancement of community youth programs.
Recommendations for Further Research
The completion of this study presents opportunities for additional research such as:
Replicating this study with a larger randomized sample to validate the methodology and findings,
Conducting a longitudinal study to enrich the data to further determine how programmatic improvements can be implemented,
Utilizing these findings to assess the quality of youth-adult relationships within a program or project as a measure of quality,
Assessing the specific leadership and life skills young people acquire while engaged in similar program experiences,
Conducting a parallel study to compare the prior leadership experiences of youth with their perceived benefits of the program, as well as a self- assessment of their own leadership abilities, and
Incorporating a control group design to see if training made a difference independent of experiential learning projects.

The Power of Youth Empowerment Programs in Communities
Posted on February 12, 2019
Youth empowerment programs can have an incredible impact on their communities as they support students, increase access to opportunity, and remove barriers to education and achievement.
Ultimately, the goal of community programs for youth is to authentically engage and empower vulnerable children for a better future. Some programs advocate for healthy eating and physical activity as part of reducing childhood obesity. Others offer support to LGBTQ kids, work to lift children out of poverty, develop workforce training, or implement violence and bullying prevention activities.
Examples of Youth Empowerment Programs
Every state, county, or city is home to a program designed to help kids in that community, and each has a slightly different approach to speak to the needs of their area.
The Georgia Department of Human Services created their Youth Empowerment Series to provide access to resources that offer support and empower Georgians and their families. To accomplish this goal, kids are encouraged to be the “blueprint for change” in their communities and leaders are developed through workshops, networking, and experiences to “grow a generation of young trailblazers.” [1]
The Youth Action Research for Prevention (YARP) program was designed to train kids as a group to use research to understand their community better. YARP engages the students to use data to then develop social action plans and activities in the community. [2] The resulting engagement in community activism has had an effect on both behavior and effectiveness for individuals and the community. [3]
The Youth Empowerment Program in Louisiana was founded to “engage underserved young people through community-based education, mentoring, and employment readiness programs to help them develop skills and strengthen ties to family and community.” [4] Like many non-profit groups leading empowerment programs, they aim to create a community where all children “have access to the opportunities, skills, resources, and relationships they need to actualize their potential.” [5]
The United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health, funds a demonstration project called the Youth Empowerment Program (YEP) created to address unhealthy behaviors in minority at-risk youth. “YEP provides resources to those who need them most, minority youth who live in some of the most high-risk areas in the country. At its heart, this program is helping them make better lifestyle choices that result in healthier, happier lives,” explains Dr. Paula E. Papanek, founding director of the Program of Exercise Science in the Department of Physical Therapy at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. [6]
Across the country, 17 YEP grantees offer innovative approaches to promote healthy lifestyles and life choices in minority youth, each for a three-year grant cycle. [7] The University of Utah worked with 30 at-risk teen mothers through a daily one-hour life skills training and after-school mentoring and tutoring program. They have seen both teen birth rates and STI rates lower significantly in their community indicating a decrease in risky sexual behaviors through direct educational programming in reproductive health and empowerment. [8]
Funding for Youth Empowerment Programs
Youth empowerment programs are designed to increase access to resources to improve children’s lives. If you have a plan for your community but aren’t sure where to find funds to develop your program, several youth empowerment program grants are available. For instance, Grants.gov Youth Funding Opportunity Search Tool allows organizations to search a wide range of funding opportunities for youth-related programs, and the list of searchable grant opportunities is updated daily. The Global Youth Empowerment Fund provides funding to community projects, especially those led by youth-led organizations, that “provide sustainable solutions to local challenges in communities around the world.”
Data for Grant Proposals and Evaluations
As part of the application process, many federally-funded grants require organizations or community coalitions to have a detailed plan in place on how you will establish baselines, track success, and report on results. You may be required to submit this information on a regular schedule to show progress and monitor outcomes. Survey data can be used for both as well as encouraging increased community support through matching funds and participation in programs. If your community-based coalition has received or is applying for a grant that requires data measurement and reporting, Pride Surveys can help.
Why Work with a School and Student Survey Company?
The benefit of working with a survey company is that we can gather fact-based data and information through anonymous and effective survey tools. With this information, educators, parents, PTAs, and coalitions are in a better position to secure future funding from a variety of sources to support their programs.
Presenting a survey to students can feel daunting especially when it comes to developing survey question ideas for high school students, but Pride Surveys has been providing research-quality data for schools and communities since 1980.
Our Pride Survey for Grades 6-12 is our longest-running and must-used survey with more than 8 million respondents over the last 35 years. This comprehensive questionnaire for students collects data regarding alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, discipline problems at and outside of school, personal information, academic achievement, family life, and more. Using this student behavior and school climate survey, we have been able to track significant longitudinal data and trends, and have released multiple national data sets, allowing our customers to compare their local data with our national data. As you develop your community youth empowerment programs, this data can be incredibly valuable for many reasons.
Please browse through the different types of student surveys we offer and find out why more than 14 million students, parents, and faculty members have responded to Pride Surveys. Questions? Please call us today at 800-279-6361 or fill out our quick online contact form.

According to the Knight Foundation, statistics also show a gap. ‘Often that energy, that desire to contribute or lead, is going unsupported and untapped, they said.’ Teens and young adults don’t always see a place for their voice and their work.’ They feel unwelcome, perhaps a result of negative messages about youth coming from adults and even the media.
We are running out of time to solve the climate crisis. Every day it seems more people are calling out for climate action, but still, every time global leaders meet they fail to reach binding agreements to curb greenhouse gasses.
Youth around the world feel fear and despair when they think about what climate change could mean for their future. While this generation has the most at stake when it comes to preventing climate chaos, many young people don’t know where to start in addressing this huge issue. Many youth are looking for ways to be a part of the solution, but need the training and support to take the next step.
In light of the issue we are facing, here is a list of 10 ways that you can start empowering your children to be positive youth leaders NOW:
1. Give the youth tools to collaborate and problem solve, brainstorm and reflect.
Providing youth with the information and resources necessary for analyzing issues that affect their lives and environments will help them become strong strategizers on ways to act as change agents in their communities.
2. Encourage them to use their passions for good.
Guiding youth to use what their passions and creativity to share positive messages or bring attention to issues they care about will allow them to find purpose within their passion and use the power of their joy to share important messages.
3. Guide them to believe that their voice matters without judging or criticizing their ideas.
Empowering youth to understand that their voice makes a huge difference in this world and that all ideas are worth exploring will only give them more motivation and fuel to continue strengthening their own power for change.
4. Guide them to understand that people will not always want to listen, just because we would like them to but to not take it personally.
Helping youth to understand that not everyone is going to respond the way you hope they would and that some people may not be ready to hear what you want to share will support their confidence. It’s important to let youth know that when someone doesn’t listen to them, allow that to only make them stronger.
5. Help them learn that sometimes even the most fabulous idea may need a bit more logistical planning.
Guiding youth to help them understand that all visions and ideas take time to make sure they are realistic and well thought through. Help them to know that there are different stages to a project and the first stage is having an idea but there are many stages after that. This will help them understand the full process and not get stuck on one idea.
6. Help youth develop habits, that in the end, they can sustain without ‘suggestions’ or prodding.
Good habits produce sustainable leaders. Youth that have good habits for their own well-being and constant personal progression that they enjoy will help them become strong leaders on their own.
7. Give youth a chance for them to fail but help them to learn to succeed.
Let youth know that failing is not a bad thing to happen, it’s actually important to find out what went wrong so they can improve and make it better the next time they try. Often the way to success is through failure.
8. Employ storytelling of successful youth leadership to counteract negative messages about young people.
Encourage youth to speak about to their triumphs often, to share their victories across all media platforms to reinforce the positive change that has occurred. This will empower more positive action to continue and give youth more foundation and support to work from.
9. Invite the youth to launch a project or idea and support their progress.
Support youth in implementing their project once they feel they have come up with a good strategy and support them along the way. Allowing them to carry out their vision with the encouragement and coaching support will be an empowering experience and let them feel supported in their process.
10. Become involved with Rising Youth for a Sustainable Earth (RYSE)!
It’s time for each of us to support the leadership of generations to come who will be most affected by the global crisis of climate change. This spring, RYSE will train and support 500 young solutionaries to lead a collaborative national movement of young people to take direct actions for climate solutions starting in their own communities. This project needs your attention and support to bring it to life – (http://igg.me/at/RYSE/x/9466572)
