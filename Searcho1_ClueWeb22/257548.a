Hello!
The answer is: Naturalization
Why?
The U.S. naturalization process is the process which grants U.S. citizenship (and all its benefits) to foreign or national that fulfills all the requirements.
There are several requirements which could variate for each people depending on his/her situation, four of the main requirements to apply for the U.S. citizenship are:
- For US citizen spouses: Who wants to apply for the U.S .citizenship must be a permanent resident for at least 3 years and meet all the eligibility requirements to apply as a U.S. citizen spouse.
- Being a permanent resident for at least 5 years and fulfill all the eligibility requirements.
- Having qualifying services in the U.S. armed force and fulfill all the eligibility requirements.
- For childs, they can apply if his/her parents are U.S citizen and they are born, residing and living outside the U.S. and meeting all the eligibility requirements.
Have a nice day!

Step-by-Step Process for US Immigration
Step-by-Step Process for US Immigration
By: Jane Meggitt
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
The number of immigrant visas available annually is set under the United States Immigration and Nationality Act. If you're an immediate relative -- spouse, parent or unmarried child under age 21 -- of a U.S. citizen, the number of visas are unlimited so you can apply in any year. If you're hoping to immigrate based on a preference category, such as skilled labor, the number of annual visas is limited.
Visa Sponsorship and Petition
Potential U.S. immigrants require sponsorship, either from a relative with U.S. citizenship or permanent resident status, or a prospective employer. Your sponsor must file a petition for you with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Citizens and permanent residents file Form I-130, the "Petition for Alien Relative," while employers must file Form I-140, the "Petition for Alien Worker." Once USCIS approves the petition, the visa application process begins.
Required Documentation
Once your petition is approved, you can apply for a visa at your country's U.S. embassy or consulate. You must supply up-to-date documents for visa processing. You must fill out a biographical data questionnaire, answering all questions truthfully, and submit both an original and copy of both your sponsor's and your birth certificate. If either birth certificate is not in English or in the language of your country, a notarized translation is required. If married, you must submit the original and a copy of your marriage license. The original, signed Form I-864, "Affidavit of Support" from your sponsor is required. Additionally, you must provide any prior non-immigrant U.S. visas, along with a valid passport from your country.
Medical Examination
All immigrants must undergo a medical examination by a qualified doctor. The U.S. Department of State designates foreign physicians who can conduct these examinations. The U.S. embassy or consulate in your country can give you information regarding eligible "panel physicians." You must bring Form I-693, the "Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record" to your medical appointment. After the doctor conducts the examination, he fills out the form and signs and seals it. Only sealed envelopes are accepted by the USCIS.
Visa Interview
Once you have submitted all necessary documentation and received your medical examination, you can set up a visa interview appointment. You must bring your appointment letter issued by the embassy or consulate to the actual interview, along with all of your other documentation. The U.S. Department of State warns that you should not make nonrefundable flight plans or make "permanent financial commitments," such as quitting your job or selling your house until after the interview and after receiving your immigration visa.

Citizenship and Naturalization
Citizenship and Naturalization
Citizenship is a unique bond that unites people around civic ideals and a belief in the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
Deciding to become a U.S. citizen is one of the most important decisions an immigrant can make. Depending on your situation, there may be different ways to obtain citizenship.
Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a lawful permanent resident after meeting the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).
Acquisition of citizenship is obtained through U.S. citizenship parents either at birth or after birth, but before the age of 18.
Explore the links below to help you determine what applies to you. Depending on your situation, there may be other requirements that you must fulfill.

What is the Process for US Citizenship? (with pictures)
What is the Process for US Citizenship?
M.C. Huguelet
Last Modified Date: June 17, 2022
Swearing an oath of loyalty to the United States is required to become a citizen.
Anyone who wishes to attain US citizenship must complete a multistep process known as naturalization. Prior to beginning the naturalization process, the applicant must first meet certain residency and language requirements. If the applicant satisfies these prerequisites, he can start the citizenship process by filing a naturalization application. After his application has been filed, he must then complete an interview and a test. Once he has successfully fulfilled all of these requirements, he will then attend a ceremony in which he is officially sworn in as a US citizen.
In many cases, the immigration process begins with the submission of an application along with documentation supporting the applicant's request.
Before beginning the naturalization process, the applicant must check that he satisfies certain prerequisites, many of which are related to residency. He must have been a legal permanent resident of the US for at least five years ‚Äî three years if he is married to a US citizen ‚Äî before applying. In addition, he must have been physically present in the US for at least half of this legal residency period. Further, he must have been resident in the state in which he will file his citizenship application for at least three months.
Taking a naturalization test is one step in the process for gaining US citizenship.
Additionally, the applicant must be at least 18 years of age and have a basic command of the English language. He must also be willing to declare loyalty to the United States at the time of naturalization. It should be noted that many countries allow for dual citizenship, however, and thus this declaration of loyalty to the US will not necessarily void his citizenship in the country of his birth.

An interview may be conducted after a prospective citizen files an application.
Even if an applicant fulfills these requirements, there are certain things which may jeopardize his naturalization eligibility. For instance, he cannot have willfully deceived an immigration official, neglected to pay outstanding US taxes, or voted in a US election. While these offenses may not irrevocably bar an applicant from citizenship, if he has committed one or more of them he should consult an immigration lawyer before commencing the application process.
Proof of marital status is commonly asked for during a citizenship interview.
Once the applicant has verified his eligibility, he can complete and file a naturalization application. This form is available from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website. The application must be accompanied by a check for processing and fingerprinting fees. After your application form has been processed, you will be instructed to appear at your local USCIS office or other specified location for electronic fingerprinting.
Next, you will be invited to an interview with the USCIS. During this meeting, your interviewer will double-check your naturalization eligibility and your control of the English language. He will also try to confirm that you are a person of good moral standing, with a genuine desire to become a loyal US citizen.
During this appointment you will in most cases also take a written exam. This exam will test your knowledge of US history, government, and citizenship duties. In addition, it will allow reviewers to further evaluate your understanding of the English language.
If the USCIS determines that you have successfully fulfilled all requirements, you will be invited to a swearing-in ceremony. During this ceremony, you will turn in your permanent residence card and then swear an oath of loyalty to the US. You will then be issued a naturalization certificate. At this point you have officially become a US citizen.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How do immigrants become citizens?" From the search results, it seems like the process is called naturalization. Let me see what all the documents say about this.

First document is from Brainly.com, and it's a question similar to mine, asking about how an immigrant can become a US citizen. The answer is naturalization. It also mentions some requirements like being a permanent resident for a certain number of years, depending on the situation, like being married to a US citizen or serving in the US armed forces. So, naturalization is the key process here.

Second document is from LegalBeagle.com, and it goes into more detail about the step-by-step process for US immigration. It talks about visa sponsorship and petition, required documentation, medical examination, and visa interview. But this seems more about the immigration process itself, not specifically about becoming a citizen. Maybe I need to look deeper.

Third document is from USCitizenship.info, and it clearly outlines the steps to become a US citizen through naturalization. It says you need to be a lawful permanent resident for 5 years (or 3 if married to a US citizen), maintain continuous and physical presence, have good moral character, know English and US history, and be willing to take the Oath of Allegiance. Then, you submit your application, get fingerprinted, attend an interview and take tests, and finally take the oath to become a citizen. This seems comprehensive.

Fourth document is directly from the USCIS website, which is the official government site for citizenship and naturalization. It confirms that naturalization is the process for lawful permanent residents to become citizens. It also mentions that citizenship can be acquired through US citizen parents, but that might be a different path. So, for most immigrants, naturalization is the way to go.

Fifth document is from Infobloom.com, and it also describes the naturalization process in detail, including prerequisites like residency duration, physical presence, age, and language skills. It mentions that after filing the application and undergoing fingerprinting, there's an interview and a test, followed by a swearing-in ceremony where you take the oath and receive the naturalization certificate.

So, from all these sources, it's clear that the process is called naturalization, and it involves several steps: meeting certain residency and language requirements, filing an application, undergoing biometrics (fingerprinting), attending an interview and taking tests on English and US history/government, and finally participating in a swearing-in ceremony to take the oath of allegiance.

I should also note that there might be exceptions or different paths for certain groups, like military service members, but for the general case, naturalization is the standard process.

To summarize, immigrants become citizens through a process called naturalization, which includes fulfilling residency requirements, filing an application, undergoing biometric screenings, passing interviews and tests, and taking the Oath of Allegiance in a ceremonial setting.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Through a process called naturalization, which involves meeting residency requirements, filing an application, undergoing biometric screenings, passing interviews and tests on English and U.S. history/government, and taking the Oath of Allegiance.}} \]
