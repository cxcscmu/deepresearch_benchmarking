So the question is whether humans cause climate change. This is a big and complex topic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. First, I need to understand what climate change is. Climate change refers to long-term changes in global or regional climate patterns, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns. These changes can be natural, like volcanic eruptions or solar variations, but the term often refers to changes caused by human activities.

I've heard a lot about greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which is essential for life as we know it. However, when their concentrations increase, they can lead to more heat being trapped, resulting in global warming and other climate changes.

Now, do humans contribute to this? Well, human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, have significantly increased the emission of greenhouse gases. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas for energy releases大量二氧化碳。此外，森林砍伐减少了可以吸收二氧化碳的树木数量，进一步加剧了问题。

我也听说过“气候怀疑论”或者“否认论”，他们认为气候变化是自然循环，不是人类活动导致的。但我需要查证这些观点是否站得住脚。

也许我应该查找一些权威的科学报告或研究来了解这个问题。比如联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会（IPCC）的报告，他们是气候变化领域的权威机构。

Humans have caused almost 100% of global warming, says new IPCC report
Climate science has evolved since the last IPCC report released in 2013, and scientists are now confident that human influence has caused climate change as we know it

The new climate science report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released August 9, 2021 differs from its predecessor on one main account: Scientists are now more confident that human activity has caused climate change than they have been before.
The report, the first instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), has a simple message:
“It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts more frequent and severe.”
There is almost no doubt that most of the observed warming of the planet since the late-1800s is caused by humans.
The report’s technical summary highlights how this confidence has increased with each successive IPCC report: “The evidence for human influence on recent climate change has strengthened progressively from the IPCC second assessment report [in 1995] to the AR5 [in 2013-14] and is even stronger in this assessment, including for regional scales and for extremes.”
This has been possible through advances in climate science and improvements in models and analytical tools. The report outlines some of these advances, saying:
“Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from longer observational datasets, improved palaeo-climate information, stronger warming signal since AR5 (the fifth assessment report) and improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques. Since AR5, the attribution to human influence has become possible across a wider range of climate variables and climatic impact-drivers. New techniques and analyses drawing on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and climate extremes to human influence (high confidence).”
Human activities have warmed the planet at a rate never seen before in the planet’s long history in the past 2,000 years in particular. The IPCC report found that Earth’s global surface temperature warmed by 1.09 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900.
While natural changes to the Earth’s climate do occur, 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities. Thus, almost 100 per cent of global warming has been caused by humans.
Human influence is the main driver of hot weather extremes (which have become more frequent and intense since 1950s), and without which these extremes would have been unlikely. The AR6 is virtually certain that human-driven emissions are the main driver of the changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale, and of ocean warming and acidification.
Additionally, the AR6 acknowledges the ability of scientists to now pinpoint how much worse an extreme weather event was made by climate change.
Previously, they could not link a specific event to warmer temperatures caused by human activity. But this is no longer a challenge, as weather attribution studies can now be rapidly produced, as was done by the World Weather Attribution initiative for the North American heatwave in July 2021. It had concluded that the heatwave would be “virtually impossible” without human-driven climate change.

Global warming: why is IPCC report so certain about the influence of humans?

The fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. Many media outlets have reported that this is an increase from the 90 percent certainty in the fourth IPCC report, but actually the change is much more significant than that. In fact, if you look closely, the IPCC says that humans have most likely caused all of the global warming over the past 60 years.
Spot the Differences
Here is the relevant statement from the fourth IPCC report in 2007:
"Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely [90 percent confidence] due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations
Now here is the statement from the fifth IPCC report:
"It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together."
Did you spot the differences? The 2007 IPCC statement focused on human greenhouse gas emissions, while the 2013 statement pertains to all human influences on the climate. This includes the cooling effect from human aerosol emissions (pollutants that scatter sunlight).
Cooling from human aerosol emissions offsets about one-third of the warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. The new IPCC statement says that even taking that aerosol cooling effect into account, humans are still the main cause of the global warming over the past 60 years.
Current Global Warming Caused by Greenhouse Gases, Not Nature
The IPCC elaborates further. What's causing global warming: human greenhouse gas emissions.
"The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period ... The observed warming since 1951 can be attributed to the different natural and anthropogenic drivers and their contributions can now be quantified. Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5°C to 1.3 °C over the period 1951−2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of −0.6°C to 0.1°C."
What's not causing global warming: natural external factors like solar activity, and natural internal factors like ocean cycles.
"The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C."
We've observed about 0.6°C average global surface warming over the past 60 years. During that time, the IPCC best estimate is that greenhouse gases have caused about 0.9°C warming, which was partially offset by about 0.3°C cooling from human aerosol emissions. During that time, natural external factors had no net influence on global temperatures. For example, solar activity has been flat since 1950.
Annual global temperature change (thin light red) with 11 year moving average of temperature (thick dark red). Temperature from NASA GISS. Annual Total Solar Irradiance (TSI; thin light blue) with 11 year moving average of TSI (thick dark blue). TSI from 1880 to 1978 from Krivova et al (2007). TSI from 1979 to 2009 from PMOD.
As for the natural internal variability of the Earth's climate system, short-term noise averages out to zero over long time frames. Warm and cool ocean cycles cancel each other out, and thus internal variability has no long-term influence on average global temperatures.
Put it all together, and the IPCC is 95 percent confident that humans have caused most of the observed global surface warming over the past 60 years. Their best estimate is that humans have caused 100 percent of that global warming.
IPCC is Summarizing the Scientific Research
The IPCC does not conduct any original research; it's a summary report, and these statements accurately reflect the body of climate science research. For example, last year climate scientists Tom Wigley and Ben Santer published a paper concluding that human climate influences were responsible for 50 to 150 percent of the observed warming from 1950 to 2005.
Like this new IPCC statement, they found with 95 percent confidence that humans have caused at least half the observed warming since 1950, and most likely all of it. It's also possible that humans have caused more warming than has been observed because natural factors may have had a net cooling effect. The Wigley and Santer results are consistent with the body of scientific research on the causes of global warming.
Net human and natural percent contributions to the observed global surface warming over the past 50-65 years according to Tett et al. 2000 (T00, dark blue), Meehl et al. 2004 (M04, red), Stone et al. 2007 (S07, light green), Lean and Rind 2008 (LR08, purple), Huber and Knutti 2011 (HK11, light blue), Gillett et al. 2012 (G12, orange), Wigley and Santer 2012 (WS12, dark green), and Jones et al. 2013 (J12, pink).
The 'fingerprints' of climate change are also all consistent with what we expect to see as a result of human-caused global warming, for example changes in the atmosphere, as another paper by Ben Santer recently concluded.
Summary of observational evidence that human carbon dioxide emissions are causing the climate to warm.
What About the Naysayers?
A few naysayers like Judith Curry from Georgia Tech have disputed the IPCC confidence on this question, for example in an interview with the reliably inaccurate David Rose.
However, while Curry is a climate scientist, she doesn't research the causes of global warming. She also has a history of exaggerating climate uncertainties. Her comments are inconsistent with the body of scientific research on the subject. Put simply, she is speaking outside her area of expertise, like a podiatrist giving advice on open heart surgery.
The 97 Percent Consensus is Evidence-Based
This is why there's a 97 percent consensu s amongst climate experts and in the climate science literature that humans are causing global warming. The scientific evidence on this question is overwhelming.
Many commenters have noted that the expert consensus is itself not scientific evidence for human-caused global warming. That's true. The expert consensus is however based on the scientific evidence. The fact that 97 percent of climate experts agree on this subject also demonstrates the strength of the scientific evidence on human-caused global warming. And the strength of the evidence is why the IPCC is able to say with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming.

The new IPCC climate report is hugely important — and here are 6 main takeaways

Earth has warmed 1.09℃ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The report also found that escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth and every facet of the weather.
The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
The IPCC is the climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, and it is the global authority on the state of Earth’s climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment.
Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today — but there is still time to avert the worst damage if humanity chooses to. Here are six takeaways from the report:
1. It’s unequivocal: Humans are warming the planet
For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally — leaving absolutely no room for doubt — humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans.
The IPCC finds Earth’s global surface temperature warmed 1.09℃ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29℃ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1℃ of the increase is due to data improvements.)
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years.
The IPCC recognizes the role of natural changes to the Earth’s climate. However, it finds 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities.
In other words, pretty much all global warming is due to humans.
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years, with the warming also reaching ocean depths below 2,000 meters.
The IPCC says human activities have also affected global precipitation (rain and snow). Since 1950, total global precipitation has increased, but while some regions have become wetter, others have become drier.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over most land areas. This is because the warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture — about seven percent more for each additional degree of temperature — which makes wet seasons and rainfall events wetter.
2. CO2 levels are rising faster than ever
Present-day global concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are higher and rising faster than at any time in at least the past two million years.
The speed at which atmospheric CO2 has increased since the industrial revolution (1750) is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the last 800,000 years and between 4 and 5 times faster than during the last 56 million years.
About 85% of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels.
About 85 percent of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels. The remaining 15 percent are generated from land-use change, such as deforestation and degradation.
Concentrations of other greenhouse gases are not doing any better. Both methane and nitrous oxide, the second- and third- biggest contributors to global warming after CO2, have also increased more quickly. Methane emissions from human activities largely come from livestock and the fossil fuel industry. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the use of nitrogen fertilizer on crops.
3. Extreme weather is on the rise
Hot extremes, heatwaves and heavy rain have also become more frequent and intense across most land regions since 1950, the IPCC confirms.
The report highlights that some recently observed hot extremes, such as the Australian summer of 2012–2013, would have been extremely unlikely without human influence on the climate.
Human influence has also been detected for the first time in compounded extreme events. For example, incidences of heatwaves, droughts and fire weather happening at the same time are now more frequent. These compound events have been seen in Australia, Southern Europe, Northern Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and African tropical forests.
Even if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia.
4. Our oceans are getting hotter, higher and more acidic
Oceans absorb 91 percent of the energy from the increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. This has led to ocean warming and more marine heatwaves, particularly over the past 15 years.
Marine heatwaves cause the mass death of marine life, such as from coral bleaching events. They also cause algal blooms and shifts in the composition of species. Even if the world restricts warming to 1.5-2℃, as is consistent with the Paris Agreement, marine heatwaves will become four times more frequent by the end of the century.
Melting ice sheets and glaciers, along with the expansion of the ocean as it warms, have led to a global mean sea level increase of 0.2 meters between 1901 and 2018. But, importantly, the speed that the sea level is rising is accelerating: 1.3 millimeters per year during 1901-1971, 1.9mm per year during 1971-2006, and 3.7mm per year during 2006-2018.
Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of CO2, has occurred in the overall oceans and is reaching depths beyond 2,000 meters in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic.
5. Many changes are already irreversible
The IPCC says if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia. For example, global warming of 2℃ this century will lead to an average global sea-level rise of between two and six meters over 2,000 years — and much more for higher emission scenarios.
Globally, glaciers have been synchronously retreating since 1950 and are projected to continue to melt for decades after the global temperature is stabilized. Meanwhile, the acidification of the deep ocean will remain for thousands of years after CO2 emissions cease.
Global warming stays below 2°C during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The report does not identify any possible abrupt changes that would lead to an acceleration of global warming during this century — but does not rule out such possibilities.
The prospect of permafrost (frozen soils) in Alaska, Canada, and Russia crossing a tipping point has been widely discussed. The concern is that as frozen ground thaws, large amounts of carbon accumulated over thousands of years from dead plants and animals could be released as they decompose.
The report does not identify any globally significant abrupt change in these regions over this century, based on currently available evidence. However, it projects permafrost areas will release about 66 billion metric tonnes of CO2 for each additional degree of warming, and these emissions are irreversible during this century under all warming scenarios.
6. But we can still act and prevent the worst-case scenario
Earth’s surface temperature will continue to increase until at least 2050 under all emissions scenarios considered in the report. The assessment shows Earth could well exceed the 1.5℃ warming limit by the early 2030s.
If we reduce emissions sufficiently, there is only a 50 percent chance global temperature rise will stay around 1.5℃ (including a temporary overshoot of up to 0.1℃). To get Earth back to below 1.5℃ warming, CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere using negative emissions technologies or nature-based solutions.
Global warming stays below 2℃ during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2°C  … Humanity, however, must choose to act.
The IPCC analyzed future climate projections from dozens of climate models, produced by more than 50 modeling centers around the world. It showed global average surface temperature rises between 1-1.8℃ and 3.3-5.7℃ this century above pre-industrial levels for the lowest and highest emission scenarios, respectively. The exact increase the world experiences will depend on how much more greenhouse gases are emitted.
The report states, with high certainty, that to stabilize the climate, CO2 emissions must reach net zero, and other greenhouse gas emissions must decline significantly.
We also know, for a given temperature target, there’s a finite amount of carbon that we can emit before reaching net-zero emissions. To have a 50:50 chance of halting warming at around 1.5℃, this quantity is about 500 billion metric tonnes of CO2.
At current levels of CO2 emissions this “carbon budget” would be used up within 12 years. Exhausting the budget will take longer if emissions begin to decline.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2℃ and limit it to around 1.5℃, the globally agreed goals of the Paris Agreement. Humanity, however, must choose to act.

New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet
News | September 27, 2013
New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change
A 'Blue Marble' image of the Earth taken from the VIIRS instrument aboard NASA's most recently launched Earth-observing satellite - Suomi NPP.
A United Nations panel has released the first part of its much-anticipated six-year update on the state of climate change. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says there is 95 percent certainty that humans have caused most of the warming of the planet's surface that has occurred since the 1950s — up from 90 percent certainty in the last assessment report, which came out in 2007.
The report draws from many independent scientific analyses of climate change, which use direct observations of Earth’s climate, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models.
Other key findings include:
Today carbon dioxide is at an "unprecedented" level not seen for at least the last 800,000 years.
Sea level is set to continue to rise at a faster rate than over the past 40 years. Waters are expected to rise by between 26 cm (10 inches) at the low end and 82 cm (30 inches) at the high end.
There is "high confidence" that over the last two decades the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been melting, glaciers have receded in most parts of the world, and Arctic sea ice has continued to shrink in terms of extent.
Many of the changes seen in our climate since the 1950s are "unprecedented over decades to millennia."
The IPCC issued its "Summary for Policymakers" as part of the "Physical Science Basis of Climate Change" section of the report in Stockholm on Friday, and will release the full text of that section on Monday, Sept. 30, on the IPCC website (http://www.ipcc.ch/ ). Additional sections will be released in the coming months, providing a comprehensive summary of the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change.
More than 25 NASA scientists helped author and review the Fifth Assessment Report. The report is the work of a total of 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries, and over 600 contributing authors from 32 countries.

Climate change: IPCC report is 'code red for humanity' - BBC News
Climate change: IPCC report is 'code red for humanity'
By Matt McGrath
Environment correspondent
9 August 2021
Comments
COP26
EPA
Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.
The landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade.
The report "is a code red for humanity", says the UN chief.
But scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.
There is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures.
Echoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General António Guterres said: "If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success."
The sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.
Their report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.

Research shows millions more at risk of flooding
A really simple guide to climate change
In strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".
According to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.
"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet."
Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: "By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before."
The authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.
This warming is "already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe".
Whether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, "their attribution to human influence has strengthened" over the past decade.
IPCC report key points
Global surface temperature was 1.09C higher in the decade between 2011-2020 than between 1850-1900.
The past five years have been the hottest on record since 1850
The recent rate of sea level rise has nearly tripled compared with 1901-1971
Human influence is "very likely" (90%) the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea-ice
It is "virtually certain" that hot extremes including heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, while cold events have become less frequent and less severe
The new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.
The oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.
"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming," said Prof Hawkins.
"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back."

When it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.
However, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.
Such outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100.
One key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.

Protesters urge action by politicians as the clock counts down to November's COP26 climate summit in Glasgow
Almost every nation on Earth signed up to the goals of the Paris climate agreement in 2015.
This pact aims to keep the rise in global temperatures well below 2C this century and to pursue efforts to keep it under 1.5C.
This new report says that under all the emissions scenarios considered by the scientists, both targets will be broken this century unless huge cuts in carbon take place.

Can temperature rise be kept below 1.5°C?
1.1°C The increase in temperature since pre-industrial times
2,400bn tonnes CO2 humans have emitted to date
500bn tonnes more would leave only a 50-50 chance of staying under 1.5°C
40bn tonnes Roughly amount of CO2 humanity emits every year
Source: IPCC
The authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.
This was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.
"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Niño in 2016," said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia.
"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never."
The consequences of going past 1.5C over a period of years would be unwelcome in a world that has already experienced a rapid uptick in extreme events with a temperature rise since pre-industrial times of 1.1C.
"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves," said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.
"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world."
Sea levels will continue to rise for centuries, warns climate scientist Prof Ed Hawkins.
Prof Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: "The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming."
So what can be done?
While this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures.
Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.
"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero," said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.
"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling."
Five future impacts
Temperatures will reach 1.5C above 1850-1900 levels by 2040 under all emissions scenarios
The Arctic is likely to be practically ice-free in September at least once before 2050 in all scenarios assessed
There will be an increasing occurrence of some extreme events "unprecedented in the historical record" even at warming of 1.5C
Extreme sea level events that occurred once a century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of tidal gauge locations by 2100
There will be likely increases in fire weather in many regions
While the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.
"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points," said Dr Otto. "We are not doomed."
A tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.
For political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Do humans cause climate change?" It seems pretty straightforward, but I know climate change is a big and complex issue, so I need to approach this carefully. First, I should probably understand what climate change is. From what I know, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, and it's different from natural weather fluctuations. The key here is that these shifts can have significant impacts on ecosystems, sea levels, and weather events.

Now, the question is specifically about whether humans are causing this climate change. I've heard a lot about greenhouse gases and how human activities are increasing their levels in the atmosphere, leading to more heat being trapped and thus warming the planet. Things like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural practices all release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

But I also remember that there are natural factors that can influence climate, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations, and changes in the Earth's orbit. So, it's important to distinguish between natural and human-induced causes.

To get a better understanding, I think I should look into what scientific consensus says about this. There must be extensive research and reports from reputable organizations that can provide clarity. One of the most authoritative sources on climate change is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They publish comprehensive assessments every few years, compiling the latest scientific findings.

Maybe I should search for their latest report or summaries to see what they say about the human influence on climate change.

The new IPCC climate report is hugely important — and here are 6 main takeaways

Earth has warmed 1.09℃ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The report also found that escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth and every facet of the weather.
The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November.
The IPCC is the climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization, and it is the global authority on the state of Earth’s climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment.
Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today — but there is still time to avert the worst damage if humanity chooses to. Here are six takeaways from the report:
1. It’s unequivocal: Humans are warming the planet
For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally — leaving absolutely no room for doubt — humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans.
The IPCC finds Earth’s global surface temperature warmed 1.09℃ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29℃ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1℃ of the increase is due to data improvements.)
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years.
The IPCC recognizes the role of natural changes to the Earth’s climate. However, it finds 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities.
In other words, pretty much all global warming is due to humans.
Global surface temperature has warmed faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2,000 years, with the warming also reaching ocean depths below 2,000 meters.
The IPCC says human activities have also affected global precipitation (rain and snow). Since 1950, total global precipitation has increased, but while some regions have become wetter, others have become drier.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over most land areas. This is because the warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture — about seven percent more for each additional degree of temperature — which makes wet seasons and rainfall events wetter.
2. CO2 levels are rising faster than ever
Present-day global concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are higher and rising faster than at any time in at least the past two million years.
The speed at which atmospheric CO2 has increased since the industrial revolution (1750) is at least 10 times faster than at any other time during the last 800,000 years and between 4 and 5 times faster than during the last 56 million years.
About 85% of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels.
About 85 percent of CO2 emissions are from burning fossil fuels. The remaining 15 percent are generated from land-use change, such as deforestation and degradation.
Concentrations of other greenhouse gases are not doing any better. Both methane and nitrous oxide, the second- and third- biggest contributors to global warming after CO2, have also increased more quickly. Methane emissions from human activities largely come from livestock and the fossil fuel industry. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the use of nitrogen fertilizer on crops.
3. Extreme weather is on the rise
Hot extremes, heatwaves and heavy rain have also become more frequent and intense across most land regions since 1950, the IPCC confirms.
The report highlights that some recently observed hot extremes, such as the Australian summer of 2012–2013, would have been extremely unlikely without human influence on the climate.
Human influence has also been detected for the first time in compounded extreme events. For example, incidences of heatwaves, droughts and fire weather happening at the same time are now more frequent. These compound events have been seen in Australia, Southern Europe, Northern Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and African tropical forests.
Even if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia.
4. Our oceans are getting hotter, higher and more acidic
Oceans absorb 91 percent of the energy from the increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. This has led to ocean warming and more marine heatwaves, particularly over the past 15 years.
Marine heatwaves cause the mass death of marine life, such as from coral bleaching events. They also cause algal blooms and shifts in the composition of species. Even if the world restricts warming to 1.5-2℃, as is consistent with the Paris Agreement, marine heatwaves will become four times more frequent by the end of the century.
Melting ice sheets and glaciers, along with the expansion of the ocean as it warms, have led to a global mean sea level increase of 0.2 meters between 1901 and 2018. But, importantly, the speed that the sea level is rising is accelerating: 1.3 millimeters per year during 1901-1971, 1.9mm per year during 1971-2006, and 3.7mm per year during 2006-2018.
Ocean acidification, caused by the uptake of CO2, has occurred in the overall oceans and is reaching depths beyond 2,000 meters in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic.
5. Many changes are already irreversible
The IPCC says if Earth’s climate was stabilized soon, some climate change-induced damage could not be reversed within centuries or even millennia. For example, global warming of 2℃ this century will lead to an average global sea-level rise of between two and six meters over 2,000 years — and much more for higher emission scenarios.
Globally, glaciers have been synchronously retreating since 1950 and are projected to continue to melt for decades after the global temperature is stabilized. Meanwhile, the acidification of the deep ocean will remain for thousands of years after CO2 emissions cease.
Global warming stays below 2°C during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The report does not identify any possible abrupt changes that would lead to an acceleration of global warming during this century — but does not rule out such possibilities.
The prospect of permafrost (frozen soils) in Alaska, Canada, and Russia crossing a tipping point has been widely discussed. The concern is that as frozen ground thaws, large amounts of carbon accumulated over thousands of years from dead plants and animals could be released as they decompose.
The report does not identify any globally significant abrupt change in these regions over this century, based on currently available evidence. However, it projects permafrost areas will release about 66 billion metric tonnes of CO2 for each additional degree of warming, and these emissions are irreversible during this century under all warming scenarios.
6. But we can still act and prevent the worst-case scenario
Earth’s surface temperature will continue to increase until at least 2050 under all emissions scenarios considered in the report. The assessment shows Earth could well exceed the 1.5℃ warming limit by the early 2030s.
If we reduce emissions sufficiently, there is only a 50 percent chance global temperature rise will stay around 1.5℃ (including a temporary overshoot of up to 0.1℃). To get Earth back to below 1.5℃ warming, CO2 would need to be removed from the atmosphere using negative emissions technologies or nature-based solutions.
Global warming stays below 2℃ during this century only under scenarios where CO2 emissions reach net-zero around or after 2050.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2°C  … Humanity, however, must choose to act.
The IPCC analyzed future climate projections from dozens of climate models, produced by more than 50 modeling centers around the world. It showed global average surface temperature rises between 1-1.8℃ and 3.3-5.7℃ this century above pre-industrial levels for the lowest and highest emission scenarios, respectively. The exact increase the world experiences will depend on how much more greenhouse gases are emitted.
The report states, with high certainty, that to stabilize the climate, CO2 emissions must reach net zero, and other greenhouse gas emissions must decline significantly.
We also know, for a given temperature target, there’s a finite amount of carbon that we can emit before reaching net-zero emissions. To have a 50:50 chance of halting warming at around 1.5℃, this quantity is about 500 billion metric tonnes of CO2.
At current levels of CO2 emissions this “carbon budget” would be used up within 12 years. Exhausting the budget will take longer if emissions begin to decline.
The IPCC’s latest findings are alarming. But no physical or environmental impediments exist to hold warming to well below 2℃ and limit it to around 1.5℃, the globally agreed goals of the Paris Agreement. Humanity, however, must choose to act.

Humans have caused almost 100% of global warming, says new IPCC report
Climate science has evolved since the last IPCC report released in 2013, and scientists are now confident that human influence has caused climate change as we know it
NEXT NEWS ❯

Published: Tuesday 10 August 2021
The new climate science report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released August 9, 2021 differs from its predecessor on one main account: Scientists are now more confident that human activity has caused climate change than they have been before.
The report, the first instalment of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), has a simple message:
“It is indisputable that human activities are causing climate change, making extreme climate events including heat waves, heavy rainfall, and droughts more frequent and severe.”
There is almost no doubt that most of the observed warming of the planet since the late-1800s is caused by humans.
The report’s technical summary highlights how this confidence has increased with each successive IPCC report: “The evidence for human influence on recent climate change has strengthened progressively from the IPCC second assessment report [in 1995] to the AR5 [in 2013-14] and is even stronger in this assessment, including for regional scales and for extremes.”
This has been possible through advances in climate science and improvements in models and analytical tools. The report outlines some of these advances, saying:
“Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from longer observational datasets, improved palaeo-climate information, stronger warming signal since AR5 (the fifth assessment report) and improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques. Since AR5, the attribution to human influence has become possible across a wider range of climate variables and climatic impact-drivers. New techniques and analyses drawing on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and climate extremes to human influence (high confidence).”
Human activities have warmed the planet at a rate never seen before in the planet’s long history in the past 2,000 years in particular. The IPCC report found that Earth’s global surface temperature warmed by 1.09 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period of 1850-1900.
While natural changes to the Earth’s climate do occur, 1.07℃ of the 1.09℃ warming is due to greenhouse gases associated with human activities. Thus, almost 100 per cent of global warming has been caused by humans.
Human influence is the main driver of hot weather extremes (which have become more frequent and intense since 1950s), and without which these extremes would have been unlikely. The AR6 is virtually certain that human-driven emissions are the main driver of the changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale, and of ocean warming and acidification.
Additionally, the AR6 acknowledges the ability of scientists to now pinpoint how much worse an extreme weather event was made by climate change.
Previously, they could not link a specific event to warmer temperatures caused by human activity. But this is no longer a challenge, as weather attribution studies can now be rapidly produced, as was done by the World Weather Attribution initiative for the North American heatwave in July 2021. It had concluded that the heatwave would be “virtually impossible” without human-driven climate change.

Climate change: IPCC report is 'code red for humanity'

COP26

Human activity is changing the climate in unprecedented and sometimes irreversible ways, a major UN scientific report has said.
The landmark study warns of increasingly extreme heatwaves, droughts and flooding, and a key temperature limit being broken in just over a decade.
The report "is a code red for humanity", says the UN chief.
But scientists say a catastrophe can be avoided if the world acts fast.
There is hope that deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise rising temperatures.
Echoing the scientists' findings, UN Secretary General António Guterres said: "If we combine forces now, we can avert climate catastrophe. But, as today's report makes clear, there is no time for delay and no room for excuses. I count on government leaders and all stakeholders to ensure COP26 is a success."
The sober assessment of our planet's future has been delivered by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of scientists whose findings are endorsed by the world's governments.
Their report is the first major review of the science of climate change since 2013. Its release comes less than three months before a key climate summit in Glasgow known as COP26.

In strong, confident tones, the IPCC's document says "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".
According to Prof Ed Hawkins, from the University of Reading, UK, and one of the report's authors, the scientists cannot be any clearer on this point.
"It is a statement of fact, we cannot be any more certain; it is unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet."
Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization, said: "By using sports terms, one could say the atmosphere has been exposed to doping, which means we have begun observing extremes more often than before."
The authors say that since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2,000 years.
This warming is "already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe".
Whether it's heatwaves like the ones recently experienced in Greece and western North America, or floods like those in Germany and China, "their attribution to human influence has strengthened" over the past decade.
IPCC report key points
Global surface temperature was 1.09C higher in the decade between 2011-2020 than between 1850-1900.
The past five years have been the hottest on record since 1850
The recent rate of sea level rise has nearly tripled compared with 1901-1971
Human influence is "very likely" (90%) the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea-ice
It is "virtually certain" that hot extremes including heatwaves have become more frequent and more intense since the 1950s, while cold events have become less frequent and less severe
The new report also makes clear that the warming we've experienced to date has made changes to many of our planetary support systems that are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.
The oceans will continue to warm and become more acidic. Mountain and polar glaciers will continue melting for decades or centuries.
"The consequences will continue to get worse for every bit of warming," said Prof Hawkins.
"And for many of these consequences, there's no going back."

When it comes to sea level rise, the scientists have modelled a likely range for different levels of emissions.
However, a rise of around 2m by the end of this century cannot be ruled out - and neither can a 5m rise by 2150.
Such outcomes, while unlikely, would threaten many millions more people in coastal areas with flooding by 2100.
One key aspect of the report is the expected rate of temperature rise and what it means for the safety of humanity.

The authors believe that 1.5C will be reached by 2040 in all scenarios. If emissions aren't slashed in the next few years, this will happen even earlier.
This was predicted in the IPCC's special report on 1.5C in 2018 and this new study now confirms it.
"We will hit one-and-a-half degrees in individual years much earlier. We already hit it in two months during the El Niño in 2016," said Prof Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC author from the University of Melbourne in Australia.
"The new report's best estimate is the middle of 2034, but the uncertainty is huge and ranges between now and never."

"We will see even more intense and more frequent heatwaves," said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the IPCC report's authors.
"And we will also see an increase in heavy rainfall events on a global scale, and also increases in some types of droughts in some regions of the world."
Sea levels will continue to rise for centuries, warns climate scientist Prof Ed Hawkins.
Prof Carolina Vera, vice-chair of the working group that produced the document, said: "The report clearly shows that we are already living the consequences of climate change everywhere. But we will experience further and concurrent changes that increase with every additional beat of warming."
So what can be done?
While this report is more clear and confident about the downsides to warming, the scientists are more hopeful that if we can cut global emissions in half by 2030 and reach net zero by the middle of this century, we can halt and possibly reverse the rise in temperatures.
Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible using clean technology, then burying any remaining releases using carbon capture and storage, or absorbing them by planting trees.
"The thought before was that we could get increasing temperatures even after net zero," said another co-author, Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds, UK.
"But we now expect nature to be kind to us and if we are able to achieve net zero, we hopefully won't get any further temperature increase; and if we are able to achieve net zero greenhouse gases, we should eventually be able to reverse some of that temperature increase and get some cooling."
Five future impacts
Temperatures will reach 1.5C above 1850-1900 levels by 2040 under all emissions scenarios
The Arctic is likely to be practically ice-free in September at least once before 2050 in all scenarios assessed
There will be an increasing occurrence of some extreme events "unprecedented in the historical record" even at warming of 1.5C
Extreme sea level events that occurred once a century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of tidal gauge locations by 2100
There will be likely increases in fire weather in many regions
While the future projections of warming are clearer than ever in this report, and many impacts simply cannot be avoided, the authors caution against fatalism.
"Lowering global warming really minimises the likelihood of hitting these tipping points," said Dr Otto. "We are not doomed."
A tipping point refers to when part of the Earth's climate system undergoes an abrupt change in response to continued warming.
For political leaders, the report is another in a long line of wake-up calls, but since it comes so close to November's COP26 global climate summit, it carries extra weight.

New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet

New U.N. report: Humans responsible for climate change

A United Nations panel has released the first part of its much-anticipated six-year update on the state of climate change. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says there is 95 percent certainty that humans have caused most of the warming of the planet's surface that has occurred since the 1950s — up from 90 percent certainty in the last assessment report, which came out in 2007.
The report draws from many independent scientific analyses of climate change, which use direct observations of Earth’s climate, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models.
Other key findings include:
Today carbon dioxide is at an "unprecedented" level not seen for at least the last 800,000 years.
Sea level is set to continue to rise at a faster rate than over the past 40 years. Waters are expected to rise by between 26 cm (10 inches) at the low end and 82 cm (30 inches) at the high end.
There is "high confidence" that over the last two decades the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been melting, glaciers have receded in most parts of the world, and Arctic sea ice has continued to shrink in terms of extent.
Many of the changes seen in our climate since the 1950s are "unprecedented over decades to millennia."
The IPCC issued its "Summary for Policymakers" as part of the "Physical Science Basis of Climate Change" section of the report in Stockholm on Friday, and will release the full text of that section on Monday, Sept. 30, on the IPCC website (http://www.ipcc.ch/ ). Additional sections will be released in the coming months, providing a comprehensive summary of the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change.
More than 25 NASA scientists helped author and review the Fifth Assessment Report. The report is the work of a total of 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries, and over 600 contributing authors from 32 countries.

Okay, so from these articles, it's clear that the IPCC has released a report that attributes the majority of global warming to human activities. According to the report, it's "unequivocal" that humans are causing the warming of the atmosphere, lands, and oceans. The report states that 1.07°C of the 1.09°C warming observed since the pre-industrial era is due to greenhouse gases from human activities, meaning almost all of it is human-caused.

The report also mentions that human influence is the main driver of extreme weather events like heatwaves and heavy rainfall, which have become more frequent and intense since the 1950s. Additionally, it highlights that many changes, such as sea-level rise and glacier melting, are irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.

Looking back at the 2013 IPCC report, there was already a high level of confidence—90%—that humans were the main cause of global warming since the mid-20th century. This new report increases that confidence to 95%, reflecting even greater certainty based on more recent data and improved models.

Moreover, the report emphasizes that if we don't act quickly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we're likely to exceed the 1.5°C warming limit in the near future, leading to even more severe consequences.

So, to answer the question directly: yes, humans are causing climate change, and the scientific consensus on this is very strong, as evidenced by the IPCC reports and the articles I've read.

But just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any credible scientific arguments against this conclusion. I recall that there are climate skeptics or deniers who question the human role in climate change, often pointing to natural climate variability or flaws in climate models. However, these views are not supported by the vast majority of climate scientists and are often based on cherry-picked data or misunderstanding of climate science.

For instance, some skeptics argue that natural factors like solar activity or volcanic eruptions could be driving climate change, but the IPCC report acknowledges these factors and concludes that their influence is minimal compared to human activities.

Another common skeptic argument is that the Earth has experienced climate changes in the past, so the current warming must also be natural. While it's true that the Earth's climate has changed in the past due to natural causes, the current rate of warming is unprecedented in the context of the last thousands of years, and the fingerprints of human activities are clearly visible in the types of gases accumulating in the atmosphere and in the patterns of warming observed.

Furthermore, the consensus among climate scientists is overwhelmingly in favor of the human cause of climate change. Studies have shown that over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are causing global warming. This consensus is based on multiple lines of evidence, including the correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature records, the isotopic signature of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the failure of natural-only climate models to reproduce the observed warming.

Given this, it's reasonable to conclude that humans are indeed causing climate change, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its impacts.

However, I should also consider that scientific understanding is always evolving, and new evidence may emerge in the future that could potentially alter our understanding. But based on the current state of knowledge and the consensus among experts, the conclusion is clear: human activities are the primary cause of the current climate change.

In summary, the answer to the question "Do humans cause climate change?" is yes, humans are causing climate change, and this is supported by a wealth of scientific evidence and the consensus view of the international scientific community.
