I'm trying to understand why dispensationalists are considered politically powerful. I don't know much about dispensationalism, so I need to start by understanding what it is.

First, I need to know what dispensationalism is. It seems like it's a religious belief system, probably within Christianity. I think it has something to do with interpreting the Bible in a particular way, especially regarding prophecy and Israel.

Let me try to look this up to get a clearer picture.

What Is Dispensationalism? - The Seminary Student
What Is Dispensationalism?

Resources, Study Help
Dispensationalism is an hermeneutical framework which, while not entirely modern, has been defined and promulgated most sharply since the 19th Century. It has strong links to premillennialism — that is, dispensationalists are premillennialists, but not all premillennialists are dispensationalists — and is uniquely Protestant.
Often set against Covenant Theology, Dispensationalism stands out for its literal hermeneutic, commitment to the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture, and its doctrine of Israel and the Church. It is understood in a typical breakdown of salvation history into seven dispensations, or eras, in which God deals with humanity’s sin and responsibility in different ways, culminating in the return and final victory of Christ.

A Brief History of Dispensationalism
In the mid-1800s, John Nelson Darby (an Anglo-Irish Plymouth Brethren church planter, missionary, Bible translator, scholar, Bible commentator, hymn writer) began teaching and defining his unique views on eschatology and ecclesiology. He widely traveled and taught, but his theology took root in the United States through the likes of D. L. Moody, and particularly Cyrus Scofield, who published his Scofield Reference Bible in 1909.
Scofield’s dispensationalism, written about extensively in the Scofield Reference Bible’s vast commentary sections, seemed nearly prescient to an American readership on the cusp of World Wars I and II, and the dispensationalist system, where Scripture is read and understood within seven dispensations of how God interacts with humanity, became increasingly popular and relevant to a populace who was beginning to ask questions about the end of the world.
Far from being sensationalist at the time (though today we cannot say the same), it seems to have provided much-needed comfort and clarity to an alarmed and confused country, whether the modern reader agrees with its propositions or not. Many view 1948 as one of the major moments in the history of Dispensationalism, when the State of Israel was re-established.
By then, Dispensationalists (who view Israel and the Church as distinct entities, with different divine promises) had long been waiting for what they understood as a prophecy that Israel would be established as a nation before being grafted back in, and experiencing a mass turning to the Lord. While this did much to establish the validity of Dispensationalism in the eyes of many, it also seems to have coincided with an increase of sensationalism and abuse of the system, resulting in bogus Second Coming predictions and alarmist theology.
But far from being defined by these claims, today such academic heavy-hitters as John MacArthur, Norman Geisler, and Darrell Bock teach and adhere to Dispensationalism, but would distance themselves (rightly so) from false end-times predictions, and the unfortunate fallout from such works as the Left Behind series by LaHaye and Jenkins. And many of the afore-mentioned, well-grounded scholars (if not all of them) believe that the re-establishment of the state in 1948 was not a redeemed ingathering of Israel; that ultimate regathering will happen at the return of Christ.
Basic Tenets of Dispensationalism
Most Dispensationalists agree on seven main dispensations:
Innocence (pre-Fall)
Conscience (Fall–Noah)
Government (Noah–Abraham)
Promise (Abraham–Moses)
Mosaic Law (Moses–Christ)
Grace (current age)
Millennial Kingdom (1,000 year earthly reign of Christ, yet to come)
Each of these dispensations is marked by a particular way that God holds humans accountable for their sins, according to the revelation given them at the time. As revelation progresses or grows, so does man’s responsibility. In Dispensationalism, we are essentially held accountable only for that which has been revealed to us.
Yet because this revelation is progressive, throughout salvation history each dispensation builds on what came before, and deepens our understanding. Chief among the distinctive aspects of Dispensationalism are its doctrines of Israel and the Church. This framework views Israel and the New Testament church as distinct and separate entities; the promises of God to Israel in the Old Testament by no means are fulfilled in the church.
As a result, Israel must be re-established nationally, and must turn to the Lord, when he will fulfill his promises to them literally, in the last days. Thus, Dispensationalist eschatology centers geographically around Israel. Today, much of this doctrine can be seen worked out politically in a strong Christian base of support for the people and nation of Israel, and the insistence on maintaining Israel as a close ally.
Dispensationalism is premillennial in its eschatology, though Darby is often credited as the father of pre-tribulation rapture eschatology. In this system, Christ will return, raise the saved from the dead, and rapture them away from Earth, thus beginning the seven years of tribulation.
This period of tribulation—during which time some may still choose to know the Lord and be saved—culminates in the Battle of Armageddon. Christ will return again to decisively and glorious end the battle, and begin his literal 1,000 year reign on Earth.

“The unity of divine revelation, of the various dispensations, is found in the goal of history, the kingdom of God. And since this kingdom is centered in the person and work of Jesus Christ, the dispensational unity of Scripture and of history is Christological as much as it is eschatological.”

Why Dr. Michael Windsor is a Dispensationalist
The following is re-published with permission from Virginia Beach Theological Seminary’s monthly e-bulletin. Dr. Michael Windsor is Professor of Church History at Virginia Beach Theological Seminary, and contributed this piece titled “Why I Am a Dispensationalist” to the editorial section Truth for the Agora in September, 2018.
I am a dispensationalist in my theological conclusions — not because I carried a Scofield Reference Bible to church as an 18 year-old, nor because the man that led me to Christ was a dispensationalist, nor because I attended a dispensational seminary for my theological education. Each of the preceding factors encouraged me along the way, but they were not decisive. Let me share three concepts that cause me to see dispensational contours in the pages of Scripture. Progressive revelation. God gave revelation over the course of time. When looking at the progress of revelation, we find that at times, God chose to alter His relationship to mankind. This divinely chosen adjustment of mankind’s relationship to God, rooted in divine revelation, we call dispensationalism. The word for dispensation is oikonomia. The word implies a management of a home environment or a stewardship. God grants a stewardship of life to men and women grounded in the boundaries of His revelation. This is what Paul meant when he wrote “of the dispensation of the grace of God” and how God “by revelation . . . made known to me the mystery” so that Christians can “read” and “understand” what God was doing (Eph. 3:2–4). God gave revelation in order to adjust mankind’s relationship to Himself and His work. Dispensational interpreters are endeavoring to understand Biblical history marked by God’s revelatory transitions. Hermeneutics. A dispensational reader of Scripture consistently uses a normative approach for all of Scripture. The difference between a dispensational hermeneutic and a non-dispensational hermeneutic can be illustrated in Isaiah 11. Note how each approaches the three sections of this passage. Both hermeneutic approaches take the first 5 verses literally, understanding that the Messiah will come from the stem of Jesse (11:1), will have the Spirit rest upon Him (11:2), will judge with righteousness (11:4), and will be faithful in all he does (11:5). In verses 6–10, non-dispensationalists are divided; some join the dispensational reader’s conclusion and accept Isaiah’s promise as literal realities of the future kingdom, while others view the paragraph as allegorical blessings for the church. In verses 11–16, non-dispensationalist readers usually agree that these verses should be rendered in a more allegorical sense. Dispensational readers, on the other hand, accept Isaiah’s promise as the literal reunification of Israel and its regathering in the Holy Land during the coming kingdom. In short, the dispensational hermeneutic maintains the same normative hermeneutic throughout Chapter 11, while the non- dispensationalist struggles whether or not to adopt a figurative hermeneutic after verse 5. Since consistency ought to be the norm for the interpreter, the dispensational approach seems most satisfying. Church and Israel. As a dispensationalist, I recognize an exegetical distinction between the Church and Israel. Scriptures may use similar imagery for both Israel and the Church, but the Scriptures never identify the Church as Israel. Both spiritual communities may share similar features because they both relate to the same God. For example, Peter exhorted Christians to be holy because God is holy (1 Pet. 1:15), just as Moses earlier exhorted the people of Israel to the same spiritual state (Lev. 11:45). Holiness was expected of a person walking with God, whether that person was an OT saint or NT saint. Recognizing the distinction between these two spiritual communities leads me to see distinctions in their eschatological destinies. When Jesus returns in His Second Advent, He will establish the Kingdom of God on earth. The nation of Israel will be regathered in the Holy Land and the Church will reign with the King. Having been in the ministry for over 40 years, I can say that following the dispensational contours of God’s progress of revelation has allowed me to appreciate what God has accomplished in the OT and will yet accomplish under his New Covenant. I treasure the Scriptures as being directly from the mind of God to the heart of mankind. Therefore, I want to know exactly what God says and what he means by what he says—there is no greater joy!

Question
What is dispensationalism and is it biblical?
Answer
A dispensation is a way of ordering things—an administration, a system, or a management. In theology, a dispensation is the divine administration of a period of time; each dispensation is a divinely appointed age. Dispensationalism is a theological system that recognizes these ages ordained by God to order the affairs of the world. Dispensationalism has two primary distinctives: 1) a consistently literal interpretation of Scripture, especially Bible prophecy, and 2) a view of the uniqueness of Israel as separate from the Church in God’s program. Classical dispensationalism identifies seven dispensations in God’s plan for humanity.
Dispensationalists hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible as the best hermeneutic. The literal interpretation gives each word the meaning it would commonly have in everyday usage. Allowances are made for symbols, figures of speech, and types, of course. It is understood that even symbols and figurative sayings have literal meanings behind them. So, for example, when the Bible speaks of “a thousand years” in Revelation 20, dispensationalists interpret it as a literal period of 1,000 years (the dispensation of the Kingdom), since there is no compelling reason to interpret it otherwise.
There are at least two reasons why literalism is the best way to view Scripture. First, philosophically, the purpose of language itself requires that we interpret words literally. Language was given by God for the purpose of being able to communicate. Words are vessels of meaning. The second reason is biblical. Every prophecy about Jesus Christ in the Old Testament was fulfilled literally. Jesus’ birth, ministry, death, and resurrection all occurred exactly as the Old Testament predicted. The prophecies were literal. There is no non-literal fulfillment of messianic prophecies in the New Testament. This argues strongly for the literal method. If a literal interpretation is not used in studying the Scriptures, there is no objective standard by which to understand the Bible. Each person would be able to interpret the Bible as he saw fit. Biblical interpretation would devolve into “what this passage says to me” instead of “the Bible says.” Sadly, this is already the case in much of what is called Bible study today.
Dispensational theology teaches that there are two distinct peoples of God: Israel and the Church. Dispensationalists believe that salvation has always been by grace through faith alone—in God in the Old Testament and specifically in God the Son in the New Testament. Dispensationalists hold that the Church has not replaced Israel in God’s program and that the Old Testament promises to Israel have not been transferred to the Church. Dispensationalism teaches that the promises God made to Israel in the Old Testament (for land, many descendants, and blessings) will be ultimately fulfilled in the 1000-year period spoken of in Revelation 20. Dispensationalists believe that, just as God is in this age focusing His attention on the Church, He will again in the future focus His attention on Israel (see Romans 9–11 and Daniel 9:24 ).
Dispensationalists understand the Bible to be organized into seven dispensations: Innocence (Genesis 1:1—3:7 ), Conscience (Genesis 3:8—8:22 ), Human Government (Genesis 9:1—11:32 ), Promise (Genesis 12:1 — Exodus 19:25 ), Law (Exodus 20:1 — Acts 2:4 ), Grace (Acts 2:4 — Revelation 20:3 ), and the Millennial Kingdom (Revelation 20:4–6 ). Again, these dispensations are not paths to salvation, but manners in which God relates to man. Each dispensation includes a recognizable pattern of how God worked with people living in the dispensation. That pattern is 1) a responsibility, 2) a failure, 3) a judgment, and 4) grace to move on.
Dispensationalism, as a system, results in a premillennial interpretation of Christ’s second coming and usually a pretribulational interpretation of the rapture. To summarize, dispensationalism is a theological system that emphasizes the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy, recognizes a distinction between Israel and the Church, and organizes the Bible into different dispensations or administrations.

In Evangelical Christian theology, progressive dispensationalism is a variation of traditional dispensationalism.[1] All dispensationalists view the dispensations as chronologically successive.  Progressive dispensationalists, in addition to viewing the dispensations as chronologically successive, also view the dispensations as progressive stages in salvation history. [2] The term "progressive" comes from the concept of an interrelationship or progression between the dispensations. Progressive dispensationalism is not related to any social or political use of the term progressive, such as progressive Christianity .

Development[edit]
While elements of progressive dispensational views were present in earlier dispensational writers, including Scofield and Eric Sauer, the view itself coalesced around specific issues and questions raised in the 1980s. Numerous dispensational scholars came to a rough consensus and in the early 1990s produced three main books articulating progressive dispensationalist views. [3] [4] [5] Consequently, the editors and authors of the books - Craig A. Blaising, Darrell L. Bock, and Robert L. Saucy — are considered the primary spokespersons for progressive dispensationalism.
Comparison with traditional dispensationalism[edit]
Progressive and traditional dispensationalists hold to many common beliefs, including views that are uniquely dispensational. The vast majority of adherents in both schools hold to a distinction between Israel and the Church,[6] a future pre- tribulationrapture,[7] a seven-year tribulation, and a Millennial Kingdom [8] in which the rule of Jesus Christ will be centered in Jerusalem. Progressive dispensationalists tend to de-emphasize the pre-tribulation rapture doctrine, and some lean toward the post-tribulation rapture position.
The major difference between traditional and progressive dispensationalism is in how each views the relationship of the present dispensation to the past and future dispensations. Traditional dispensationalists perceive the present age of grace to be a "parenthesis" or "intercalation" God's plans.[9] In general, the concept means God's revealed plans concerning Israel from the previous dispensation has been "put on hold" until it resumes again after the rapture.
"Progressive" relationship between the covenants[edit]
Progressive dispensationalists perceive a closer relationship between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant than do most traditional dispensationalists. One of the covenants which highlight the differences between the two views is the New Covenant. In the past, dispensationalists have had a variety of views with regard to the new covenant. Some dispensationalists, including Charles Ryrie and John F. Walvoord in the 1950s, argued for two new covenants: one new covenant for the Church and another new covenant for Israel. Other dispensationalists, including John Nelson Darby and John Master, argued for one new covenant applied only to Israel. And still other dispensationalists, including Cyrus I. Scofield and John McGahey in the 1950s, have argued for one new covenant for a believing Israel today and an ongoing partial fulfillment, and another new covenant for a future believing Israel when Jesus returns for a complete fulfillment.
Progressive dispensationalists, like Blaising and Bock, argue for one new covenant with an ongoing partial fulfillment and a future complete fulfillment for Israel. Progressives hold that the new covenant was inaugurated by Christ at the Last Supper. Progressives hold that while there are aspects of the new covenant currently being fulfilled, there is yet to be a final and complete fulfillment of the new covenant in the future. This concept is sometimes referred to as an "already-but-not-yet" fulfillment.
Hermeneutics[edit]
Both traditional and progressive dispensationalists share the same historical-grammatical method. As with all dispensationalists, progressive revelation is emphasized so that the dispensationalist interprets the Old Testament in such a way as to retain the original meaning and audience. Thus progressives and traditionalists alike place great emphasis on the original meaning and audience of the text. The primary differences in hermeneutics between traditionalists and progressives are that progressives are more apt to see partial or ongoing fulfillment, and progressives are more apt to utilize complementary hermeneutics.
These differences between traditionalists and progressives show up in how one views the Old Testament texts and promises in the New Testament and how they are handled by the New Testament writers. For traditionalists, who perceive the present dispensation as a parenthesis, the standard approach has been to view Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as applications rather than fulfillment. If an Old Testament quotation is said to have a fulfillment role in the New Testament (outside of the gospels), then that may imply that the present dispensation is no longer a parenthesis, but has a relationship or connection with the prior dispensation. In contrast, progressives, instead of approaching all Old Testament quotations in the New Testament as application, attempt to take into account the context and grammatical-historical features of both Old Testament and New Testament texts. An Old Testament quote in the New Testament might turn out to be an application, but it also might be a partial fulfillment or a complete fulfillment or even something else.
As a framework for biblical interpretation, covenant theology stands in contrast to dispensationalism in regard to the relationship between the Old Covenant with national Israel and the New Covenant in Christ's blood .
Complementary hermeneutics[edit]
Complementary hermeneutics means that previous revelation (such as the Old Testament) has an added or expanded meaning alongside the original meaning. For example, in Jeremiah 31:31–34, the original recipients of the new covenant were Jews—i.e., "the house of Israel and the house of Judah ." Progressives hold that in Acts 2, believing Jews first participated in the new covenant based on Jer 31:31–34. Gentiles were not named as original participants. However, additional revelation came in Acts 9–10 concerning believing Gentiles where God (through Peter and Cornelius) formally accepted believing Gentiles as co-heirs with the Jews. In other words, God used additional New Testament revelation to further expand the participants of the new covenant to include believing Gentiles. God did not replace the original recipients or change the original meaning of the new covenant, He simply expanded it. This expansion of meaning while keeping the original intact is what is called complementary hermeneutics.
Charles Ryrie[edit]
Charles Ryrie had also laid less stress on the parenthetical nature of the age of the Church. The restatement of the "parenthesis" comes from the nature of the Church as the mystery, previously not known and now revealed, that Jews and Gentiles are united in one body (Eph. 3:1-7). Although Ryrie opposed some of the tenets of progressive dispensationalism, he also advanced in the late 1970s, many years prior to the progressive movement, something very similar to complementary hermeneutics, particularly in his interpretation of the new covenant which he held was one new covenant that had successive (complementary?) applications to different groups of believers. In other parts of the world, outside of the United States, dispensationalists had also laid a strong emphasis on the present aspect of the Kingdom of God (cp. Other revisionist, like Emilio Antonio Núñez, in Guatemala, who was also a theological heir of Ryrie).

SHOCKING FACTS ABOUT
DISPENSATIONALISM
(How Did This Doctrine Ever Make It?)
Michael F. Blume

When a doctrine has been around
just long enough and becomes popular,
its momentum carries itself onward for many years to come.  We
can think of some denominational traditions that are found no where in
the Bible that have simply been around so long and have become so 
ingrained within their followers that you simply cannot jar the people
out of adherence to them.  The tradition's sheer popularity
alone keeps it going without any need for biblical basis in many
people's minds.  In my opinion, this is precisely the case
with the doctrine of Dispensationalism.
WHAT
IS DISPENSATIONALISM?
Briefly, the doctrine of Dispensationalsm can be summed as
follows:  God has dispensed several covenants in the earth
beginning with the simple command to Adam to not eat of the forbidden
fruit in the garden.  Each dispensation ends with a judgment
before God gives to man the next covenant.  The teaching
claims there are to be seven such dispensations before the end of the
world occurs.  We are allegedly in the sixth dispensation
called Grace, and this will be followed by one more called the Kingdom
Dispensation, or the Millennial reign of Christ.  It became
popular during the 1800s and early 1900s and is held today by many
conservative Protestants.
The teaching takes the 70 Weeks of Daniel, in Daniel chapter 9, and
inserts an unbiblical gap of centuries between the 69th week and the
70th week in which the church age allegedly occurs.  During
the 70th week of Daniel, God will deal specifically with the nation of
Israel to bring it to national salvation.  In this national salvation, Israelites who have
faith in Jesus Christ during that time will inherit the promised
Theocratic Kingdom and the alleged unconditional Covenants God made
with Israel. Israel will fulfill its role as the Theocratic Covenanted
Kingdom promised to the nation in Old Testament prophecy.
The dispensations are listed as follows:
the
dispensation of Innocence (Gen 1:1–3:7), prior to Adam's fall,
of
Conscience (Gen 3:8–8:22), Adam to Noah,
of
Government (Gen 9:1–11:32), Noah to Abraham,
of
Patriarchal Rule (Gen 12:1–Exod 19:25), Abraham to Moses,
of
the Mosaic Law (Exod 20:1–Acts 2:4), Moses to Christ,
of
Grace (Acts 2:4–Rev 20:3 – except for
Hyperdispensationalists and Ultradispensationalists), the current
church age.
of
a literal, earthly 1,000-year Millennial Kingdom that has yet to come.
(Rev 20:4–20:6).
THEY
TEACH THE KINGDOM WAS POSTPONED BY THE CROSS
The word "dispensation" is used in the bible four times (1 Cor. 9:17;
Eph. 1:10; 3:2; Col. 1:25).  It is not used to describe seven
dispensations, though, and it simply means a stewardship and
administration given to people.  It is true that the
dispensations listed in the teaching actually did occur, except for the last one, the Millennial Kingdom, which I claim will never occur.  That is bad enough, but the larger problem is the
elements of the teaching that claim God is working with Israel and the
Church in this sixth dispensation they call "Grace", at the same
time.  The bible simply does not teach this.  The
idea is that God has inserted the Church into the overall work of God
in the world due to Israel's rejection of Jesus Christ.  It is
said that the Kingdom of God that Jesus claimed was at hand during His
ministry on earth was postponed, since Israel did not accept
Him.  This caused God to turn towards the Gentile world and
call a Church out of the world for His name's sake during the period
when Israel is blinded by God due to their rejection of the
Lord.  The Kingdom will again come into view after the
"Gentile Church" is raptured out of the world and a seven year
tribulation period begins, says the doctrine.  This seven year
period is the seven last years of the dispensation of Grace, and will
see the judgment that has faithfully occurred at the end of every
preceding dispensation, before the last and final Dispensation occurs
with the Millennium's one thousand year reign of Jesus. 
Israel will once again be in the forefront, having accepted Jesus
Christ by this point, and the Kingdom will finally be placed in the
world as God intended to be thousands of years earlier before Jesus
died on the cross.
First of all, this doctrine implies God's plan failed, and a secondary
Plan B, so to speak, had to occur with the involvement of the
Church.  This makes the cross a Plan B that should never have
taken place.  If Israel had accepted Christ as God planned,
they would never have crucified the Lord!  So it makes the
cross something that was not supposed to occur after the fall of Adam
and Eve in the Garden.  However, the Bible teaches that the
work of the cross was planned by God before the world even began
(Revelation 13:8; 1 Peter 1:19-20)!  That means it could not
have been a backup plan to occur in case the primary plan of God
failed.  How would God have redeemed mankind without the cross
had Israel not rejected Jesus Christ?  It makes no sense to
say the rejection of Jesus Christ by Israel, and the work of the cross
was a plan B.
I recall having first heard this a few short years after I was saved,
and questioning it back then in my early years as a believer! 
Everything I read about the cross in the Bible was indications that God
planned for it to occur, which meant the Jews were intended by God to
reject Jesus Christ and crucify Him.  How could God find need
of postponing the Kingdom of God and see the cross save man from sin if
the only way for redemption is through the shedding of blood (Heb
9:22).  God foreknows the future!  He does not need
to have a Plan B in case Plan A fails!  When you know the
future, there is no room for a Plan B.
During the Church Age in this dispensation of Grace, this doctrine
tells us that God is working with Israel at the same time He is working
with the Church to bring Israel to its land thousands of years after
the cross, and position them for the great tribulation to come in the
final seven years of this dispensation.  Dispensational
preachers have stated that God is readying Israel for a slaughter that
will make the Holocaust look like a picnic!  All of that is
necessary to see Israel get back on track again with God and be ready
to accept Jesus Christ as Messiah in order to usher in the seventh
final dispensation of the Kingdom.
JESUS
AND APOSTLES SAID NOTHING ABOUT DISPENSATIONALISM
As ridiculous as Dispensationalism is in those aspects, there is more
about the teaching that is shocking.  None of the Apostles and
Disciples, of the New Testament early church, and the Lord,
Himself,  said anything about God working with Israel
alongside His work with the Church in this world.  All of this
is assumed and not taken from any direct teaching in the New
Testament.  One dispensationalist told me that the events are
not explicitly stated in the Bible to occur, but the idea "fits" and
does not contradict what God did plainly say in the New Testament that
He would do.  As far as something that might "fit" in between
actual statements that God did say in the Bible, there are a million
and one ideas we can come up with that fit that category. 
However, to say that the teaching does not contradict what is actually
said is incorrect.  It does contradict what the Bible says.
KINGDOM
WILL BE PHYSICAL?
Dispensationalism proposes that Postponed Kingdom will occur in the
Millennium and will consist of a physical throne in Jerusalem, in the
middle east, where Jesus Christ will actually and physically sit in the
earth.  They claim Jesus is not seated as of yet on this
throne, the Throne of David.  Since David sat on his throne on
the earth in Jerusalem, they feel that Jesus cannot be on the throne of
David unless He is on the earth in Jerusalem, as well.  This
is not what the Throne of David is referring to.  The throne
of David is a term used that is very similar to speaking about the House
of David.  David's House in scripture is not talking about the
actual place of his residence where he and his family lived. 
It is speaking about his family, itself.  The Throne of David
is speaking about David's dynasty, not the physical chair on which a
king sits.  Saul lost the throne and it was taken from Saul's
family to David's family.  It was prophesied that every king
after David would be from David's family, hence the throne refers to
David's dynasty.
At any rate, to have a physical kingdom with a physical palace in
Israel during the Millennium contradicts Jesus Christ's own words
concerning the fact that the Kingdom does not come with
observation.  You will never be able to say, "Lo here," or
"Lo, there," for the Kingdom is not physical but is in you (Luke
17:20-21).  So, the Dispensational idea of a physical kingdom
contradicts the words of Jesus Christ!   
Paul also said that the Kingdom of God is righteousness, peace and joy
in the Holy Ghost.  These are inward, spiritual
elements.  The Kingdom is already here, and has been here
since the Day of Pentecost!  When Jesus said it was at hand,
He was not mistaken as though He did not expect the Jews to reject Him
and cause a postponement of that Kingdom.  It was at hand two
thousand years ago, even when Israel rejected Him.
Jesus said that if He casts out devils by the finger of God then we
know the kingdom of God is come (Luke 11:20).
KINGDOM OF HEAVEN NOT THE KINGDOM
OF GOD?
In order to make Dispensationalism "fit", the teachers have to create
the false notion that the Kingdom of Heaven is not the same thing as
the Kingdom of God.  One dispensationalist wrote these words,
"Knowing the doctrinal difference between the terms 'Kingdom of Heaven'
and 'Kingdom of God' is the key to understanding the complete time line
of Biblical history past, present, and future, the proper place of the
Church, and the prophetic future of Israel.".
What he actually meant was that without creating this mistaken
distinction, Dispensationalism does not work.
These teachers agree the "Kingdom of God" is here now in Spiritual
form, but "the Kingdom of Heaven" is going to come after once the
Millennium begins in our future.  The fact is that the two are
one and the same Kingdom!  They are synonyms of the same
Kingdom.  Let me prove it.
"Kingdom of God" occurs 68 times in the New Testament. 
"Kingdom of Heaven" only occurs 10 times.  The Gospel of
Matthew is the only book that uses the term "Kingdom of Heaven".
Dispensationalists come up with all sorts of remarks about
that.  they claim Matthew was written primarily to the Jews,
and deals with Millennium teachings, whereas the other Gospels that
mention the "Kingdom of God" are dealing with the church age. 
They use that same argument to say that the same conversations found in
Matthew 24 and Luke 21 actually contain two different
conversations.  The one in Luke is dealing about events that
transpired in AD70, whereas Matthew 24 is speaking about our future and
not AD70.  If we can see that the Kingdom of God and the
Kingdom of Heaven are one and the same thing, then another leg of
Dispensationalism is taken out from beneath the teaching.
The account of the rich young ruler in Matthew 19 includes Jesus' words
saying, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 19:23).  In the very next verse,
Jesus exchanged the term "Kingdom of God" for "Kingdom of Heaven", and
said this, “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
God.”    He explicitly stated He
repeated Himself when He said, "Again I say unto you."  To use
the term "Kingdom of God" in repetition of His point lets us know the
two phrases are speaking about the same thing.  The Kingdom of
God is nothing different than the Kingdom of Heaven!  The
Kingdom of Heaven is not a Millennial Kingdom that has not yet
come.
Jesus said these words:
Matthew
11:11-12  Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of
women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he.  (12)  And from the days of John the Baptist
until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent
take it by force.
Luke accounted the same statement by Jesus and used these words:
Luke
7:28  For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women
there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
Which makes more reasonable sense?
Those
least in the Kingdom of Heaven, during the Millennial reign, are
greater than John the baptist, as well as a completely different set of
people called the least in the present Kingdom of God.
or
The
two titles are referring to the same Kingdom right now, and those least
in it are greater than John the Baptist.
DISPENSATIONALISM
FAILS "OCCAM'S RAZOR" TEST
There is a rule of logic and reason that fits this question quite
well.  It is called Occam's Razor.  This rule states
that when a person considers the possibilities of different
explanations for the same situation, the explanation that allows for
the least possible assumptions is most likely the correct
one.  In other words, the simplest solution is the best
one.  To claim that the two titles refer to two different
kingdoms, which the Bible does not even plainly state as being two
different Kingdoms, takes a lot of scriptural gymnastics.  But
considering the two titles as referring to the same kingdom right now,
and seeing Jesus actually use the terms synonymously from one verse to
the next, simplifies the thought very much.
GOD'S
KINGDOM WITHOUT A THRONE ON EARTH
Another important point the Bible mentions is that Samuel and God,
Himself, made statements concerning kingdoms that are contradicted by
Dispensationalism.
1
Samuel
8:4-8  Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves
together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah,  (5)  And
said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways:
now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
(6)  But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us
a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
(7)  And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of
the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected
thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over
them.  (8)  According to all the works which they
have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto
this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
they also unto thee.
Israel was already ruled by God in the days of Samuel as
Judge.  In God's rule, there was no palace or
throne.  But God was still ruling.  God's Kingdom did
not have a palace in Israel with a physical throne there. 
Israel wanted to be like other nations and have a king with a palace
and throne.  When Samuel reported this to the Lord, the Lord
told Samuel that they rejected God's Kingdom.  He compared
this rejection of the people with the evils they committed since they
were brought out of Egypt.  Therefore, to think that God wants
a kingdom set up with a palace and physical throne, like other nations
and their kingdoms, is repeating the same error that Israel made in
wanting these things.  It is rejecting the sort of Kingdom God
had before Israel made this blunder.  
Dispensationalism likewise proposes a throne in the middle east on
earth with a palace.  What were they thinking?
In Dispensationalism's efforts to prove that Israel and the Church are
involved in two different simultaneous works of God today, using the
Kingdom of Heaven and Kingdom of God issue again, it proposes that
Matthew 24 was speaking about our future whereas Luke 21 was speaking
about AD70.  These two chapters practically mirror each other
with minor variations that one finds in any story related in more than
one Gospel account.
Matthew and Luke both spoke of the stones
of the temple being overthrown, false Christs, wars, earthquakes and
pestilences, fleeing to the mountains when signs are given, signs in
the sun, moon and stars, etc.  The minor variations include
the thought that when Matthew's account shows the disciples asking
Jesus about the temple, Matthew uses the phrase the "end of the world,"
whereas Luke does not.  Also, Luke's account tells the
disciples to flee to the mountains when Jerusalem is surrounded by
armies, whereas Matthew says they should flee when they see the
abomination of desolation.
However, Dispensationalism breaks
the test of Occam's Razor again, and says that despite the almost
perfect mirroring of the two accounts, Luke is speaking of AD70 and
Matthew is speaking of the future yet to come!  It claims that
the abomination of desolation has nothing to do with Jerusalem
surrounded by armies, and that these two accounts are two totally
different events separated by thousands of years.  The obvious
truth is that the abomination of desolation would occur when Jerusalem
was surrounded by armies, making the signal to flee to the mountains
in both accounts to be one and the same signal.
To say that these minor differences imply two totally different
conversations about two totally different events separated by thousands
of years is ridiculous.  It is like saying that each of the
differences in the Four Gospels means that there are four different
Jesus Christs, and four different crucifixions, because each Gospel
does not have the exact same words describing what was written over
the head of Jesus on the cross!  The minor differences exist
due to the fact that the writers were inspired by the Spirit along with
what they remember the conversations involved, so as to leave us with
different "angles" of the same pictures.
These variations
actually help us narrow down more perfectly what the Lord was referring
to in his conversations.  It is similar to have an accident
occur with two vehicles and talking to four different
witnesses.  One witness focused upon a detail the others did
not see.  Putting them altogether allows us to get a more
perfect picture.  So, rather than concoct the silly
"dispensational" notion that there are two totally different
conversations that coincidentally mirror one another in so many ways
(and jump through all sorts of hoops to come to such a conclusion), we
have the blessing of having more than one account of the single
conversation so as to allow us to more perfectly narrow down what the
issues are actually speaking about!
CLOSEST TWO REFERENCES
ACTUALLY SAY NOTHING ABOUT DISPENSATIONALISM
After having been a dispensationalist, due to having been introduced to
it first before any other interpretation of prophecy, and having
studied personally to conclude the doctrine is incorrect, I have
noticed something.  There are only two small passages in the
entire New Testament that Dispensationalism claims as its strong
points, and neither of them teach dispensationalism
whatsoever.  If those people could realize these are the two
strongest references the teachings has, then the doctrine would never
last another minute.
Acts
1:6 
When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,
Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
Romans
11:25-26  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be
ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits;
that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
Gentiles be come in.  (26)  And so all Israel shall
be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer,
and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
The case of Acts 1:6 has the disciples asking Jesus about something
Jesus did not confirm nor deny.  In fact, Jesus distracted
their attention from such a thought and directed it towards the gift of
the Holy Ghost they would receive in a few days afterwards. 
After this question, not one New Testament   passage
says anything in the Book of Acts and all the epistles, and
Revelation,  about anything to do with Israel receiving a
restored Kingdom.  Not only that, but these people were not
regenerated yet and did not have the Spirit baptism.  Jesus
said He had many things to share with them that they were unable to
handle.  When the Spirit of truth would come, it would guide
them to all truth.  When it did come, none of them
were inspired by the Spirit to mention anything about a restored Kingdom
in Israel.
The passage in Romans 11 is supposed to somehow refer to the coming
rapture of the church, after which Israel shall once again have
attention focused solely upon her.  This attention for some
reason involves the restoration of a physical Kingdom in
Israel.  Well, to put it bluntly, nothing about a rapture or
Kingdom in Israel is even mentioned anywhere around this passage, let
alone those two verses, themselves.  How is the reference to
"the fullness of the gentiles be come in" a reference to the
rapture?   If you read earlier in the same chapter,
the term "fullness" is given to refer to the blessings of God.
Romans
11:11-12  I say then, Have they stumbled that they should
fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto
the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  (12) 
Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing
of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
The fall was speaking of the Jews' fall.  Paul stated that
Israel's disobedience in rejecting Jesus did not put them in an
irrecoverable position away from God's mercy.  Gentiles were
able to come into the commonwealth of Israel's relationship with God
due to their fall.  Paul then asked that if their fall meant
the spiritual riches of the Gentiles, what would the Jews' fullness
mean for the Gentiles?  In other words, if the Gentiles
received such a blessing from God due to Israel's fall, what how much
greater blessing will come to the Gentiles due to the Jew's
fullness?  This fullness refers to the full inclusion of Jews
into the church, and not just a remnant.
Compare:
Romans
11:12  ISV Now if their stumbling means riches for the world,
and if their fall means riches for the gentiles, how much more will
their full inclusion mean!
Romans
11:25-26  ISV  For I do not want you to be ignorant
of this secret, brothers, so that you will not claim to be wiser than
you are. A partial hardening has come on Israel until the full number
of the gentiles has come in.  (26)  In this way, all
Israel will be saved. As it is written, "The Deliverer will come from
Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
The question is when would the full number of Gentiles come in, and
what will that mark as an event?  Dispensationalism proposes
this must refer to the rapture of the church.  The only
problem with that is that it makes the Church Gentile only, while some Dispensationalists admit SOME Jews are saved and in the
church.  Consider closely the fact that this teaching implies
that the Church is understood as Gentile.  The New Testament
never teaches that the Church is Gentile.  In fact it teaches
quite strongly that the church is intended for Jews and Gentiles to be
reconciled to God in one body in Ephesians 2.
The words in Romans 11 actually portray the sense of Jewish inclusion into the church, rather than the church removed so Israel can come to God again.  For Paul to say that the blindness on Israel caused the blessing of salvation to come to the gentiles, and then to ask how much more will the gentiles be blessed when Israel once again comes to God, implies that the gentile element of the church is not removed so Israel can come in.  Somehow the gentile element of the church is blessed with Israel's entrance into the church!  How could the Gentile element of the church be blessed by Israel's entrance if the Gentile element is removed from the earth?
If these verses in Acts 1 and Romans 11 are the strongest passages in
the New Testament for dispensationalism, then the doctrine has an
extremely weak foundation, to say the least!  Neither of them
plainly teach that doctrine whatsoever.  With all these flaws in Dispensationalism, I ask how did this doctrine ever make it?
RDTW

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, I've got some information on dispensationalism now. From what I've read, dispensationalism is a theological system that interprets the Bible through the lens of different time periods or "dispensations" where God interacts with humanity in distinct ways. It seems to be particularly associated with certain interpretations of prophecy and the role of Israel in God's plan.

So, the question is why dispensationalists are politically powerful. I need to connect the dots between this theological viewpoint and political influence.

First, I should understand the core beliefs of dispensationalism. From the search results, it appears that dispensationalism emphasizes a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially regarding prophecy, and maintains a distinction between Israel and the Church. It outlines seven dispensations, each with its own characteristics and God's method of dealing with humanity during that period.

One key aspect seems to be the support for Israel as a nation. Dispensationalists believe in the uniqueness of Israel in God's plan and often advocate for Israel's political and territorial integrity. This aligns with a strong political stance in support of Israel, particularly in the United States where many evangelicals hold dispensational views.

Perhaps this is a significant reason for their political power—they have a cohesive stance on Israel that influences U.S. foreign policy. Many politicians court the evangelical vote, and supporting Israel is a way to appeal to this constituency.

Moreover, dispensationalism gained prominence in the 20th century, especially through figures like Cyrus Scofield and his reference Bible, which popularized these ideas. The influence of dispensationalism in evangelical circles has grown over time, leading to a large voter base that shares similar political views, particularly on issues related to Israel and end-times prophecy.

Another factor could be the engagement of dispensationalists in politics. They might be more active voters or contributors to political causes that align with their beliefs. Their sense of mission and belief in biblical prophecy could motivate them to participate more actively in the political process.

Additionally, dispensationalism often includes a pre-tribulation rapture view, which believes that Christians will be taken up to heaven before a period of tribulation on earth. This belief might influence their political involvement, as they see their time on earth as limited and may feel a urgency to align society with their theological convictions before the anticipated rapture.

Furthermore, dispensationalists might be drawn to certain political parties or candidates who share their views on moral and social issues, such as abortion, marriage, and religious freedom. Their theological framework could shape their worldview in a way that aligns with conservative political platforms.

It's also worth considering that dispensationalism, with its emphasis on biblical prophecy and end-times events, may foster a sense of activism among its adherents. They might feel compelled to engage in politics as a way to hasten or prepare for the fulfillment of prophecies.

In terms of organizational structure, there may be institutions, churches, and media outlets that promote dispensational views and encourage political participation. These structures can mobilize their members effectively during election cycles.

Lastly, the media and public discourse might amplify the voices of dispensationalists, especially in the context of Middle Eastern politics and the ongoing conflict in Israel-Palestine. Their viewpoints are often sought after and can influence public opinion and policy decisions.

In summary, dispensationalists' political power likely stems from their large numbers, their cohesive stance on key issues like Israel, their active engagement in politics, and the alignment of their beliefs with certain political platforms. Their theological convictions drive their political actions and give them a unified voice that can impact elections and policies.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Dispensationalists are politically powerful due to their large numbers, cohesive stances on key issues like Israel, active engagement in politics, and alignment with certain political platforms, all driven by their theological convictions.}} \]
