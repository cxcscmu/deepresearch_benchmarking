So I need to figure out what the short-term causes of World War I were. I know that WWI started in 1914, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact triggers that led to such a large-scale conflict. I remember something about an assassination, but there must be more to it than that. Maybe I should look into the events leading up to the war, focusing on the immediate reasons that set off the chain reaction.

First, I need to understand the difference between short-term and long-term causes. Long-term causes might include things like alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism, which built up over time and created a volatile environment. Short-term causes, on the other hand, are the specific events or incidents that directly precipitated the outbreak of war. So, in this case, I'm looking for those immediate triggers.

I think the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist, was a key short-term cause. This event happened in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. The assassination led to a diplomatic crisis between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, which then drew in their respective allies, eventually leading to the war. But I need to dig deeper to understand how exactly this assassination led to a full-blown world war.

Maybe I should look into the aftermath of the assassination and see what steps Austria-Hungary took. I believe they issued an ultimatum to Serbia with very harsh terms, and Serbia didn't accept all of them, which then led Austria-Hungary to declare war on Serbia. That seems like a direct cause.

But I also need to consider the roles of other countries and their alliances. For example, Russia supported Serbia, so when Austria-Hungary declared war, Russia began to mobilize its troops in support of Serbia. This action then triggered Germany, which was allied with Austria-Hungary, to declare war on Russia. And because Germany saw Russia mobilizing, they maybe felt threatened and decided to act preemptively.

Also, Germany's alliance with Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria might have played a role, but I'm not entirely sure about that. I think Germany's main alliance was with Austria-Hungary and Italy, known as the Triple Alliance. But Italy ended up not joining the Central Powers during the war, which was part of the Triple Alliance.

Furthermore, Britain and France were allied with Russia in the Triple Entente. So, when Germany declared war on Russia, and then perhaps on France as well, Britain might have been drawn into the conflict because of its entanglements with France and Belgium.

Speaking of Belgium, I recall that Germany invaded Belgium as part of its plan to attack France, which brought Britain into the war because of Britain's commitment to Belgian neutrality. So, the invasion of Belgium was another short-term cause that directly involved Britain in the conflict.

Additionally, there were some diplomatic failures and miscalculations among the great powers that escalated the situation. For instance, the ambassadors and leaders misjudged the resolve of other nations or underestimated the scale of the impending conflict.

I should also consider the role of military plans and the Schlieffen Plan in Germany, which called for a quick defeat of France before turning to fight Russia. This plan required swift action and might have pressured Germany to declare war quickly, without exploring other options.

Moreover, there were various crises in the years leading up to 1914, like the Balkan Wars, which increased tensions in the region and set the stage for larger conflicts.

But since I'm focusing on short-term causes, I need to narrow it down to the immediate events that occurred in the months before the war started.

Let me try to outline the sequence of events:

1. Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914.

2. Austria-Hungary issues an ultimatum to Serbia on July 23, 1914.

3. Serbia responds partially accepting the ultimatum on July 25, 1914.

4. Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia on July 28, 1914.

5. Russia begins mobilization in support of Serbia.

6. Germany demands that Russia stops its mobilization, which Russia refuses.

7. Germany declares war on Russia on August 1, 1914.

8. Germany declares war on France on August 3, 1914.

9. Germany invades neutral Belgium, leading to Britain declaring war on Germany on August 4, 1914.

So, these are the key short-term events that led to the outbreak of World War I.

In summary, the short-term causes of WWI were primarily the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the subsequent diplomatic crises and ultimatums between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, the activation of military plans and alliances, and the series of declarations of war that followed, culminating in the invasion of Belgium by Germany and Britain's declaration of war in response.

I think that captures the immediate causes that set off the war. Of course, underlying all of this were the longer-term causes like alliances, militarism, imperialism, and nationalism, which created an environment where such a small spark could lead to a massive conflagration.

But for now, focusing on the short-term causes, it's clear that the assassination was the catalyst, and the rigid alliance systems and military plans turned a local conflict into a worldwide war.

**Final Answer**
