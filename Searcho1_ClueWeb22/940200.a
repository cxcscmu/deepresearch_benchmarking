So I've been thinking about this question: "Should sign language be taught in schools?" It seems like a straightforward question, but there are probably a lot of factors to consider here. I'm not entirely sure where to start, so maybe I should begin by understanding what sign language is and who uses it.

First off, sign language is a visual way of communicating that uses hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language. It's primarily used by deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, but it's also used by hearing people to communicate with them or among themselves in certain situations. I think it's important to note that sign language isn't universal; there are different sign languages in different countries, just like spoken languages.

Now, considering that, maybe teaching sign language in schools could be beneficial for a few reasons. For one, it could promote inclusivity and help bridge the communication gap between hearing and deaf or hard-of-hearing students. If more hearing students knew sign language, it might make it easier for them to interact with their deaf peers, which could lead to a more integrated and supportive school environment.

Additionally, learning a second language is generally recognized as beneficial for cognitive development. Most schools require students to learn a foreign language, and sign language could be another option for those who might find it more interesting or accessible than spoken languages. It could also be a unique skill that sets students apart in college applications or future job opportunities.

On the other hand, there might be some challenges to implementing sign language instruction in schools. For instance, not all schools may have teachers qualified to teach sign language. There might be a need for additional training or hiring of new staff, which could be costly. Also, time is a limited resource in the school curriculum, so adding another subject might mean taking time away from others.

Moreover, since sign language is not as widely used as spoken languages, some might argue that it's not as practical for most students. They might prefer to focus on languages that are more commonly spoken, especially those that are useful for international communication or business.

I also wonder about the accessibility of resources for learning sign language. Are there enough textbooks, online courses, and other materials available to support sign language instruction in schools? If not, developing these resources could be another hurdle.

Perhaps I should look into whether any schools or education systems already include sign language as part of their curriculum. That might give me some insights into the pros and cons based on real-world examples.

Let me try to find some information on that.

Should Sign Language Be Taught At Schools? – The Wrangler
Opinions
Should Sign Language Be Taught At Schools?
Katelyn Ruggles
These are the letters a, s, and l in sign language, which stand for American Sign Language
Katelyn Ruggles, Photojournalist
November 13, 2020
At almost every high school you go to, they always offer the basic languages to learn, commonly ranging from French to Spanish to German. However, one of the most common languages that are not taught in school is not a speaking language, but the language of the unspoken. Sign language is a popular and important language that many people across the world use to communicate, however, it is rarely offered to learn in schools. Here are several reasons why sign language is a valuable language to know, and therefore should be offered as a language to learn.
Considering the number of people in the world that use sign language as communication, it should be important enough and qualified enough to be taught in schools. About 70 million people use sign language worldwide, and of that number, 13% are teenagers over the age of 12 (usahearingcenters.com). Offering sign language in school can allow students and teachers to communicate with their peers that are hearing impaired, and allow them to have an easier and smoother time communicating with others. While explaining her classes, Jenna Roncevich (10) states how she “wanted to learn sign language instead of the languages at the school, but she could not because it was not offered.” It can also provide more job opportunities for teachers that can teach sign language, which can overall help with the economy and unemployment rates.
Not only can sign language be beneficial during school, but it is also a skill that can be useful to know in the future. Having the ability to speak sign language on your resume is a unique feature that can make you stand out amongst others. Many jobs ranging from receptionists in offices to hostesses in restaurants can find sign language a valuable asset to have on a resume as coming across deaf guests who mainly use sign language as communication can be common. Teaching sign language in schools can increase the chances of someone getting a job or into a certain school, just like any other subject taught in schools.
Sign language being offered in schools can also help with socializing and interaction in school. Kids will be able to interact with each other in a new and different way, and can also reach out and interact with kids who are hearing impaired. It is also sensitive to kids with special needs that cannot communicate efficiently using words. Unfortunately, in most schools, kids with special needs are commonly looked over by the other students and do not interact with kids as normally as other students do. Teaching sign language can increase the number of students that reach out and talk to the students with special needs, which can immensely improve these students’ high school experiences and lives.
With the increase of sensitivity to special needs and hearing-impaired students, along with the ability to better interact and communicate with students, sign language should be a given to be taught in high school. Not only can this help with including all students at school, but it can also make many of these students’ lives much better, and their high school days go much smoother. But the benefits do not stop there. Sign language also can be a unique skill to have on resumes, increasing the chances of people getting jobs or getting into schools. Obviously, with the numerous pros, sign language is a valuable asset to have in life that should be more commonly known worldwide, which should start at schools by offering it to be taught as a language option for students to take.

Accredited Online American Sign Language Classes
Several schools offer ASL classes for students wishing to begin learning ASL. Some of these courses can lead to a sign language certificate, and some courses and sign language certificate programs are available in online formats. A few of these online ASL courses are even free to students.
Online ASL courses generally use videos to demonstrate the signs for vocabulary. Some of these courses may also be available at different levels, such as a foundations or intermediate course.
ASL Interpreter Programs
As mentioned, there are ASL Interpreter programs available at the associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels. Some undergraduate degree programs in the field may be available in an online format. Typically, graduate programs focus on interpretation, but also include components of research in the field. There are also graduate programs specially designed for those wishing to teach ASL.
Many interpreter programs include hands-on experiences, such as a practicum or capstone experience, where students can practice using their ASL. Students in ASL interpreter programs may take courses that discuss topics in:
ASL
ASL to English interpreting
English to ASL interpreting
Ethics in interpreting
History of interpreting
Structure of language for interpreting
Transliterating
ASL Certification
Those wanting to become a sign language interpreter generally need to earn ASL certification. Organizations like the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc. (RID), offer certifications to verify an interpreter's skills. Some states even require RID certification to be an interpreter.
Currently, as of 2019, RID offers two main certifications. They have the National Interpreter Certification (NIC) and the Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI). The NIC requires an interview process and the passing of knowledge- and performance-based exams. The CDI also requires a knowledge and performance exam but includes a 40-hour training requirement.

ASL interpreters convert spoken language to sign language and vice versa. These interpreters generally need at least a bachelor's degree and must be fluent in two languages, with one being ASL. Some interpreters may specialize in a particular area of interpreting, such as educational interpreting, medical interpreting, or legal interpreting.
Most ASL interpreters work full-time, but some interpreters may be self-employed and create their own schedules. ASL interpreters work in a wide range of settings, including schools, conference centers, hospitals, courthouses, and businesses.
ASL Interpreter Salary
The BLS reported that the median annual salary for all interpreters and translators was $49,930, as of 2018. Another website, PayScale.com, stated that as of July 2019, the median salary for sign language interpreters was $39,029.

American Sign Language Teachers
Sign language teachers provide instruction in signing, or non-verbal, visual communication, to deaf students and those learning it as a second language. In addition to English, they must be fluent in American Sign Language (ASL), which has its own grammatical structure and incorporates the use of body language, finger spelling, and signing. Sign language teachers need good communication and instructional skills and patience. They should also be able to use a variety of different computer programs, including database user interface and query software and voice recognition software.
Job Duties for those who Teach in Sign Language:
Help Deaf students become more independent
Teach students who are deaf how to function in the hearing world
Create opportunities for non-Deaf students to learn ASL & communicate with Deaf students
Teach both Deaf and hearing students to communicate in ASL
Inspire and challenge Deaf students to be successful and confident
Key Skills for How to Teach ASL:
Native or near-native ASL speaker
Tech savvy to utilize technology in the classroom
Enjoy being around people and able to work as a team
Highly organized and able to multitask
Keen ability to observe development
Active - you won't be sitting in a chair all day!
Different ASL Job Assignments:
ASL Teachers for Hearing People - this is most similar to teachers of foreign languages; these professionals teach ASL to people who can hear and would like to be able to communicate with sign language
ASL Teachers for Deaf Students and their Parents - these teachers aid in developing communication between Deaf children who are born to parents that can hear
ASL Classroom Interpreters - focused on subjects like math, science, or literature, these teachers help students who are deaf learn in classrooms that are taught in spoken language by teachers that are hearing
How to Become a Sign Language Teacher
Becoming a sign language teacher is the opportunity for an exciting and rewarding career. It requires dedication and passion above all else, but the professional path to success is relatively simple. Outlined below are four steps for how to teach sign language, including cohesive detail of the journey to a fulfilling career as an ASL teacher.
Step 1: Education
Education and credentialing requirements for aspiring sign language teachers vary. Those who work for continuing education centers, businesses, or other organizations will likely need some training and/or experience. Sign language teachers who want to teach sign language in elementary, middle, or high schools need to earn a minimum of a bachelor's degree in deaf education or American Sign Language. Students who pursue ASL as a major might want to undertake a concentration or minor in education. Those who want to teach at a community college or university might need a graduate degree in deaf education or a related field. If you are looking for continuing education colleges that teach sign language, the University of South Carolina American Sign Language program is an excellent opportunity, offering 5-week courses for reasonable prices.
Step 2: Teaching License
Aspiring sign language teachers who want to work in public schools must obtain a teaching license. Requirements vary by state, but can include supervised teaching experience and passing scores on a subject area exam. In addition to a license, prospective sign language teachers might need an endorsement in ASL.
Step 3: Certification
The American Sign Language Teacher's Association (ASLTA) encourages sign language teachers to pursue professional certification. There are three levels, including provisional, qualified, and professional certification. Each level has different requirements when it comes to the number of hours of experience working specifically with deaf students and those learning signing as a second language.
Step 4: Continuing Education
To retain licenses and certification, sign language teachers typically engage in continuing education. They can renew their certification through ASLTA by submitting examples of professional development, including a written narrative of their post-certification teaching history and proof of teaching experience and professional development, like professional workshops and mentorships. Requirements vary by state and level of certification. Continuing education can also help sign language teachers who want to advance to higher positions in academia, such as teaching at the university level.
Continuing education and keeping up to date on knowledge and skills helps teachers be aware of common phrases people want to learn, such as how to sign money in asl or knowing how to communicate 'what do you want' in sign language.
ASL Teacher Salary
While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not provide salary information specifically for sign language teachers, in May 2019 it reported that special education teachers make $ 61,030/year; the same information shows elementary school teachers, who did not work in special education, earned an average annual salary of $59,420. During the same month, secondary school teachers overall earned an average yearly salary of $61,660. Sign language teachers work in a variety of settings, from public and private schools to community colleges and universities and teach students of varying ages. Before beginning their careers, they should determine what type of classes they want to teach and their desired audience.
Those who speak ASL and possess the ability to teach it do not necessarily have to go into a career in education. There are other options for these professionals, although most of them require additional education. ASL teachers can become librarians, academic advisors, instructional coordinators, or interpreters/translators.

Types of  Teaching Certifications
American Sign Language Teacher Certification
Many high school students take a year or two of Spanish as an elective class; others take French. Some take German or Japanese, when teachers are available at their school; while still others opt for American Sign Language.
American Sign Language? As a foreign language? Indeed! Contrary to popular belief, American Sign Language (ASL) is not a form of English. Rather, it is a fully developed and independent language, spoken by many people across the nation—both deaf and hearing. Unfortunately, too many schools lack a teacher who can teach it. This is where a certified ASL teacher can make a huge difference in the culture of a school—and in the lives of students who need them.

What is certification?
Certification establishes a minimum professional standard for teachers of American Sign Language, ensuring quality education for students of ASL in public schools. Without certification, teachers who know “some” ASL could take on basic ASL classes, resulting in inadequate or even incorrect instruction. Just as we need teachers of Spanish and Japanese to be fluent in Spanish and Japanese (rather than just knowing “some” Spanish or Japanese), we need ASL teachers who are fluent in American Sign Language.

Why American Sign Language teachers are important
Learning a foreign language has long been a standard component of high school and post-secondary education (although Americans are, as a whole, much more likely to know only one language than their European counterparts). Learning a second language can open up many new possibilities for students, exposing them to new communities and ideas (as well as new business opportunities, for those so inclined).
How many people use ASL?
Finding the number of speakers of American Sign Language is difficult. Most available numbers are actually a misreporting of a 1972 study that found ASL speakers to be the fourth-largest group requiring translators in court (not the fourth-largest group of speakers in the nation). Other numbers take the total population of the deaf as an estimate; but those who become deaf in old age tend not to learn ASL, while many hearing people learn ASL in order to interact with family members, friends, community, and customers.
Curiously, U.S. Census data does not count ASL users (and sometimes incorrectly codes ASL as English, which it is not ). Consequently, no reliable numbers exist; common estimates vary from 500,000 to 2,000,000.
But the teaching of American Sign Language has a special importance, above and beyond the teaching of other languages. While speakers of Spanish or German have the ability to learn English, deaf individuals may never develop the capacity for fluent spoken English (although they can easily learn to read and write it); therefore, interacting with the deaf community requires a more two-way exchange. Thus, more hearing people are learning ASL in order to serve as interpreters. (This, by the way, can be a quite lucrative career; language translators have a median hourly pay of $20.82.)
Additionally, most deaf children are born to hearing parents—who, as you might guess, are not already fluent in ASL. This means that deaf children often get the bulk of their ASL instruction at school, and that college and community classes are needed for parents who wish to be able to speak with their deaf or hearing-impaired children.
Obtaining certification
Certification requirements vary by state, but have many common elements, including demonstrating ASL proficiency and taking classes in second-language learning. Generally, acquiring a single-subject credential to teach American Sign Language classes involves the following:
Completing a bachelor’s degree, including a minimum number of semester units in ASL (which varies by state—for example, 30 units in New Jersey, 24 in Nevada). Some portion of these units needs to be upper-level courses.
Completing a teacher preparation program accredited by your state (review your state’s requirements)
Pass your state’s examination (often requiring a performance video)
If you already have a teaching credential in another subject, you may add a certification or endorsement to teach American Sign Language. However, doing so may still require taking a minimum number of units in ASL.
One Step Beyond: Teaching the Deaf
ASL teacher certification is for teaching American Sign Language to students (both hearing and deaf), but suppose you want to teach other subjects, such as history or biology, in ASL?
For that, you’ll need to complete a Deaf Education teacher preparation program, in order to learn effective techniques for teaching classes of deaf and hearing-impaired students. You can find schools offering such programs at DeafEd.net.
Many states recognize certification by the American Sign Language Teachers Association (ASLTA); some states, such as Florida, require it. ASLTA offers several levels of certification: provisional, qualified, and professional. In order to obtain ASLTA certification, you’ll need a minimum of five years’ experience using ASL on a daily basis. Additional requirements can be reviewed on the ASLTA website.
How your training prepares you for your role as an ASL teacher
Many people know a number of individual words in American Sign Language—in fact, it is common for parents to teach their children some basic signs, such as “please,” thank you,” and “more” before they are capable of speech. However, teaching ASL as a language goes far beyond mere vocabulary. American Sign Language has its own grammar, syntax, phonemic base (although with gestural instead of spoken components), and set of pragmatics (the component of a language that involves rules of context, such as the level of precision when reporting numbers, and how answers to questions change in different contexts). Your advanced study of American Sign Language will take you far beyond basic communication, and into these details and foundations. This will enable you to understand variations and inflections in the language, and teach beyond a simplified one-to-one word correspondence.
Common Classes in ASL
Interpreting ASL
ASL Syntax and Grammar
Basic Hearing Science
Audiology Principles
Deaf History and Communication
Deaf Culture and Community
Common Classes in ASL
Additionally, you’ll learn about the important cultural components of the language. In other foreign languages, students learn some about the cultures of origin, and how some cultural patterns or expectations affect using the language; ASL is no exception. In this case, you’ll be learning and teaching about deaf culture, including the history of the community’s struggles, how the community is formed and maintained (since deaf children are often born to hearing parents, and deaf parents often have hearing children), and what rules govern passage into and out of the culture. Such a knowledge is very important for learning proper etiquette in using signage, and being able to effectively translate (interpret) between English and ASL.
How you’ll impact your students and schools
Since deaf children can be born to hearing parents, and hearing children to deaf parents, deaf communities develop differently than communities formed by other languages. Therefore, the use of sign language is more dispersed than localized.
Nonetheless, teaching American Sign Language often has a greater immediate impact on students than teaching French or German, as students are more likely to have family, friends, or neighbors who use ASL. Additionally, you’ll raise awareness of this language and community, so that more people come to recognize this distinct and creative language—instead of simply mistaking it as a form of English for deaf people.
The developing language of ASL
American Sign Language is a recent creation, first developed in the 19th century. Before the advent of ASL, deaf people often communicated in idiosyncratic home-based sign languages, or in village sign languages where larger numbers of deaf people were present.
The development of a standard American Sign Language began in April 1817 at Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons (now called American School for the Deaf ), influenced by Old French Sign Language as well as sign languages used in American communities in Martha’s Vineyard, Henniker, New Hampshire, and southeastern Maine, as well as the home sign used by students coming to the school. As schools for the deaf spread, American Sign Language began to standardize; and in 1880 the National Association of the Deaf was founded, providing another means of stabilizing the language (although regional dialects continued to exist).
ASL is a natural language (as opposed to a constructed language), with its own grammar that evolves through use. However, it was not until the 1950s that linguists really began examining ASL, recognizing it as a full-fledged and independent language. Today the language (and its regional and ethnic variations) continues to evolve, adding new vocabulary and experiencing other changes in phonology and syntax over time.
In writing, ASL is almost always translated (or glossed) into English; but ASL and English do not have a one-to-one word correspondence, and English has no way of representing inflectional modulation in ASL signs. Several attempts at developing a written form of ASL have been made, but none have a great following. The Stokoe notation, developed in the 1960s, is only used in academic circles. Sutton Sign Writing is currently the system with the most use, including in use in some college newsletters and in the captioning of some YouTube videos; and is in at least partial use in some 40 countries.
As speakers of American Sign Language continue to interact with speakers of other languages across the globe, ASL will continue to change and evolve. Teachers of ASL will themselves never stop being learners of the language, as the language adds new words and continues to expand to more people—deaf and hearing alike.
The announcement made during National Summer Learning Week will allow more students to access more programs year-round to support their…

“Sign language is the equal of speech, lending itself equally to the rigorous and the poetic, to philosophical analysis or to making love.”
I believe that sign language should be taught in schools from a young age, and kids should have the choice of picking it just like the other languages for more complicated levels. Sign language isn’t only useful for deaf and mute people, but everyone. In this essay, I will be discussing the reasons that I think sign language should be taught alongside the initial language taught in the region. Here is the first reason:
First of all, people from all around the world will be able to communicate with this shared language, there will be no need for translating apps or any confusion to occur. In addition to that, sign language can be useful in countless situations. For instance, if someone is coming for a job interview or to order something at a restaurant, there would be no confusion. Perhaps you’re at the cinema and you want to talk to your friend, you can do so without making a sound. Or maybe you’re at a loud concert with your friends and you can easily communicate with your hands. Another example could be talking underwater while snorkeling or diving.  Communicating while eating, talking through the glass, or far distances are a few other examples.
Secondly, sign language helps people to develop better listening skills. Sign language forces people to pay full attention to the person who is speaking by maintaining eye contact and waiting for the person to finish speaking for you to start. You simply can’t look away when talking in sign language. This shows the other person that you are genuinely interested in what they are saying. People who know sign language tend to be better at listening.
My last point is that sign language can be just as, if not more expressive than words. Even though you can change your tone and volume when speaking, with sign language there are also ways to express yourself. The way your arms move, the speed you speak at, your facial expressions can say a great deal about what you’re trying to get across. For example, the position of your eyebrows can change your sentence from a statement to a question. Facial expressions can express emotions as well as grammatical information.
In conclusion, sign language is really the most useful language existing, and I don’t see why it shouldn’t be part of every human’s life. There are plenty of more reasons why it should be taught in schools, but those were just a few

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered some information about sign language, its usage, and its teaching in schools. Let me try to organize my thoughts based on this.

First, sign language is a visual means of communication used primarily by deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, but it's also used by hearing people to communicate with them or among themselves. It's important to note that sign language isn't universal; there are different sign languages in different countries, similar to spoken languages.

One of the main arguments for teaching sign language in schools is promoting inclusivity. If more hearing students know sign language, it can bridge the communication gap between hearing and deaf or hard-of-hearing students, leading to a more integrated and supportive school environment. This aligns with the idea of fostering an inclusive society where everyone can communicate effectively, regardless of their hearing abilities.

Moreover, learning sign language can be beneficial for cognitive development. Just like learning any second language, it can enhance cognitive skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and memory. Many schools already require students to learn a foreign language, and sign language could be another option that some students might find particularly interesting or useful.

Another point in favor of teaching sign language in schools is that it can provide students with a unique skill that sets them apart in college applications or future job opportunities. Employers often value candidates who can communicate with a diverse range of people, and knowing sign language can be an asset in various professions, such as education, healthcare, social services, and more.

However, there are also some challenges to implementing sign language instruction in schools. One of them is the availability of qualified teachers. Not all schools may have instructors who are proficient in sign language, which could require additional training or hiring new staff. This could be costly and logistically challenging for some schools.

Additionally, time is a limited resource in the school curriculum. Adding another language option might mean reallocating time from other subjects, which could be met with resistance from those who believe that core subjects should take precedence.

Furthermore, since sign language is not as widely used as some spoken languages, some people might argue that it's not as practical for most students. They might prefer to focus on languages that are more commonly spoken, especially those that are useful for international communication or business.

Despite these challenges, I think the benefits of teaching sign language in schools outweigh the drawbacks. Promoting inclusivity, enhancing cognitive skills, and providing students with a unique and valuable skill are all compelling reasons to include sign language as an option in school curriculums.

Moreover, with the advancement of technology and online resources, it might be easier now than ever before to train teachers or provide students with the necessary resources to learn sign language effectively.

In conclusion, I believe that sign language should be taught in schools as an optional language that students can choose to learn. This would not only benefit the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by improving communication but also enrich the educational experience for hearing students by providing them with a valuable and unique skill.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, sign language should be taught in schools.}} \]
