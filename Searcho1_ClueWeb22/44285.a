So I've got this question: "Will global warming cause more rain?" Hmm, that seems like a pretty straightforward question, but I know that climate science can be complex, so I want to make sure I understand all the factors involved.

First off, I know that global warming is caused by an increase in greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and lead to rising temperatures. Now, how does this relate to rainfall?

Well, warmer temperatures can hold more water vapor in the atmosphere. I think there's a principle or law in thermodynamics that relates to this, maybe it's called the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which states that the水汽容量 of air increases exponentially with temperature. So, if temperatures are rising, the atmosphere can hold more water vapor.

But does that mean there will be more rain overall? Not necessarily, because rainfall depends on many other factors besides the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere. For example, weather patterns, wind currents, and the distribution of land and sea all play a role in where and how much it rains.

I also recall that with warmer temperatures, evaporation rates increase. So, even as the atmosphere holds more moisture, more water might be evaporating from bodies of water and the ground. This could lead to drier conditions in some areas, even while others experience increased rainfall.

Moreover, climate models suggest that with global warming, we might see changes in precipitation patterns. Some regions may become wetter, experiencing more frequent and intense rainfall events, while other areas may become drier and experience more droughts.

It's also important to consider that rainfall isn't just about the total amount of water falling; it's also about the intensity and frequency of rainfall events. For instance, some areas might see heavier downpours but fewer rainy days, which could lead to both flooding and drought conditions in different parts of the year.

I think it would be helpful to look at some specific examples or studies that have investigated this relationship. Maybe there are reports from scientific organizations or research papers that can provide more insight.

Let me consider doing a search to find some reliable sources on this topic. I should look for information from reputable scientific institutions or peer-reviewed studies.

The world is warming because humans are emitting heat-trapping greenhouse gases. We know this for certain; the science on this question is settled. Humans emit greenhouse gases, those gases should warm the planet, and we know the planet is warming. All of those statements are settled science.
Okay so what? Well, we would like to know what the implications are. Should we do something about it or not? How should we respond? How fast will changes occur? What are the costs of action compared to inaction? These are all areas of active research.
Part of answering these questions requires knowing how weather will change as the Earth warms. One weather phenomenon that directly affects humans is the pattern, amount, and intensity of rainfall and the availability of water. Water is essential wherever humans live, for agriculture, drinking, industry, etc. Too little water and drought increases risk of wild fires and can debilitate societies. Too much water and flooding can occur, washing away infrastructure and lives.
It’s a well-known scientific principle that warmer air holds more water vapor. In fact, the amount of moisture that can be held in air grows very rapidly as temperatures increase. So, it’s expected that in general, air will get moister as the Earth warms – provided there is a moisture source. This may cause more intense rainfalls and snow events, which lead to increased risk of flooding.
But warmer air can also more quickly evaporate water from surfaces. This means that areas where it’s not precipitating dry out more quickly. In fact, it’s likely that some regions will experience both more drought and more flooding in the future (just not at the same time!). The dry spells are longer and with faster evaporation causing dryness in soils. But, when the rains fall, they come in heavy downpours potentially leading to more floods. The recent flooding in California – which followed a very intense and prolonged drought – provides a great example.
Okay so what have we observed? It turns out our expectations were correct. Observations reveal more intense rainfalls and flooding in some areas. But in other regions there’s more evaporation and drying with increased drought. Some areas experience both.
Some questions remain. When temperatures get too high, there’s no continued increase in intense rain events. In fact, heavy precipitation events decrease at the highest temperatures. There are some clear reasons for this but for brevity, regardless of where measurements are made on Earth, there appears to be an increase of precipitation with temperature up until a peak and thereafter, more warming coincides with decreased precipitation.
A new clever study by Dr. Guiling Wang from the University of Connecticut and her colleagues has looked into this and they’ve made a surprising discovery. Their work was just published in Nature Climate Change. They report that the peak temperature (the temperature where maximum precipitation occurs) is not fixed in space or time. It is increasing in a warming world.
The idea is shown in the sketch below. Details vary with location but, as the world warms, there is a shift from one curve to the next, from left to right. The result is a shift such that more intense precipitation occurs at higher temperatures in future, while the drop-off moves to even higher temperatures.

The authors also looked at how we characterize the temperature/precipitation relationship. Traditionally, we have related precipitation events to the local average temperature. However, it’s clear that there’s a strong relationship between the peak temperature and the precipitation rates. In fact, relations reveal that precipitation rates are increasing between 5 and 10% for every degree C increase. The expected rate of increase, just based on thermodynamics is 7%.
The authors find that in some parts of the globe, the relationship is even stronger. For instance, in the tropics, there’s more than a 10% increase in precipitation for a degree Celsius increase in temperature. This is not unexpected because precipitation releases latent heat, which can in turn invigorate storms.
From a practical standpoint, this helps us plan for climate change (it is already occurring) including planning resiliency. In the United States, there has been a marked increase in the most intense rainfall events across the country. This has resulted in more severe flooding throughout the country.
In my state, we have had four 1000-year floods since the year 2000! Two years ago, Minneapolis, Minnesota had such flooding that people were literally fishing in the streets as lakes and streams overflowed and fish escaped the banks. No joke, I actually observed fish swimming past me as I waded up a street. This occurrence is being observed elsewhere in my country and around the world.
It falls upon city planners and engineers to design infrastructure that is more able to accommodate heavy rains and manage water. This means designing river containment areas or flood plains, reinforcing buildings and houses, and increasing the capacity of storm drainage in urban areas, just to name a few. These modifications present costs but not preparing for increased flooding poses even greater financial and social costs. Moreover, storing water from times when there is too much for the inevitable times when we have too little (drought), results in better water management and multiple benefits.
This shows why climate science is so important. The US government is in the process of decimating our climate science infrastructure. The current US congress and our president have lost the battle of science – they have no reputable scientists to hide behind in their climate change denial. But, what they are doing instead is decapitating our ability to predict and plan for the future. By defunding organizations like NASA, the EPA, and NOAA, they are making us fly blind into a future.
For comparison, the proposed increase in the Department of Defense budget would enable our military to buy more expensive weapons like the US Navy Joint Strike Fighter. At approximately $335 million per plane, giving up just six of those planes would be enough to maintain the climate budget of NASA.
I worked on the Joint Strike Fighter as a consultant. I understand the need to have a national military. But giving up our understanding of a changing climate for six jet fighters is actually decreasing our security, is, in plain English, dumb. It seems that our elected officials have a strange values system – a values system that will end up presenting us with much higher social and economic costs.
I hope we remember these values next time we have fish swimming in our streets or droughts shriveling our crops.

Change in average rainfall at global warming levels
Note: Reaching a global warming level means the global mean surface temperature (GMST) is steadily at or near that level relative to the baseline (reference period) chosen to represent the pre-industrial climate: 1850–1900.
Rainfall change is reported between the recent baseline of 1986–2005 to the future period when the world reaches the warming level. This recent baseline is used for relevance to our recent experience. Change in average rainfall is reported - not changes in rainfall extremes, which can be different from the change in the average.
Spatial Maps of projected change
The global average precipitation is projected to increase in a warmer 
world. But the likely change is very different in different parts of the
 world, from decrease, little change to increase. Changes are strongly 
related to the change in atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. 
There is also a range of plausible change currently assessed from various lines of evidence, and there is not a strong consensus 
between different climate models in most places - but several notable cases where there is strong agreement such as southwest Australia.

The maps above show the central estimate (model average), with agreement among models shown using dots. Area-average rainfall change shown as a bar chart for each region shows the range of model results more clearly. Australian rainfall is very different in different parts of the country, so here we report the state and territory averages,  but also results by four key regions based on climatological boundaries: the ‘super-cluster regions’ see Super-Clusters , (broadly consistent with IPCC ‘reference regions’ see this scientific paper, new window):

NASA Study Projects Warming-Driven Changes in Global Rainfall

A NASA-led modeling study provides new evidence that global warming may increase the risk for extreme rainfall and drought.
NASA Study Projects Warming-Driven Changes in Global Rainfall

The occurrence of no rain and heavy rain will increase, while moderate rainfall will decrease. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio
The study shows for the first time how rising carbon dioxide concentrations could affect the entire range of rainfall types on Earth.
Analysis of computer simulations from 14 climate models indicates wet regions of the world, such as the equatorial Pacific Ocean and Asian monsoon regions, will see increases in heavy precipitation because of warming resulting from projected increases in carbon dioxide levels. Arid land areas outside the tropics and many regions with moderate rainfall could become drier.
The analysis provides a new assessment of global warming's impacts on precipitation patterns around the world. The study was accepted for publication in the American Geophysical Union journal Geophysical Research Letters.
"In response to carbon dioxide-induced warming, the global water cycle undergoes a gigantic competition for moisture resulting in a global pattern of increased heavy rain, decreased moderate rain, and prolonged droughts in certain regions," said William Lau of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and lead author of the study.
The models project for every 1 degree Fahrenheit of carbon dioxide-induced warming, heavy rainfall will increase globally by 3.9 percent and light rain will increase globally by 1 percent. However, total global rainfall is not projected to change much because moderate rainfall will decrease globally by 1.4 percent.
Heavy rainfall is defined as months that receive an average of more than about 0.35 of an inch per day. Light rain is defined as months that receive an average of less than 0.01 of an inch per day. Moderate rainfall is defined as months that receive an average of between about 0.04 to 0.09 of an inch per day.
Areas projected to see the most significant increase in heavy rainfall are in the tropical zones around the equator, particularly in the Pacific Ocean and Asian monsoon regions.
Some regions outside the tropics may have no rainfall at all. The models also projected for every degree Fahrenheit of warming, the length of periods with no rain will increase globally by 2.6 percent. In the Northern Hemisphere, areas most likely to be affected include the deserts and arid regions of the southwest United States, Mexico, North Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan, and northwestern China. In the Southern Hemisphere, drought becomes more likely in South Africa, northwestern Australia, coastal Central America and northeastern Brazil.
"Large changes in moderate rainfall, as well as prolonged no-rain events, can have the most impact on society because they occur in regions where most people live," Lau said. "Ironically, the regions of heavier rainfall, except for the Asian monsoon, may have the smallest societal impact because they usually occur over the ocean."
Lau and colleagues based their analysis on the outputs of 14 climate models in simulations of 140-year periods. The simulations began with carbon dioxide concentrations at about 280 parts per million -- similar to pre-industrial levels and well below the current level of almost 400 parts per million -- and then increased by 1 percent per year. The rate of increase is consistent with a "business as usual" trajectory of the greenhouse gas as described by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Analyzing the model results, Lau and his co-authors calculated statistics on the rainfall responses for a 27-year control period at the beginning of the simulation, and also for 27-year periods around the time of doubling and tripling of carbon dioxide concentrations. They conclude the model predictions of how much rain will fall at any one location as the climate warms are not very reliable.
"But if we look at the entire spectrum of rainfall types we see all the models agree in a very fundamental way -- projecting more heavy rain, less moderate rain events, and prolonged droughts," Lau said.

Abstract
Trends in precipitation are critical to water resources. Considerable uncertainty remains concerning the trends of regional precipitation in response to global warming and their controlling mechanisms. Here, we use an interannual difference method to derive trends of regional precipitation from GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project) data and MERRA (Modern- Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis in the near-global domain of 60°S–60°N during a major global warming period of 1979–2013. We find that trends of regional annual precipitation are primarily driven by changes in the top 30% heavy precipitation events, which in turn are controlled by changes in precipitable water in response to global warming, i.e., by thermodynamic processes. Significant drying trends are found in most parts of the U.S. and eastern Canada, the Middle East, and eastern South America, while significant increases in precipitation occur in northern Australia, southern Africa, western India and western China. In addition, as the climate warms there are extensive enhancements and expansions of the three major tropical precipitation centers–the Maritime Continent, Central America, and tropical Africa–leading to the observed widening of Hadley cells and a significant strengthening of the global hydrological cycle.

Summary:
Global warming will increase rainfall in some of the world's driest areas over land, with not only the wet getting wetter but the dry getting wetter as well.
FULL STORY
Global warming will increase rainfall in some of the world's driest areas over land, with not only the wet getting wetter but the dry getting wetter as well.
New research published today in Nature Climate Change has revealed that in the Earth's dry regions, global warming will bring an overall increase in rainfall and in extreme precipitation events that could lead to flash flooding becoming a more regular event.
"We found a strong relationship between global warming and an increase in rainfall, particularly in areas outside of the tropics," said lead author Dr Markus Donat from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.
"Within the tropics we saw an increase in rainfall responding to global warming but the actual rate of this increase was less clear."
Unfortunately for societies, businesses and agricultural activities that exist in arid regions, the expected increase in rainfall over dry areas does not necessarily mean that more water will become available according to the researchers. The additional heat caused by global warming will likely lead to increased evaporation. This means that while there may be more extreme flooding events it may have little impact on overall water storage rates.
"The concern with an increased frequency and in particular intensity of extreme precipitation events in areas that are normally dry is that there may not be infrastructure in place to cope with extreme flooding events," said Dr Donat.
"Importantly, this research suggests we will see these extreme rainfall events increase at regional levels in dry areas, not just as an average across the globe."
The researchers were able to reach this conclusion because they looked at regions with similar characteristics rather than trying to compare complex climate variations found when comparing one country or continent with another.
This meant that dry regions in Australia were compared with similarly dry regions in Asia, Africa and many other countries. At the same time, wetter regions across different countries were also compared. This allowed the researchers to directly compare like with like.
Importantly, the findings remained consistent across observations and models.
"With precipitation climate models and observations don't always tell the same story regarding regional changes, but we were very surprised to find that our results turned out to be highly robust across both," said Dr Donat.
"It appears the uncertainties in climate models were greatest where the observational uncertainties were greatest. This suggests that improved observations will be vital for those planning for climate change if they are to reasonably determine how future precipitation will change in every corner of the world with global warming."

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what they say about whether global warming causes more rain.

First, there's an article from The Guardian. It says that global warming is increasing rainfall rates. It mentions that warmer air can hold more water vapor, which leads to more intense rainfalls and snow events. But it also says that in some regions, warmer temperatures can cause faster evaporation, leading to droughts, even while those same areas might experience more flooding when it does rain. So, it's kind of a mixed picture: more intense rainfall but also potentially more droughts.

The second document is from the Climate Change in Australia website. It shows maps of projected rainfall changes across different regions of Australia and the world at different levels of global warming. It seems to suggest that some areas will get wetter, while others will get drier, depending on their location.

The third article is from NASA, and it talks about how global warming may increase the risk for extreme rainfall and drought. It says that wet regions will see increases in heavy precipitation, while arid and some moderate rainfall areas could become drier. So, again, it's suggesting that global warming could lead to more extreme precipitation events in already wet areas and more drought in dry areas.

The fourth document is a scientific study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. It discusses trends in regional precipitation from 1979 to 2013 and how these trends are controlled by changes in precipitable water in response to global warming. The study found that trends in regional annual precipitation are mainly driven by changes in the top 30% of heavy precipitation events, which are influenced by changes in water vapor in the atmosphere.

The fifth article is from ScienceDaily, reporting on research that suggests global warming increases rainfall in the world's driest areas. It says that not only do wet areas get wetter, but dry areas also get wetter. However, it notes that the additional rainfall might not translate into more available water due to increased evaporation from higher temperatures.

So, synthesizing these sources, it seems that global warming leads to changes in precipitation patterns, with wet regions experiencing more intense rainfall and dry regions potentially getting wetter, but also facing more evaporation due to higher temperatures. This could lead to more extreme weather events, including heavier floods and more intense droughts in different parts of the world.

But to answer the specific question: "Will global warming cause more rain?" The answer seems to be yes, in terms of total precipitation, especially in wetter regions and some drier areas, but the distribution and intensity of that rain will change significantly. Some areas might experience more rain, while others might get less, and the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events are likely to increase.

So, my final answer is: Yes, global warming will cause more rain in many regions, particularly in already wet areas and some dry regions, but with increased variability and extremeness in precipitation patterns.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, global warming will cause more rain in many regions, particularly in already wet areas and some dry regions, but with increased variability and extremeness in precipitation patterns.}} \]
