Alright, so I've got this question about how Medicaid can be improved while keeping costs under control. Now, Medicaid is a big deal in the U.S.; it's a joint federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with low incomes and resources. It's really important because it covers a lot of vulnerable populations, like low-income adults, children, seniors, and people with disabilities.

First off, I need to understand what Medicaid currently does and where it might be falling short. I think one of the main issues is that it's a bit fragmented because it's managed jointly by federal and state governments, which means there can be variations in coverage and quality between different states. Also, funding can be an issue, with states sometimes struggling to meet their financial obligations.

So, how can we improve it while being cost-effective? That seems like a balancing act. On one hand, we want to enhance the quality of care and maybe expand coverage, but on the other hand, we need to make sure it's sustainable financially.

Let me start by thinking about quality improvement. One way to improve Medicaid is to focus on preventive care. If we can keep people healthy in the first place, maybe we can reduce the need for more expensive treatments down the line. That could save money in the long run.

Another idea is to invest in technology, like electronic health records. If all patient data is digitized and accessible to care providers, it could lead to more efficient care and fewer mistakes. But implementing such systems can be costly upfront, so I need to think about whether the long-term savings justify the initial investment.

Also, maybe there's a way to better coordinate care for patients who have multiple chronic conditions. Often, these patients see multiple specialists, and without proper coordination, there can be overlaps or gaps in their treatment. Some states have tried using care coordinators or implementing patient-centered medical homes, which seem to show promise in improving outcomes and reducing costs.

Speaking of states, since Medicaid is administered at the state level, perhaps there are best practices that can be shared across states. Some states might be doing a particularly good job in certain areas, and others could learn from them.

Cost containment is another big aspect. One approach could be to negotiate better rates with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. Medicaid is a large purchaser of healthcare services, so it should have some bargaining power to get lower rates.

I've heard about managed care organizations (MCOs) being used in Medicaid to manage costs. They work by having a contract to provide all healthcare services for enrollees, and they're paid a set amount per member per month. In theory, this can incentivize MCOs to provide cost-effective care. But there have been concerns about whether this model really improves quality or just cuts corners to save money.

Another angle is to look into social determinants of health. Things like housing, nutrition, and transportation can greatly affect a person's health. If Medicaid could somehow address these underlying issues, it might lead to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs in the long run.

Wait a minute, I should probably look up some data on this. Maybe there are studies or reports that discuss strategies for improving Medicaid while controlling costs. Let me see.

Improving Health and Controlling Costs in Medicaid:  The 6|18 Initiative
Improving Health and Controlling Costs in Medicaid:  The 6|18 Initiative
5/19/2021
Introduction
The U.S. health care system is undergoing unprecedented change as policymakers work toward a system that is more effective and efficient. Major trends in health care, including moving toward paying for value and health outcomes rather than just volume of services provided, offer opportunities to purchase and deliver preventive services. The 6|18 Initiative was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to better link the health care sector, particularly payers like Medicaid, and public health sectors. It provides a shared focus on evidence-based interventions and preventive services that can improve health and control costs. 1
Medicaid is a publicly financed program that provides health insurance for millions of low-income Americans, including low-income adults, children, pregnant women, older adults and people with disabilities. 2 With Medicaid accounting for nearly 30% of total state spending, 3 state policymakers continually look for ways to reduce its costs. Medicaid clients are more likely than privately insured individuals to have chronic conditions. 4 With chronic conditions being among the costliest to treat and manage, Medicaid beneficiaries and state budgets may benefit from better coordinated care and evidence-based approaches to services.
This policy brief outlines the CDC’s 6|18 Initiative, including the common conditions targeted and evidence-based interventions, and describes opportunities and barriers for states in implementing these proven strategies in their Medicaid programs.
What is CDC's 6/18 Initiative?
The 6|18 Initiative was developed to provide health care purchasers, payers and providers with rigorous evidence about high-burden health conditions and the associated evidence-based, practical strategies that have the greatest health and cost impact in a short period of time. 5 The name “6|18” comes from the focus on six common, preventable health conditions and 18 evidence-based interventions to prevent and manage these conditions.
The 6|18 Initiative targets six chronic conditions: tobacco use, high blood pressure, inappropriate antibiotic use, asthma, unintended pregnancies and type 2 diabetes. The CDC selected these conditions because they affect large numbers of people, significantly affect individual health and drive high health care spending. 6 In addition, there are proven evidence-based strategies to prevent or control these conditions.
The prevalence of these conditions in the Medicaid population underscores the potential value of using proven and practical strategies to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. 7 The 6|18 Initiative is now in its fifth year, and over the past four years, the CDC has partnered with 40 state, local and territorial Medicaid and public health department teams to provide assistance in their implementation of the identified interventions. Participating Medicaid and public health teams took part in technical assistance and collaboration opportunities, including peer-to-peer support, webinars and quarterly calls, all of which help with understanding and sharing effective ways to apply 6|18 strategies across different sectors. 8
The following sections contain details regarding common and costly conditions and strategies for preventing and managing these conditions using Medicaid programs and the 6|18 Initiative.
Reducing Tobacco Use
According to the CDC, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the United States. Nearly 35 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes. Tobacco use is particularly high among Medicaid beneficiaries, with nearly 24% using tobacco compared to only 10.5% of those with private insurance coverage. 9
Comprehensive coverage of cessation benefits with minimal out-of-pocket cost is identified by CDC as a proven strategy for helping people quit using tobacco. 10 However, Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation services varies by state. All 50 states cover some form of tobacco cessation services, but states may choose what is covered and may not cover the full spectrum of services. For example, all states cover nicotine replacement therapy gum, and most states cover group and individual counseling. 11
As of 2018, many Medicaid programs also have limitations on length of treatment (26 states), prior authorization requirements (17 states), cost sharing requirements (10 states) and limits on number of attempts to quit per year (25 states). 12 The 6|18 Initiative provides evidence and technical assistance to support states’ efforts to provide full access to tobacco cessation services in state Medicaid programs.
Evidence-Based Strategies | Tobacco Cessation
The following evidence-based options may be considered for reducing tobacco use:
Increase access to evidence-based tobacco cessation treatments, including individual, group and telephone counseling, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cessation medications.
Remove barriers that impede access to covered cessation treatments, such as cost-sharing and prior authorization.
Promote increased use of covered treatment benefits by tobacco users.
Controlling High Blood Pressure
Nearly 1 in 2 adults—108 million—have high blood pressure.13 Most adults are aware of and treat their high blood pressure, but only about half have their blood pressure under control. 14
One key strategy identified by CDC for controlling high blood pressure is self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring. Typically, a person’s blood pressure is monitored at regular appointments in a clinical setting. But SMBP monitoring allows people to track their blood pressure outside of the clinical setting, commonly at home. 15
Simplifying the treatment regimen and minimizing out-of-pocket costs can also help. 16 For example, many individuals are currently treated with two different medications to manage their blood pressure. Fixed-dose combinations, when two or more drugs are combined in a single tablet, may help with adherence by reducing the amount of pills a person takes each day. 17
In 2014, all Medicaid programs filled almost all blood pressure prescriptions with a copay of $5 or less, but only about 10% of blood pressure medication was a fixed-dose combination. 18
Evidence-Based Strategies  |  Controlling High Blood Pressure
The following evidence-based options may be considered for controlling high blood pressure:
Implement strategies that improve adherence to anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering prescription medications via expanded access to:
Low-cost medication copayments, fixed dose medication combinations and extended medication refills.
Innovative pharmacy packaging (e.g., calendar blister packs).
Improved care coordination within networked primary care teams using standardized protocols, medication therapy management programs, and self-monitoring of blood pressure with clinical support.
Provide home blood pressure monitors to patients with high blood pressure and reimburse the clinical support services required for self-measured blood pressure monitoring.
Improving Antibiotic Use
About 30% of antibiotics used in hospitals may be unnecessary or prescribed incorrectly, 19 which can contribute to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. The CDC estimates at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths can be attributed each year to antibiotic-resistant infections. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that hospital-based programs dedicated to improving antibiotic use, commonly referred to as “Antibiotic Stewardship Programs” (ASPs), can optimize the treatment of infections and reduce adverse events associated with antibiotic use. 20
ASPs are designed to ensure that people in a hospital or other inpatient health care setting receive the correct antibiotic at the right time and for an appropriate duration. These programs involve interdisciplinary teams that work to improve prescribing of antibiotics and continuously review prescribing practices and outcomes. One strategy to improve prescribing practices includes frequent auditing and feedback regarding clinician antibiotic prescribing practices and giving providers data on their own antibiotic prescribing practices. 21
Most hospitals are already required to have ASPs by the Joint Commission, an independent nonprofit entity that accredits hospitals. 22 However, many hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid are not accredited by the Joint Commission because they are only certified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Through the 6|18 Initiative, the CDC worked with CMS as it modified the conditions of participation for hospitals in both Medicaid and Medicare to require the adoption of ASPs. The initial rule, proposed in June 2016, became effective in November 2019, requiring all hospitals participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to adopt ASPs. 23
Evidence-Based Strategies | Improving Antibiotic Use
The following evidence-based options may be considered for improving antibiotic use:
Require antibiotic stewardship programs in all hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, in alignment with CDC’s “ Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship ” and “ The Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship for Nursing Homes. ”
Improve outpatient antibiotic prescribing by incentivizing providers to follow CDC’s “ Core Elements of Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship. ”
Controlling Asthma
More than 24 million Americans have asthma, affecting over 7% of both adults and children. 24 People with low incomes are disproportionately affected by asthma and most low-income children with asthma are enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 25
One way to manage asthma is using the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP Guidelines).26 The goals of the NAEPP are to raise public awareness regarding the seriousness of asthma, teach people to identify its signs and symptoms, and enhance the quality of life of people with asthma. The NAEPP develops guidelines and tools for patients and clinicians, including recommendations for reducing the impacts of asthma through well-developed treatment and action plans and guidelines for initial diagnosis and ongoing follow up.
Analysis of claims data shows that patients who have been treated according to NAEPP Guidelines have a reduction of asthma-related ED visits and are hospitalized less often. 27 Providing ongoing NAEPP Guidelines-based medical education to primary care physicians has been shown to increase dispensing of asthma controller medication by 25%. 28
State Medicaid coverage of asthma management services may include prior authorization requirements and copayments, which can create difficulties for some beneficiaries when accessing needed services. 29 In addition, reimbursement policies regarding beneficiary education and in-home services may be inconsistent, with requirements for these services offered through Medicaid managed care organizations varying. 30 But there is the potential for cost savings and improved health outcomes within the Medicaid program by providing comprehensive coverage. 31 For example, Rhode Island’s Home Asthma Response Program (HARP) saw a 75% reduction in asthma-related hospital and emergency department costs.
Evidence-Based Strategies | Controlling Asthma
The following evidence-based options may be considered for controlling asthma:
Use the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP Guidelines) as clinical practice guidelines.
Promote strategies that improve access and adherence to asthma medications and devices.
Expand access to intensive self-management education by licensed professionals or qualified lay health workers for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled by medical management.
Expand access to home visits by licensed professionals or qualified lay health workers to provide intensive self-management education and reduce home asthma triggers for patients whose asthma is not well-controlled with medical management and self-management education.
Preventing Unintended Pregnancies
On average, Medicaid pays for about 46% of births in the U.S. 32 Approximately 50% of all pregnancies are unintended and these pregnancies increase the risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes. 33
Medicaid provides family planning coverage with no out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, but Medicaid programs are not required to cover all FDA-approved family planning options. 34 Providing access to the full range of contraceptive options is a key 6|18 strategy, with a particular focus on increased use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) as a proven strategy to reduce costs and unintended pregnancies.
Contraceptives that are incorrectly or inconsistently used may still lead to unintended pregnancies and avoidable expenses. Because LARC requires no user effort after placement of the contraceptive, the potential for inconsistent or incorrect use is eliminated. Improved use of LARC among women ages 15 to 44 may generate health care cost savings by reducing unintended pregnancies despite higher up-front costs. 35
For example, one study found that offering LARC methods to clients at no cost in Colorado Title X-funded clinics, compared with offering all other methods on a sliding-fee scale, resulted in an increase from 5% use to 19%  use of LARC among 15- to 24-year-olds. 36 Between 2009 and 2014, the Colorado initiative helped reduce unintended pregnancy rates by 40%  for teens and 20% among women ages 20 to 24. 37
The Colorado Medicaid program also worked to unbundle payment for LARC from other services to further increase LARC use in the state. 38 Previously, payment for labor and delivery costs were provided as an upfront prospective payment and did not consider the actual costs associated with the LARC insertion process. Unbundling payments provides an incentive for providers to provide LARC insertion while the beneficiary is already in their care, avoiding the need for a subsequent appointment. 39
Evidence-Based Strategies | Preventing Unintended Pregnancies
The following evidence-based options may be considered for preventing unintended pregnancies:
Reimburse providers for the full range of contraceptive services (e.g., screening for pregnancy intention; tiered contraception counseling; insertion, removal, replacement or reinsertion of contraceptive devices, and follow-up) for women of childbearing age.
Reimburse providers for the actual cost of FDA-approved contraceptive methods.
Unbundle payment for long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) from other postpartum services.
Remove administrative and logistical barriers to receipt of contraceptive services (e.g., pre-approval step therapy restriction, barriers to high acquisition and stocking costs).
Preventing Type 2 Diabetes
Approximately 30 million people in the U.S. have diabetes and about 84 million Americans have prediabetes, according to the CDC. Adults with prediabetes are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke. CMS estimated that Medicare would spend an additional $42 billion in 2016 on beneficiaries with diabetes. More than 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes; fortunately, type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with appropriate lifestyle changes. 40
The 6|18 initiative promotes expanding access to the National DPP lifestyle change program as the most effective evidence-based approach to diabetes prevention. 41 The National DPP is designed to help individuals make the lifestyle changes needed to avoid type 2 diabetes. The yearlong program focuses on behavior changes, managing stress and peer supports, and provides regular opportunities for direct interaction with a lifestyle coach and peers. According to the CDC, studies have shown adopting lifestyle changes like those supported by the National DPP lifestyle change program may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58% in adults with prediabetes.
Information from the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) indicates that as of 2020, 20 states offer access to the National DPP lifestyle change program in some form through their Medicaid program, although not all states offer coverage statewide. 42 But through the 6|18 Initiative, some states, like Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Utah, have been working to expand coverage of the National DPP lifestyle change program in their Medicaid programs.
Evidence-Based Strategies | Preventing Type 2 Diabetes
The following evidence-based options may be considered for preventing type 2 diabetes:
Expand access to the National Diabetes Prevention Program (the National DPP) lifestyle change program for preventing type 2 diabetes, through Medicaid coverage of the program.
State Examples
In 2016, the first year of the 6|18 Initiative, nine states that already had significant efforts underway in addressing these common conditions were selected to participate in the initiative. The experiences of two of those states are highlighted below. Information for the state examples below was compiled from state profiles from the Center for Health Care Strategies.
SOUTH CAROLINA
Through the 6|18 Initiative, South Carolina’s Medicaid agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and its public health agency, the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), worked together to improve access to and use of tobacco cessation benefits for its Medicaid population. South Carolina already had a comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit for pregnant women and the 6|18 Initiative helped support South Carolina’s efforts to provide comprehensive coverage to all Medicaid beneficiaries.
South Carolina public health staff worked with Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), particularly medical directors, to make the case for covering all tobacco cessation medications and counseling services without barriers. Public health staff also worked with the MCOs to standardize the services offered across all MCOs in the state. Because of these efforts, South Carolina was able to successfully implement a comprehensive, standardized tobacco cessation benefit within the Medicaid program that eliminated copays and prior authorization requirements.
Public health staff and Medicaid program staff also worked closely together to raise awareness of the comprehensive services and educate providers and Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, using the evidence and technical assistance provided as part of the 6I18 Initiative, South Carolina was able to obtain federal Medicaid funds to provide part of the money needed to support its Quitline telephone counseling option. South Carolina was recognized by the American Lung Association for these efforts to provide comprehensive coverage and increase access to services.
NEW YORK
New York focused on unintended pregnancies in its effort with the 6|18 Initiative. The New York State Department of Health’s Office of Health Insurance Programs (Medicaid agency) and the Division of Family Health (public health agency) worked to reduce the state’s unintended pregnancy rate by increasing access to and use of effective contraception, particularly LARC.
Like South Carolina, New York already had success in reducing unintended pregnancy prior to joining the 6|18 Initiative. The 6|18 Initiative provided technical assistance to New York as it revised its reimbursement methodology to encourage use of LARC. Specifically, New York modified its reimbursement to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to unbundle the payment for LARCs to reimburse for the actual cost associated with LARC insertion. New York worked with MCOs to similarly separate payment of LARC from an inpatient delivery stay to further encourage the use of LARC immediately after delivery but before discharge from the hospital.
Through this work, New York also identified a significant need for education and awareness in the provider community regarding the use of LARC devices. The 6|18 Initiative provided evidence and technical assistance to New York as it developed a team to train providers in the appropriate use of LARC and educating providers regarding myths about the devices. These provider outreach efforts encouraged appropriate and timely contraception counseling and stocking of LARC devices on the labor and delivery floor. Through these efforts, the New York Department of Health developed a key partnership with the local chapter of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to further improve access to and use of LARC devices.
Conclusion
The CDC conducted interviews with Medicaid and public health officials participating in the 6|18 initiative. 43 The interviews indicated the initiative led to increased collaboration and information sharing as well as provided supports needed to make meaningful progress toward goals.
Lessons learned include the discovery by public health officials that Medicaid coverage and reimbursement is an important concern for successfully implementing public health strategies. And Medicaid officials and providers were able to learn the science and rationale behind these interventions, to more fully support their work in revising Medicaid coverage and reimbursement options.
State policymakers can use examples of state experiences to leverage 6|18 Initiative strategies to improve health outcomes in their states while also reducing Medicaid costs. One policy lever state policymakers have used to impact Medicaid program performance and efficiency is through benefit coverage decisions and service delivery options. The 6|18 Initiative’s practical strategies and technical assistance provide a framework for Medicaid benefit coverage and service delivery options to accelerate the adoption of these proven cost-saving strategies within Medicaid programs.
States involved in the 6|18 Initiative continue to work to fully integrate these interventions and strategies in their Medicaid programs. State policymakers can provide leadership to encourage and foster the cross-section collaborations necessary for success of these interventions and policies. Through these collaborations, state policymakers can further tailor Medicaid policies and strategies, as well as overall public health strategies, to the needs of their states.

Strategies to Reduce Medicaid Acute Care Spending
Premiums, Cost Sharing, and Enrollee Wellness Incentives
Premiums and Cost Sharing
State Medicaid programs are given the flexibility to charge cost sharing (defined here as deductibles, premiums, and copayments) for certain groups of individuals or types of services, subject to limitations. States have greater flexibility to charge cost sharing in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) relative to Medicaid. In either program, cost sharing cannot exceed 5% of household income, and Medicaid enrollees with income below 150% of the federal poverty level are generally exempt from cost sharing. Cost sharing shifts some health care costs to enrollees to encourage them to avoid unnecessary care. When enrollees are responsible for some portion of the cost of care, economic theory suggests they will be more selective in the care they choose to consume. Payers can deter the use of low-value services by placing greater cost-sharing requirements on those services, and they can encourage the use of high-value services by removing or lowering cost sharing. Reduced use may translate into lower expenditures for Medicaid, provided the reductions in use are great enough. However, small changes in use may not result in significant changes in program expenditures. We provide a brief overview of the extensive literature on enrollee response to cost sharing, with a specific focus on Medicaid or CHIP.
Charging premiums can lead to disruptions in Medicaid or CHIP coverage, which, in turn, may lead to increased Medicaid spending. Several studies have found that implementation of or an increase in premiums in Medicaid or CHIP leads to disenrollment from or less time in the program. 1,2,3 In Oregon and Wisconsin, increases in Medicaid premiums were associated with disenrollment for nondisabled adults. 4,5 Among children, increases in premiums in Medicaid or CHIP in Kansas, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Florida, and Wisconsin were associated with fewer new enrollments into the program, increased likelihood of disenrollment, and fewer days enrolled in the program. 6,7,8 Lower-income Medicaid or CHIP enrollees are often at higher risk for disenrollment relative to higher-income Medicaid enrollees. 9 When former Medicaid enrollees in Oregon, Wisconsin, and Utah were surveyed about why they were no longer enrolled, cost sharing in the form of premiums, enrollment fees, and copayments was frequently reported. 10,11
Individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or depression, who experience interruptions in Medicaid coverage have been shown to have higher Medicaid expenditures once they return to Medicaid, primarily due to a subset of individuals who experience acute needs while off the program and have more emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations upon re-enrollment. Disenrollees that remain uninsured, particularly individuals with chronic conditions who need continuous medical management for their condition and contend with household medical debt, and safety-net systems that care for the uninsured experience greater strain as these disenrollees enter their systems for care.
Copayments can reduce use, but their impact on spending is less clear. Seminal findings of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment showed that the more individuals must pay out-of-pocket, the fewer medical services they use. 12 Studies on cost sharing have noted that reductions in service use are common when copayments are introduced or increased, and that reductions can happen for low-value, high-cost services such as non-emergent ED visits as well as for high-value, low-cost services such as ambulatory care. 13,14,15 Very few studies have explicitly examined the impact of copayments on total Medicaid expenditures, but those that have report either no change or higher expenditures. 16,17 The impact of copayments on use need to be considered together with expenditures per user. Reductions in use may not necessarily lead to reductions in expenditures if expenditures per user increase at the same time (e.g., the number of hospital stays may fall, but the average cost per hospital stay increases). 18
Predicting revenues associated with collecting premiums and copayments is challenging. If premiums induce disenrollment from Medicaid or CHIP, then revenues from premiums will decrease. 19 There are also administrative costs to implementing programs to collect premiums, track enrollees who fail to pay premiums or cost sharing in a timely manner, and re-instate individuals who lose and regain Medicaid coverage.
It is not clear from the literature that Medicaid programs will realize significant savings from cost sharing above and beyond the savings that may accrue from individuals exiting the program due to the initiation or increase of premiums. For those that re-enroll in Medicaid later, costs may be higher because individuals with chronic conditions experience exacerbations that lead to high resource use upon re-enrollment. Although other forms of cost sharing, such as co-payments, do reduce use, the evidence shows that consumers are not selective in how they reduce their care, potentially foregoing high-value care. How these reductions directly impact total Medicaid spending is still unclear.
Enrollee Wellness Incentives
Medicaid programs 20 have been experimenting with incentives for engaging in wellness or preventive behaviors, such as wellness visits, evidence-based preventive care, tobacco cessation services, medication adherence, and weight-reduction activities. 21 Incentives can take various forms such as vouchers, gift cards, points redeemable for health-related items, or reduced premiums or cost sharing, and incentive program design varies.
Limited evidence suggests some effects on the uptake of specific services, but evidence for reduced Medicaid spending has not yet emerged. Incentives have been shown to motivate individuals to engage in healthy behaviors and use preventive services. 22,23,24 The uptake of such activities is expected to improve health, which, in turn, may lead to lower health care spending over time. The target behavior, target population, type of incentive, and the incentive’s magnitude and frequency are critical design elements that can impact a program’s success. Evaluations of early initiatives have found that these programs can be effective at increasing short-term or one-time activities, such as physician visits, medication adherence, and preventive care use. 25,26 A more recent evaluation of 10 Medicaid programs that received Medicaid demonstration funds to test financial incentives to promote engagement in chronic disease prevention or management programs found that Medicaid enrollees were more likely to use a service (e.g., attend a diabetes prevention class or call a smoking cessation Quitline) if they received a financial incentive to do so. There was little evidence that the receipt of financial incentives was associated with short-term (1–2 years post-enrollment) changes in the use of the ED, inpatient, or total Medicaid expenditures. 27 There was also no evidence to suggest that one type of program (e.g., prevention vs. disease management, smoking cessation vs. weight management) was more successful than another. However, findings are not conclusive because the evaluation occurred midway through states’ demonstration programs. It is important to note that these programs have experienced implementation challenges that could limit impact. Notable challenges include low program enrollment, lack of awareness of or difficulty understanding the incentive program, not perceiving a benefit from the incentives, and not knowing how to redeem incentives once earned. 28 Furthermore, return on investment for prevention can take many years to realize, certainly well beyond the typical 2 to 4 years of study post-intervention for many of these evaluations.
Although the use of financial incentives to promote wellness holds some promise for increasing the use of wellness services, the long-term impacts on Medicaid spending are not known.
Complex Care Management
Medicaid programs, health systems, and communities are experimenting with efficient and effective approaches to identifying and engaging with high-cost, high-use enrollees, commonly referred to as super-utilizers. The expectation is that targeted, often intense care management of these individuals will lead to reductions in unnecessary use and greater connections to needed community-based resources. Controlling costs in this population can have a significant impact on total Medicaid spending given that an estimated 5% of Medicaid beneficiaries with complex medical and psychosocial needs account for 54% of total Medicaid spending. 29 Super-utilizer programs have expanded considerably in the last decade, with substantial support from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and foundations such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 30,31 These care management programs vary widely in the population targeted, methods for deciding who is eligible for services, and the scope and intensity of services offered.
Evidence that super-utilizer programs in Medicaid can reduce the use and costs of care is mixed. Although some programs have found success, others have not realized significant reductions or savings. Many programs find substantial changes in use or expenditures after providing care management service to super-utilizers. 32 Because program participants have extreme use and costs at baseline, their use and commensurate costs at a later date will often be lower, a phenomenon known as regression to the mean. 33,34 Without a group of individuals to compare trends in use over time, regression to the mean cannot be ruled out as a possible explanation for use and spending reductions. A closer examination of programs that have employed more rigorous study designs have noted that the impact of complex care management programs among Medicaid and the uninsured are mixed. 35,36,37,38 Some programs have shown success in reducing ED visits, hospital admissions, inpatient expenditures, and total Medicaid expenditures, 39,40,41,42 while other programs have noted no change in outcomes or reductions in use and expenditures that did not reach statistical significance. 43,44,45 The evidence is not any stronger in Medicare, with one evaluation of a large-scale care coordination program finding minimal impact on use and expenditures. 46
Reductions in use and costs of care may depend on which populations are offered CCM services. Some evaluations have found that changes in use can vary over time, with some showing immediate impact and others suggesting that reductions accrue over time. 47 Others have also found that subgroups within a program (e.g., people who engage more or the highest risk individuals) are relatively more successful in reducing use and costs compared to the other subgroups or the full population under study. 48,49 Thus, the cost savings generated from lower use depend on targeting resources to the population most amenable to change.
Evidence that super-utilizer programs can generate net savings for Medicaid remains unknown. Reductions in high-cost services such as hospitalizations and ED visits may indicate the potential for reduced health care spending. However, it is unclear if cost savings are achieved from reduced use once the costs of implementing and administering a care management program are considered. Several studies suggest that net savings are possible or may be feasible after several years if significant reductions in total Medicaid costs are realized. However, if significant cost reductions are not achieved, financial losses attributable to the program can be high because these programs can be costly if the care management model relies on intense follow-up and frequent interactions with a care manager. 50,51 Given the lack of information regarding net savings in Medicaid, lessons from Medicare may provide insight for Medicaid. An evaluation of Medicare-funded care coordination programs found little evidence that Medicare savings, when generated, were great enough to offset care coordination fees. 52
There is insufficient evidence that supportive housing reduces total Medicaid costs. Supportive housing is an emerging model that provides care and case management as well as stable housing to homeless or precariously housed patients. 53 Evaluations of these relatively new efforts are limited, and even more so for the Medicaid population, but small programs in Oregon, New York City, and Chicago have reported some positive results for reduced use and/or spending. 54,55,56,57 Several states are currently experimenting with leveraging Medicaid funds to support individuals in these settings, so more may be known about the effect of these programs in coming years.
Complex care management programs to target super-utilizers are promising, but prior studies employing rigorous evaluation designs are not conclusive that these programs can consistently reduce use and costs. Programs vary considerably in their design, and success may lie in being able to effectively target the right mix of care management resources to the right population at the right level of intensity. These programs can be expensive, and the return on investment as a viable cost-containment strategy is still not fully understood.
Patient-Centered Medical Homes
Over the last several decades, primary care has struggled to meet the needs of patients in the face of a health care system that incentivizes providers to furnish more care and that emphasizes specialty and acute care over prevention and population health management and care fragmentation over coordination and patient-centeredness. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an approach to redesigning primary care to be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, patient- or family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. A team of providers takes collective responsibility for the patient and coordinates care across health systems and within a community. PCMH models are very diverse, but the expectation for any model is that this coordinated approach will improve access to care, patient experience, and quality of care, as well as reduce costs, largely by reducing high-cost services such as ED and hospital use. 58 However, if ED and hospital use do not substantially decrease, overall costs could increase if PCMHs are successful at delivering unmet needed care and connecting patients to services.
There has been widespread adoption of the PCMH model. Currently, 26 state Medicaid agencies are operating PCMH programs, often within the context of broader Medicaid redesign efforts. 59,60 These programs provide enhanced Medicaid payments to PCMHs either through additional fee-for-service payments or through Medicaid managed care contract requirements. Practices use these enhanced payments, often termed care management fees, to support their PCMH activities.
Evidence that PCMHs can reduce Medicaid use and costs is mixed. Few rigorous evaluations examine the impact on Medicaid populations only, 61,62 but implications for Medicaid may be drawn from an extensive literature on PCMH effectiveness. Some evaluations have documented associations between PCMHs and reduced ED and hospital use, lower total costs of care and costs for specific services, and improvements in quality of care relative to matched comparison groups. Other evaluations, also employing rigorous study designs with matched comparison groups, have found no change or minimal change in these outcomes. 63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73 Systematic reviews that compare results across many medical home evaluations also find that PCMHs are not consistently associated with reductions in ED visits, hospital stays, or total costs of care relative to matched comparisons, but they do improve quality. 74,75,76 One potentially promising finding across several of the systematic reviews suggests that PCMHs may differentially benefit individuals with more significant health needs (e.g., older adults and individuals who are more ill). Some review studies have found that these groups may experience reductions in high-cost use and total costs that are not found in a general population, 77,78,79,80 but other large-scale evaluations of Medicare-funded comprehensive primary care activities have found modest results, at best, for older individuals. 81,82,83
Net savings may be challenging to achieve. A less-studied but critical consideration when assessing cost containment is the impact these programs have on net savings. Several large-scale, multi-site PCMH initiatives funded by Medicare commonly experience net losses because reductions in total spending do not offset PCMH payments to practices. 84,85,86 Evidence in Medicaid is much more limited, but one study of Iowa’s Medicaid Health Home initiative (see description of health homes below) did find evidence for reductions in total cost even after accounting for PCMH payments. 87
Program heterogeneity and short evaluation periods may contribute to lack of consistent findings. Considering the diversity of programs in terms of target population, supporting payers, and implementation approach, there is no clear evidence that one type of setting or approach to PCMHs performs better than another. This inherent heterogeneity across programs may explain the lack of consistent findings. Further, the relatively short time over which PCMH patients are followed (typically 1 to 3 years after a PCMH initiative’s implementation) may also contribute to lack of findings. Qualitative studies of PCMH initiatives often find that the first couple years of PCMH transformation are devoted to identifying which services, supports, and processes need to be in place and redesigning work flows accordingly, so the full benefits of delivery system redesign may not be immediately realized. 88
There is little evidence to determine if the Medicaid health home program can reduce total Medicaid costs. The concept that individuals with greater needs may benefit most from the medical home is of importance for state Medicaid programs. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid programs can establish health homes for enrollees who have or are at risk for multiple chronic conditions or who have at least one serious and persistent mental health condition. Health homes are similar to PCMHs, but they specifically target individuals with chronic conditions and emphasize physical and behavioral health integration as well as improved linkages to community and social supports and long-term services and supports. 89 Twenty-two states have implemented the Medicaid health home program. 90 A 5-year evaluation of the initiative sponsored by the federal government is ongoing, and findings on the impact of health homes on use and costs are not yet available. 91 However, a couple of state-funded evaluations of health home programs have reported some significant decreases in service-specific use and costs. 92,93
The PCMH model, and the more recent Medicaid health home model, has experienced widespread support, and public and private payers continue to invest in this model. The ability of the PCMH to effect significant change on total health care costs and high-cost use remains inconclusive. By themselves, PCMHs may be challenged to contain Medicaid cost growth, but they may serve as an integral component of a larger cost containment strategy such as alternative payment models or ACOs.
Alternative Payment Models
Under fee-for-service, there is little financial incentive to manage and coordinate patient care. Therefore, Medicaid programs are experimenting with alternative payment models (APMs) that task providers with managing the cost and quality of a defined population, sometimes within a defined budget, in exchange for bonus payments for staying within a budget or meeting cost and quality goals. 94 In an effort to stay under spending targets, providers may avoid caring for the sickest patients or may not recommend needed but costly services, so quality goals or other incentives are included in these models to guard against barriers to access and quality. There are many different APMs, and here we focus on several relatively new APMs—accountable care organizations (ACOs), episode-based payment, and global budgeting. Because many of these models are new, evidence for their effectiveness in Medicaid is very limited. Therefore, we highlight findings from Medicare and commercial payers to illustrate, when necessary, what may be feasible under these models.
Accountable Care Organizations
ACOs are groups of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers who voluntarily agree to share responsibility for the health care delivery and outcomes for a defined population. ACOs are expected to reign in cost growth by providing coordinated, high-quality care. When cost and/or quality goals are achieved and cost savings are generated, providers share the savings. ACOs typically choose to accept either one-sided or two-sided risk. With one-sided risk, the ACO will share in savings if it meets certain cost and quality targets. With two-sided risk, providers share in savings (the savings will be higher than one-sided risk options), but they also pay back money if certain targets are not met.
Limited evidence from one state Medicaid program and Medicare suggests that ACOs could reduce total Medicaid costs. At least 10 states are in the early stages of operating Medicaid ACOs, with many opting for one-sided risk. 95 Some states have reported reductions in total Medicaid expenditure growth under the ACO when compared to expected expenditure growth from historical trends; reductions in inpatient and ED visits were also achieved. 96 With the exception of Oregon, discussed in greater detail in the “Global Budgeting Model” section, there are no rigorous evaluations comparing spending trends to a matched comparison group. Given the lack of rigorous Medicaid evaluations to date, evidence from Medicare’s ACO initiatives may inform expectations for Medicaid. Early results from evaluations of the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) and Pioneer ACO program have shown modest savings in total cost of care and improved quality when ACO participants are compared to a control group. Cost reductions are generally driven by reductions in acute and post-acute settings, and some have also seen reductions in outpatient and physician services. Savings also tend to be greater for ACOs with higher baseline spending, and those with more experience operating in risk-based payment models. 97,98,99,100 The ability to sustain cost reductions beyond 2 years of implementation remains to be seen. At this early stage, the programs result in a net loss to Medicare because reductions in total spending have not been great enough to offset the shared savings bonus payments paid to high-performing ACOs. 101 Because most ACOs are currently operating with one-sided risk only, the relative effectiveness of taking on more risk is unknown.
Episode-based Payment Model
The episode-based payment model places financial risk on providers for a set of services to treat a clinical condition (e.g., acute asthma exacerbation) or conduct a procedure (e.g., total joint replacement). Providers held responsible for the episode of care are rewarded, are penalized, or remain financially neutral depending on how actual costs of care and/or quality compare to a predetermined threshold.
There is no evidence yet to determine if episode-based payment models reduce total Medicaid costs. Initiatives to test episode-based payment are relatively new across payers, and Medicaid programs are just now beginning to experiment with this model. Evidence on model success to date primarily comes from Medicare. The largest initiative began in 2013 when the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) launched the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative to test 48 episodes of care within Medicare. In the first year of operation, changes in Medicare expenditures were not notably different for BPCI providers relative to a comparison group of providers. 102 In a separate study of BPCI providers focused solely on lower extremity joint replacement episodes, the rate of Medicare spending decreased for BPCI providers relative to a comparison group, without a significant change in quality. 103 Arkansas and Tennessee are leaders in episode-based payment within Medicaid. Launched in 2012, the Arkansas Payment Improvement Initiative involves Medicaid and commercial payers in an episode-based payment model for 14 episodes. 104 One report stated that Arkansas’ model is reducing the growth of Medicaid spending compared to historical trends, but a rigorous evaluation of the model is not yet available. 105 Tennessee launched the first episodes of care for its Medicaid providers in January 2015, and analyses of model impact are not yet available. 106
Global Budgeting Model
Global budgeting places a spending limit on an entity such as an ACO or a hospital. In exchange for taking on the risk of staying within the budget, the entity is given flexibility in how it pays providers and designs services, often choosing a suite of services that are tailored to the needs of the providers’ target population.
There is insufficient evidence that global budgets may reduce total Medicaid costs. Few global budget models have been examined in depth. Oregon’s Medicaid ACO program, mentioned above, prospectively pays ACOs for risk-adjusted total costs of care for an attributed population. One study found that when compared with a neighboring state, Oregon had experienced a decrease in total Medicaid costs, primarily due to decreases in inpatient admissions, but Oregon also saw reductions in primary care visits and related costs, which raises questions about the ability of the program to sustain access to primary care. Cost reductions were greater for adults compared to children and for individuals at high risk for use and morbidity. 107 A commercial sector program in Massachusetts found lower total expenditures relative to a control group for adults, but not for children, and did not compromise quality of care. 108,109 Net savings (after factoring in bonuses and shared savings) were not realized until later in the program. 110 An all-payer, global hospital budget program implemented in 2014 in Maryland has shown some promise at reducing hospital costs to Medicare in the first year of operations but little change in total Medicare costs relative to a comparison group. Medicaid and commercial data are not yet available. 111
Because Medicaid programs are only recently beginning to experiment with ACOs, episode-based payments, and global budgets, there is very limited evidence on the effectiveness of these models to contain Medicaid costs. Modest declines in spending attributable to Medicare ACOs 1 or 2 years after implementation suggests that reduced spending may be feasible within the ACO model but that net savings may take time to realize, and Oregon’s early success with Medicaid ACOs and global budgets may hold promise for cost containment. Further, experience managing one population (e.g., Medicare or commercial) does not guarantee that providers will know how to effectively manage a higher-needs, higher-cost Medicaid population. Providers will need time to learn which package of services and supports will be most effective at managing costs, quality, and use in the short and long term. Given the evidence thus far, the utility of APMs to reduce long-term Medicaid cost growth and generate net savings for Medicaid programs remains uncertain.
Strategies to Reduce Medicaid Long-Term Care Spending
Tightening Financial Eligibility Rules for Long-Term Care Services
Most elderly and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries are eligible for Supplemental Security Income, the income support program for low-income older people, blind persons, and people with disabilities. The maximum federal Supplemental Security Income monthly benefit is $735 for an individual or $1,103 for a couple (73 percent of the federal poverty level in 2017). Individuals receiving SSI must have low incomes and countable assets of no more than $2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a couple. 112 The asset levels have not increased since the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984.
Certain assets are excluded from the Medicaid financial eligibility determination. In 2017, the value of the family home up to $560,000 is exempt and states can exempt up to $840,000 in personal and household items 113 and some or all qualified retirement accounts (e.g., 401(k) and individual retirement accounts [IRAs]) in most states. 114 Spousal impoverishment rules also protect the financial status of the spouse not receiving Medicaid nursing home or HCBS benefits. 115
Medicaid also provides coverage to people who originally had income and assets above the Medicaid eligibility level but who spent down because of the high cost of medical care and LTSS. 116,117 For example, examining people age 50 and older who spent down to Medicaid over the 1996/98 to 2008 period 118 estimated that 66 percent of Medicaid nursing home residents spent down.
Because Medicare does not cover LTSS and few people have private LTC insurance and services are expensive, some people transfer their assets to relatives at less than fair market value for the purpose of appearing artificially poor and obtaining Medicaid eligibility. To discourage Medicaid applicants from transferring assets, Medicaid prohibits such transfers. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 established a look-back period of 60 months to establish whether transfers occurred. 119 Should transfers occur during this period, states can impose a period of ineligibility for Medicaid that is related to the amount of assets transferred. 120 Some observers believe that there is a significant amount of unallowable transfer of assets. 121,122 The Government Accountability Office 123 found that although most states ask applicants to document income and asset information, very few require documentation going back for 5 years.
In addition to prohibitions against transfer of assets, as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress mandated that states implement estate recovery programs to recoup the cost of Medicaid LTSS from the estate of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries.
To capture additional private resources to offset Medicaid spending, some observers have proposed tightening transfer of asset rules and more aggressively enforcing these rules and estate recovery. More recently, some observers have proposed stricter rules about what should be considered excluded assets. Warshawsky and Marchand 124 argue that retirement income generating assets such as IRAs should be counted toward the Medicaid assets limit.
Asset Transfer
Most empirical research on transfer of assets has found that relatively little transfer takes place or that the amount transferred is small. 125,126,127 Examining the population age 50 and older, Wiener et al. 128 found that people who spend down to Medicaid are much less likely to transfer their assets than are people who do not spend down to Medicaid. Among respondents age 65 and older who spent down to Medicaid, 24.7 percent of people transferred more than $500 to children, compared to 41.6 percent of people who did not spend down. In a study using the 1993 to 2002 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, Lee et al. 129 found that between 9 and 15 percent of new Medicaid beneficiaries living in nursing homes had transferred assets to their families, but that the average amount was about $4,000—an amount that is below the cost of 1 month of nursing home care in most of the country.
To understand the extent to which asset sheltering is practiced, the Government Accountability Office 130 conducted a review of 465 Medicaid nursing application files in three states. Of these applicants, about 10 percent (47) had transferred assets at less than the fair market value for the then 36-month 131 look-back penalty period. The median value of the transferred assets was just over $15,000. The length of the penalty period assessed for the improper transfer averaged 6 months, although for nine of the applicants there was no penalty because it would have been less than 1 month.
Moreover, survey data suggest that most severely disabled older people have little in the way of assets; people cannot transfer large amounts of assets if they do not have them. In their analysis of Medicaid spend down, Wiener et al. 132 found that the spend-down group had few asset at baseline, in a period up to 10 years prior to spend down: the median total wealth (not including IRAs) for the spend-down group was $33,000 compared with $135,000 for people age 50 and older who did not spend down. Non-housing assets for the spend-down group averaged $24,000 compared to $86,000 for the non–spend-down group and the median net home equity was $17,000 and $68,000, respectively. Similarly, Spillman and Waidmann 133 found that those most likely to transition to Medicaid were those in the poor and near poor income groups 134 and those who were not homeowners. Conversely, for those in the higher income group who did not use nursing homes the Medicaid transition rate was less than 0.5 percent (although for those who did use nursing home care, the transition rate went up to 5 percent).
Moreover, the financial wealth 135 of adults with disabilities, who are most likely to use LTSS, is much lower than for those without limitations. Using the Health and Retirement Study, Johnson 136 found that the 2012 median financial wealth for people age 65 and over with two or more activities of daily living (ADL) impairments was $8,300, compared to $104,300 for those who did not have limitations. Furthermore, 31 percent of those with two or more ADL limitations had no financial assets at all. Johnson and Wiener 137 reported that frail older adults with disabilities start off with less wealth then their healthier counterparts and that the gap widens over time.
Estate Recovery
Current efforts to recover Medicaid LTSS expenditures from the estates of deceased beneficiaries have not yielded large amounts of funds. A 2015 survey conducted by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission 138 found that in fiscal year 2014 states collected $589.2 million from beneficiaries’ estates, about 0.1 percent of total Medicaid spending. Warshawsky and Marchand 139 extrapolated that if every state performed at the level of the states with the highest recovery efforts, then about $2.4 billion annually could be recovered, about 0.5 percent of total Medicaid spending. As noted above, Medicaid LTSS beneficiaries are likely to have few assets of any significant value.
States would need to overcome both operational and symbolic barriers if they are to implement more aggressive estate recovery programs. Operationally, they will need to hire additional staffing to identify and recover money from the estates of deceased Medicaid beneficiaries. Because of the complex interaction between Medicaid rules with state property, probate, homestead and creditor laws, recovery efforts are conducted on a case-by-case basis, a time-consuming and potentially expensive process. Moreover, pursuing the estates of deceased older people may be politically unpopular.
Including Retirement Accounts as Countable Assets
Despite the change from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions, many retirees have limited savings in retirement savings mechanisms, such as 401(k)s and IRAs. Using the Health and Retirement Study (1993-2008), Poterba et al. 140 show that older people do not have much in terms of retirement assets. In 2008 only 20.9 percent of all households (single and married) aged 85 and older had personal retirement assets in IRAs, Keoghs, 401(k)s, and similar retirement savings mechanisms. The average personal retirement value for all households was $15,069, but the median holding was zero for both single and married couples’ households. Thus, including retirement accounts is unlikely to yield significant savings, again because few Medicaid beneficiaries are likely to have high balances in their accounts.
Retirement accounts are generally excluded from determining Medicaid eligibility because they are the source of income for retirees and must be withdrawn at a regular schedule designed to match projected mortality rates. Given that almost half of nursing home residents are age 85 or older, 141 there is unlikely to be much left in the retirement accounts. Forcing Medicaid applicants to rapidly deplete their retirement accounts could result in a lack of income if institutionalized beneficiaries return to the community and higher Medicaid spending in later years. Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing homes are required to contribute all their income, including from retirement account withdrawals, toward their cost of care, except for small personal needs allowances; Medicaid only pays the difference between the remaining amount. Thus, if the retirement accounts are depleted before a person becomes a beneficiary, there will be less available to contribute to the cost of care in later years.
Prevention of asset transfer, more aggressive estate recovery, and counting retirement savings have been proposed as Medicaid cost saving measures as ways to bring additional private resources into LTSS financing. However, empirical evidence indicates that savings would be small and offset to some extent by additional administrative expenses states would need to incur. Studies suggest that transfer of substantial amounts of assets by people applying for Medicaid is relatively rare. Moreover, older people with substantial disabilities have limited assets in most cases, giving them little to transfer. Because people needing LTSS have little in the way of assets, estate recovery programs and claiming retirement savings are unlikely to yield substantial additional savings.
Private Long-Term Care Insurance
Medicaid provides coverage for LTSS not only for people who are poor, but also for people who have become poor because of the high cost of services, especially nursing home care. 142,143 Some advocates of private LTC insurance have argued that purchase of policies by middle-class people could reduce Medicaid LTSS expenditures by preventing policyholders from depleting their income and assets when they use LTSS services. 144 In 2012, 7.4 million people had private LTC insurance, about 2.4 percent of the American population. 145 In 2014, only about 11.5 percent of people age 40-70 had private LTC insurance, and purchase was heavily skewed toward people with higher incomes and assets. 146,147 This upper-income/asset orientation is not surprising given that the policies are expensive; in the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance Program, 148 a policy purchased at age 65 that covers 3 years of care at $150 per day with a 4 percent inflation adjustment costs approximately $2,600 a year.
The ability of private LTC insurance to reduce Medicaid LTSS expenditures depends partly on whether people who purchase the policies would otherwise be Medicaid beneficiaries. It also depends on the general state of the market for private LTC insurance and whether there are companies actively marketing products.
Microsimulation studies of the potential impact of private LTC insurance on Medicaid LTSS expenditures find little to no effect even far into the future. Using the Urban Institute’s DYNASIM Model, Favreault, Gleckman, and Johnson 149 analyzed the effect of three types of private LTC insurance—a policy that provided coverage for the first part of a nursing home or HCBS stay, a policy that only provided coverage after a long deductible period, and a policy that provides comprehensive benefits—on Medicaid expenditures. In the current voluntary purchase scenario, in 2070, the policies reduced Medicaid LTSS expenditures by between zero and 1 percent. With a subsidy for purchase, the impact increased from 2 to 7 percent, but Medicaid savings would be offset by the cost of the subsidy. Higher levels of subsidy would likely increase the savings, but also the cost of the subsidy. In contrast, a mandatory public LTC program would reduce managed LTSS expenditures by between 7 and 35 percent; again Medicaid savings would be offset by the cost of the public insurance plan. These findings of little or no impact of private LTC insurance are consistent with earlier analyses conducted by Wiener, Illston, & Hanley 150 and Rivlin and Wiener. 151
One approach to expand the market would be for the government to pay the LTSS costs beyond what is covered in an approved private LTC insurance policy. This strategy provides lifetime coverage without requiring people to buy a costly private LTC insurance policy that provides lifetime benefits, a type of policy that has largely disappeared from the marketplace. A version of this approach, the Long-Term Care Partnership, is currently being implemented in many states, with Medicaid providing the government backup. This approach has not generated a large increase in sales. As of June 30, 2011, 43 states had adopted the Partnership approach, with approximately 630,000 policies in force. 152 Studies differ as to whether the LTC Partnership will modestly reduce or increase Medicaid LTSS expenditures. 153,154,155
The private LTC insurance market is in sharp decline, and the future role of the product as a source of financing for LTSS for the general population is in doubt. The ability of private LTC insurance to produce Medicaid savings depends on whether insurance companies are actively marketing policies. In 2002, the market started to unravel as private LTC insurance sales plummeted and companies left the market. Additionally, after a steady increase in the number of LTC insurance policies in force between 1992 and 2005, the number of insured lives remained relatively flat—at about 7.4 million—between 2005 and 2012. 156 Additionally, new sales fell precipitously; in 2013, only 172,000 new private LTC policies were sold. 157,158,159 New policies that link insurance with life insurance or annuities have come on the market with modest success, but they are targeted at people with large amounts of assets. Although 125 companies had competed in the private LTC insurance market in 2000, by 2012, fewer than 15 insurance companies remained that actively sold standalone LTC insurance. 160
Most of the remaining insurers have substantially increased their premiums, including for existing policyholders. A doubling in premiums from one year to the next has not been uncommon. Further, LTC insurers have tightened their underwriting while reducing benefits, making it more difficult for people to buy policies. 161 A recent study estimated that 40 percent of the general population aged 50-71 could not pass the medical underwriting for private LTC insurance. 162
Although the decline in the private LTC insurance market began in 2002, the more recent collapse of the LTC insurance market can be traced to the Great Recession. 163 Because of the low interest rates during the recession and thereafter, the returns on reserves held by insurers fell well below the actuarial assumptions used to determine initial premiums. Thus, the reserves were inadequate to cover both actual and expected claims. Furthermore, the lapse rate—the proportion of individuals who discontinue their insurance—was lower than actuarial predictions, which meant that companies were required to pay claims on policies they had not expected to be in force. The resulting rise in premiums engendered bad publicity and hard feelings toward many insurance companies.
It has long been the hope of private LTC insurance advocates that wide-scale purchase of the product would result in substantial Medicaid savings. This market penetration has not occurred for a variety of reasons, two of which are most important. First, private LTC insurance is expensive and without large, costly subsidies is unlikely to be affordable by many middle-class families. Thus, the product does not reach far enough down the income distribution to include many people who would otherwise spend down to Medicaid and result in program savings. Second, the private LTC insurance market is in disarray. The number of companies selling policies has declined precipitously over the last 15 years and the industry views the product as posing substantial risk. Thus, the total number of policies has stagnated and it is unlikely that private LTC insurance will be more than a niche product for upper-moderate and higher income people with substantial amounts of assets.
Expanding Home and Community-Based Services
Many policymakers and consumer advocates have long argued that expanding HCBS is a way of reducing the use of expensive institutional care, such as nursing homes and intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities. HCBS includes a broad spectrum of services, including personal care, home health, adult day service centers, residential care facilities, home-delivered meals, habilitation, job coaching, and personal response systems. In addition to the desire for Medicaid savings, quality of care problems in nursing homes and other institutional settings and the U.S. Supreme Court’s Olmstead v L.C. decision (which held that the unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities is illegal discrimination) have placed pressure on states to expand HCBS services. Further, survey data show that Americans have a strong preference for aging in place. Few Americans would choose to move into a nursing home in the event of a disability, 164 and most wish to stay in their current residence and local community if possible. 165
Historically, Medicaid LTSS spending has been primarily for institutional care, rather than HCBS. However, the balance of care has been changing toward HCBS, and in 2013, Medicaid HCBS spending surpassed institutional spending for the first time. 166 This shift reflected decades of rebalancing efforts at both the federal and state levels, bolstered in recent years by Affordable Care Act provisions, such as the Money Follows the Person Demonstration and the Balancing Incentive Program, and new and expanded state plan options under Section 1915 (k) Community First Choice and Section 1915 (i). Medicaid HCBS spending reached $80.6 billion in FY 2014, with the new federal authorities alone accounting for 7.4 percent of total HCBS expenditures. The three largest Medicaid HCBS services (Section 1915 (c) waivers, state plan personal care, and state plan home health) helped nearly 3 million Medicaid enrollees in 2013. 167 Despite rapid growth in services, waiting lists for Medicaid HCBS waivers continue to grow; nationally, with more than 640,000 people on waiting lists in 2015.
Although proponents of HCBS believe savings can be achieved by substituting high-cost institutional services with lower cost HCBS, the research literature is mixed. Several studies have shown small or nonstatistically significant reductions in nursing home use resulting from HCBS expansion. 168,169,170 One review of the literature found that HCBS use reduces nursing home admissions by an average of 3.15 percent. 171
On the other hand, other studies have found a stronger impact. Segelman et al. 172 also found that increasing HCBS spending at the state and local levels by $1,000 per waiver enrollee per month was associated with an 8 to 14 percent reduction in the risk of long-term nursing home admission. Similarly, Thomas, Keohane, & Mor 173 found that increased Medicaid HCBS spending is associated with lower rates of nursing home admissions among younger people with disabilities. A study on Medicaid LTSS spending in Michigan showed that HCBS cuts were associated with increased permanent nursing home placement. 174 Studies also find that the availability of HCBS increases the disability severity of nursing home residents 175,176 and reduces the prevalence of nursing home residents with low-intensity care needs, 177 suggesting that HCBS expansion may divert individuals with fewer care needs from nursing homes.
One issue in achieving cost savings is whether the people receiving HCBS would be institutionalized without the services. Although few studies directly examine differences between HCBS waiver participants and nursing home residents, studies comparing these two populations found some evidence that nursing home residents exhibit more ADL dependencies and cognitive impairment than HCBS waiver participants. 178,179,180 Waiver participants also may have more social supports available to them. 181,182
Moreover, relatively few waiver participants end up being institutionalized, which may reflect the effectiveness of the program or may suggest that the program is serving a different population. The Weissert and Frederick 183 literature review concluded that fewer than one-quarter of people identified as being at risk of institutionalization (or nursing home-certifiable) end up being admitted to a nursing home within the same year. Studies of Section 1915(c) waiver enrollees have found that 17 to 19 percent of enrollees transitioned to nursing homes over the study period. 184,185 This research suggests that HCBS may not reduce Medicaid expenditures because participants would not otherwise be institutionalized; thus, large increases in HCBS use are offset by only modest reductions in institutional service use.
Similarly, studies examining the cost savings of HCBS programs show mixed results. Early studies from the 1980s, including the evaluation of the Channeling demonstration, found that expanding HCBS did not result in overall cost savings. 186,187,188,189
Although extensive research demonstrates that Medicaid HCBS cost less per service user than institutional settings, 190,191,192,193 these studies usually do not match nursing home residents and HCBS participants on characteristics such as availability of informal caregivers and disability levels and do not address issues of whether HCBS successfully target people who would otherwise be institutionalized.
More recent analyses are more favorable to the ability of HCBS to achieve savings. Kaye, LaPlante, and Harrington 194 found that states with higher HCBS expenditures saw slower Medicaid LTSS spending growth than states with lower HCBS expenditures. However, while states expanding HCBS saw an increase in LTSS expenditures, states with established programs saw some reduction in the rate of increase in overall LTSS spending after a few years. Thus, cost savings may depend on the states’ level of investment in expanding HCBS and the maturity of the HCBS programs.
A 2013 review of 38 studies of publicly funded HCBS programs showed wide variation among programs in different states, but promising results related to cost savings. 195 Some programs (e.g., Georgia’s SOURCE program, which is the state’s HCBS waiver for aged, blind, and disabled individuals and individuals who qualify for nursing facility care) found per capita savings when comparing HCBS to nursing home expenditures, and others demonstrated overall savings from nursing home diversion and transition efforts (e.g., Arkansas’s Community Connector Program, West Virginia’s Money Follows the Person program). The review also highlighted other promising outcomes of HCBS programs, including improved health status, client satisfaction, and service access.
A cross-state evaluation of the Money Follows the Person demonstration, which transitions people from institutions to the community, found a 16 percent decrease in total Medicare and Medicaid expenditures post-transition among older adults with no mental health conditions, a 20 percent decrease among older adults with a mental health condition, and an 18 percent decrease among younger adults with physical disabilities. 196 Despite large investments in resources over several years, however, relatively few people have been transitioned to the community; from January 2008 to December 2015, approximately 63,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in institutions had been transitioned to the community. 197 Although there is overlap from year to year, on average there are about 1,000,000 Medicaid beneficiaries each year in nursing homes. Thus, the proportion of residents transferred back to the community has been small.
Proponents also suggest that HCBS expansion may result in Medicaid savings by reducing use of acute and post-acute care services. However, some recent studies show that the effect of HCBS on medical care may be complex. Wysocki et al. 198 found that dual-eligible Medicare-Medicaid enrollees who used HCBS were 1 percent more likely to experience a potentially avoidable hospitalization, and dual-eligible HCBS users who had transitioned from a nursing home were 40 percent more likely to experience a potentially avoidable hospitalization. 199 In an analysis of six states, Wiener et al. 200 found that higher HCBS expenditures slightly increased other Medicaid spending. Within the Money Follows the Person demonstration, non-LTSS expenditures (e.g., inpatient and post-acute) remained the same or declined during this post-transition period. One study of dual-eligible beneficiaries in California found average monthly differences of $174 for acute care services and $20 for post-acute services between HCBS users compared to nursing home residents, with HCBS participants having lower ex­­penditures. 201 Evidence of overall Medicaid savings on acute and post-acute expenditures, however, remains limited.
Over the last 30 years, policymakers and consumer advocates have successfully sought to expand Medicaid HCBS. The current financing system is moving steadily in the direction of more spending on HCBS and less on institutional services. Under the current Medicaid structure, continued shifts from institutional to HCBS services are likely to continue, allowing states to capitalize on any savings. Although a longstanding research topic in LTSS, recent research on the cost savings to be achieved through expanding HCBS has mixed results, although more recent studies are more favorable. Especially since the widespread use of the Medicaid HCBS waivers, states are serving a population with greater functional needs, exercising control over the number of waiver slots, targeting waiver services to certain populations or geographic areas, and using lower cost participant-directed care rather than agencies. 202,203 There may be reasons other than cost savings to pursue policies expanding beneficiary access to HCBS, such as improved health outcomes or increased enrollee satisfaction.
Managed Long-Term Care Services
The financing and service delivery of medical care, LTSS, and behavioral health for older people and younger people with disabilities are splintered and uncoordinated. 204,205,206 Fragmentation exists within and across these multiple systems. For example, financing for medical and post-acute care for dual-eligible beneficiaries is primarily a federal responsibility through Medicare, whereas financing for LTSS is primarily a state responsibility through Medicaid. Because of this bifurcation of responsibility, medical care providers have little incentive to be concerned about the LTSS needs of their patients and LTSS providers have little incentive to be concerned about the medical care needs of their consumers. As result, care is not coordinated, utilization of expensive services and costs may be higher than necessary, and quality of care is sometimes poor.
To address this problem, states and the federal government are increasingly turning to managed care, where a single entity is responsible for medical care and LTSS. The expectation is that integrated delivery models will improve quality of care, enhance the beneficiary experience with care and services, and help control expenditure growth.
In Medicaid managed LTSS programs, the managed care organization is responsible for a range of LTSS or a range of LTSS and medical services. During the past decade the number of states with managed LTSS programs has also grown from 8 in 2004 to 21 in 2016, and with an additional 8 states having plans to implement managed LTSS. 207,208 In 2014, between 500,000 and 1.7 million Medicaid beneficiaries were served by managed LTSS programs. 209 To operate managed LTSS programs, states need Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approval of state plan amendments, but have flexibility in deciding the populations that will be served, the types of services covered, whether enrollment is mandatory or voluntary, and the type of payment methodology used to compensate providers. 210,211
In addition, CMS has developed the Financial Alignment Initiative to test demonstrations of integrated care and financing models for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees. 212 The goal of these demonstrations is to develop person-centered care delivery models that integrate medical, behavioral health, and LTSS for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees. Under this initiative, CMS made two models available to states: (1) a capitated model in which managed health plans receive Medicare and Medicaid payments for the full range of health services and LTSS, and (2) a managed fee-for-service model in which states are eligible to benefit financially from savings resulting from initiatives that improve quality and reduce costs. Ten states—California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia—are participating in the managed care model and two states—Colorado and Washington—are participating in the managed fee-for-service model. 213
Although there is some evidence that the use of managed LTSS can lead to lower utilization of some services like preventable emergency room visits, hospital stays, and institutional services—factors typically associated with high spending—cost studies have offered mixed evidence on overall savings. 214 The Financial Alignment Initiative is still underway and final quantitative results are not available.
Evaluations of managed LTSS from the mid-2000s found inconclusive and inconsistent evidence that these programs produced savings. Furthermore, given that some of these programs included a large fraction of dual-eligible enrollees, it was not clear if the Medicaid savings accrued had simply been shifted costs from Medicaid to Medicare. 215,216, 217 Grabowski reported that of the six programs he reviewed—PACE, Wisconsin Family Care, Minnesota MSHO, Arizona ALTCS, S/HMO II in Nevada, and Texas STAR+PLUS—only two—Arizona ALTCS and Texas STAR+PLUS programs—offered good evidence of savings. In comparing the ALTCS cost estimates with what the traditional Medicaid program would have cost for the first 5 years of the program, ALTCS costs were on average 16 percent per year lower. 218 Benchmarked against predicted fee-for-service expenditures had the program not been implemented, the Texas STAR+PLUS was estimated to have 17 percent savings. 219 These two studies suffered from significant methodological limitations, hence the findings should be viewed with caution. Another program that has shown promising potential for cost savings is New Mexico’s managed LTSS CoLTS program. An independent evaluation conducted in 2011 found it to be cost-effective and actuarially sound. Specifically, it found that participating MCOs’ per member per month spending was just below their capitated costs. 220
A major challenge in managed care arrangements for LTSS is setting the capitation rate so that MCOs have adequate funds to provide care to beneficiaries, provide care management, market the plans and cover other administrative needs, and still achieve savings. A rule of thumb for marketing and standard administrative costs in managed care plans and other employer-based insurance is about 10 percent of costs and care management might be another 5 percent of costs, leaving perhaps 85 percent of standard fee-for-service expenditures for both services and profit to the managed care organization. Rates that are too low will discourage plans from participating, force them to drop out of the arrangement, or provide a disincentive to offer optimal care. For states that have low fee-for-service rates to begin with, designing capitation rates below them will be difficult. In this case, achieving savings will be difficult and will require substantial reductions in utilization of expensive health care services, such as hospitals and nursing homes. 221
The expansion of programs that use MCOs to integrate LTSS and medical care could facilitate improved services and lower costs. However, despite the popularity of these initiatives, there is a marked paucity of evaluations of their effectiveness in lowering unnecessary utilization and expenditures and improving quality of care. Although they provide opportunities for better care and lower costs, managed care always carries risks because of the financial incentives to provide less care and to contract with only low-cost providers.

The Potential of a Population Health Strategy to Improve Healthcare Outcomes and Reduce Costs for Medicaid Programs

With Medicaid consuming a larger share of the Mississippi's budget, innovative solutions were needed to deliver improved health outcomes at a lower cost. A public-private partnership was created to pursued a population health strategy aimed at reducing preterm births and preventing the progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.
The rising cost of healthcare in the United States is a concern not only for individuals and families but also for corporations and both state and federal governments. This is particularly true of Medicaid programs across the country. The ever-escalating costs of medical goods and services are driving up the cost of Medicaid programs and making it difficult for state governments to fund their portion of the program. 1 State legislatures are increasingly faced with making difficult choices of fundingthe Medicaid program at the expense of other, equally important priorities.
Partly driven by healthcare funding pressure, as well as the Affordable Care Act, the concept of the “triple aim” was proposed by Berwick and colleagues in 2008. 2 The triple aim describes 3 linked and concurrent goals for healthcare delivery: improved care for individuals, improved health of populations, and reduced per-capita costs. Medicaid managed care programs have adopted the concept of the triple aim and attempt to achieve these goals by case management, which directs Medicaid recipients to the most appropriate setting for the healthcare that is needed, limiting duplicative or unnecessary procedures and relying heavily on generic drugs. While this approach has seen positive results in containing costs, it is still unclear whether the overall health of the population is improving. Perhaps a slightly different focus could produce even greater results. That focus incorporates the concept of population health.
The term population health was coined by Kindig and Stoddart in 2003. 3 Their original definition was concerned with the health outcomes of a group of individuals. While there is no single overarching definition of population health, the focus on health outcomes seems to be the unifying factor in this still-emerging discipline. For me, the whole tenet of population health is to understand the health risks of individuals and design interventions that mitigate the risk in an attempt to halt or stabilize the progression of the health condition or disease moving forward. Keeping people healthy by focusing specifically on their health conditions should lead to a healthier population and subsequently a lower cost of care. How do we do this, and where do we begin?
The first step is to understand the current health status of the individuals enrolled in the program. On the surface, this may sound like a fairly easy task, but it is not (Figure 1 ). Most Medicaid programs have large quantities of data residing in their Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) regarding claims payments for their beneficiaries. This data set is very important to the understanding of the health status of the individual. However, no matter how well this data set is mined, it will not be sufficient to get a clear picture of the overall health status of the individual. MMIS data will provide some information, but it is not the whole picture.
For a true health-status picture to emerge, the MMIS data (which contain medical claims data for point-of-care visits as well as pharmacy data) must be merged with available electronic health record (EHR) data. Once this is done, a clearer picture of the health status of an individual will begin to emerge. These individuals can then be stratified into risk categories based on their overall health status. Those with the least risk for adverse health outcomes or disease progression can be stratified on one end of the spectrum and those with the greatest risk for adverse health outcomes on the other.
Once this is done, gaps in care can be identified and addressed. In addition, targeted strategies for interventions can be developed and implemented. This sounds logical and practical, right? But it is easier said than done, particularly in the Medicaid population. Eligibility for Medicaid is based on resources relative to some measure of the federal poverty level or disability status. The social determinates of health, such as food insecurity, the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables, adequate housing, safety concerns, limited educational opportunities, and environmental factors all work to negatively affect the health status of Medicaid beneficiaries. A population health approach in a middle-class or more affluent population is a challenge; add in the complex interaction of poverty and health, and it becomes an even greater challenge for those receiving healthcare benefits through a Medicaid program.
The Mississippi Division of Medicaid began investigating the potential of a population health approach to achieve better health outcomes and reduced cost in 2014. The Medicaid program continued to be a significant cost driver in Mississippi’s state budget, in part because of enrollment growth (Figure 2 ). (According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2017 Medicaid accounted for 12% of the state’s general fund spending and 46% of all federal funds directed to the state. 4) Newer, more innovative solutions had to be identified to control costs.
The public investment in the digitization of medicine, including Meaningful Use and Interoperability funding, set the stage to enable the Division of Medicaid to leverage clinical data generated through the delivery of care. By combining clinical EHR data and claims data from the MMIS, the stage was set to monitor health outcomes of Medicaid beneficiaries as well as the progress of the managed care plans to produce improved outcomes.
The Mississippi Division of Medicaid partnered with the Delta Health Alliance (DHA) to perform a pilot program called the Mississippi Delta Medicaid Population Health Demonstration Project. The Mississippi Delta region is one of the most impoverished regions in the country, with a large Medicaid population 5 and a high disease burden. 6 DHA is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) whose mission is to research and identify the causes of poor health and lack of adequate educational opportunities as well as inform residents of the Mississippi Delta on how to adapt a healthier lifestyle.
Because the disease burden is high and the health status of the region is poor, this demonstration project had multiple disease conditions to choose from. In addition, because the region is known for its poor health outcomes and lack of infrastructure, any model developed under these difficult conditions should be able to meet the challenges of any other region of the state.
One of the key elements of the study, as well as the power of the population health approach, is to identify individuals at risk for disease progression and implement strategies that will mitigate or perhaps reverse that progression. Two conditions were chosen to explore in this study, the progression of chosen to explore in this study, the progression of diabetes from its precursor form, prediabetes, to full blown type 2 diabetes (T2D) and preterm delivery. The incidence of obesity and the subsequent burden of T2D in the Mississippi Delta region is high. A clinical profile was developed of an individual progressing along the path of prediabetes to T2D. This profile was used as a template to identify those individuals meeting these clinical criteria.
The demonstration project used a proprietary population health platform developed by the Cerner Corporation to create a longitudinal record that contained Medicaid claims data and clinical EHR data for Medicaid beneficiaries in select clinics in the Mississippi Delta region. Using a predictive algorithm, risk scores for progression of prediabetes to T2D were developed for Medicaid beneficiaries receiving care at the select clinics. Targeted interventions were applied through intensive care management techniques.
Mississippi has a high burden of preterm birth. Preterm birth refers to babies born before 37 weeks of gestational age. The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 9.85% of the births in the United States are considered preterm. 7 The preterm country, at 13.6%.8 Data at the Division of Medicaid show that the preterm birth rate for women receiving benefits is 18%. 9 Therefore, the Medicaid population accounts for a disproportionate share of the high preterm birth rate in Mississippi.
Although the cause of approximately 50% of the preterm births is unknown, a wide variety of risk factors are known to play a role in the birth outcomes. Some of the known causes of preterm birth are vaginal infections, short intervals between pregnancies, maternal stress, anxiety or depression, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and low socioeconomic status. In addition, African American mothers are almost twice as likely to have a preterm infant as white mothers in the United States. 10
Prenatal care is integral to lowering the risk and rate of preterm births. Often access to prenatal care is tied to insurance coverage. It is worth noting that the socioeconomically disadvantaged women with higher risk factors for preterm birth do not become eligible for coverage until they are pregnant. Access to and timely attainment (in the first trimester) of care for women who were previously uninsured depend on a rapid enrollment for Medicaid benefits. Unsurprisingly, prenatal care in this population is often delayed.
Using the population health platform described above, longitudinal records were created, and predictive algorithms were applied for risk of preterm delivery for women who became pregnant. These women received intensive prenatal care as well as education that was related to risk factors such as infection, smoking, stress, and other lifestyle risks.
While the study is still ongoing, preliminary results indicated a considerable cost savings through the application of population health tools. Preventing the progression of prediabetes to T2D is estimated to save approximately $9700 per year per individual. 11 Although the estimates vary on the cost savings of preventing preterm delivery, Mississippi Medicaid data show the average stay in the newborn intensive care unit for a preterm baby costs approximately $57,000.
These preliminary results, which are exciting, need to be verified and repeated not only in other settings but also with other health conditions and disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, asthma, and metabolic syndrome. The care management model used in this approach is significantly high touch, but it is important to weigh the cost of the intervention against the healthcare outcomes achieved.
There is a heightened interest in the healthcare outcomes of managed care programs from the federal regulatory body, the Center of Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS), that oversees the Medicaid managed care programs. The recently promulgated Medicaid Managed Care Final Rule 12 puts a great deal more emphasis on state oversight and health outcomes. These new rules indicate that the federal government is now interested in the cost-to-benefit ratio and whether managed care can improve health outcomes and lower costs as a result. As the cost of healthcare and the cost of the Medicaid program at both the state and federal levels increase, there is likely to be further emphasis on cost containment as a product of improved health outcomes. Population health platforms offer a new tool that can be applied to achieve these results.
Of anecdotal interest is the fact that CMCS was very receptive to the concept of a population health approach to improving quality and outcomes in the Medicaid program. When the Mississippi Division of Medicaid submitted its Implementation Advanced Planning Document for enhanced funding for its population health initiative, it was received with great interest and approved within a 4-week time period, a short turnaround for proposals of this type.
In 2017, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid completed a reprocurement of its managed care program, adding contract language that requires managed care plans to implement a population health-based strategy as part of its ongoing operations. While debate continues over who should deliver managed care to the state’s Medicaid recipients, the future seems to point toward a population health approach.
While the program is still in its infancy, there is significant potential for population health platforms to improve healthcare outcomes, which can not only lead to healthier, more productive individuals but also substantially lower the cost of healthcare in Medicaid programs. Financial Disclosure

State Strategies to Improve Health and Control Cost
The U.S. health care system is transforming, creating opportunities for increased health impact. States are increasingly interested in identifying interventions that improve population health and reduce health care spending. CDC is partnering with the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS), part of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, to provide governors’ offices, Medicaid directors, and public health stakeholders with specific population health strategies that can be integrated into the health care delivery system to improve health and lower costs within 5 years.
With NGA and CMCS, CDC developed technical packages for select population health interventions. Technical packages contain targeted, action-oriented information for stakeholders interested in advancing population health strategies. The technical packages focus on interventions that have a significant scientific basis for their effectiveness and have shown a positive return on investment in less than 5 years.

How Care Management Strategies Could Reduce Medical Costs
How Care Management Strategies Could Reduce Medical Costs
Due to a growth in the number of chronic medical conditions around the United States, health payers are working to develop care management strategies that will better serve patients with complex diseases.
By Vera Gruessner
December 24, 2015 - When it comes to managing the treatment and financial implications of complex medical conditions, health payers and providers will need to work together and have effective cross-industry communication. A strong relationship between payers and providers is a must in order to create superior care management strategies for at-risk patient populations.
Due to a growth in the number of chronic medical conditions around the United States, health payers are working to develop care management strategies that will better serve patients with complex diseases, according to a white paper from the California HealthCare Foundation.
Payers are developing Complex Case Management programs for helping patients with acute and critical health problems and Disease Management programs for those who have more common chronic conditions.
In order to fit the requirements of new legislative actions such as the Affordable Care Act, payers and providers are working to re-design some of these programs, the white paper stated.
Health payers are now more focused on population health management including disease prevention and wellness promotion. For example, beneficiary incentives are meant to spark consumer interest in obtaining all health screenings, managing medication dosages, and remaining physically fit.
The white paper discusses how patients in the state of California have experienced a spike in chronic diseases such as diabetes. With approximately 40 percent of Californians suffering from one or more chronic conditions, payers are more interested than ever before in developing effective care management strategies with their network of providers.
Private, commercial payers have several methods for developing care management strategies including Complex Case Management and Disease Management. For example, one method may be contracting with an outside vendor to develop a care management approach while another way would be to develop the strategy in-house.
There are several approaches in care management programs such as consumer outreach and engagement along with provider engagement and risk stratification. A survey conducted by the California HealthCare Foundation shows that two-thirds of California payers use in-house services for developing Complex Case Management and Disease Management strategies.
Cammack Health reverses cost trends through care management
One example of a health payer and provider network that worked to reverse rising healthcare spending through the development of effective care management strategies comes from consulting company Cammack Health and Montefiore’s health plan, according to a company press release.
In 2011, it was discovered through Cammack Health’s annual Benefits Survey of Hospitals that the costs associated with the Montefiore health plan were above average per employee per year when compared to New York hospitals.
In order to solve this major dilemma, Cammack Health, Montefiore Health System’s Human Resources department, and Montefiore’s nationally recognized Care Management Organization (CMO) partnered together to create a Care Guidance Program along with redesigning plan benefits and coverage options.
Four years ago, Montefiore’s per employee per year health plan spending was $12,475 while the average for New York hospitals was $11,982. The three parties used the care management platform at the CMO to create the Care Guidance Program.
“ We understood some people might view this kind of program cynically, as simply a means of managing claims. But it’s not being done by the claims administrator; it’s being done by a separate entity,” William Shanahan, former Vice President of Human Resources at Montefiore, said in a public statement.
“This, plus the fact that the program is voluntary, sends a clear message to employees that the program is here to help you and your dependents, not to mandate you to do anything. From what we’ve heard anecdotally, this approach has worked to reassure people.”
The way this program works is by targeting health plan members to follow a healthy lifestyle and better navigate the medical care system when issues arise. Also, the Care Guidance Program is meant to find at-risk patients early before a health concern exacerbates and provide wellness education for them. All of these steps are meant to stabilize the costs of healthcare at this particular establishment.
This program also lasers in on care coordination and disease management in order to stabilize medical spending within the Montefiore health plan. Those with chronic conditions are offered services through a Personal Health Nurse.
The nurse works with individuals in order to promote medication adherence and other healthy behaviors. One important point to mention is that the majority of plan members favor the program and are interested in its goals.
“The concern was that people would see the program as Big Brother or invading their privacy,” Anne Meara, RN, Associate Vice President of Network Care Management, mentioned in the press release. “Yet the majority of people we contact are very appreciative of an offer for help. The program has generated significant goodwill, positive word of mouth and even referrals from coworkers participating in the program.”
The results show that the new program has led to significant benefits such as the drop in spending by around $1,000, a report from Cammack Health shows. Engaged consumers and plan members saw their medical as well as prescription drug costs fall by 10.8 percent since 2011.
Some other benefits included a decrease of utilization in “key categories, including a 19.6% reduction in inpatient admissions, 26.7% reduction in non-maternity-related inpatient admissions, and 13.4% reduction in emergency department visits.”
This illustrates that strong care management strategies between provider networks and payers could lead to a stabilization in medical costs across multiple organizations.
“We were looking for some mechanism to help us moderate the trend in healthcare costs, rather than simply shifting costs from employer to employee,” William Shanahan explained in the report.

Alright, so I've got this information from my searches. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, there's this 6|18 Initiative from the CDC. It seems like they've identified six common health conditions that are both preventable and costly, and they've got 18 evidence-based interventions to tackle these issues. The idea is to help states improve health and control costs by focusing on these areas.

Looking at the list, tobacco use, high blood pressure, inappropriate antibiotic use, asthma, unintended pregnancies, and type 2 diabetes are the targeted conditions. For each, there are specific strategies outlined that have been proven to work.

For example, for tobacco use, increasing access to cessation services and removing barriers like copays can help people quit smoking, which should reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with smoking-related diseases.

Similarly, for high blood pressure, strategies like self-monitored blood pressure and simplifying treatment regimens can lead to better control, potentially reducing the need for more intensive and costly treatments down the line.

In the case of asthma, especially among children, improving access to comprehensive care and education can prevent exacerbations that often lead to emergency room visits and hospitalizations, which are expensive.

Preventing unintended pregnancies through better access to contraception, particularly long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), can reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies, which in turn can lower Medicaid costs related to childbirth and neonatal care.

And for type 2 diabetes, preventing the onset through lifestyle changes and early interventions can save a significant amount of money that would otherwise be spent on managing the disease and its complications.

Now, the second search result was about strategies to reduce Medicaid spending, and it seems to align well with the first one. It talks about various approaches states can take to contain costs while maintaining or improving the quality of care.

One of the strategies mentioned is premium and cost-sharing policies. However, the report notes that while these can shift some costs to enrollees, they can also lead to disenrollment and potential increases in costs if people delay necessary care or end up in more expensive settings like emergency rooms.

Another approach is enrollee wellness incentives, where beneficiaries are rewarded for engaging in healthy behaviors. The evidence here is mixed; while some programs have shown increases in preventive care usage, the impact on overall Medicaid spending isn't clear yet.

Then there's complex care management for high-need, high-cost patients, often referred to as "super-utilizers." These are the 5% of beneficiaries who account for a large chunk of Medicaid spending. Programs aimed at providing intensive care management to this group have had mixed results. Some have shown reductions in emergency department visits and hospitalizations, which could lead to cost savings, but others haven't seen significant changes. Moreover, these programs can be expensive to run, so achieving net savings is uncertain.

Patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs) are another strategy. The idea is to provide coordinated, comprehensive primary care that can prevent complications and reduce the need for costly specialty care and hospitalizations. Again, the evidence is mixed. Some studies show reductions in certain types of costs, but others don't see a significant impact. Achieving net savings after accounting for the additional costs of running PCMHs is also a challenge.

Alternative payment models, like accountable care organizations (ACOs), episode-based payments, and global budgeting, are being explored to align financial incentives with quality and cost-effectiveness. Early results from Medicare ACOs show modest savings, but it's unclear how well these models will translate to Medicaid populations, which often have more complex needs.

Moving on to long-term care, the report discusses strategies like tightening financial eligibility rules, expanding home and community-based services (HCBS), and managed long-term care services. Expanding HCBS is seen as a way to reduce institutional care costs, which are higher, but the evidence on cost savings is mixed. Some studies show reductions in nursing home admissions, but others suggest that HCBS may not necessarily lead to overall cost savings because the services are used by those who would not have otherwise been institutionalized.

Managed care for long-term services and supports (LTSS) is another approach, with the goal of integrating medical and LTSS and potentially achieving efficiencies and cost savings. However, the evidence on cost savings is still emerging, and ensuring that quality of care is maintained is crucial.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that there are several promising strategies to improve Medicaid while controlling costs, but none of them guarantee success, and many require careful implementation and持续的监测和评估。

首先，聚焦于预防和管理高负担的健康状况，如烟草使用、高血压、哮喘和糖尿病，可以通过减少长期的医疗需求来节省成本。这些策略不仅有助于改善公众健康，还可能在长期内降低 Medicaid 的支出。

其次，虽然成本分担措施如保费和共同支付可能会在短期内带来一些收入，但它们也可能导致人们推迟必要的护理或完全退出计划，这可能会增加紧急情况下的医疗成本。因此，这种策略需要谨慎实施，并且可能不适合所有人群。

第三，激励参与者采取健康行为的方法显示出一些潜力，特别是在增加预防性护理的使用方面，但其对整体 Medicaid 成本的影响尚不明确。这可能需要更长时间的研究来确定其长期效果。

对于复杂病例管理，尽管针对高需求、高成本患者的干预措施可能在某些情况下有效，但其普遍适用性和净节约效果仍不确定。这些计划的成本可能很高，因此需要仔细权衡投资与回报。

患者为中心的医疗之家模式旨在通过提供协调一致的初级保健来提高护理质量并减少不必要的服务。虽然一些研究表明这可以减少某些类型的费用，但其他研究则没有发现显著影响。此外，实现净节约可能具有挑战性，因为实施 PCMH 模式的额外成本需要被节省的成本所抵消。

替代支付模型，如 ACO 和基于 episodes 的付款，试图通过改变付款方式来激励提供者更有效地管理成本和质量。尽管在 Medicare 中看到一些初步的成功，但这些模型在 Medicaid 中的效果尚待充分证明。

在长期护理方面，扩大家庭和社区基础服务以减少机构护理的需求是一个重要策略。虽然机构护理成本更高，但将人们保留在社区中并不总是能直接转化为成本节约，因为社区服务可能被那些无论如何都不会进入机构的人使用。

最后，管理长期服务和支持的 Medicaid 管理式护理计划旨在整合医疗和长期服务，以提高效率和降低成本。然而，这些计划的成功程度各不相同，需要进一步的研究来确定它们在不同环境中的有效性。

综上所述，没有万能的解决方案可以确保 Medicaid 的改进同时控制成本。相反，各州需要根据自身情况，选择和定制一系列策略，并准备好适应和调整以应对不断变化的情况。重要的是要持续监测和评估这些策略的有效性，以确保他们在改善健康结果的同时，也能实现成本控制的目标。
