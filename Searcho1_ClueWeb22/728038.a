So I need to figure out what motivates employees. This seems like a pretty broad topic, but I'll try to break it down. First off, motivation is about what drives people to take action, so in the context of employees, it's about what makes them want to perform well at their jobs.

I think different things motivate different people, so there probably isn't one-size-fits-all answer here. Some people might be motivated by money, others by recognition or the chance to learn new skills. Maybe some people just enjoy the work itself.

Let me start by considering some basic categories of motivation. I've heard of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic is when someone does something because they find it personally rewarding or interesting, like a passion for their work. Extrinsic motivation comes from external factors, like bonuses or promotions.

So, for employees, both of these could be important. Some people might be more intrinsically motivated, while others are more extrinsically motivated. Probably, most people have a mix of both.

Maybe I should look into some theories of motivation that have been developed in psychology or management science. There's Maslow's hierarchy of needs, Herzberg's two-factor theory, expectancy theory, and many more. It might help to brush up on some of these.

Let me consider Maslow's hierarchy first. It suggests that people have different levels of needs, from basic physiological needs up to self-actualization. In a workplace, once employees' basic needs like salary and job security are met, higher-level needs like esteem and self-actualization can become motivators.

Herzberg's two-factor theory differentiates between hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors include things like salary and work conditions, which if not adequate can lead to dissatisfaction, but improving them doesn't necessarily increase motivation. Motivators are things like recognition, achievement, and growth opportunities, which can actually increase job satisfaction and motivation.

Expectancy theory suggests that motivation depends on the expectation that effort will lead to good performance, which in turn will lead to desirable rewards. So, if employees believe that putting in extra effort will lead to a bonus, for example, they might be motivated to work harder.

Goal-setting theory proposes that setting specific, challenging goals can motivate employees, especially if they receive feedback on their progress.

There are also newer theories and concepts, like intrinsic motivation being enhanced by providing autonomy, mastery, and purpose, as described by Daniel Pink in his book "Drive."

So, based on these theories, it seems that motivation can come from a variety of sources:

1. **Compensation and Benefits:** Fair salary, bonuses, benefits.

2. **Recognition and Appreciation:** Acknowledging employees' efforts and achievements.

3. **Career Growth and Development:** Opportunities for advancement, training, and skill development.

4. **Work-Life Balance:** Flexible hours, supportive work environment.

5. **Challenging Work:** Interesting and meaningful tasks.

6. **Autonomy:** Freedom to make decisions and manage one's own work.

7. **Sense of Purpose:** Aligning personal values with company mission.

8. **Positive Work Environment:** Collaborative culture, respectful relationships.

Now, these are all general ideas, but I wonder if there's more specific research on what motivates employees in different industries or at different stages in their careers.

Perhaps I should look into some studies or surveys that have been conducted on employee motivation. Maybe there are statistics or trends that can provide more insight.

Let me try to find some recent data on this topic.

Understanding Employee Motivation
Abstract
The study examined the ranked importance of motivational factors of employees at The Ohio State University's Piketon Research and Extension Center and Enterprise Center. The hand-delivered descriptive survey addressed ten motivating factors in the context of employee motivation theory. Findings suggest interesting work and good pay are key to higher employee motivation. Carefully designed reward systems that include job enlargement, job enrichment, promotions, internal and external stipends, monetary, and non-monetary compensation should be considered.

Introduction to Motivation
At one time, employees were considered just another input
into the production of goods and services. What perhaps changed
this way of thinking about employees was research, referred to as
the Hawthorne Studies, conducted by Elton Mayo from 1924 to 1932
(Dickson, 1973). This study found employees are not motivated
solely by money and employee behavior is linked to their
attitudes (Dickson, 1973). The Hawthorne Studies began the human
relations approach to management, whereby the needs and
motivation of employees become the primary focus of managers
(Bedeian, 1993).
Motivation Theories
Understanding what motivated employees and how they were
motivated was the focus of many researchers following the
publication of the Hawthorne Study results (Terpstra, 1979).
Five major approaches that have led to our understanding of
motivation are Maslow's need-hierarchy theory, Herzberg's two-
factor theory, Vroom's expectancy theory, Adams' equity
theory, and Skinner's reinforcement theory.
According to Maslow, employees have five levels of needs
(Maslow, 1943): physiological, safety, social, ego, and self-
actualizing. Maslow argued that lower level needs had to be
satisfied before the next higher level need would motivate
employees. Herzberg's work categorized motivation into two
factors: motivators and hygienes (Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman,
1959). Motivator or intrinsic factors, such as achievement and
recognition, produce job satisfaction. Hygiene or extrinsic
factors, such as pay and job security, produce job
dissatisfaction.
Vroom's theory is based on the belief that employee effort
will lead to performance and performance will lead to rewards
(Vroom, 1964). Rewards may be either positive or negative. The
more positive the reward the more likely the employee will be
highly motivated. Conversely, the more negative the reward the
less likely the employee will be motivated.
Adams' theory states that employees strive for equity
between themselves and other workers. Equity is achieved when the
ratio of employee outcomes over inputs is equal to other employee
outcomes over inputs (Adams, 1965).
Skinner's theory simply states those employees' behaviors
that lead to positive outcomes will be repeated and behaviors
that lead to negative outcomes will not be repeated (Skinner,
1953). Managers should positively reinforce employee behaviors
that lead to positive outcomes. Managers should negatively
reinforce employee behavior that leads to negative outcomes.
Motivation Defined
Many contemporary authors have also defined the concept of
motivation. Motivation has been defined as:  the psychological
process that gives behavior purpose and direction (Kreitner,
1995); a predisposition to behave in a purposive manner to
achieve specific, unmet needs (Buford, Bedeian, & Lindner, 1995);
an internal drive to satisfy an unsatisfied need (Higgins, 1994);
and the will to achieve (Bedeian, 1993). For this paper,
motivation is operationally defined as the inner force that
drives individuals to accomplish personal and organizational
goals.
The Role of Motivation
Why do we need motivated employees? The answer is survival
(Smith, 1994). Motivated employees are needed in our rapidly
changing workplaces. Motivated employees help organizations
survive. Motivated employees are more productive. To be
effective, managers need to understand what motivates employees
within the context of the roles they perform. Of all the
functions a manager performs, motivating employees is arguably
the most complex. This is due, in part, to the fact that what
motivates employees changes constantly (Bowen & Radhakrishna,
1991). For example, research suggests that as employees' income
increases, money becomes less of a motivator (Kovach, 1987).
Also, as employees get older, interesting work becomes more of a
motivator.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to describe the importance of
certain factors in motivating employees at the Piketon Research
and Extension Center and Enterprise Center. Specifically, the
study sought to describe the ranked importance of the following
ten motivating factors: (a) job security, (b) sympathetic help
with personal problems, (c) personal loyalty to employees, (d)
interesting work, (e) good working conditions, (f) tactful
discipline, (g) good wages, (h) promotions and growth in the
organization, (i) feeling of being in on things, and (j) full
appreciation of work done. A secondary purpose of the study was
to compare the results of this study with the study results from
other populations.
Methodology
The research design for this study employed a descriptive
survey method. The target population of this study included
employees at the Piketon Research and Extension Center and
Enterprise Center (centers). The sample size included all 25
employees of the target population. Twenty-three of the 25
employees participated in the survey for a
participation rate of 92%. The centers are in Piketon, Ohio.
The mission of the Enterprise Center is to facilitate
individual and community leader awareness and provide assistance
in preparing and accessing economic opportunities in southern
Ohio. The Enterprise Center has three programs: alternatives in
agriculture, small business development, and women's business
development. The mission of the Piketon Research and Extension
Center is to conduct research and educational programs designed
to enhance economic development in southern Ohio. The Piketon
Research and Extension Center has five programs: aquaculture,
community economic development, horticulture, forestry, and soil
and water resources.
From a review of literature, a survey questionnaire was
developed to collect data for the study (Bowen & Radhakrishna,
1991; Harpaz, 1990; Kovach, 1987). Data was collected through use
of a written questionnaire hand-delivered to participants.
Questionnaires were filled out by participants and returned to an
intra-departmental mailbox. The questionnaire asked participants
to rank the importance of ten factors that motivated them in
doing their work: 1=most important . . . 10=least important. Face
and content validity for the instrument were established using
two administrative and professional employees at The Ohio State
University. The instrument was pilot tested with three similarly
situated employees within the university. As a result of the
pilot test, minor changes in word selection and instructions were
made to the questionnaire.
Results and Discussion
The ranked order of motivating factors were: (a) interesting
work, (b) good wages, (c) full appreciation of work done, (d) job
security, (e) good working conditions, (f) promotions and growth
in the organization, (g) feeling of being in on things, (h)
personal loyalty to employees, (i) tactful discipline, and (j)
sympathetic help with personal problems.
A comparison of these results to Maslow's need-hierarchy
theory provides some interesting insight into employee
motivation. The number one ranked motivator, interesting work, is
a self-actualizing factor. The number two ranked motivator, good
wages, is a physiological factor. The number three ranked
motivator, full appreciation of work done, is an esteem factor.
The number four ranked motivator, job security, is a safety
factor. Therefore, according to Maslow (1943), if managers wish
to address the most important motivational factor of Centers'
employees, interesting work, physiological, safety, social, and
esteem factors must first be satisfied. If managers wished to
address the second most important motivational factor of centers'
employees, good pay, increased pay would suffice. Contrary to
what Maslow's theory suggests, the range of motivational factors
are mixed in this study. Maslow's conclusions that lower level
motivational factors must be met before ascending to the next
level were not confirmed by this study.
The following example compares the highest ranked
motivational factor (interesting work) to Vroom's expectancy
theory. Assume that a Centers employee just attended a staff
meeting where he/she learned a major emphasis would be placed on
seeking additional external program funds. Additionally,
employees who are successful in securing funds will be given more
opportunities to explore their own research and extension
interests (interesting work). Employees who do not secure
additional funds will be required to work on research and
extension programs identified by the director. The employee
realizes that the more research he/she does regarding funding
sources and the more proposals he/she writes, the greater the
likelihood he/she will receive external funding.
Because the state legislature has not increased
appropriations to the centers for the next two years (funds for
independent research and extension projects will be scaled back),
the employee sees a direct relationship between performance
(obtaining external funds) and rewards (independent research and
Extension projects). Further, the employee went to work for the
centers, in part, because of the opportunity to conduct
independent research and extension projects. The employee will be
motivated if he/she is successful in obtaining external funds and
given the opportunity to conduct independent research and
extension projects. On the other hand, motivation will be
diminished if the employee is successful in obtaining external
funds and the director denies the request to conduct independent
research and Extension projects.
The following example compares the third highest ranked
motivational factor (full appreciation of work done) to Adams's
equity theory. If an employee at the centers feels that there is
a lack of appreciation for work done, as being too low relative
to another employee, an inequity may exist and the employee will
be dis-motivated. Further, if all the employees at the centers
feel that there is a lack of appreciation for work done, inequity
may exist. Adams (1965) stated employees will attempt to restore
equity through various means, some of which may be counter-
productive to organizational goals and objectives. For instance,
employees who feel their work is not being appreciated may work
less or undervalue the work of other employees.
This final example compares the two highest motivational
factors to Herzberg's two-factor theory. The highest ranked
motivator, interesting work, is a motivator factor. The second
ranked motivator, good wages is a hygiene factor. Herzberg,
Mausner, & Snyderman (1959) stated that to the degree that
motivators are present in a job, motivation will occur. The
absence of motivators does not lead to dissatisfaction. Further,
they stated that to the degree that hygienes are absent from a
job, dissatisfaction will occur. When present, hygienes prevent
dissatisfaction, but do not lead to satisfaction. In our example,
the lack of interesting work (motivator) for the centers'
employees would not lead to dissatisfaction. Paying centers'
employees lower wages (hygiene) than what they believe to be fair
may lead to job dissatisfaction. Conversely, employees will be
motivated when they are doing interesting work and but will not
necessarily be motivated by higher pay.
The discussion above, about the ranked importance of
motivational factors as related to motivational theory, is only
part of the picture. The other part is how these rankings compare
with related research. A study of industrial employees, conducted
by Kovach (1987), yielded the following ranked order of
motivational factors: (a) interesting work, (b) full appreciation
of work done, and (c) feeling of being in on things. Another
study of employees, conducted by Harpaz (1990), yielded the
following ranked order of motivational factors: (a) interesting
work, (b) good wages, and (c) job security.
In this study and the two cited above, interesting work
ranked as the most important motivational factor. Pay was not
ranked as one of the most important motivational factors by
Kovach (1987), but was ranked second in this research and by
Harpaz (1990). Full appreciation of work done was not ranked as
one of the most important motivational factors by Harpaz (1990),
but was ranked second in this research and by Kovach (1987). The
discrepancies in these research findings supports the idea that
what motivates employees differs given the context in which the
employee works. What is clear, however, is that employees rank
interesting work as the most important motivational factor.
Implications for Centers and Extension
The ranked importance of motivational factors of employees
at the centers provides useful information for the centers'
director and employees. Knowing how to use this information in
motivating centers' employees is complex. The strategy for
motivating centers' employees depends on which motivation
theories are used as a reference point. If Hertzberg's theory is
followed, management should begin by focusing on pay and job
security (hygiene factors) before focusing on interesting work
and full appreciation of work done (motivator factors). If Adams'
equity theory is followed, management should begin by focusing on
areas where there may be perceived inequities (pay and full
appreciation of work done) before focusing on interesting work
and job security. If Vroom's theory is followed, management
should begin by focusing on rewarding (pay and interesting work)
employee effort in achieving organizational goals and objectives.
Regardless of which theory is followed, interesting work and
employee pay appear to be important links to higher motivation of
centers' employees. Options such as job enlargement, job
enrichment, promotions, internal and external stipends, monetary,
and non-monetary compensation should be considered. Job
enlargement can be used (by managers) to make work more
interesting (for employees) by increasing the number and variety
of activities performed. Job enrichment can used to make work
more interesting and increase pay by adding higher level
responsibilities to a job and providing monetary compensation
(raise or stipend) to employees for accepting this
responsibility. These are just two examples of an infinite number
of methods to increase motivation of employees at the centers.
The key to motivating centers' employees is to know what
motivates them and designing a motivation program based on those
needs.
The results presented in this paper also have implications
for the entire Cooperative Extension Sysyem. The effectiveness of
Extension is dependent upon the motivation of its employees
(Chesney, 1992; Buford, 1990; Smith, 1990). Knowing what
motivates employees and incorporating this knowledge into the
reward system will help Extension identify, recruit, employ,
train, and retain a productive workforce. Motivating Extension
employees requires both managers and employees working together
(Buford, 1993).  Extension employees must be willing to let
managers know what motivates them, and managers must be willing
to design reward systems that motivate employees. Survey results,
like those presented here, are useful in helping Extension
managers determine what motivates employees (Bowen &
Radhakrishna, 1991). If properly designed reward systems are not
implemented, however, employees will not be motivated.

Employee Motivation
Employee Motivation
Employee Motivation Research Papers focus on the importance of motivating workers in organizations.
In  an attempt to discover what motivates employees, employee motivation research papers report  that what motivates workers today is primarily  linked to the values and goals  of the individual.  Beginning in the   1970's, it seems that there was a dramatic shift in the values and  priorities of  the everyday worker.  As people became  more educated and  the economy witnessed a sharp decline of the Protestant work ethics,  what employees wanted from their employers changed as well.  The values  that formerly characterized most  employees in most organizations were  as follows:
A strong loyalty to the company for which they  worked.
A strong motivation for money and status.
A strong motivation for promotion in the  organization.
A strong need for job stability and security.
A strong identification with work roles rather  than with personal roles off the job.
Values and Employee Motivation
Today, it seems that  many of these values and needs have changed  and as a result, the values of  today’s employee focus on self and  emphasize characteristics that lead to  self-development and  self-fulfillment.   These include the following:
Little loyalty or commitment to an organization.
A need for recognition of one’s accomplishments.
Little concern with job security and stability.
Leisure considered more important than work.
Desire for work that is challenging, that  provides  opportunities for personal growth and development, and that calls for   creativity.
Desire to participate in decisions that affect  one’s job.
A stronger identification with one’s personal  role in all facets of life rather that with one’s work role.
Job Satisfaction and Employee Motivation
Shultz and Shultz  continue by noting that the values and needs  of the individual when met  translate into job satisfaction and “a high  level of job satisfaction is  directly related to positive behavior on  the job, specifically to high  performance, low turnover, and low absenteeism ”.   Employee motivation research papers further this point by stating   that, “For any effective work to occur, there must be a certain amount  of  consensus on basic values”.   Therefore it is important to select  individuals whose values and goals  match those of the organization.   This  will ultimately produce satisfied employees, a productive  workforce and hence a  more successful organization.

25 examples of employee motivation
How can employee motivation be measured?
Employee Motivation Survey
Excursus: Change Management and Employee Motivation
Employee motivation is a hot topic – and with good reason: A study by Gallup estimates the economic damage of unmotivated employees to be over $450 billion per year – and these are only the figures for the US. [1]
Even more frightening are the statistics that about 70% of all U.S. workers have little or no emotional attachment to their company.
No wonder that companies are actively trying to motivate their employees - because motivated employees with a strong emotional commitment to the company are not only happier, but create real value for the company. Motivated employees with high emotional attachment
take 41 percent fewer days off; that also means 41 percent less costs through absence,
stay in the company much longer (resulting in an up to 59 percent lower turnover),
cause on average 28 percent less depletion,
are, in comparison, 70 percent less involved in work-related accidents,
cause 40 percent less quality defects,
improve customer service KPIs by about 10 percent on average,
are 20 percent more productive,
and are responsible for a 21 percent increase in overall profitability.
Note: The 2016 Gallup Meta-Analysis highlighted the differences between employees with high emotional attachment (the upper 25 percent) and lower emotional attachment (the lower 25 percent).
In short: The investment in employee motivation is worthwhile – in multiple ways.
But before we go into the many measures and examples which increase employee motivation, let's take a step back and focus briefly on the following question:
Definition: What is employee motivation?
If we take a look at the definition of motivation, then we only find a somewhat boring explanation of the term motivation:
The condition of a person that causes them to choose a particular course of action to achieve a particular outcome and to ensure that that person maintains their direction and intensity of behavior.
Based on employee motivation, this definition means that employers or executives positively change the condition of their employees through various measures.
In general, a distinction is made between three types of employee motivation: the motivation of employees through material incentives and the intangible employee motivation, as well as the hybrid employee motivation, which is a mix of the first two types.
Motivation of employees through material incentives
This includes, as the name implies, all material incentives for the employee. Examples include:
Salary
Bonuses and pensions
Disability and survivors insurance
Company cars
Employee shares in the company
Other monetary benefits such as job tickets, meal vouchers and other subsidies
Hybrid of material and immaterial employee motivation
This form is not always easy to grasp, because here the boundaries between the two basic forms of employee motivation become blurred. In general, the employee gains a monetary advantage through the measure in question, but also creates a high level of intangible value. Good examples of hybrid types of employee motivation are:
Sports and leisure activities organised by the employer
Continuous education, learning opportunities and development programs
romotion of healthy food in the canteen
Attractive workplace design
Company outings
Spa services
Home Office regulations
Intangible employee motivation
By contrast, purely intangible employee motivation involves more abstract aspects such as personal growth, trust, relationships with colleagues and supervisors, autonomy, or recognition.
Although these aspects are much harder to grasp and therefore not as easy to influence positively by concrete measures, companies can create the most value through those, and thus also benefit the most from their motivated employees.
In the following, a model is presented that makes the targeted increase in employee motivation easier to understand.
Increasing employee motivation: Theories and methods
Honestly Employee Engagement Model
At Honestly, we identified nine elements of Employee Engagement ):
Satisfaction
How satisfied are my employees with regard to compensation, work and additional services?
Empowerment
Will my employees be hampered by a lack of equipment or bureaucracy? Can they make all necessary decisions autonomously?
Personal Growth
Can my employees develop professionally through training courses or mentoring programs? Do my employees see a deeper meaning behind their work?
Peers Rapport
How good is the relationship of my employees with other colleagues? Do my employees trust each other?
Management Rapport
How good is the relationship of my employees with their superiors? Are my employees adequately supported by management?
Recognition & Feedback
How often do my employees receive feedback and provide feedback? Do my employees receive enough recognition?
Culture
Do my employees know the vision, strategy and values of my organisation? How do my employees value the moral sense of responsibility of the employer?
Advocacy
Are my employees proud to work here? Do my employees support the company even in times of crisis?
Well-being
How is the work-life balance of my employees? Is the physical safety of my employees in the workplace guaranteed?
This model makes it possible to identify excellently possible parameters for employee motivation.
Another helpful model to find starting points for motivational measures is the Maslow pyramid of needs.
The Maslow hierarchy of needs
Combined with the model of Honestly this results in:
Honestly model and Maslow hierarchy of needs combined
Maslow's theory is that the lower "deficit needs" take precedence over the others. This means that job security or salaries have a higher weighting than, for example, the need for team cohesion. Team cohesion, in turn, takes precedence over training opportunities. The fact is, most companies adequately cover physiological needs and security needs.
But too many companies are relying solely on those factors. Ideally, salaries are also good, but harder-to-grasp concepts such as corporate culture, a shared vision, recognition, and personal growth are often times disregarded or misdirected.
However, there is an undreamt-of potential here, since the intensity of need for cohesion, personal development and meaningful work clearly exceeds the intensity of the basic needs.
Source: Wikipedia
In short: these areas are factors which ensure enthusiasm and the only way you can develop motivated employees with a high emotional commitment to the company.
Increasing the share of highly motivated, emotionally committed and high-performing employees is anything but trivial and requires the support of corporate management as well as continuous measures for employee motivation.
Does this sound like a lot of work? It is! But only in this way one can benefit from the positive effects of motivated employees as outlined in the introduction. And as we have seen, the investment is worthwhile - in every sense.
The theory of Service Profit Chain illustrates the connection between employee satisfaction and the success of a business: [2]
Service Profit Chain
The growth in sales and the profitability of a company are stimulated mainly by customer loyalty. Customer loyalty, in turn, is strongly correlated with customer satisfaction, i.e. the happier your customers are, the likelier they are to become loyal to your business. Customer satisfaction is largely determined by the value or benefit of the services and products offered. In turn, value is created by satisfied, loyal and productive employees. And last but not least, employee satisfaction is primarily driven by the company's so-called internal service quality.
Internal service quality basically means nothing more than the entirety of all measures for establishing employee satisfaction, employee motivation and employee retention. Specifically, the following areas are named in the service profit chain model:
Workplace Design
Job specs
Employee selection and development
Recognition programs
Tools for interacting with customers
All of these factors, and more, are also reflected in Honestly's model of actively engaging with employees and creating a bond.
Now that we have the necessary models and understanding of how incredibly important employee motivation is for the success of your business, we will discuss how to take action to drive employee satisfaction, loyalty, and motivation.
Employee motivation: 25 examples
In the following, we will discuss all nine elements of employee motivation and provide concrete examples of how employees can be motivated.
Satisfaction
Aspects of employee satisfaction such as compensation, benefits, and the workplace environment alone are not enough to motivate your employees. The "mere" satisfaction does not spur your employees to peak performance, yet it is the basic requirement to ensure that most employees can strive for something higher (see above the Maslow hierarchy of needs).
1. Fair salaries
This one is easy. One can not impress employees with words alone. We all need money to live. Therefore, ensure that you pay a fair salary so that your employees do not have to worry about this aspect.
However, we advise caution on salary increases: According to a study, no significant correlation could be found between salaries and employee motivation.[3] Rather, some scholars argue that an increase in salaries and other bonuses can even have a mitigating effect on employee motivation.
The reason for this is that there is a natural tension between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, so that extrinsic incentives such as salary increases lower or even suppress intrinsic motivation, which is much more valuable.
All in all, of course, we do not promote lower salaries, but rather a broader understanding that an increase in salaries is not a panacea and that there are significantly more inexpensive and effective measures for employee motivation.
2. Purchasing a coffee machine
In a nutshell: Coffee makes you productive and happy. If you have many coffee aficionados among your employees (and we bet that you do) then it pays to invest in a premium coffee machine.
Coffee has shown to have an anti-oxidative effect, reducing the risk of cancer and also the risk of heart disease. [4] And as if that was not enough, coffee also has a positive impact on productivity and motivation.
Interestingly enough, it's not just the caffeine it contains that causes increased productivity and employee motivation, but also the coffee break itself. A study has shown that it is mainly the social interactions between employees during coffee breaks that increase employee motivation. [5]
3. Setting up your office in a nice way and keeping it clean

Another no-brainer: If one can spend hours choosing the right color for his living-room curtains, why should one not apply the same basic aesthetic needs to the workplace?
Before you go to the IKEA to purchase new curtains for your office, be aware that different standards apply to offices.
Plants in the office are always a good idea as they do not only visually enhance the office space but also provide oxygen.
Another important point is to tidy up the workplace: starting with the office table, to lounges, the kitchen, toilets and meeting rooms. The Broken Window theory states that even small things such as full bins, a large quantity of unorganised documents and messy toilets can have "devastating" consequences for the overall system (the office and company) by lowering the level of tolerance for such points of neglect. [6]
Finally - if you have sufficient budget available - it always pays off to invest in an entertainment and recreation room, where you can place lounge equipment or ping pong tables.
In short, you can improve the workplace environment with little tricks without having to dig deep into your pocket. Of course, if you have a larger budget on the other hand, you can arrange for complete renovations, such as those at Soundcloud's Berlin office.
4. Jobtickets for your employees
An often overlooked additional benefit: Employers can provide non-monetary and social security benefits for their employees (in Germany up to an amount of 44 euros). Depending on the amount, job tickets can either be taken over completely or subsidised. A small but appreciated gesture for your employees, which is certainly not detrimental to employee motivation.
Empowerment
Employee empowerment includes all the tools that the company can use to help employees reach their full effectiveness and efficiency.
These include:
Role & Tasks
Work processes
Equipment
Autonomy
Performance Management
Examples to motivate employees based on empowerment include:
5. Introduction of an OKR system
OKRs (short for Objectives and Key Results) is a goal management framework that has been popularised by Google and has the task of sharpening the focus of each employee, to increase transparency within the company and to facilitate the communication of the corporate strategy.
An OKR includes an objective describing a target to be reached, and several key results, which are essentially measures that determine the progress or achievement of the associated goal.
The method is as simple as it is powerful: well-known companies such as Google, Intel, Oracle, LinkedIn or Twitter have been using it successfully for years and slowly companies from other industries are also beginning to realise that this framework has a large potential to motivate employees and sharpen their focus.
Incidentally, Honestly also owes much of its success to the OKR framework, which has been in use for several years.
6. The equipment of your employees
Self-explanatory: Make sure that your employees do not only have the hardware that is necessary, but also conducive to completing their work. The same applies to the access to software that facilitates the work of your employees. A quick employee survey to ask for missing equipment will save you the guesswork and will give you a direct starting point to make your employees happier and more productive.
Personal growth
Personal growth is probably one of the key factors in employee motivation. In particular, this element of Honestly's Employee Engagement Model addresses the upper spheres of the Hierarchy of Needs. Being able to develop personally and professionally lies in the nature of man and it should not have to be mentioned that employees who want to develop constantly are extremely valuable.
With these examples you can support the personal growth of your employees:
7. Personal education budget
Some companies give their employees a personal education budget that employees can freely dispose of as long as they have a relevant educational intent. This can be used, for example, for seminars, workshops, conferences or e-learning courses.
8. Show and Tells
So-called show and tells are meetings that are arranged on the initiative of one or more employees and in which colleagues can participate voluntarily. The intention behind this form of meeting is to show colleagues interesting insights from the work of the lecturer.
For example, an HR employee could explain the onboarding process to a new employee or a marketing colleague could present the branding guide to the company. There are no limits to this show and tells.
Typically, show and tell meetings take place on a Friday afternoon or just after lunch and last 15-30 minutes. Of course, the format can be adapted to your own wishes.
These self-organised "employee seminars" are a very effective and also  free tool to bring domain knowledge into other departments and to promote the personal development of all employees – which has a tremendous impact on employee motivation.
9. Set up mentoring programs
Mentor programs are effective for three main reasons:
The mentee has a much steeper learning curve than if she had to learn everything herself
The mentor has the opportunity to develop leadership skills and to consolidate her knowledge through articulation of her activity
The mentor-mentee relationship promotes social interaction within the company, which can even help to establish friendships between employees
Peers Rapport
10. Team Lunch
Depending on the size of the company, it may be useful to set up lunch once a week with the team for which the company pays. But even for larger companies such a ritual can be easily implemented by teams from the individual departments.
If you can find a way to "break down barriers" between departments by creating a system that includes all departments in the team lunch, you've just taken a valuable step toward employee cohesion and employee motivation.
11. Team Events
By team events, we are not only talking about compulsory Christmas parties, but regular company outings with the staff to strengthen cohesion.
But company outings usually require a lot of planning, so we recommend - without much fuss - to plan weekend activities for for your employees. The frequency of interacting with colleagues outside work, in a normal private environment, is far more important than any pompous Christmas party.
And best of all, true cohesion among colleagues promotes the emergence of friendships, which according to studies leads to greater productivity and motivation in the workplace. [7]
Management Rapport
12. One-on-one meetings with supervisors
This example of how to increase employee motivation is likely familiar to you. Regular one-on-one meetings with the manager are one of the most important tools for giving feedback to employees and improving the relationship between supervisors and employees.
Recognition & Feedback
The supreme discipline of employee motivation: Recognising achievements and developing a healthy feedback culture are the building blocks for an open, motivated and productive feeling of togetherness. (We are so convinced of this that we have designed our own feedback solution to increase employee retention .)
13. Giving praise - but in the right manner
You can not go wrong with praise, you might think. Unfortunately however, you can. You should keep in mind a few basic rules before praising your employees:
Praise should not be used inflationary - otherwise it loses its motivating effect
Praise should be authentic and serious
Praise should always be specific and not generic - only relevant praise is useful for the employee
As soon as you follow these rules, praising employees, probably one of the best instruments of all of those mentioned, motivates employees in the long term.
Spontaneous and concrete praise is one measure to convey a sense of appreciation. However, the recognition of an employee can also be expressed non-verbally and at a subliminal level, for example by the general attitude and behavior towards the employee. This form of recognition affects the overall image of the employee and is therefore more difficult to grasp - the employee, however, usually feels whether she receives recognition or not.
14. Pulse surveys - feedback from employees
Feedback is the linchpin of good internal communication. There are hundreds of instructions on how to conduct a feedback interview with employees. But most of the time, feedback is given to employees only in the context of employee appraisal interviews, what he or she does well, and what can be done better.
Rarely does the employee have the opportunity to provide feedback to superiors, colleagues or the corporate culture. But employee feedback is an invaluable asset as it provides you with concrete starting points for sustainably improving your corporate culture, retaining your employees and attracting new talent. For this reason, there are tools such as Honestly, with which continuous employee surveys can be realised – on autopilot.

Culture
"We are one firm, defined by our unwavering commitment to our clients, our shareholders, and each other. Our mission is to build unrivaled partnerships with and value for our clients, through the knowledge, creativity, and dedication of our people, leading to superior returns to our shareholders." – Lehman Brothers
This mission statement was featured on the website of Lehman Brothers, the notorious US investment bank whose bankruptcy was primarily responsible for the global financial crisis. It has become a relic of capitalism.
In a nutshell: Most of the mission statements and corporate values are hollow words. This has devastating consequences for the company: A healthy corporate culture that builds on authentic company values creates transparency, a sense of belonging and accelerates decision-making processes.
The larger the company and the more employees the company has, the more difficult internal communications and the more complex bureaucratic processes become. If you have a working corporate culture, then your employees speak "one language" and can refer to corporate values in tricky decisions. The result are motivated employees who can identify themselves with their employer and the elimination of decelerating bureaucracy.
A corporate culture can not be created. The corporate culture is always there. But it is up to you to shape the culture and to steer it in the right direction.
Two examples to shape the corporate culture and to motivate employees:
15. Introducing an error culture
Mistakes should be allowed. To be precise, mistakes should even be desirable – because only through trial and error can we grow as human beings. At the same time we learn to deal with setbacks and learn to decouple mistakes from the negative concept of defeat. Our world is increasingly fast-paced and complex, which requires a new level of experimentation.
Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough. – Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
An example to introduce an error culture are so-called fuckup nights. In this relaxed and often funny format, employees (including management) present their biggest "fuckups" – this does not only have the effect of allowing colleagues to learn from others' mistakes, but also strengthens the collective feeling by being able to talk openly about mistakes.
16. Kickstart-Mondays
On Monday mornings, team members gather and talk about their successes in the last week - no matter how big or small. This will start the working week directly with a sense of collective positive energy.
17. Offsite events with the company
An offsite event or meeting is an event that is deliberately held outside the office. These are perfect for pondering with the whole team on the formative values of the company and bringing about a concrete formulation of the same – this creates transparency and cohesion.
Depending on the size of the company, it may not be practical to gather all employees at an offsite event. In this case, theoretically, individual offsite events can be held, which converge together in the formulation of corporate values.
18. Supporting charity projects
Show your employees that their employer is aware of their social responsibility. Ideally, the charity project is directly linked to your corporate mission.
Advocacy
Advocacy measures how proud the employees are of their employer, how they represent the company externally, and whether they show loyalty to the company in times of crisis.
19. Merchandise for employees
T-shirts, polo shirts, hoodies, and other merchandise items are just a few examples of how employee motivation can be achieved by creating a sense of belonging. Corporate logo T-shirts are usually worn for sleeping only, but when these T-shirts fall into the hands of motivated and proud employees, this can be an effective employer branding tool.
Well-being
The physical and mental well-being of your employees is the foundation on which the quest for self-fulfillment and meaningful work is based. Therefore, pay close attention to the stress level, the work-life balance and the health of your employees.
There are numerous examples of how you can motivate your employees:
20. Flexible working hours
Every person has different rhythms. Trust in the principle of self-organisation and give your employees more flexibility in their working hours.
21. Homeoffice
Opinions differ on this aspect: On the one hand, you want to enable your employees to harmonise work and private life as smoothly as possible. On the other hand, it is very difficult to integrate absent employees, who often work from home, into the corporate culture. Both arguments are valid, which is why we believe that the home office should have a firm place in the modern working world – but in moderation.
Specifically, this means that you could declare a fixed day of the week as a home office day, or generally allow employees to work from home, but only under special circumstances (such as relocation or medical appointments).
22. Fruit baskets and healthy snacks
Promote a healthy diet by always providing plenty of healthy fruit.
23. Yoga classes and other sports activities
To promote the physical health of your employees, you could offer a gym membership or even offer classes in-house.
24. Napping Station or meditation room
If you want to give your employees pure wellness luxury, you could even set up your own space just for powernaps or meditation exercises – a haven for those in need of some rest and re-energising for the rest of their working day.
25. Introducing six-hour days
This is certainly one of the more controversial examples of employee motivation. In Sweden, a large six-hour day field experiment was performed, which had a significant positive impact on participants' stress levels, but was discontinued after two years due to high costs.
Nevertheless, we believe that the conventional eight-hour day will become obsolete in the not-too-distant future through technological advances and increasing automation.
More examples of employee motivation can be found on our blog.
Measuring employee motivation - but how?
Measuring employee satisfaction and employee motivation provides useful information about the status quo in your company while providing concrete starting points for improving it.
The traditional way are annual or even biennial employee surveys. However, these traditional employee surveys are, in our view, completely outdated.
The main disadvantages of employee surveys are listed here:
When measuring through annual employee surveys, a lot of feedback is lost
The company can only react very slowly to feedback
The rest of the year you are "blind" to feedback and suggestions for improvement
For this reason, Honestly, in collaboration with clients such as Daimler and Lufthansa, has developed an employee feedback solution that measures the above-mentioned areas of employee engagement in any number of adjustable turn cycles (weekly or monthly, for example).
Demo anfordern
The benefits of measuring employee motivation through continuous pulse interviews are obvious:
You can see in which areas you have room for improvement and can react immediately instead of waiting for longer periods
You can analyse how areas like e.g. employee satisfaction or work-life balance change over time
The response rate is usually very high, as smaller questionnaires are sent, which can be answered in one to two minutes
Questionnaire for employee motivation
Here is a template for a questionnaire that measures employee motivation and employee satisfaction.

Excursus: Change Management and Employee Motivation
Change management refers to the entirety of all measures required to bring about a far-reaching change - in terms of strategy, processes, behavior, structures and systems - in the organisation.
Change management projects mark a significant intervention (even if well meant) in existing structures and the daily lives of employees. For this reason, such projects fail with impressive frequency: According to the change management researcher John P. Kotter about 70 percent of change management projects fail.
So there must be a concerted approach to introduce change processes harmoniously and thoughtfully, without demotivating the workforce.
Kotter has introduced the 8-step model for this, in order to drive forward changes carefully and ultimately successfully.
1. Communicating the urgency for change
This involves raising awareness of the urgency of both managers / executives and employees. For example, post-mortem analyses, the development of scenarios, or company-wide meetings that emphasise the urgency of the changes, are helpful.
2. Building a leadership coalition
To drive change, you need a team of people who fully support the change management project, are able to represent the relevant departments, and ideally have sufficient responsibility and authority to bypass bureaucratic blockages.
3. Developing a vision and strategy
Employees are more easily motivated to change if the employer can present a clear vision and strategy. The vision serves as a memorable image that gives more depth to abstract terms such as "change management project" and process of change and thus promotes acceptance.
Finally, the development of a well-thought-out strategy represents the argumentative course and the time course of the project. This, too, leads to a higher level of acceptance among the employees, since transparency is created and the changes are linked with logical arguments.
4. Communicating a clear vision
Do not inform your employees about the vision through a taciturn newsletter. The vision should be heard and lived everywhere – so think of a platform to transport the vision to each employee.
5. Removing obstacles along the way
Identify possible blockages that hinder change with your project team and look for ways to resolve them.
6. Making short-term success visible
At the beginning of the project, define milestones for small achievements that can be communicated. This creates acceptance, positive energy and the necessary momentum to successfully complete the project.
7. Continuing to drive change
The momentum of the project must always be maintained so that it is not interrupted along the way. To do so, you should always document and share all achievements and milestones with direct stakeholders (or even with the entire company).
8. Anchoring changes in the corporate culture
The process of change is completed at some point. Now it is necessary to "freeze" the change and anchor it firmly in the corporate culture. To this end, the changed state must be kept intact by stabilising measures until it becomes a habit and a complete and lasting integration into the overall system takes place.
Conclusion
Internal communication is the determining pivot of the entire change process. To maintain employee motivation in the context of change management, you should therefore follow the Kotter model meticulously.
Summary: How to Implement Employee Motivation Measures
By the end of this guide to employee motivation, you should have developed a deeper understanding of motivation and a more accurate idea of how deeply motivated and emotionally engaged employees impact company performance.
With this guide, you'll also have a repertoire of specific and actionable examples to increase employee motivation, which you can access as soon as you know where the issue lies.
In order to identify the underlying issues of employees, it is necessary to measure employee motivation and to analyse employee satisfaction in all areas.
This is exactly where Honestly comes in with its employee engagement solution.

What Really Motivates Employees? Research Reveals Secrets.
Albert Costill
Updated on January 21st, 2022
Unlike your parents or grandparents, you’re not motivated by a raise or promotion. Today, what really motivates employees involves a wide-range of well thought out drivers like feeling appreciated, doing meaningful work, and having a healthy work-life balance.
But, out of all of these ways to motivate employees, what really keeps them pushing forward? Here’s what research has revealed when it comes to motivating employees.
It’s Not All About the Benjamin’s
Dan Ariely, a psychology professor at Duke University and author of Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, recounted an interesting study that took place in an Israeli semiconductor factory.
The workers received one of three messages at the start of their workweek. They would either receive a voucher for a free pizza, a $30 cash bonus, or a compliment from their stern boss if they reached a goal. However, a quarter of the factory’s employees did not receive any message since they were the control group. The results, via New York Magazine, were interesting.
“After the first day, pizza proved to be the top motivator, increasing productivity by 6.7 percent over the control group, thereby just barely edging out the promise of a compliment (in the form of a text message from the boss that said “Well done!”).”
Even more surprising, “On the second day of the workweek, those in the money condition performed 13.2 percent worse than those in the control group. This leveled out over the next several days, but for the week overall, the cash bonus ended up costing the company more and resulted in a 6.5 percent drop in productivity.”
When the study concluded, it was found that the compliment came in first place, while pizza was in second.
Other Employee Motivators
This wasn’t the only study that showed that money isn’t the main things that motivates employees. In fact, one study found that performance-based pay incentives can actually backfire.
“We find that financial incentives may indeed reduce intrinsic motivation and diminish ethical or other reasons for complying with workplace social norms such as fairness,” said Bernd Irlenbusch, of the London School of Economics department of management.
There’s actually a pretty good reason for this, according to Wharton professor Adam Grant.
“Extrinsic motivators can stop having much meaning — your raise in pay feels like your just due, your bonus gets spent, your new title doesn’t sound so important once you have it,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “But the sense that other people appreciate what you do sticks with you.
In other words, of course money matters to your employees. But, for a majority of them, it’s not their main motivation.
A Fun and Positive Work Environment
If your employees aren’t motivated by money, then what really motivates them? One study funded by Make Their Day, an employee motivation firm, and Badgeville, a gamification company, that surveyed 1,200 employees found that:
90 percent said a “fun work environment” was very or extremely motivating.
88 percent found praise from managers very or extremely motivating.
83 percent of respondents said recognition for contributions was more fulfilling than any rewards or gifts.
76 percent found peer praise very or extremely motivating.
Appreciation
A separate study from Glassdoor discovered that over 80 percent of employees are motivated to work harder when their boss shows appreciation for their work. Over half of employees reported that they would stay longer at the company if they felt more appreciation from their boss.
The study also found that 46 percent of employees would feel more appreciated if their boss gave them an unexpected treat. This included anything from snacks, lunches, dinners, or thank you notes.
“There is a wide variety of ways to show employee appreciation that can go far towards keeping employees satisfied, engaged and retained,” said Allyson Willoughby, Glassdoor’s senior vice president of people and general counsel. “Even inexpensive forms of appreciation, like thank you cards and treats, or offering flexibility like telecommuting, show employees you value them.”
Other ways to show employees appreciation include involve them in the decision-making process. Also, give them career opportunities and recognize them at a team meeting or in a company newsletter.
Peer Pressure
When asked 200,000 employees, “What motivates you to excel and go the extra mile at your organization?,” employee engagement firm TINYpulse, found that their peers were the number one influence.
According the survey, “Compensation is now viewed as just the baseline reason for taking a job. Camaraderie plays the true motivating role in encouraging employees to outperform expectations.”
Following camaraderie and peer motivation, employees reported that they were most motivated by:
Intrinsic desire to a good job.
Feeling encouraged and recognized.
Having a real impact.
Growing professionally.
Meeting client/customer needs.
Money and benefits.
Positive supervisor/senior management.
Believe in the company/product.
Work-Life Balance
A 2015 report on Millennials from the US Chamber of Commerce put an emphasis on flex-time. And, for good reason. It found that three out of four Millennials reported that work-life balance drives their career choices.
David Rook of the JP Griffin Group adds, “Millennials value flexibility above many things. They want to telecommute, make their own hours and might even be willing to accept a lower salary if it means wielding more choices when it comes to commanding their work schedule.”
Despite the importance of a healthy work-life balance, Millennials still look for organizations that offer a decent salary, benefits, and retirement packages.
Leading By Example
Finally, an employee survey from the National Business Research Institute (NBRI) “used the Root Cause Analysis to identify the items that were driving employee perceptions.” The survey found that employees are motivated by management that is approachable and easy to talk with.
Employee motivation increases when they are provided with resources and equipment to do their job. A big motivation also involves management’s ability to keep employees informed about important issues and changes.
A Global Perspective on What Motivates Employees
Leadership also plays a big role in motivating employees from around the world. Marcus Buckingham, founder of the TMBC Global Engagement Index, found that different countries have various drivers of engagement. These are:
US, China, Germany: The most engaged teams need to rally around a shared mission.
UK and India: It’s  important to have teammates with shared values.
France, Canada, Brazil and Argentina: Engagement relies on the feeling that teammates have their back.
Australia: Confidence in the company’s future boosts engagement.
Spain: These employees like the challenge to grow by adding skills.
“Perhaps we shouldn’t have been surprised [by these differentiators],” Buckingham told Fast Company, “since some of these patterns do appear to fit, in the broadest sense, the politico-social climate of each country.”
What Motivates Employees?
Did you notice a theme among the research listed above? The main motivators for employees all point to having a positive attitude to toward their corporate culture.
Employees want encouragement and support. They prefer to work in an organization that fosters growth and where they feel they’re making a difference. And, they long for leaders who display appreciation and gratitude.

Alright, I've got a bunch of information here from different sources about what motivates employees. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First off, there's this idea that motivation is complex and varies from person to person. Some people are driven by money, others by recognition or the enjoyment of their work. That makes sense. I remember reading about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic is when you do something because you find it satisfying in itself, like a hobby. Extrinsic motivation is when you do something to get an external reward, like a bonus or promotion.

One source mentioned Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which arranges needs from basic physiological needs up to self-actualization. In a work context, once employees' basic needs like salary and job security are met, higher-level needs like esteem and self-actualization become motivators. So, maybe after paying employees fairly, companies should focus on things like recognition and providing opportunities for growth.

Another theory mentioned was Herzberg's two-factor theory, which separates hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors include salary and work conditions. If these aren't adequate, employees are dissatisfied, but improving them doesn't necessarily make them more motivated. Motivators are things like recognition, achievement, and growth opportunities, which can actually increase job satisfaction and motivation. So, it's not enough just to pay people well; you need to provide those motivators to get employees engaged.

There's also expectancy theory, which suggests that motivation depends on the expectation that effort will lead to good performance, which in turn will lead to desirable rewards. So, if employees believe that putting in extra effort will lead to a bonus, for example, they might be motivated to work harder. This seems logical.

Goal-setting theory proposes that setting specific, challenging goals can motivate employees, especially if they receive feedback on their progress. I can see how having clear goals gives employees direction and a sense of accomplishment when they achieve them.

Then there's Daniel Pink's book "Drive," which emphasizes intrinsic motivation being enhanced by providing autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Autonomy is having control over one's work, mastery is getting better at something, and purpose is connecting to a higher cause. These seem like really important factors in keeping employees motivated and engaged.

Looking at all these theories, it seems like a combination of factors motivates employees. It's not just one thing; it's a mix of compensation, recognition, growth opportunities, work environment, and alignment with personal values.

Now, looking at the specific examples and strategies provided in the sources, there are lots of ways companies can motivate their employees. For example:

- Providing fair salaries and benefits.

- Offering recognition and appreciation for their work.

- Giving opportunities for career growth and development.

- Ensuring a good work-life balance.

- Assigning challenging and meaningful work.

- Allowing autonomy in how work is done.

- Aligning the company's purpose with employees' values.

- Creating a positive and supportive work environment.

These all make sense and align with the theories.

One source talked about a study where employees were surveyed about what motivates them, and interesting work and good pay were ranked highest. Another study mentioned that interesting work was the top motivator, while pay was not always among the top factors. So, it seems like interesting work is a key motivator across different studies.

There's also mention of the importance of intangible motivators, like recognition and a positive work culture, which can be more impactful than material incentives. In fact, one source cautioned that over-reliance on monetary incentives can sometimes backfire, reducing intrinsic motivation.

I recall reading about how extrinsic rewards can sometimes undermine intrinsic motivation. For example, if someone is doing a task they enjoy for fun, and then start getting paid for it, they might enjoy it less because the intrinsic motivation is replaced by the extrinsic reward. So, it's important to strike a balance.

Another interesting point was about the connection between employee motivation and company success. One source cited a study estimating that unmotivated employees cost the US economy over $450 billion per year. That's staggering. On the other hand, motivated employees lead to better performance, lower turnover, and higher profitability.

So, investing in employee motivation isn't just about being a nice employer; it's crucial for the bottom line.

Now, in terms of practical steps, the sources provided many examples of how to motivate employees. For instance:

- Setting up an OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system to clarify goals and align efforts.

- Ensuring employees have the right tools and equipment to do their job effectively.

- Providing opportunities for continuous learning and development.

- Organizing team lunches and events to foster camaraderie.

- Implementing mentorship programs.

- Conducting regular one-on-one meetings between managers and employees.

- Giving specific and genuine praise to employees.

- Collecting employee feedback through pulse surveys to understand their needs and concerns.

- Promoting a healthy work culture that values openness and recognition.

- Allowing flexible working hours and remote work options.

- Supporting employees' well-being through initiatives like fitness programs or mindfulness sessions.

These are all great ideas, but I imagine that implementing them requires resources and commitment from the company.

One source also discussed the concept of employee engagement, breaking it down into several elements like satisfaction, empowerment, personal growth, peer rapport, management rapport, recognition and feedback, culture, advocacy, and well-being. This seems comprehensive and aligns with the various motivation theories.

Moreover, there's a model combining Maslow's hierarchy of needs with these engagement elements, suggesting that addressing higher-level needs is crucial for motivation.

I think the key takeaway is that motivation is multifaceted, and companies need to consider a range of factors to keep their employees engaged and performing at their best.

Additionally, measuring employee motivation is important to understand where improvements can be made. One source mentioned using pulse surveys to regularly gauge employee sentiment and make adjustments accordingly. This seems like a proactive approach compared to annual surveys, which might not capture real-time issues.

Lastly, there was a section on change management and how to handle organizational changes in a way that maintains employee motivation. It referenced John P. Kotter's 8-step model for successful change management, emphasizing the importance of communication, leadership, and anchoring changes in the corporate culture.

Overall, it's clear that motivation is a critical aspect of managing a successful workforce, and there are numerous strategies and theories to guide employers in fostering a motivated and engaged workforce.

So, to sum it up, what motivates employees is a combination of factors including interesting work, fair compensation, recognition, growth opportunities, a positive work environment, and alignment with personal values. Companies need to consider these elements and implement strategies to address them in order to maximize employee motivation and, consequently, organizational success.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including interesting work, fair compensation, recognition, growth opportunities, positive work environment, and alignment with personal values.}} \]
