Alright, so I have this question: "How do people respond to change?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I guess it's about understanding human behavior in the face of change. I'm not an expert in psychology or sociology, but I've taken some courses and read a bit on the subject, so I'll try to piece together what I know.

First off, change is a constant in life, right? Things are always changing—technology, society, personal circumstances. But even though change is inevitable, people react to it differently. Some embrace it, while others resist it strongly. I think there are several factors that influence how people respond to change.

Let me start by considering the psychological aspects. I recall that people have a natural tendency to seek consistency and stability. This is probably because uncertainty can be threatening. So, when change disrupts that consistency, it can trigger feelings of anxiety or discomfort. That might be why some people resist change—they're trying to maintain their comfort zone.

I also remember something about loss aversion. People tend to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. So, when change occurs, people might focus on what they're losing rather than what they might gain from the change. For example, if a company is undergoing restructuring, employees might worry about losing their jobs or their familiar work routines, even if the change could lead to better opportunities in the long run.

Another concept that comes to mind is the stages of change, perhaps related to Prochaska and DiClemente's Transtheoretical Model. They proposed that people go through different stages when experiencing change, such as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Maybe people respond to change based on which stage they're in. For instance, someone in the precontemplation stage might not see the need for change and therefore resist it, while someone in the action stage is more open to implementing changes.

Moreover, personality traits probably play a role in how people handle change. For example, individuals who are more open to experience might be more receptive to change, whereas those who are more conscientious and prefer structure might be more resistant. I think extroversion and neuroticism could also influence responses to change, but I'm not entirely sure about that.

Let me think about this from a motivational perspective. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, people are motivated to fulfill their basic needs before moving on to higher-level needs. If change threatens their sense of safety or security, which are lower-level needs, they might prioritize protecting those needs over adapting to the change.

Also, the way change is communicated and managed can greatly affect people's responses. If change is introduced abruptly without explanation, people might feel blindsided and resist more. On the other hand, if there's clear communication, involvement, and support throughout the change process, people might be more likely to accept and adapt to the change.

I should probably look into some research or theories on this topic to get a more structured understanding. Maybe there are specific models that explain how people respond to change.

Popular Change Management Theories
John M Fisher and John Kotter have made a significant contribution to popular change management theories. A brief description of their change management models is given below.
John M. Fisher's Change Model
Fisher's Process of Transition model explains how people respond to change. This change theory is based on earlier studies by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross who identified five stages of grief. Fisher identified eight stages that people follow in succession through a change process.
Click on Fisher's Process of 

Transition Diagram to view these stages. They are:
1. Anxiety and Denial
2. Happiness
3. Fear
4. Threat
5. Guilt and Disillusionment
6. Depression and Hostility
7. Gradual Acceptance
8. Moving Forward
Some people move more quickly through the stages than others. Deciding factors are their temperament, life experiences, degree of control and so on. People may also  regress to an earlier stage depending on their situation.
An effective change agent is able to plot where people are on Kotter's Transition Curve - and respond appropriately.
Initial Resistance to Change
People generally react badly to change in the first instance. They are anxious and in shock.
They follow this by expressing a degree of happiness or relief about the situation, glad that something is happening at last.
Then fear sets in.
If there is a healthy amount of two way communication at the happiness stage, then the degree of fear may be reduced, but it always present.
People will resist change, afraid of what lies ahead and how it might affect them in a negative way.
If you are a change agent, accept that this resistance to change is a perfectly normal reaction - and do not be deterred!
For example, there is no point focusing on the benefits of change, if people are still in the stage of fear or threat.
You have to listen to them and attempt to understand where they are at that moment.
The discussion should ideally move to an action stage when they are ready for it.
As long as you are ahead of them on the curve, you can guide them forward at the right time.
Working with People through Change
It is possible that some people are not able to move forward and "get stuck" in the stages of denial, disillusionment or hostility. You might find it difficult to accept that you cannot help everyone move through the change process, despite your best efforts.
Your time might be better spent working with those who move quickly through the curve and see the change as a positive thing.
These people can act as "champions" and support others to reach the same view.
Timing is extremely important when managing change.
If you attempt to force change through before the majority of people are ready, then the change is not likely to be as effective in the long term.

John Kotter's Change Model
Kotter identified eight steps that need to be taken in order to manage change successfully. These steps translate the best of change management theories into practice.
1. Establish a sense of urgency
2. Form a powerful guiding coalition
3. Create a clear vision
4. Communicate the vision
5. Empower others to act on the vision
6. Plan and create short-term wins
7. Consolidate improvements and produce still more change
8. Institutionalise new approaches
These steps are based on a solid 
foundation of communication, empowerment and focus. Once the 

change has been made, it is important to embed the new approaches, so 
that people do not slip into old habits. Monitoring, feedback 

and intervention are necessary for a sufficient period after the changes
 has occurred.

How People React to Change, and The Change Strategy
Malcolm Webber
More
To successfully lead organizational change, leaders must understand how people react to change. They must also formulate an appropriate change strategy. This Letter will deal with both these issues.
How People React to Change:
People react to major organizational change in a manner similar to how they react to sudden traumatic events such as the death of a loved one, the breakup of a marriage, or a natural disaster that destroys one’s home. The reaction pattern has four stages:
1. Denial. The initial reaction is to deny that change will be necessary. “This isn’t happening” or “It’s just a temporary setback.”
2. Anger. The next stage is to get angry and look for someone to blame. At the same time, people stubbornly resist giving up accustomed ways of doing things.
3. Mourning. In this stage, people stop denying that change is inevitable, acknowledge what has been lost, and mourn it.
4. Adaptation. The final stage is to accept the need to change and get on with life.
The duration and severity of each type of reaction can vary greatly, and some people get stuck in an intermediate stage. Leaders must understand these stages and learn to be patient and helpful. Many people need help to overcome denial, conquer their anger, mourn without becoming depressed, and have optimism about adjusting successfully.
How People Are Affected by Repeated, Traumatic Change:
People react in different ways to repeated, traumatic change. Many people are hurt by change. This leaves them less resilient and more vulnerable to damage by subsequent change. Others are “inoculated” by repeated changes, and become better prepared to change again without having such an intense or prolonged period of adjustment.
Christian leaders must know their people, pray for them and with them, and seek to lead change in a manner that is healthy and beneficial. Organizational change should not hurt the people it was intended to serve.
The Change Strategy
There are two ways to introduce change in an organization: change people or change roles. Leaders must understand these two dimensions of change.
1. Change people. This approach assumes that new attitudes or skills will cause behavior to change. Skills can be changed with training programs, and attitudes can be changed by persuasive appeals or by team building interventions. Prayer, of course, is the Christian leader’s most potent way to bring change in people’s hearts when that change is in line with God’s will. “Converts” become change agents themselves and transmit the vision to other people in the organization.
2. Change roles. This approach assumes that when new roles require people to act in a different way, they will change their attitudes to be consistent with their new behavior. Roles can be changed by redesigning jobs to include different activities and responsibilities, by reorganizing the workflow, by modifying authority relationships, and by changing the criteria and procedures for the evaluation of work.
Either approach can succeed or fail depending on how it is implemented as well as the circumstances. Often the best strategy will be to use them together in a mutually supportive way, making efforts to change attitudes and skills to support new roles. This will minimize resistance and give change the best chance of success.
Using Someone Else’s Change Strategy?
There are many generic change strategies for either attitude change or role change. In the business world, some examples include downsizing, delayering, self-managed teams, quality circles and incentive plans. Popular strategies come and go in every organizational context.
However, a common mistake is for a leader to implement one of these change strategies without a careful and prayerful diagnosis of the particular problems and opportunities facing his or her own organization. A single generic strategy is not likely to solve an organization’s problems by itself, and it may make them worse.
Before initiating major changes, leaders must be clear about the nature of the problem, or the opportunity, and the objectives of the intended change. Just as in the treatment of a physical illness, the first step is a careful diagnosis to determine what is wrong with the patient. The organizational diagnosis can be conducted by the top leadership team, by outside consultants, or by a team composed of representatives of the various key stakeholders in the organization. To succeed, the procedure must be submitted to the will and purposes of God, and it must be bathed in prayer. After the diagnosis is completed, an appropriate change strategy can then be prayerfully designed with complementary changes in roles and people.
The next Leadership Letter will begin to describe the actual mechanics of implementing change.

Abstract
The authors present five fundamentally different ways of thinking about change, each representing different beliefs systems and convictions about how change works, the kind of interventions that are effective, how to change people, etc. They are labeled by color: yellow, blue, red, green, and white print thinking. Each is based upon a family of theories about change. These five models function as communication and diagnostic tools and provide a map of possible change strategies.

... failure to implement a change will not bring about a terminal endpoint (e.g., bankruptcy, closure of business). This type of change process encourages organizational members to negotiate about the potential benefits and risks of a change, rather than mobilize resources to strengthen internal cohesion (De Caluwe & Vermaak, 2004). Negotiations about non-existential change are a matter of resolving internal conflict between different internal stakeholders of the organization.  ...
... However, in a heterogeneous group, members may hold initially very different positions about the risks and benefits that accompany the change. Therefore, not all members adopt a value-creating perspective, especially knowing that members also may want their personal interests to be considered (De Caluwe & Vermaak, 2004). Accordingly, members of heterogenous groups may engage in value-claiming or competitive tactics, such as by conceding slowly, exaggerating the value of concessions, minimizing the benefits of the other's concessions, concealing information, arguing forcefully on behalf of principles that imply favorable settlements, making commitments to accept only highly favorable agreements, and be willing to outwait others (see Lax & Sebenius, 1986).  ...

Understanding The Cycle of Change, And How People React To It (Free Article)
Understanding The Cycle of Change, And How People React To It
Understanding The Cycle of Change, And How People React To It
Robert Bacal is a noted author, keynote speaker, and management consultant. You can view his bestselling books by going to the Bacal book listings here. In this article Robert outlines some of the basic elements and principles needed by managers, executives, and supervisors, in understanding how people react to change, and managing the workplace change process.
Managers often make the mistake of assuming that once a change is started, that employees will see that it is going to take place, and get on side.  This is rarely the case.  Because change causes fear, a sense of loss of the familiar, etc., it takes some time for employees to a) understand the meaning of the change and b) commit to the change in a meaningful way.  It is important to understand that people tend to go through stages in their attempts to cope with change.  Understanding that there are normal progressions helps change leaders avoid under-managing change or over-reacting to resistance.
As we go through the stages, you will probably find many similarities with the process a person goes through with the loss of a loved one.
Stage I:  Denial
An early strategy that people use to cope with change is to deny that it is happening, or to deny that it will continue or last.  Common responses during this stage are:
"I've heard these things before.  Remember last year they announced the new customer initiative?  Nothing ever happened, and this will pass."
"It's just another hair-brained idea from the top."
"I bet this will be like everything else.  The head honcho will be real gung-ho but in about six months everything will be back to normal.  You'll see."
"I'll believe it when I see it."
People in the denial stage are trying to avoid dealing with the fear and uncertainty of prospective change.  They are hoping they won't have to adapt.
The denial stage is difficult because it is hard to involve people in planning for the future, when they will not acknowledge that the future is going to be any different than the present.
People tend to move out of the denial stage when they see solid, tangible indicators that things ARE different.  Even with these indicators some people can remain in denial for some time.
Stage II:  Anger & Resistance
When people can no longer deny that something is or has happened, they tend to move into a state of anger, accompanied by covert and/or over resistance.  This stage is the most critical with respect to the success of the change implementation.  Leadership is needed to help work through the anger, and to move people to the next stage.  If leadership is poor, the anger at this stage may last indefinitely, perhaps much longer than even the memory of the change itself.
People in this stage tend to say things like:
"Who do they think they are?  Jerking us around"
"Why are they picking on us?"
"What's so damned bad about the way things are?
"How could [you] the boss allow this to happen?
Actually people say far stronger things, but we need to be polite.
Stage III:  Exploration & Acceptance
This is the stage where people begin to get over the hump.  They have stopped denying, and while they may be somewhat angry, the anger has moved out of the spotlight.  They have a better understanding of the meaning of the change and are more willing to explore further, and to accept the change.  They act more open-mindedly, and are now more interested in planning around the change and being participants in the process.
People in this stage say things like:
"Well, I guess we have to make the best of it."
"Maybe we can get through this."
"We need to get on with business."
Stage IV:  Commitment
This is the payoff stage, where people commit to the change, and are willing to work towards making it succeed.  They know it is a reality, and at this point people have adapted sufficiently to make it work.  While some changes will never get endorsement from employees (downsizing, for example) employees at this stage will commit to making the organization effective within the constraints that have resulted from the change.
Concluding Points
Let's conclude with some key points:
1)	The change process takes a considerable amount 	of time to stabilize and to work.  Don't 	undermanage by assuming it will "work itself 	out" and don't over-react when faced with 	reasonable resistance.
2)	Worry if there is no resistance.  If the change is 	significant it means that people are hiding their 	reactions.  Eventually the reactions that are not 	dealt with will fester and can destroy the 	organization.  Likewise with anger.

/ Back to all
Why People Respond To Change Differently: Obstacles vs Opportunities
We all interpret and respond to change differently. Some people are excited by change whilst others appear resistant and overwhelmed. Understanding the many different perspectives, emotions and responses to change in ourselves and those around us, brings people together, makes people feel understood and builds energy for change.
Written by Jon Watkins
Understanding why people respond differently to change starts by understanding the difference between change and transition
Change and transition are two different things. The difference is subtle but essential.
Change is external and what happens to you in your environment even if you disagree with it, e.g. a new boss, a change in role or a new IT system.
Transition is internal, and it’s how you think about change, engage and respond to it. Change can happen relatively quickly, whereas transition can be a much slower process of adaption.
Transitions are challenging without the impact of others reacting negatively because cognitively you and they are very different. Understanding and recognising these tiny details in each other’s thinking patterns is a skill, a skill that should be learnt and a skill that will impact the performance, wellbeing and communication of all.
Exploring the different perspectives and responses to change by understanding whether you are opportunity or obstacle focused
Assessing the balance of energy that you put into these 5 areas helps you to understand whether you see the opportunities or obstacles at work and how you and others approach risk and ambiguity.
Goals energy
Multiple pathways
Optimism
Fault finding
Time focus
1. Goals energy
Different people put different amounts of energy into setting themselves stretched or challenging goals. Some people naturally like to stretch themselves, others don’t. One person’s idea of a stretched goal is another’s idea of an impossible one, and to someone else, it’s not stretched enough.
Setting stretched goals is a skill, and its benefits include higher confidence and the will to keep going. Critical in the face of change as organisations move from one milestone to the next. Get the stretch wrong, and people begin to disengage with stress, burnout and anxiety. It’s essential to recognise what each individual deems as a stretch, and how it affects their response to change – for some change is too big a stretch, and they suffer, for others it may not be big enough.
Consider:
Do you set yourself stretched goals?
Does the team have stretched goals?
Are you persistent, or do you give up too early?
2. Multiple pathways
Some people put a lot of energy into finding a path around a problem, others less so. Change brings new ways of doing things, and those who put a lot of energy into finding multiple pathways are well prepared for change. They can find a route around a problem and are probably the people who identified the opportunity to “do it differently” in the first place. They are always looking for better ways to do things and enjoy various projects all at once. Change to them is manageable and exciting.
Those people who don’t put much energy into finding pathways around obstacles like to put their energy into similar projects and refer to process and procedure, previous solutions and other people to get their results. For them, a change could remove the mechanism for which they get results. Their strength lies in doing things the same way.
Consider:
What do you do when an obstacle arises?
3. Optimism
Optimism explores someones thinking style when they interpret a setback. A key component of thriving during change. It does include both positive and pessimistic thinking, but its primary measure is on how people interpret a setback. We all view setbacks in 3 ways. The setback becomes:
Personal – the fault lies with me “They thought I wasn’t good enough for the job. I have such bad luck.”
Permanent – the impact will be long-lasting. “This always goes wrong, it never goes right”. ‘I’ll never get a job’ – ‘I’ll never be good in interviews.’
Pervasive – adverse events will happen in all areas of my life ‘I didn’t get the job. It will be the same old story if I go for another interview!’
Those with lower optimism levels take longer to bounce back and negative events can blend into each other. This means that change can be taken more personally, become more permanent and blend into other changes. In short, they may need more time to process the change and adapt to it.
Those high in optimism can brush through a change far more comfortably than those with lower optimism. This can cause them to come across as flippant and they can respond to others with lower optimism levels still adapting to change with disdain. They can start saying things like:
“No-one died get on with it”
“You’re fine pull yourself together”
Brush past a change without giving it emotional attention and it will leave some feeling ignored, stressed and anxious. Ignoring people’s levels of optimism means that individuals could be forced to move past setbacks far quicker than they are capable of. They don’t process it properly, and it lingers, while the rest of the team moves on, they are left stuck.
Remember everyone is different and interpret setbacks in different ways – it’s a stance, and a great strength.
Consider:
What is in your past that you need to learn from to then move forward?
4. Fault finding
People who have high levels of fault-finding put a lot of energy into looking at what could go wrong, not “how can I make this work”. They see faults, large and small and spend time thinking about how things fail, not how they will succeed. People high in fault finding are not necessarily being negative.
Those who don’t put much energy into fault finding find:
people get drawn to them
look at how can things work
appear excited and positive
don’t waste energy on what goes wrong
Those people who put a lot of energy into fault finding want to address the faults when going through change. This strength has to be acknowledged as a strength. If they are ignored, they become frustrated, stressed and won’t buy into the change.
Consider:
Does the team spend more time finding fault with one another or their work?
As a team, how do we ensure we spend sufficient time and energy to mitigate the risk of making snap judgements?
5. Time focus
Time is subjective and relative to each individual. If we all watch the same programme on Tv for 60 minutes, some people will feel it dragged and felt more like 6hrs others will feel it flew by and felt like 6 minutes. The point being is we don’t all see time the same way, and as a result, we don’t see change the same way either. There are 3 time focus’:
Past – feel safety + security in the past, “they were much better times”.
Present – focus on the present, “this is the time”.
Future – focus on the future, see it clearly and can’t wait to get there “there will be much better times”.
If I asked a room, perfectly balanced with people from all three time focus’ to describe their 1st ever day at work, the past focused people could talk in small intricate details about it. The future-focused people would not have a clue.
So if we relate this to change and take the typical approach that most change custodians take and describe the end state in detail. It’s likely that 2/3 of the audience won’t be able to picture it as their focus is on the past or present – not the future. They will find it distressing and loose focus on what needs to be achieved.
Likewise, only engage and focus on the past and present, and future-focused people will find it distressing. Instead, a history walk can be used to guide people through the change and incorporate everyone’s perspective of time.
The so what; some people are obstacles focused; others opportunity focused
Where do you or your team focus their energy? On spotting obstacles or spotting opportunities? Recognising who sits in which camp can help you understand why some people react differently to change.
Opportunity focused people think things will always go well, that it could be worse and generally happy with risk. When faced with a challenge or change their first thought is:
“How can I make this work”.
Obstacle focused people put a lot of energy into spotting errors; they are relatively risk-averse. When faced with a challenge or change their first thought is:
“What could go wrong”.
Both have their strengths, but both view change very differently. One can appear negative, one giddy. One sees change as a chance, the other a challenge, which is right, which is wrong? The answer is neither, and it can lead to highly charged and emotive reactions if one is not considered alongside the other or if communications favour only one.
Want to communicate and deliver change effectively?
We all think both logically and emotionally. It’s important to understand that everyone is different and has a different view of the world and what is important to them. We all see obstacles and opportunities differently. It’s not a simple case of the reward outweighs risk as the concept of risk is relative to each person and dependent on circumstance. Want to communicate and lead change effectively, and your focus will switch to:
How do I communicate and manage this change for both obstacle and opportunity focused people?
The real question to ask when communicating change effectively
For obstacle focused people the, barriers have to be addressed before they can move forward, if they don’t get resolved, then they don’t move forward engaged. They have to work harder to see the benefits of others have to work harder to show them by removing the obstacles.
For opportunity focused people, they are concerned only with how they can make it happen. They are not interested in what could go wrong. They have to work harder to see the obstacles or others have to work harder to show them.
Obstacle focused:
Do’s
Expect them to be initially negative and be prepared to explain why your ideas will work.
Be prepared for them to be resistant to change.
Ask them to help you examine all the things that could go wrong.
Accept that their position might be of value to you and find ways to use their strength.

Alright, I've got some information here from these documents. Let's see what they say about how people respond to change.

From Doc 1, it seems like there's a model called Fisher's Process of Transition, which outlines eight stages people go through when responding to change. The stages are: anxiety and denial, happiness, fear, threat, guilt and disillusionment, depression and hostility, gradual acceptance, and moving forward. It sounds like people progress through these stages sequentially, but the speed at which they move varies based on individual factors like temperament and life experiences. There's also mention of John Kotter's eight-step change model, which is more about managing change in an organization, but it's related.

Doc 2 talks about how people react to change similarly to how they react to traumatic events, like the death of a loved one or a natural disaster. It identifies four stages: denial, anger, mourning, and adaptation. This seems similar to the grieving process, which makes sense because change can involve loss—loss of familiar routines, job roles, or even identity within an organization.

Doc 3 mentions "change paradigms" and labels them with colors: yellow, blue, red, green, and white print thinking. Each paradigm represents different beliefs about change and how it should be approached. This seems more about the theoretical frameworks for understanding change rather than the psychological responses of individuals.

Doc 4 discusses the cycle of change and how people react to it, breaking it down into stages similar to Doc 1 and Doc 2. It mentions denial, anger, exploration and acceptance, and commitment. The article emphasizes that change takes time and that leaders need to manage expectations and reactions appropriately.

Doc 5 is from a resilience training company and talks about how people interpret and respond to change differently based on whether they focus on opportunities or obstacles. It introduces concepts like goals energy, multiple pathways, optimism, fault finding, and time focus to explain these differences.

So, overall, it seems that responding to change involves a process with distinct stages, and people move through these stages at different paces. There are also individual differences in how people approach change, depending on their personality traits, beliefs, and coping mechanisms.

I think the key takeaway is that change is not a one-size-fits-all scenario. People need support and understanding as they navigate through the changes, and leaders should be aware of these processes to manage change effectively.

Now, to answer the question "how people respond to change," I can summarize the main points from these documents.

First, there are staged responses to change, similar to the grieving process. People go through denial, anger, mourning, and eventually adaptation. During denial, they refuse to accept that change is happening. In the anger stage, they look for someone to blame and resist the change. Mourning involves acknowledging the loss and adjusting to the new reality, and adaptation is accepting the change and moving forward.

Second, there are individual differences in how people approach change. Some focus on opportunities and are more optimistic and adaptable, while others focus on obstacles and are more risk-averse and cautious. Understanding these differences can help in communicating and managing change in a way that resonates with different types of people.

Third, change is a process that takes time, and it's important for leaders to manage expectations and provide support throughout the transition. Under-managing change can lead to resistance and poor outcomes, while over-reacting can exacerbate tensions.

In conclusion, people respond to change through a series of stages, and their reactions are influenced by individual traits and beliefs. Effective management of change requires understanding these responses and providing appropriate support to help individuals adapt successfully.
