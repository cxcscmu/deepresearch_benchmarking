So I've been asked why long-distance relationships don't work. Now, I know that not all long-distance relationships fail, but apparently, statistics show that they have higher failure rates compared to geographically close relationships. I need to understand why that is the case.

First off, I should probably define what a long-distance relationship (LDR) is. It's when two people in a romantic relationship live apart, sometimes thousands of miles away from each other. They maintain their relationship through technologies like phones, video calls, and messaging apps.

So, why don't they work? Or, more accurately, why are they more likely to fail? I need to consider several factors here.

Let me start by thinking about communication. In an LDR, communication is entirely reliant on technology. That means there can be issues with misinterpretation because non-verbal cues are lost in text or even in voice calls. Video calls help, but they're not the same as in-person interactions. So, maybe misunderstandings happen more often, leading to conflicts.

Also, the lack of physical touch could be a big issue. Humans are tactile creatures; we need hugs, kisses, and other forms of physical affection to feel connected. In an LDR, that's severely limited, which might lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnect.

Another thing is the time difference. If partners are in different time zones, it can be hard to find overlapping times when both are awake and free to talk. This might reduce the frequency of communications, making the relationship feel less immediate and vibrant.

Trust might also play a significant role. In an LDR, it's harder to verify where your partner is and who they're with. This lack of visibility can lead to jealousy and trust issues, which are major relationship stressors.

Moreover, the absence of shared experiences could be detrimental. In a geographically close relationship, couples share daily routines, go out together, and create memories side by side. In an LDR, these shared experiences are limited, which might hinder the bonding process.

I should also consider the practical aspects. Long-distance relationships can be expensive due to travel costs and international calling rates. Financial stress can take a toll on any relationship.

Additionally, being in different social environments might cause drifts in personal growth and interests. Over time, partners might grow apart if their experiences and worldviews diverge significantly.

Now, I need to see if these are the main reasons why LDRs don't work or have higher failure rates. Maybe I should look for some studies or statistics on this topic to get a better understanding.

Long-distance relationships are more successful than you think

Long-distance relationships have a 58 percent success rate, according to new research.
A new study of 1,000 Americans who have been in a long-distance relationship found that whether or not you and partner make it through the long-distance phase will come down to a coin flip.
The new survey, conducted by KIIROO, examined the burdens of keeping things fresh while far apart and whether respondents’ relationships survived the long-distance. Only 60 percent actually do.
It also revealed that a good number of long-distance relationships actually begin long-distance, with the uptick in couples meeting online.
SWNS
In fact, half of those surveyed said they met their partner online, with 27 percent saying they never actually lived close to their partner to begin with.
So, what qualifies as a long-distance relationship? According to the survey respondents, living at least 132 miles away from each other is the official qualifying factor.
The first few months of a long-distance relationship may be an optimistic time, but the study pinpointed the four-month mark as being the hardest part of the relationship.
But according to the data, if your long-distance relationship can survive the eight-month milestone, it gets a lot easier.
Being in a long-distance relationship means having to communicate with your partner electronically a lot more than usual.
According to the results, the average long-distance couple will send each other 343 texts every week and spend eight hours a week talking on the phone or video chatting.
But texting and calling doesn’t solve all the problems.
The survey showed that lack of physical intimacy was still the biggest challenge of endeavoring in long-distance travel (66 percent), with 31 percent saying they missed sex the most.
SWNS
“As the world becomes more and more digitally connected and we see ourselves drifting further and further apart, the adoption of technology to forge new and better ways to communicate has become imminent,” said Toon Timmermans, CEO of KIIROO.
“We forge new relationships online more now than ever before. From the results of this study, we see that technology in any shape or form is being used by long-distance relationships to feel closer, to feel loved and to attempt help ease sexual tensions that may arise due to the distance.”
While there are obviously many pitfalls to long-distance romance, the results showed that there were some surprising upsides as well.
For example, does living apart from your partner make you closer? According to the majority of respondents, it does.
Over half (55 percent) of Americans that have been in a long-distance relationship said that their time apart actually made them feel closer to their partner in the long run, while seven out of ten (69 percent) said that they actually talked to their partner more during their time apart.
Another 81 percent said that being in a long-distance relationship made real-life visits a lot more intimate than usual, due to the specialty of the occasion.
SWNS
But one glaring conclusion that the survey seemed to point to was that advancements in technology have not only made long-distance relationships possible — but even practical.
And while nothing will beat being physically close to your partner, 88 percent said technology helped them feel closer to their partner throughout their long-distance relationship.
“The results of this survey show that nearly half of the respondents would be interested in trying long-distance sex toys to help maintain physical intimacy,” said Toon Timmermans, CEO of KIIROO.
“By maintaining a physical connection, couples can help put some of those tensions to rest.”
“At the same time, being physically intimate from a distance helps relationships learn more about their bodies and about each other.
“KIIROO provides the tools for couples to be physically intimate from any distance.”

Long distance relationships are supposed to end. Isn't that what everyone says? They say you'll never make it work. The numbers tell a different story, though.
Today, 14 million couples are in long distance relationships. College, military assignments, and work keep couples apart.
How long do long distance relationships work?
4.5 months is all it takes for a long distance relationship to dissipate. It's not that the couples can't work things out. The majority let themselves worry about cheating. This causes the disaccord between partners.
How do you keep a long distance relationship?
There are 2 distinct rules:
Don't isolate yourself from other social situations. You need a life while your loved one is gone. If you sit and pine for him/her, it will only turn into resentment. This usually results in a break up.
Face any issues when you are face-to-face. Too many couples ignore the issues. They want to enjoy their time together. This only makes problems worse. Get it out in the open when you can. Then you can enjoy your time together.
How long is a long distance relationship?
Most people consider 125 miles or more apart a long distance relationship. Of course, there are differing opinions on this. If you can't see your partner daily or a few times a week, it's long distance.
How many long distance relationships don't make it?
40% of long distance relationships don't make it. Not because of the distance, though. It's because they didn't plan for changes. 70% of the broken-up relationships didn't plan for changes. In fact, the average LDR breaks up after just 4.5 months. Going from a close relationship to long distance requires quite a bit of work. There's a lot of give and take that not everyone can offer.
What percentage of high school sweethearts last?
Studies show that only 2% of high school sweethearts last.
Those who go away to college rarely make it past Thanksgiving. They call it the Turkey Dump. Thanksgiving is usually the first time high school sweethearts are back together. It's at that point that one party usually breaks off the relationship. Many chalk it up to wanting to "explore the possibilities."
Can you be in love with someone you never met?
It seems ridiculous. How could you love someone whom you've never seen face-to-face? The truth is, it does happen. Relationships often last. Verbal communication takes out the superficial feelings. You don't judge someone on their looks or nitpick their habits. Instead, you fall in love with what's inside.
What is the percentage of failed marriages?
Almost 40% of marriages end up in divorce. Of the 2 million marriages in the U.S., 800,000 fail.
How many relationships do you have in a lifetime?
According to Claire Jarvis, Director of Communications at Siemens, men and women fall in love just twice in their lives. This means just 2 "real" relationships. But most people have a total of 7 or more relationships in their lifetime. These relationships may be more casual than "true love," though.
How long should you date before getting married?
According to Ted Huston, relationship researcher, couples who dated for 25 months stay happily married. Surprisingly, couples dating for only 1½ years stay married for 7 years. Those who dated more than 3 years often divorce right away. If you're planning on getting an engagement ring soon, make sure to look at online jewelry retailers, such as Blue Nile, to save some money. If you're asking "Is Blue Nile a good deal ," make sure to read our full review.
More Surprising Statistics About Long Distance Relationships
Long distance relationships are a part of the college experience.
It's almost like a rite of passage. Almost 75% of college students claim to have had an LDR at least once during college. Maybe it's a part of growing up? High school sweethearts are the most common long distance couples. Not all start in high school, though.
Even married couples have long distance relationships.
Almost 3.75 million American couples live apart from one another. Spouses in the military make up a large portion of the couples. But today, the economy forces more married couples to live separately. Better opportunities away from home keep couples apart.
Long distance relationship couples often have better communication.
Living apart from a significant other forces deeper communication. You lose that sense of mundaneness when you don't see one another every day. Many consider it the "honeymoon" phase. You just get to live it over and over again.
Your loved one wants to hear the daily "boring" stuff.
It might seem more important to get melodramatic. You think you must profess your undying love. Dr. Gregory Guldner of the Center for the Study of Long Distance Relationships says don't. Instead, talk about the boring stuff. Talk about what you ate for dinner or your recent issue at work. Loved ones want to hear the daily stuff; it helps them feel connected.
Communication means more than talking.
Intimacy is complicated in a long distance relationship. Sexting is a necessity, according to Rachel Moheban-Wachtel, a relationship psychotherapist. Sharing fantasies and staying open helps you stay connected.
Texting isn't enough to keep the relationship alive.
Texting is convenient, but it's not personal. Acronyms and emojis aren't the same as a real conversation. Rachel Moheban-Wachtel suggests making it a habit to have nightly talks. It helps keep the connection alive, something texting can't do for you. Get on the phone or Skype. Connecting verbally can save your relationship.
Worrying about cheating can cause breakups.
LDR couples aren't at any higher risk of a cheating on a significant other than close couples. However, the worry it can cause can wreak havoc on a relationship. It's all about trust. If you can't trust your loved one, your relationship may be doomed.
Long distance relationships aren't more likely to end during the first 3 months than other relationships.
A study conducted by Central Michigan University found that LDRs and other relationships were tied; they both had the same statistics within the first 3 months. It's after that honeymoon phase that things start to change.
LDRs often last because of fantasies or idealizations.
People in an LDR often fantasize about their relationship. They aren't faced with the daily trials and tribulations. They remember their loved one in a somewhat falsely positive manner. They overlook the negatives they would see in person.
Relationship quality isn't based on geography, but on individual personalities.
A study between close couples and LDRs showed no difference between the relationships themselves. The differences occurred between the individual personalities. Couples in a long distance relationship aren't doomed because of the space between them. Their communication and level of trust dictates their success.
Women aren't as fragile as you think.
Women are often portrayed as the weaker sex. Research shows that they handle the distance in long distance relationships better than men. They even handle breakups better. Women have an easier time adjusting, which is just a part of their nature. Men often resist change. This makes the physical separation difficult for them.
Many relationships end at the physical reunion.
You'd think couples would be happy to be back together. The opposite is often true, though. 33% of reunited couples end up breaking it off 3 months after the reunion.
The Takeaway
Falling in love with someone hundreds of miles away isn't hopeless. The statistics speak for themselves. It's about how you handle the relationship that matters. Don't restrict your love interests to your zip code. Broaden your horizons and see who's out there waiting for you.

Why 82% of Long Distance Relationships Don't Work
Why 82% of Long Distance Relationships Don’t Work
By Will - LongDistanceFun / Advice / March 14, 2018 / 8 Comments
You are here because you’re certainly in a long distance relationship
I’m sorry, but this article may not please you.
We must face the truth: the vast majority of couples in long distance relationships are statistically doomed to fail and break up.
Of course, I don’t tell you this because it’s impossible to save your couple, but because I firmly believe that you can be the exception and belong to the minority for whom it works.
But first of all, it’s important to put this statement in context.
Does the majority of long distance relationships fail? Is it true?
82% of couples in long distance relationship put an end to their adventure after finally moving in together, according to the Ohio State University.
In fact, another study from the same university goes even further, revealing that one third of those same couples break up within three months of moving in together.
Tough. But should we accept these results as they are?
Although these figures are significant, it’s important to qualify them:
These studies concern only college students: College time is a period of change for each partner. After graduation, American students have the urgency to find a job to repay the huge debt they got to get to college. But what about all the other couples in LDR?
These studies take only place in the United States: American “dating culture” fundamentally differs from romantic and social relationships maintained by other nationalities. Can we really generalize these results to the rest of the Western world?
These studies only consider breakups after that the couples move in together: Moving from student life to active life, as well as from solo to couple life, creates more tensions and new challenges, whether there’s distance or not. What about the breakups before moving in together?
However, whether we like it or not, whether we give credit to these studies or not, the reality remains overwhelming: a majority of long distance relationships are meant to break up anyway.
This can happen after the final reunion (as described in this study), but also (and even more frequently) during the long distance relationship.
So we could still try to relativize these figures, saying that after all, classic relationships are not perfect either. Breakups are commonplace today, whether before or after settling down together, before or after marriage, before or after the birth of a child.
However, for long distance relationships, not everything should be considered the same way.
Many things are different. Typically, you have to relearn everything.
A common example is idealization, which wreaks havoc in LDRs, particularly during reunions and after moving in.
Geographical distance makes us exaggerate the good sides of our partner in an unrealistic way and completely forget about the potential and real bad sides. Once together, all the problems which had been put aside return to the surface and conflict is inevitable.
But can we blame idealization even for breakups happening before moving in? I don’t think so.
Why long distance relationships don’t work (most of the time)
There are millions of possible reasons to explain a LDR’s failure:
Lack of love
Bitterness
Detachment
Mistrust
Silence
Jealousy
Lies
Temptation
Deception
Lack of listening
Inexperience
Shyness
Idealization
Loneliness
Lack of vision
Monotony
Lack of privacy
Sadness
Lack of involvement
Resignation
It’s vital to find a comprehensive response over the long term, although one could analyze one by one each of these problems and find a remedy:
Long distance relationships fail because couples fail to create and maintain a healthy, complete and fulfilling love life.
Is it the distance fault? …Not at all.
It’s up to you and your partner to bring intimacy, fun, communication, complicity, exciting and inspiring reunions, a bright future, an assumed sexuality and feelings on a daily basis.
Either before or after moving together, traditional couples and LDR couples will always have a very high failure rate.
However, long distance relationships have additional barriers: idealization, relearning, uncertainties, lack of communication, loneliness, etc.
Fighting for your relationship is up to you. No matter what people and statistics say!
Your couple is never doomed to fail.
You can always be the exception to the rule, but today, it’s important to put all the chances on your side to be part of the couples who last and flourish.
That’s why I strongly recommend you to read now this article I wrote about “ How to Make your Long Distance Relationship Work? “!
About The Author

Despite the general belief, the long distance relationship statistics reveal that millions of people are currently in a successful long-distance relationship—or even marriage.
Commuting for work, studying abroad, being stationed on military assignment, living in another state, and online dating have all made long-distance relationships more common and accepted.
If you want to know more about how successful long-distance relationships are, how they function, or you want to find out some tips on how to keep yours alive in 2022, keep reading.
The Top 10 Key Long Distance Relationship Facts and Stats
When it comes to long distance, statistics show couples live an average of 125 miles apart.
More than 90% of people living in the UK and Europe have been in a long-distance relationship.
10% of married couples started together as a long-distance relationship, marriage statistics indicate.
The average long-distance relationship ends in 4.5 months.
The success rate of a long-distance relationship is 58%.

General Long Distance Relationship Statistics for 2022
If you are someone who’s in a long-distance relationship or marriage, the stats below will show you that you aren’t alone and your love has a high chance of succeeding. Even if you’re doubtful about entering one, make sure to read these before you decide.
1. 14 million people in the US in a long-distance relationship.
(Romancoholic)
And this doesn’t include the rest of the world or the other 3.37 million people who are married but share a long-distance relationship. Even though this data might seem scary, it means that even happily married couples can end up in a long-distance relationship and still make it work.
2. There are two main types of long distance relationships: couples who met online and couples who were separated by circumstances.
(Long Distance Diaries)
The first type of long-distance relationship is actually any relationship that starts when people don’t live near each other. They may meet online, through friends, or at some place away from their homes. The second type involves lovers who met traditionally but had to separate due to certain circumstances.
3. When it comes to long distance, statistics show couples live an average of 125 miles apart.
(Brandon Gaille)
“Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” Some couples are separated by thousands of miles, some are separated by just a hundred, but the pain of being away from your loved one is always the same.
4.  Around 75% of US college students have been in a long-distance relationship, according to the statistics on long distance relationship.
(Inspiring Tips)
Thanks to the internet and online communication, more couples than ever are in a long-distance relationship. Job transfers, new opportunities, and personal matters are just some of the reasons couples experience this kind of relationship.
5. More than 90% of people living in the UK and Europe have been in a long-distance relationship.
(Mind Body Green)
However, out of the many long-distance relationships in Europe and the UK (91% of the population has been in one), half broke down.
According to the long distance relationship statistics from the UK, the main reason for failing was the lack of progress, as 71% of women and 64% of men claim. The other half, who didn’t break up, claim that resolving arguments quickly was their secret for success.
6. The average long-distance relationship ends in 4.5 months.
(Long Distance Relationship)
Most relationships end. However, long-distance couples are particularly concerned with this. A survey found that couples believe a long-distance relationship lasts 14 months on average.
Be that as it may, these relationships often don’t last more than 5 months. Of course, not all long-distance relationships are doomed, and a lot of them last much longer.
7. Statistics of proximity relationship vs. long distance indicate that some couples are happier in a long-distance relationship.
(Romancoholic)
One survey has revealed that many couples function better when there’s a distance between them. This can be explained by the level of freedom that people in a long-distance relationship have. They have a romantic partner, but also their independence.
8. Long-distance couples see each other once or twice a month, on average, according to the long distance relationship facts.
(Brandon Gaille)
Since visiting each other often isn’t possible for long-distance couples, a great majority of them speak on the phone up to three times a week, on average. Many long-distance couples also write letters to each other.
Long Distance Relationship Facts and Statistics
If you’re in a long-distance relationship — hello, you’re a part of these stats. Now that we got you covered on some general info, let’s go into more detail about aspects such as success rates, frequency, and chances of ever being in a long-distance relationship.
10. The success rate of a long-distance relationship is 58%.
(New York Post)
More than half of them last long enough to turn into something more serious. People who have been in this kind of relationship claim that it has a high chance of succeeding.
11. 35% of students will be in a long-distance relationship in college, statistics indicate.
(Refinery 29)
College is one of the main reasons so many couples are in long-distance relationships. As we’ve already seen, statistics report that up to 75% of college students have been in one at some point in their lives.
12. Only 2% of high school relationships survive the long-distance phase.
(CreditDonkey)
Couples who are separated because of college rarely last longer than the first Thanksgiving. This phenomenon is also known as the “Turkey Dump” because high school couples usually see each other again for the first time at Thanksgiving.
Of those with a high school partner in a long distance relationship, statistics show that most couples break up at this time because they’re ready to explore new things.
13. One-third of long-distance relationships ended within 3 months of the couple moving to the same place.
(Refinery 29)
As shown in the long distance relationship statistics, some studies have discovered that these relationships are more stable than those whose participants are physically closer. However, in some cases, that stability lasts only until they reunite and move to the same place to be together.
14. It’s estimated that 27% of long-distance couples never lived close to each other.
(New York Post)
Studies have revealed that just over a quarter of long-distance relationships actually started off as long distance. As the facts about any long distance relationship show, online dating is a notable contributor to the increase in the number of long-distance relationships.
15. On average, long-distance couples have 30-minute-long phone calls.
(Romancoholic)
Today, long-distance relationships are much easier to maintain with the help of technology. Telling someone that you miss them is only a few clicks away, and staying in touch and nurturing intimacy is not as complicated as it might have been in the past.
Long Distance Marriage Statistics for 2022
After the borders closed unexpectedly due to the pandemic, many people found themselves in long-distance marriages . To make it easier, we found some stats to fill in the gaps and doubts with information on frequency, benefits, and trends when it comes to long-distance marriages.
16. According to the long distance marriage statistics, 2.9% of married couples are in a long-distance relationship.
(Long Distance Relationship)
The main reason married couples find themselves in a long-distance relationship is work. In addition to this, military service is also one of the more frequent reasons for a long-distance relationship, where one or both partners are called to participate in active duty.
17. 10% of married couples started together as a long-distance relationship, marriage statistics indicate.
(Ezine Articles)
Apparently, it’s not impossible for a long-distance relationship to become something long term—and even turn into a marriage. Long-distance relationships can become stronger as time goes by; people just need to work hard at them.
18. A study based on 150 couples revealed that long-distance relationships make people both physically and mentally healthier.
(Long Distance Fun)
The study concluded that partners who don’t see each other every day are less anxious and depressed, and they have a better diet than those who spend all their time together.
As the psychological facts about long distance relationships explain, this happens because distance allows people to be more independent and freely organize their daily activities and social life.
19. More than half of Americans in a long-distance relationship claim that the situation brought them closer to their partner.
(New York Post)
It’s estimated that 55% of US adults feel a deeper connection to their partner from being in a long-distance relationship. A long distance marriage or relationship makes people miss each other more, and it gives them a greater appreciation for the moments they spend together.
20. Around 88% of people in a long-distance relationship say that technology lets them stay close to their partner.
(New York Post)
Naturally, nothing is better than being physically close to the person you love, but technology plays a major role for those sharing a long-distance relationship. For a long distance couple, the marriage statistics report that constant texting and chatting give these partners a greater feeling of closeness.
21. Approximately 24% of internet users have relied on the internet or their email for communication in a long-distance relationship.
(Dating at a Distance)
Social media and video chats have also greatly helped people in long-distance relationships. And even though social media may sometimes be a cause for jealousy, the social media statistics on long distance relationship interactions reveal that it also provides a sense of connection.
22. On average, people in a long-distance relationship send 343 text messages on a weekly basis.
(New York Post)
As we’ve already mentioned, technology and communication are major factors in a successful long-distance relationship.
Chat services and text messages give people the opportunity to express themselves anytime and anywhere, and as the long distance relationship sexting statistics reveal, they make up for the lack of physical closeness.
Given this, don’t be shy — pour yourself a glass of wine and sext your partner!
Long Distance Relationship Statistics and Challenges
All relationships face challenges, and long-distance relationships are no different. However, people who are in love frequently tend to disregard the obvious challenges they will have to face that no ordinary couple even thinks about. Here are the most common ones.
23. The absence of physical intimacy is the biggest obstacle for 66% of people in a long-distance relationship.
(Refinery 29)
Some couples don’t have sex, and that’s fine. However, not being able to share intimacy with your loved one is the greatest challenge long-distance couples face. In addition to this, 31% of surveyed people say they miss sex the most.
24. The chances of cheating reach 25%, based on the long distance relationship cheating statistics.
(PsychCentral)
However, cheating comes in many forms —it’s not just sleeping with another person. An emotional infidelity is also a form of cheating, as well as hiding personal things from a partner and sharing them with someone else.
25. Long distance relationship statistics indicate that 55% of people are worried that their partner will meet someone else.
(New York Post)
In addition to this, 50% also feel lonely, and 43% feel like they are drifting apart from their partner.
26. Long distance relationship facts show that maintaining this kind of relationship is pretty expensive.
(Miss Kyra)
However, spending money on traveling to see your partner isn’t the only costly thing. Not to mention, probably impossible in 2021 with all the travel restrictions.
Phone and electric bills will increase. Sending an occasional surprise gift will also cost you more since it carries courier costs. In addition to sacrificing your bank account, putting in the extra time and effort will seriously test every long-distance relationship.
FAQs
What percentage of long distance relationships work?
(CreditDonkey)
60% of all long-distance relationships work out in the end. Maintaining a long-term relationship is complicated, and not everyone wants to put in extra effort, go through various changes, and compromise.
Do long distance relationships last?
(Long Distance Relationships)
Despite general belief, a long-distance relationship breaking down is no more common than that of a regular one. Long-distance relationships have a 27% chance of leading to a break-up within the first six months, while regular relationships have a 30% likelihood.

Six Challenges of a Long-Distance Relationship – How You Can Overcome Them
Long distance relationships are difficult to maintain. Your family may discourage it, and some of your friends may advise you not to get your hopes up, lest you get your heart broken. Long distance relationships (LDRs) include romantic relationships between partners who are geographically distant. Partners may need to stay in different locations for various reasons such as job or studies (Borelli., Rassmussen, Burkhart, & Sbarra, 2014). Sometimes these relationships may even be formed virtually and partners may seldom meet each other in person.  Although such relationships are becoming increasingly common, the common perception still remains that the success rate of such relationships is low.
LDRs are common as people are moving from their hometowns to fulfill their academic or career goals (Pistole, Roberts, & Chapman, 2010). Though access to internet and other mediums of communication makes maintaining these relationships easier, there are other stressors that can still make them difficult to manage. For example, research suggests that awareness about lack of physical proximity itself can make relationships seem difficult along with concerns regarding the quality of the relationship in general (Pistole, Roberts, & Chapman, 2010).  While the general notion is that the lack of proximity and constant communication are the only major challenges when it comes to LDRs newer studies show that these are only a small part of one’s relationship satisfaction (Shrivastva & Burianova, 2014). Studies now seem to suggest that differing views about commitment among partners, having unrealistic ideals of the ‘perfect relationship’, and becoming avoidant in communication are the bigger reasons why LDRs become difficult to sustain in the long run (Pistole, Roberts, & Chapman, 2010; Maguire & Kinney, 2010).  In case you are in a long-distance relationship presently or likely to get into one in the near future, the following are some of the challenges you can anticipate.
Jealousy: It is possible that partners in LDR can experience jealousy because one’s partner spends more time with other people which can cast doubt over the partner’s loyalty. The first thing to understand is that jealousy is an instinct that can arise due to insecurities which might be present in any relationship. It is natural to feel jealous and to express it. Sometimes jealousy arises from feeling of insecurity or lack of trust in your partner.  In such situations being honest about one’s feelings can help both partners to manage their relationship better. It’s advisable that partners discuss their anxieties and fears regarding LDRs. These discussions will not only help in gauging whether both partners are on the same page but also make them feel understood by each other. It is better that one acknowledges jealousy and openly expresses it rather than worrying about being labeled as needy or over possessive, as keeping such concerns bottled up will only make matters worse
Insecurity: The oft-quoted “Out of sight, out of mind” continues to create insecurities in long-distance relationships, (Borelli, Rassmussen, Burkhart, & Sbarra, 2014). Insecurity can be related to future concerns over with the presence of significant others in respective partners’ life which can make one feel neglected and insecure about their importance in their partner’s life.
It is advisable that partners quell such anxieties by dedicating time towards planning near future events such as next vacations and get-togethers and starting at least tentative planning about future goals such as marriage or living in together etc. if so desired. Such planning can improve the attachment between partners and give sense of security to both (Maguire & Kinney, 2010). While it is important to think about future, at present setting ground rules for relationship can be useful as well. These ground rules can be unique for the couple however general aspects to be considered can be a discussion over how much transparency is expected, how much and when to contact each other, sharing or allocating responsibilities and general expectations and concerns regarding this relationship.
Being open to change: When partners live away from each other it can be difficult to keep track of the numerous changes happening in their partner’s life. As one’s life circumstances change, one’s way of relating to the world too may change. However, the latter is seldom anticipated by both partners. Thus when partners meet each other in person after long time these changes can come across as revelations and one might feel like their partner is a new person altogether.For a partner who has moved to different location, the new  destination would warrant significant lifestyle changes which in turn may change their views regarding future aspirations, relationships, etc. In such situations, the partner who continues to live in the same place, may view these as a reflection of who their partner ‘really is’ as opposed to a natural consequence of moving to a different location It would help both partners if change is treated as par for the course, and that one differentiates the person from the attributes when one comes across a change that they do not like.
Lack of Physical intimacy: Distance definitely affects physical intimacy among partners. LDR partners might face issues with managing physical intimacy between them as meeting each other frequently may not be possible. Lack of physical intimacy can cause moral dilemmas for partners if they opt for satisfying their sexual needs by other means such as masturbation or non-committal sexual encounters (Borelli, Rassmussen, Burkhart, & Sbarra, 2014). One may also feel disappointed that they need to resort to masturbation to manage their sexual needs with thoughts such as, “Why do I have to masturbate even when I am in a relationship?” or feel frustrated that one cannot engage in sexual activity with other available partners as a consequence of being in a committed relationship. Though lack of physical intimacy is seen as LDR specific issue, partners living under the same roof too at times have relationships devoid of physical intimacy. In other words, long-distance is not necessarily linked with reduced emotional and sexual intimacy. However, irrespective of one’s relationship status or the proximity of one’s partner, it would be unreasonable to assume that one’s sexual needs would always be satisfied by one’s partner and that one would never have to resort to masturbation or other self-satisfying activities to do so. Though other alternatives such as phone-sex and video-chatting may feel awkward and uncomfortable for a host of reasons, and not feel as satisfying as sex in person, exploring different options together to find what feels closest to ‘the real thing’ itself can be a process that brings partners closer. Depending on the comfort level of both partners, it would also help to have clear and open discussions regarding having other sexual partners outside of one’s relationship.
Challenges in Communication: Often in LDRs, partners may engage in regular conversation but such discussions would predominantly involve factual everyday happening and be devoid of feeling. It is therefore important to ask and express how both partners are feeling on a daily basis in order to keep the communication meaningful.  Monotony in communication can be tackled by using different modes of communicating such as email, video chats, or handwritten letters (Stafford & Reske, 1990).  LDRs partners can make use of “Relational Savoring” which includes focusing on positive times spent together and observing how it affected the person emotionally and physically. Thus it creates an experiential memory. Relational savoring is helpful for partners to relive positive memories and help strengthen the relationship (Borelli, Rassmussen, Burkhart, & Sbarra, 2014).
Sharing responsibilities: For couples who are living away from each other managing responsibilities can be a task. One may feel pressured to take care of certain responsibilities since they cannot share it with their partner such as, household work, finances, parenting etc. This not only puts a strain on their relationship but also makes it difficult for partners to give time to each other. Partners can decide what kind of responsibilities they can still share and what are the other responsibilities they cannot, what they are ready to negotiate with and what they aren’t in this. Such discussions can help in reducing uncertainty in relationship and make it easier for partners to work together towards relationship goals (Shrivastva & Burianova, 2014).
All said and done, sometimes conflicts can be too complicated to deal with on your own. Such times call for the intervention of an unbiased and qualified third person like a counselor.

Alright, so I've got some information from these articles. Let's see what they're saying.

First, from the New York Post article, it mentions that 58% of long-distance relationships succeed, which is actually higher than I thought. So, it's not like they're doomed to fail; a significant portion makes it work.

But then, another statistic says that 40% of LDRs don't make it, and the main reason is that couples don't plan for changes. That seems crucial. So, maybe the key is adaptation and planning for the future.

The CreditDonkey article says that 4.5 months is the average time before an LDR dissipates. That seems really short. But it also mentions that most breakups happen because of mistrust and worries about cheating, not necessarily because of the distance itself.

Interesting, the Long Distance Fun article claims that 82% of LDRs fail after the couple finally moves in together. That's a staggering number. But as the author points out, this might not be entirely accurate because it's based on specific studies involving college students and may not apply universally.

The 2Date4Love article compiles various stats, including that 55% of people in LDRs are worried their partner will meet someone else, and 66% see the lack of physical intimacy as the biggest challenge.

From these, it seems like trust and physical intimacy are major issues in LDRs. But, at the same time, many couples do make it work.

I also noticed that long-distance marriages are a thing, with about 2.9% of married couples being in LDRs, mostly due to work or military assignments.

Now, why do LDRs fail? It's not just because of the distance; it's more about the challenges that distance brings, like mistrust, loneliness, and less frequent physical contact.

But, as some articles suggest, LDRs can also make people happier in certain ways. For example, the Romancoholic article mentions that some couples function better apart because they have more independence.

Also, a study cited in the Long Distance Fun article says that LDR couples are physically and mentally healthier because they're less anxious and have better diets. That's intriguing.

So, perhaps LDRs can have some benefits, but they also come with significant challenges.

Looking at the challenges, the iCall Helpline article lists six main issues: jealousy, insecurity, being open to change, lack of physical intimacy, communication problems, and sharing responsibilities.

These are all valid points. Jealousy and insecurity are common in any relationship, but they can be amplified in LDRs because of the distance and less frequent contact.

Being open to change is important because when people are apart, they might grow differently, and that can create a gap.

Lack of physical intimacy is a big one, and while technology can help to some extent, it's not the same as being physically together.

Communication is key in any relationship, but in LDRs, it's even more critical because you rely on it entirely to connect.

Sharing responsibilities can be tricky when you're not physically together, but it's still important to maintain a sense of partnership.

So, based on all this, it's clear that LDRs can work, but they require more effort and intentional maintenance compared to geographically close relationships.

Perhaps the main reason why people think LDRs don't work is because of the misconceptions and challenges associated with them, but with the right approach, they can be just as successful as any other relationship.

I think the key takeaways are:

1. Communication is paramount. It's essential to be open about feelings, expectations, and concerns.

2. Trust is crucial. Without trust, any relationship struggles, but in LDRs, where physical presence can't verify whereabouts, trust becomes even more important.

3. Planning for the future helps. Discussing and planning future events and goals together can provide a sense of security and direction.

4. Managing physical intimacy in a way that works for both partners is necessary. This might involve being creative and exploring different ways to stay connected physically.

5. Accepting and adapting to changes in each other is important, as people grow and change over time, especially when living in different environments.

6. Lastly, recognizing that LDRs can have their own set of benefits, such as increased independence and potentially better mental and physical health, can help in appreciating the relationship for what it is.

So, to sum it up, LDRs don't inherently don't work; they just require more effort and a different set of skills to make them work compared to geographically close relationships.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Long-distance relationships can work, but they require more effort, open communication, trust, and intentional maintenance compared to geographically close relationships.}} \]
