So I'm trying to think about what would happen if we didn't have democracy. First off, I need to understand what democracy is. Democracy is a system of government where power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. So, if we didn't have democracy, that means we'd have some other form of government where power isn't in the hands of the people.

Let me consider some alternative forms of government. There's monarchy, where a king or queen rules the country. Then there's dictatorship, where one person or a small group has absolute power. There's also oligarchy, where a small elite controls the government. And communism, where theoretically, power is supposed to be held by the proletariat, but in practice, it often leads to a single party controlling everything.

I guess each of these has different implications. Let's start with monarchy. In a monarchy, the ruler is usually chosen by birthright, so you have kings and queens inheriting power. Historically, some monarchies were benevolent, with rulers who cared for their subjects, while others were tyrannical. So, without democracy, we might have a situation where a single family holds power generation after generation, and the people have little say in how they're governed.

Moving on to dictatorships. These are often characterized by a strong leader who wields complete authority, often without any checks or balances. Dictatorships can arise from military takeovers or coups. In such systems, there's usually suppression of opposition and limited political freedoms. So, if we didn't have democracy, and instead had a dictatorship, people might not have freedom of speech, assembly, or the press. There could be widespread human rights abuses and lack of accountability among those in power.

Oligarchy is another possibility. In an oligarchy, a small group of people holds the majority of the power, often based on wealth, family connections, or military strength. This could lead to policies that favor the elite at the expense of the general population. There might be unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, with the wealthy and powerful holding onto their advantages while others struggle.

Communism, as I understand it, aims for a classless society where everyone contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs. However, in practice, communist states often become authoritarian, with a single party controlling all aspects of life. Dissent is not tolerated, and there may be limitations on personal freedoms. So, without democracy, a communist system could lead to a lack of individual liberties and suppressions of political diversity.

Now, thinking more broadly, without democracy, there might be less emphasis on the rule of law and more on the whims of those in power. In democratic systems, laws are supposed to apply equally to all citizens, including those in government. But in non-democratic systems, rulers might be above the law, leading to corruption and abuse of power.

Moreover, democracy is often associated with certain rights and freedoms, like freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Without democracy, these freedoms might not be protected, leading to censorship, religious persecution, and other forms of oppression.

On the other hand, some might argue that non-democratic systems can be more efficient in decision-making because they don't have to go through the sometimes slow and messy process of democratic deliberation. For example, in a dictatorship, decisions can be made quickly without needing to consult multiple stakeholders. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of accountability and the potential for poor decisions that don't reflect the will or best interests of the people.

Additionally, democracy is thought to promote stability because it provides mechanisms for peaceful transfer of power through elections. Without democracy, transitions of power might be more volatile, involving coups, revolutions, or inheritances that may not be accepted by all segments of society.

Economically, democracy is often correlated with higher levels of development and better governance. Countries with democratic systems tend to have more transparent institutions, which can attract foreign investment and foster economic growth. Without democracy, there might be more cronyism and corruption, which can stifle economic development.

However, it's important to note that democracy isn't a panacea. There are democracies with significant problems, and non-democratic systems can sometimes achieve certain goals efficiently. For instance, some authoritarian countries have been able to implement large-scale infrastructure projects quickly without the hindrance of democratic deliberation.

But overall, the lack of democracy seems to correlate with fewer protections for individual rights, less accountability among leaders, and potentially less stable political environments.

I should probably look up some examples to get a better understanding. Maybe look at countries that don't have democracy and see how they're faring.

The Economist (magazine) produces a list called the Democracy Index.  Some of the criteria used to evaluate the 'democracy-ness' in various countries include these items:
"Whether national elections are free and fair";
"The security of voters";
"The influence of foreign powers on government";
"The capability of the civil servants to implement policies".
It also breaks out broad categories based on the scores:

Why is China not seen as a democracy?
One reason is that you don’t have direct election in China. You have “nested election loops” where the local people elect the local reps, then the local reps elect the next level provincial reps, then the provincial reps elect their congressional reps, then the congressional reps elect the managing team a.k.a. the Politburo. The top one gets to be the President, and the second vote-getter gets to be the Prime Minister, and the third and forth vote-getters get to be Cabinet members.

The country limits civil rights and freedom of the press. But interestingly, the PM has historically been a benevolent dictator and the people have substantial freedoms. Accordingly, they support the government and the political practices that Singapore has always used.

Politics involve two fundamental factors: (1) The organization of interactions among humans, and (2) our natural focus on providing food, clothing and shelter for ourselves and our families.
As the number of humans in close proximity to each other increases, the need for organization of human interactions increases, but the majority of people are more concerned with their own needs than they are with the needs of their society.

There are many countries that do not have a democracy and operate from a monarchy, socialist or communist government structure including the People’s Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Cuba, North Korea, Bhutan, Qatar and Vietnam. In 2006, United States President George W. Bush announced that democracy promotion would be one of the central aims of U.S. foreign policy.
The U.S. continues to make the promotion of democracy one of its central goals. However, U.S. efforts have not succeeded in creating democracies in countries, such as Egypt and Lebanon, which remain non-democratic. The Clinton administration also attempted to promote democracy throughout the world in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. However, that democracy also failed.
Still democracy is growing throughout the global world despite many U.S. presidents’ failed attempts at instilling it in other countries. Democracy was found traditionally only in wealthy countries, but it is now the most popular political system in the entire world. In 1900, there were only 10 countries that were democracies. Yet, by 1950, there were 30 democratic countries and, by 2005, 119 of the 190 countries in the world were democracies, leaving just 71 countries that were not democratic.

Most democratic countries have a written constitution, but it's not a requirement.
Here is a list of countries which are democratic but do not have a documented constitution.
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
Israel is generally considered democratic, but has no constitution.
New Zealand has no codified constitution. By some strange coincidence, it's part of UK-led Commonwealth realm.

The real answer to this question is that truly democratic countries (true democracies} don't exist.
Democracy is mob-rule. A true democracy is majority rules, even if that majority is razor-thin. That doesn't exist anywhere other than in small organizations.
Constitutions only say how a country will be run and how the laws will be written and enforced. Even dictatorships have constitutions. They shouldn't be confused with the US Constitution, which is a truly unique document in the modern world.

A “real democracy” has some sort of foundational document. They may not call it a constitution. though.
I don’t know that there are any true democracies. They tend to be kind of unwieldy. Taking EVERYTHING to the voters is cumbersome.
What I think I see is variations on republics and democratic republics.
This does not “speak to “ how effective the government of any particular nation is.

Before anyone can really answer this question they need to clarify how they define a “democratic country.” Perhaps, even more fundamental is how one defines the word “democracy”? It seems there are almost as many definitions of the word as there are people.
As M Sparks stated correctly, virtually every country, especially in our modern world, needs to have a set of basic rules as to how a government is formed and how it should function, unless one is, perhaps, talking about a Ghenkis Khan.

I don’t think it’s technically possible for a country, whether democratic or otherwise, to have no constitution. Wikipedia defines a constitution as “a set of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organization is governed. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is.” To be organized and stable enough to even be called a county means that you must have at least some form of constitution.

People want their laws to reflect their own traditions and choose to go with a way of organising government, law-making and the judiciary (to use the classic trilogy) that suits them.
In some cases, normally after conquest, a democratic constitution may be imposed from outside. But conquerors who impose such things don’t stick around forever and eventually the constitution is back in the hands of the people of the country themselves.

How would you explain the statement, “All countries that have a constitutions are not necessarily democratic, but all countries that are democratic will have constitutions.”?
Constitutions are merely a set of rules that dictate how a state functions. Constitutions do not have to be democratic, they do not have provide people with the ability to run for office, to vote or even to be free and equal. They give structure to the state. Therefore it is entirely possible to have a constitution that is not democratic but is instead monarchic or of some other kind.
All democracies will have constitutions however to ensure that there are legal safeguards preventing Democracy from turning into any system less desirable than democracy. Democracy is regarded in these countries t

A World Without American Democracy?
The Global Consequences of the United States’ Democratic Backsliding
By Larry Diamond
July 2, 2021
After Hurricane Harvey in Conroe, Texas, August 2017.
Carlo Allegri / Reuters
A prolonged global democratic recession has, in recent years, morphed into something even more troubling: the “third reverse wave” of democratic breakdowns that the political scientist Samuel Huntington warned could follow the remarkable burst of “third wave” democratic progress in the 1980s and the 1990s. Every year for the past 15 years, according to Freedom House, significantly more countries have seen declines in political rights and civil liberties than have seen gains. But since 2015, that already ominous trend has turned sharply worse: 2015–19 was the first five-year period since the beginning of the third wave in 1974 when more countries abandoned democracy—twelve—than transitioned to it—seven.
And the trend continues. Illiberal populist leaders are degrading democracy in countries including Brazil, India, Mexico, and Poland, and creeping authoritarianism has already moved Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, and Venezuela out of the category of democracies altogether. In Georgia, the dominance of the Georgian Dream Party has led to the steady decline of electoral processes and a breakdown in the rule of law. In Myanmar, the military overthrew the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, ending an experiment in partial democracy. In El Salvador, president Nayib Bukele staged an executive coup by removing the attorney general and Supreme Court justices who were obstacles to his consolidation of power. In Peru, democracy hangs from a thread as the right-wing autocrat Keiko Fujimori advances vague claims of election fraud in a bid to overturn her narrow electoral defeat to left-wing opponent Pedro Castillo.
What is especially striking about this last case is that Fujimori’s gambit bears a grim resemblance to the lie perpetuated by former U.S. President Donald Trump and his followers about the 2020 presidential election. This is no coincidence. As the journalist and historian Anne Applebaum has observed, fictitious claims of fraud and “stop the steal” tactics are becoming a common means by which autocratic populists try to obstruct democracy. Such tactics have long been a source of instability in countries struggling to develop democracy. But the fact that the most recent iteration of the antidemocrat’s playbook draws heavily on precedents in the world’s most important and powerful democracy marks the start of a dangerous new era.

Today, the United States confronts a growing antidemocratic movement, not just from the ranks of fringe extremists but also from a substantial group of officeholders—a movement that is challenging the very foundations of electoral democracy. Should this effort succeed, the United States could become the first ever advanced industrial democracy to fail—that is, to no longer meet the minimum conditions for free and fair elections as political scientists and other scholars of democracy define them.
The failure of American democracy would be catastrophic not only for the United States; it would also have profound global consequences at a time when freedom and democracy are already under siege. As Huntington noted, the diffusion of democratic movements and ideas from one country to another has helped drive positive democratic change. Antidemocratic norms and practices can spread in a similar fashion—especially when they emanate from powerful countries. That is why the acceleration of a democratic recession into a democratic depression happened largely on Trump’s watch. And it is why no development would more gravely damage the global democratic cause than the democratic backsliding of its most important champion.
THE DEMOCRATIC TRIAD
A democratic system of government stands on three legs. The first leg is popular sovereignty—rule by the people. Democracy demands that people are able to choose and replace their leaders in regular, free, and fair elections; that all adult citizens are able to vote free from intimidation and obstruction; and that candidates and parties are free to compete and campaign. Crucially, elections must be administered impartially, so that valid ballots are counted accurately and power is granted to those who win.
Liberty is the second leg of liberal democracy. A fully democratic system provides strong protections for freedom of speech, the press, association, and assembly. It ensures that these rights are equally protected for all social groups. And it promotes a culture of mutual tolerance and respect for the rights of political opponents.
The third leg—the rule of law—defends and strengthens the other two. It ensures that democratic procedures are impartially enforced by an independent judiciary and other regulatory bodies that check the abuse of power. In most advanced democracies, excluding the United States, these instruments of accountability include national bodies to administer elections and to monitor corruption.
Trump was the first U.S. president to demonstrate contempt for all three legs of the triad of liberal democracy. He attacked the media as “fake news” and “absolute scum” and called for his election opponent to be “locked up.” He invited his followers to commit acts of violence against protesting opponents. Upon his defeat, he insisted that the election results were fraudulent and had to be overturned. Throughout his presidency, he waged war on an independent judiciary, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, his own attorney general, the Office of Government Ethics, the civil service, and a host of other actors who refused to bend to his political will or sought to enforce the rule of law.
The United States’ outsize importance will influence struggling democracies and embattled autocracies alike.
Many scholars of democracy perceived an unprecedented threat to U.S. democracy when Trump entered office in 2017 and feared grave assaults on the second and third legs of the democratic triad, in particular. This assessment was partially correct. Not since President Richard Nixon and rarely in U.S. history has there been such a determined effort to misuse and subvert administrative and rule-of-law institutions for nakedly political ends—but these attempts achieved only limited effect. The bulk of the press and the judiciary remained independent. The FBI avoided political capture. Outside the Republican Party and Trump’s own administration, freedom of speech thrived. From 2017 through 2020, liberty and the rule of law more or less held.
In three respects, however, most scholars misjudged the nature of the peril—and underestimated its gravity. First, many assumed that Trump himself constituted the biggest threat to U.S. democracy and that his defeat would lance the poisonous boil on the body politic. Second, with notable exceptions, including the Yale historian Timothy Snyder and the Carnegie Endowment scholar Rachel Kleinfeld, many underestimated the potential for violence on the part of Trump’s true-believing followers. And third, most underestimated the extent to which Trump would remake the Republican Party as an institution not only slavishly loyal to him but also hostile to democracy.
Fortunately, leading up to the 2020 election, democracy scholars and civic organizations correctly anticipated the threats to electoral integrity posed by zealous Trump partisans, as well as the staggering logistical challenges presented by the pandemic. As a result, they launched one of the most energetic civic campaigns in U.S. history to register an unprecedented number of voters, to give them safe and early access to the ballot, to ensure that local electoral administrations had the resources necessary to administer the vote, and to prepare to combat any potential efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the presidential election. The election was not a nightmare scenario, as some had feared. In fact, it proved to be one of the best-administered elections in U.S. history, leading election experts Nathaniel Persily and Charles Stewart III to call it a “miracle.”
IT COULD STILL HAPPEN HERE
Yet what followed was, in the words of Persily and Stewart, a “tragedy,” with “lies about vote fraud and the performance of the system [cementing] a perception among tens of millions of Americans that the election was ‘rigged.’” Such “manufactured distrust” has extended past the January 6 insurrection in Washington. Although President Joe Biden’s inauguration has deescalated imminent threats to civil liberties and the rule of law, the core element of electoral democracy—free and fair elections—is now under relentless partisan assault. Republican state legislatures are accelerating efforts to make it more difficult for African Americans, Latinos, and other Democratic-leaning constituencies to vote by passing laws that make it more difficult to vote by mail and to vote early, and that make it easier to purge voters from voting rolls. These changes are driven not by documented evidence of malfeasance associated with these practices but by deliberately false narratives about election fraud.
Now, the greatest threat to American democracy is posed by legislative initiatives seeking to subvert the independence of electoral administration, including the counting and certification of the vote. As the election law expert Richard Hasen has observed, “At stake is something I never expected to worry about in the United States: the integrity of the vote count.” A recent law passed in Georgia, for example, removes the secretary of state (currently Brad Raffensperger, who refused to manufacture the 11,780 votes Trump needed to win the state) as chair of the state Election Board and gives the state legislature—a highly partisan institution—the ability to name the new chair. Representatives in Michigan have politicized the Board of State Canvassers, which certifies election results, by replacing a Republican who voted to certify Biden’s election victory with a movement conservative. In Michigan and in Nevada, Trump loyalists are seeking to consolidate control over election supervision by running candidates for secretary of state—giving them the authority to preside over election administration and the tools to try to block Democratic votes. And at the federal level, Republicans could take back control of the House of Representatives (helped by their unilateral ability to redraw 187 congressional districts following the most recent census) and use their majority to manipulate the 2024 presidential results in their favor—especially if the 2024 election resembles 2020, when Democrats won a decisive popular vote victory but relied on narrow margins in a handful of states for an Electoral College majority.
Once a political system loses bipartisan consensus respecting the rules of the democratic game, it can be a short slide to autocracy. The world has watched this happen in Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela. It is not inconceivable that it could happen in the United States.
THE GATHERING STORM
To warn of the failure of American democracy is not hyperbole or simply a slogan meant to motivate action. Political scientists may differ on the minimum conditions for democracy, but they agree on this: a country cannot be considered a democracy if it does not broadly ensure the neutral and fair administration of elections. If the outcome of a major national election in the United States were to be determined by fraudulent exclusion or the manipulation of votes, the country would cease to be a democracy, no matter how much freedom of expression might survive (for a time).
More than 100 prominent democracy scholars recently warned in a collective statement that Republican assaults on electoral integrity could bring about the demise of U.S. democracy. They appealed to Congress to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and to adopt other measures to “ensure the sanctity and independence of election administration.” But with broad national legislation to ban partisan gerrymandering and strengthen voting standards unlikely in the near term, it will also be up to civil society to defend American democracy.
That defense is made more urgent by the gathering storm of democratic backsliding around the world. The United States’ outsize importance as a source of political diffusion, for good or ill, makes it an example that will influence struggling democracies and embattled autocracies alike. Both in backsliding democracies such as the Philippines and Poland and in deepening autocracies such as Turkey and Venezuela, Trump’s mantra of “fake news” emboldened strongman leaders in their assaults on the media. If the United States winds up disfiguring its democracy by politicizing electoral administration and suppressing minority votes, autocrats will gleefully seize upon the American precedent as justification for their methods of blocking democratic change. And in declining democracies, politically vulnerable incumbents will embrace similar methods of violating electoral integrity in order to hang on to power.
In short, what happens to democracy in the United States is likely to determine the fate of democracy around the world: whether this third wave of democratic reversals is turned back or gains horrific new momentum.

Alright, so I've got this task to think about what would happen if we didn't have democracy. I need to approach this step by step, considering different aspects and maybe even looking at examples from history or current events. First off, I should probably define what democracy is because that seems fundamental to understanding what its absence would look like.

Democracy, as I understand it, is a system of government where power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It's based on principles like political freedom, equality, and the rule of law. So, if we didn't have democracy, that would mean power isn't derived from the people in that way. There are various alternatives to democracy, like monarchies, dictatorships, oligarchies, and communist states, each with their own characteristics.

Let me consider some of these alternatives one by one to see what life might be like without democracy.

First, monarchy. In a monarchy, a king or queen inherits the throne and rules the country. Historically, some monarchies were benevolent, with rulers who cared for their subjects, while others were tyrannical. If we didn't have democracy and instead had a monarchy, people might not have a say in how they're governed. Decisions would be made by the monarch and possibly a small circle of advisors. This could lead to policies that benefit the ruling family and elites at the expense of the general population.

Next, dictatorship. This is a form of government where power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual or a small group, often without any checks or balances. Dictators often come to power through military coups or other undemocratic means. In dictatorships, there's usually suppression of opposition, limited political freedoms, and human rights abuses. So, without democracy, living under a dictatorship could mean lacking basic freedoms like free speech, assembly, and a free press.

Then there's oligarchy, where a small group of people holds the majority of power, often based on wealth, family connections, or military strength. In such a system, policies would likely favor the elite, leading to inequality and limited opportunities for the broader populace. The wealthy and powerful would maintain their advantages while others struggle.

Communism is another alternative, at least in theory. It aims for a classless society where everyone contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs. However, in practice, communist states have often become authoritarian, with a single party controlling all aspects of life and suppressing dissent. So, without democracy, a communist system could lead to a lack of individual liberties and political diversity.

Thinking more broadly, without democracy, there might be less emphasis on the rule of law and more on the whims of those in power. In democratic systems, laws are supposed to apply equally to all citizens, including those in government. But in non-democratic systems, rulers might be above the law, leading to corruption and abuse of power.

Moreover, democracy is often associated with certain rights and freedoms, like freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Without democracy, these freedoms might not be protected, leading to censorship, religious persecution, and other forms of oppression.

On the other hand, some argue that non-democratic systems can be more efficient in decision-making because they don't have to go through the sometimes slow and messy process of democratic deliberation. For example, in a dictatorship, decisions can be made quickly without needing to consult multiple stakeholders. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of accountability and the potential for poor decisions that don't reflect the will or best interests of the people.

Additionally, democracy is thought to promote stability because it provides mechanisms for peaceful transfer of power through elections. Without democracy, transitions of power might be more volatile, involving coups, revolutions, or inheritances that may not be accepted by all segments of society.

Economically, democracy is often correlated with higher levels of development and better governance. Countries with democratic systems tend to have more transparent institutions, which can attract foreign investment and foster economic growth. Without democracy, there might be more cronyism and corruption, which can stifle economic development.

However, it's important to note that democracy isn't a panacea. There are democracies with significant problems, and non-democratic systems can sometimes achieve certain goals efficiently. For instance, some authoritarian countries have been able to implement large-scale infrastructure projects quickly without the hindrance of democratic deliberation.

But overall, the lack of democracy seems to correlate with fewer protections for individual rights, less accountability among leaders, and potentially less stable political environments.

I think to get a better understanding, I should look at some real-world examples of countries that don't have democracy and see how they're doing. Maybe compare their political systems, human rights records, economic situations, and social conditions.

I'll need to do some research to find out which countries are considered non-democratic and then look into their specific circumstances.

None. No country on the planet has a democratic government.
Democratic is government of the people, by the people, for the people.
The closest we have is representative democracies, which are: Government of the people, by representatives, for the representatives’ parties and their sponsors. Representative democracy is not democratic.

Why is China not seen as a democracy?
One reason is that you don’t have direct election in China. You have “nested election loops” where the local people elect the local reps, then the local reps elect the next level provincial reps, then the provincial reps elect their congressional reps, then the congressional reps elect the managing team a.k.a. the Politburo. The top one gets to be the President, and the second vote-getter gets to be the Prime Minister, and the third and forth vote-getters get to be Cabinet members.

Singapore has had only one party, the Peoples’ Action Party, since 1959, although it holds mock elections for Prime Minister where only one PAP candidate is genuine and others are declared ineligible or are of so little importance as to be insignificant.
The country limits civil rights and freedom of the press. But interestingly, the PM has historically been a benevolent dictator and the people have substantial freedoms. Accordingly, they support the government and the political practices that Singapore has always used.

That's a neat question because it helps us look at ourselves.
Politics involve two fundamental factors: (1) The organization of interactions among humans, and (2) our natural focus on providing food, clothing and shelter for ourselves and our families.
As the number of humans in close proximity to each other increases, the need for organization of human interactions increases, but the majority of people are more concerned with their own needs than they are with the needs of their society. This results in a power vacuum that is filled by power-hungry individuals who gratify themselve

There is no 1 definition of democracy. Nodays every country claims to be a democracy, and arguably none are, or even should be. “PEOPLES DEMOCRATIC ” in front of the name of a country usually means only idiots thin it is a real democracy and if anyone speaks against the government, they speak no more. A more definable and related concept is “fair election”. You could say that countries that have fair elections to international standards are democratic. The standards are much more complicated than you might think. The short answer is that the world is more democratic than the past, say a little

Why aren't democratic countries 100% democratic?
`Most democracies are in fact representative republics. We elect representatives and they enact the laws. Pure democracy is too cumbersome for anything larger than a small village. Beyond that most Republics have checks and balances to protect the rights of minority groups. A pure democracy would mean that a simple majority could enact anything they support, a sort of legitimized mob rule and the results could be ugly or even inhumane.

All democratic countries are headed into devolving into Islamic Totalitarian Shiaria Law appeasing states.

What are some examples of countries which are democratic and not republic? What does it actually mean?
Both democracy and republic have different meanings depending on context.
Democratic is frequently taken to mean 'having a law-making assembly elected by universal adult suffrage'. Republic is often taken to mean 'not having a titular monarch'. By those definitions, several European countries are democratic and not republics, e.g. the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark.
The question may however reflect what is to Europeans an obscure United States ideological debate, in which 'democratic' indicates unfettered rule by a directly elected assembly, and 'republican' indicates that this assembly fa

Non democratic countries do not have the democratic legitimacy due to them not being directetly elected in to office via the people. Often these countries come to power via revolutions or military coups. These countries often include autocratic leaders or absolute monarchies for example one of the last absolute monarchies still present today is Quatar. These countries most notably do not represent the people and are not accountable to the people as they are not reflected after a set period of time.

How does a democratic country works?
Power to the people, not just one leader or a few officials. Aka; Voting, which is then represented in parliament in the capital. Parliament is full of people elected in one way or another, who then vote on things. There is always different parties in a democracy so you have lots of different views attempting to make laws under the leadership of a Chancellor, Prime Minister or President who is the most powerful person in the country, however can loose his or her job if the people are not pleased, just like everyone else in parliament.

How is a democratic government formed?
Read our history. A group of people got together, thrashed out (over time) a couple of documents that tried to counter the oppression served on people over centuries. They read history, wrote and re-wrote documents which were ultimately voted on and accepted. Those documents weren’t perfect….and never would or will be. As a result, one has been amended and probably will continue to be. It’s maybe a little messy process, but has outlasted all others purported to be of its kind.

What Countries Do Not Have a Democracy?
By Staff Writer Last Updated April 06, 2020
Franco Origlia/Getty Images News/Getty Images
There are many countries that do not have a democracy and operate from a monarchy, socialist or communist government structure including the People’s Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, Vatican City, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Cuba, North Korea, Bhutan, Qatar and Vietnam. In 2006, United States President George W. Bush announced that democracy promotion would be one of the central aims of U.S. foreign policy.
The U.S. continues to make the promotion of democracy one of its central goals. However, U.S. efforts have not succeeded in creating democracies in countries, such as Egypt and Lebanon, which remain non-democratic. The Clinton administration also attempted to promote democracy throughout the world in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo. However, that democracy also failed.
Still democracy is growing throughout the global world despite many U.S. presidents’ failed attempts at instilling it in other countries. Democracy was found traditionally only in wealthy countries, but it is now the most popular political system in the entire world. In 1900, there were only 10 countries that were democracies. Yet, by 1950, there were 30 democratic countries and, by 2005, 119 of the 190 countries in the world were democracies, leaving just 71 countries that were not democratic.

The List of Modern Top Five Non-Democratic Countries
Top Five Non-Democratic Countries
Every person, both in democratic and non-democratic countries, is born with certain unalienable rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. People everywhere, especially today, want the freedom to not only to be their own leader, but also to excel and enjoy life the way they intend to. But even today, there are countries that lack the basic human rights and prevent their own people from excelling under one unquestionable monarch. Democracy is the most common type of rule because it seeks to safeguard freedom and choice by keeping people involved at every level. While it can’t be said that non-democratic countries always constrain people from basic freedom, it is too often the case, as is seen in these five non-democratic countries.
Saudi Arabia
This is a prominent example of one of the many non-democratic countries that lack basic human rights. There is an absolute monarch in Saudi Arabia where the king, currently Salman of Saudi Arabia, serves as the country’s head of state, leader of the national government and commander-in-chief of the nation’s military. The people of Saudi Arabia are denied any substantial voice as authorities systematically discriminate against women and religious minorities, and judicial punishments are unbelievably inhumane. In 2015 alone, Saudi Arabia carried out 158 executions, 63 for non-violent drug crimes, according to the Human Rights Watch.
North Korea
As one of the world’s most secretive and repressive societies, North Korea is an authoritarian state currently run by the supreme leader Kim-Jong Un. The government imposes harsh restrictions on freedom of information and movement by threatening the people with forced labor and public executions. A 2014 UN report documented extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortion and other sexual violence in North Korea.
Vietnam
Vietnam is a one-party communist state where the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government. Vietnam actively suppresses any religious rights and the only party that rules the country has a complete monopoly on political power. Basic rights, including freedom of speech, opinion, press, association and religion, are restricted. On a positive note, the government of Vietnam and the World Bank Group jointly prepared a report, Vietnam 2035, that lays out their goal of equity and a reform of the lower middle class.
Jordan
Jordan, an Arab nation on the east bank of the Jordan River, is a constitutional monarchy where the Monarch is the head of state, the chief executive and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Jordan restricts freedom of expression and speech by prosecuting their citizens for ‘insulting an official body’ or speaking against the King. Jordan also discriminates against women by not allowing them to pass Jordanian citizenship to their children.
China
China is the biggest communist state where the government controls over 50 percent of the economy. Because of the government’s reluctance to allow western influences, it enforces strong internet censorship on the world’s top rated websites like Google, Facebook, Twitter and many others. Many fundamental human rights are limited, including freedom of expression, association, assembly and religion.
Other non-democratic countries include Turkmenistan, the U.K., Cuba, Iraq and many others. But whether a government is democratic or non-democratic, the priority should be for its citizens to enjoy basic human rights.

Alright, so I've got this task to think about what would happen if we didn't have democracy. I need to approach this step by step, considering different aspects and maybe even looking at examples from history or current events. First off, I should probably define what democracy is because that seems fundamental to understanding what its absence would look like.

Democracy, as I understand it, is a system of government where power is held by the people, either directly or through elected representatives. It's based on principles like political freedom, equality, and the rule of law. So, if we didn't have democracy, that would mean power isn't derived from the people in that way. There are various alternatives to democracy, like monarchies, dictatorships, oligarchies, and communist states, each with their own characteristics.

Let me consider some of these alternatives one by one to see what life might be like without democracy.

First, monarchy. In a monarchy, a king or queen inherits the throne and rules the country. Historically, some monarchies were benevolent, with rulers who cared for their subjects, while others were tyrannical. If we didn't have democracy and instead had a monarchy, people might not have a say in how they're governed. Decisions would be made by the monarch and possibly a small circle of advisors. This could lead to policies that benefit the ruling family and elites at the expense of the general population.

Next, dictatorship. This is a form of government where power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual or a small group, often without any checks or balances. Dictators often come to power through military coups or other undemocratic means. In dictatorships, there's usually suppression of opposition, limited political freedoms, and human rights abuses. So, without democracy, living under a dictatorship could mean lacking basic freedoms like free speech, assembly, and a free press.

Then there's oligarchy, where a small group of people holds the majority of power, often based on wealth, family connections, or military strength. In such a system, policies would likely favor the elite, leading to inequality and limited opportunities for the broader populace. The wealthy and powerful would maintain their advantages while others struggle.

Communism is another alternative, at least in theory. It aims for a classless society where everyone contributes according to their ability and receives according to their needs. However, in practice, communist states have often become authoritarian, with a single party controlling all aspects of life and suppressing dissent. So, without democracy, a communist system could lead to a lack of individual liberties and political diversity.

Thinking more broadly, without democracy, there might be less emphasis on the rule of law and more on the whims of those in power. In democratic systems, laws are supposed to apply equally to all citizens, including those in government. But in non-democratic systems, rulers might be above the law, leading to corruption and abuse of power.

Moreover, democracy is often associated with certain rights and freedoms, like freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Without democracy, these freedoms might not be protected, leading to censorship, religious persecution, and other forms of oppression.

On the other hand, some argue that non-democratic systems can be more efficient in decision-making because they don't have to go through the sometimes slow and messy process of democratic deliberation. For example, in a dictatorship, decisions can be made quickly without needing to consult multiple stakeholders. However, this efficiency comes at the cost of accountability and the potential for poor decisions that don't reflect the will or best interests of the people.

Additionally, democracy is thought to promote stability because it provides mechanisms for peaceful transfer of power through elections. Without democracy, transitions of power might be more volatile, involving coups, revolutions, or inheritances that may not be accepted by all segments of society.

Economically, democracy is often correlated with higher levels of development and better governance. Countries with democratic systems tend to have more transparent institutions, which can attract foreign investment and foster economic growth. Without democracy, there might be more cronyism and corruption, which can stifle economic development.

However, it's important to note that democracy isn't a panacea. There are democracies with significant problems, and non-democratic systems can sometimes achieve certain goals efficiently. For instance, some authoritarian countries have been able to implement large-scale infrastructure projects quickly without the hindrance of democratic deliberation.

But overall, the lack of democracy seems to correlate with fewer protections for individual rights, less accountability among leaders, and potentially less stable political environments.

I think to get a better understanding, I should look at some real-world examples of countries that don't have democracy and see how they're doing. Maybe compare their political systems, human rights records, economic situations, and social conditions.

I'll need to do some research to find out which countries are considered non-democratic and then look into their specific circumstances.
