I need to figure out why the Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction after the Civil War. I remember that there were different groups with different ideas about how to handle the South after it was defeated. So, I should probably start by understanding what Presidential Reconstruction was and what the Radical Republicans wanted instead.

First off, Presidential Reconstruction refers to the plan put forward by President Andrew Johnson after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Johnson wanted a lenient approach to bringing the Southern states back into the Union. He pardoned most former Confederates and allowed them to retain some control over their states. He also required only that the states abolish slavery and renounce secession.

Now, the Radical Republicans were a faction within the Republican Party who thought that Johnson's plan was too lenient. They were worried that the Southern states would regain power too easily and potentially reestablish slavery or enact discriminatory laws against African Americans. So, their main disagreement was with the leniency of Johnson's plan and its lack of protection for the rights of newly freed slaves.

I should look into specific policies or events that highlighted this disagreement. For example, the Black Codes enacted by some Southern states right after the war imposed restrictions on freed slaves' lives, limiting their rights and forcing them into labor through harsh contract laws. The Radical Republicans saw these codes as a way to maintain white supremacy and effectively re-enslave blacks, which went against their vision for Reconstruction.

Another point of contention was the treatment of Confederate leaders. Johnson's plan allowed many former Confederate officials to hold public office again, which the Radical Republicans found unacceptable. They wanted to ensure that those who had led the rebellion against the United States were punished and barred from positions of power.

Additionally, the Radical Republicans pushed for more aggressive actions to protect the rights of African Americans, such as the Freedmen's Bureau, which provided food, housing, and education to freed slaves, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which granted citizenship and equal rights to former slaves. Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act, but Congress overridden his veto, showing the growing conflict between the executive and legislative branches over Reconstruction policies.

So, in summary, the Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction because they believed it was too lenient towards the former Confederates, didn't do enough to protect the rights of newly freed slaves, and allowed ex-Confederate leaders to retain influence in government. They wanted a more punitive approach to Reconstruction and stronger guarantees for civil and political rights for African Americans.

To make sure I have this right, maybe I should look up some key figures involved in this debate. For instance, Thaddeus Stevens was a leading Radical Republican who advocated for harsher measures against the South and greater rights for blacks. He clashed frequently with President Johnson over Reconstruction policies.

Also, the impeachment of Andrew Johnson was a direct result of these disagreements. The Radical Republicans tried to remove Johnson from office for violating the Tenure of Office Act, which was partly an attempt to strip him of control over Reconstruction policy. Although the impeachment attempt failed, it demonstrated the deep divisions between the president and the Radical Republicans.

In contrast, Moderate Republicans generally supported some elements of both approaches, wanting to balance leniency with ensuring that the South wouldn't return to its pre-war status quo.

So, to answer the question: The Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction because they deemed it too lenient towards former Confederates, insufficient in protecting the rights of freed slaves, and allowing ex-Confederate leaders to regain power too easily.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Radical Republicans disapproved of Presidential Reconstruction because they deemed it too lenient towards former Confederates, insufficient in protecting the rights of freed slaves, and allowing ex-Confederate leaders to regain power too easily.}} \]
