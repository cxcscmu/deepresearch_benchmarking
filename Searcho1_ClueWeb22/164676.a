Alright, so I need to figure out how anxiety affects family and friends. I'm not super familiar with this topic, but I think I can break it down step by step. First, I should probably understand what anxiety is and then think about how it might impact the people closest to someone who experiences it.

Let me start by trying to define anxiety. I know that anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry, or fear about something that might happen. It's a normal human emotion, but when it becomes chronic or excessive, it can be a mental health disorder. There are different types of anxiety disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, and so on. Each of these can affect people differently.

Now, considering that, I need to think about how someone's anxiety might spill over into their relationships, particularly with family and friends. I imagine that if someone is constantly anxious, it could create a tense atmosphere at home or during social interactions. Family members might feel like they're walking on eggshells around the person, never knowing what might set off their anxiety.

Maybe I should look up some resources to get a better understanding. Let me try searching for information on how anxiety affects family and friends.

How Your Anxiety Affects Your Friends And Family?
Home » FAQ »
How Your Anxiety Affects Your Friends And Family?
Many Anxiety sufferers have never told anyone about their problem. If you feel ashamed or embarrassed about having Anxiety you might feel quite unable to talk to anyone about it. You may also feel that you’ll be labelled forever as someone who was mentally ill, that you won’t receive any sympathy, or that you’ll be forced to try treatments that you don’t really want.
Even if you haven’t told anyone, your friends and family are being affected by your illness. They may not know why you keep turning down invitations, or refuse to go on holiday with them, but they do know that something is preventing you.
People are naturally curious, and they’ll wonder why you behave as you do. They may decide that you’re just shy, or guess that there’s some sort of problem. They may also come up with explanations that are way off beam – such as thinking you’re unfriendly, or consider yourself too good to mix with them.
Did it upset you to read that? If only people knew what you’re going through, then they’d have more sympathy, surely? Or would they judge you as weak, or pathetic? Struggling to keep your illness a secret adds greatly to the stress of Anxiety, so does worrying about who to tell, and how.
Only you can decide what is right for you, but many people have reported the great relief they felt when they finally confided in someone.
Many sufferers tell only one person, usually their partner or a family member. If they need a lot of support from that person they may then start to feel guilty about it, or perhaps resentful that the person isn’t doing enough to help.
It can make more sense to tell a few trusted people so that they can share the helping tasks. You may find that one person has a soothing presence and you enjoy their company, while another is helpful in a practical way.
It’s important not to let your friends and family become part of the problem. If they always do shopping for you, or check the house for spiders, or let you travel in the front seat of the car, then they are helping to maintain your Anxiety.
No doubt they are busy people, and find it easier to go along with your immediate needs rather than take the time to help with recovery. With the best will in the world, they are doing exactly the wrong things. Of course temporary help, while you work on your recovery, is quite a different matter.
People with OCD do often admit to their difficulties, because they need help with their OCD. Sometimes they need help to complete their rituals, and sometimes they have a compulsive need to ask for reassurance.
If you have OCD, you may have already involved your friends and family, even if it’s just that they have to tolerate the extra time you need to do everyday tasks. They may also be obliged to live in a certain way (e.g. always wiping door handles after touching them) or may be involved in giving reassurance.
Whatever kind of help you have, you will at some point need to let go of it and take responsibility for yourself. Like every aspect of recovery, it can be planned as a series of goals aimed at gradually reducing your need for other people to support your Anxiety behaviour.
For a few people their Anxiety becomes so extreme that they need to be cared for by another person. This is a tough role and carers often become exhausted, while the person they are caring for has yet another worry – what happens if my carer can’t carry on?
This is an extreme scenario of course, but it does give a tremendous motivation for undertaking recovery. Even someone who’s Anxiety has become this bad can start a recovery program – there is no situation so bad that it can’t be turned round by slow steady repeated steps towards carefully chosen goals.
It’s best to tell your carer what you are planning to do, so that you can work through the program together. You may need to make changes in your daily routine, or ask for extra patience and understanding while you work on your goals.

What Is The Impact Of An Anxiety Disorder On One's Family And Friends?
Dr. Kendall Genre answers the question: 'Impact Of Anxiety Disorder On Family?'

— -- Question: What is the impact of an anxiety disorder on one's family and friends?
Answer: An anxiety disorder can affect one's family and friends in a number of ways. Specifically, the symptoms that one may experience during an anxiety disorder, which can include symptoms like irritability, tension, poor concentration, lack of sleep -- these can obviously affect one's interpersonal relationships with family members or one's ability to do one's work effectively.
That leads to number two, which is really function. In an anxiety disorder, function can be impaired through poor concentration, difficulty interacting with others.
In a panic disorder, a patient -- typically things are avoided because they may tend to trigger a panic attack. So I have patients for example, who fear driving and really have circumscribed their ability to interact socially in such a way that their family and their friends and coworkers are affected, as they are.
Thirdly, and importantly, anxiety disorders are often comorbid or co-occurring with other serious psychiatric disorders, particularly common, depression and substance abuse. So when one has an anxiety disorder, one is at a tremendously increased risk of having one of those other two disorders which obviously have a serious impact on relationships and functioning.

How does anxiety affect family relationships? How does your state of mind come in between your daily routine and the way you deal with your other family members?
Anxiety is a way to react to immense stress and also a type of mental illness, if not paid timely attention to. Even though if it is generalized anxiety, the person has his own mood shifts which make several things a lot difficult to manage and deal with in day to day life.
In this blog, let us discuss how does anxiety affects family relationships and how can family members support the one going through it and we can come out as a win-win situation.
How does anxiety affect family relationships?
Anxiety affects the individual at first and his or her own ability to think clearly and finding ways to overcome fears and overthinking problems. The person dealing with anxiety has a real hard time dealing with things on his own and after a while, things start flooding out of his mind and affect others living with that person.
Whether you are a man or woman, stress has nothing to do with gender, anxiety, and stress can hit anybody, anytime and make them restless and cause excessive fatigue in their body. It causes a series of fearful situations in our minds and we fail to come out of the mental weave it creates.
It not only ruins the beauty of our thoughts but also instills an unwarranted sense of fear and doubt in everything.
Five ways anxiety affects family relationships and makes it more complex
A person living with anxiety finds it really difficult to finish his mundane tasks, socializing with others, and find it very challenging while communicating with family members. They have this sense of mental drain. Socializing becomes their biggest fear and they try to avoid public events or any social gatherings.
It is also observed that when you are living in a joint family, many times it could be your mother in law who is pulling your anxiety triggers and putting you in that depressing zone. In turn, you avenge your frustration and irritability on your husband or kids. Let us see, how a less attended mental state can harm our relationships in the long run:
1. You have no one to talk
2. You are judged
3. Your inability is taken as an excuse
4. You are forced to do things
5. You are left unattended
1. You have no one to talk
These feelings are already complex for you to understand, why is it happening and what is happening to you? Why do you feel restless, nauseatic, heavy-headed all the time, why do you crave sleep and peace? Why do you seek solace in isolation? You might feel uncomfortable around your in laws but you can’t talk about it and it bothers you inside. Maybe because you find it too hard to open up because you find it difficult to accept what you are feeling which makes it even worse.
Mental illness is normal, yes it is, just like any other disease, the attitude towards such illness is a real problem. Unless we talk about it, no one will understand how one feels under such circumstances.
2. You are judged
How does anxiety affect family relationships? Just because you find it hard getting out of bed every morning and find yourself trapped in your own thoughts you are presumed to be lazy, ignorant, and irresponsible and that is how it affects you and your relationships. The worst problem with any form of mental illness is that it plays with your ability to function. It plays with your hormones and unbalances your thought process, we try re-aligning it daily, and trust me the struggle is real. Every day counts.
This is specifically the case with Indian daughter in lawsas they are expected to be perfect, organized, and best at everything but at times like this when your mental state is not supporting you, you need a little breathing space to figure out things.
3. Your inability is taken as an excuse
Today is that day when you are feeling overwhelmed, you could not stop but overthink about few events happening around you and then you are feeling excessive anxiety. Just then you are expected to perform a task which is not in your capacity, you won’t tell why and your family members won’t understand why? And all this mostly leads to a situation wherein you are assumed to be irresponsible and ignorant towards your duty.
How does anxiety affect family relationships? It affects when your family member fails to make out the difference in your behavior and instead of reaching out to you and checking on you, criticize you for being what you appear to them.
4. You are forced to do things
You have to do so many things unwillingly, you are present at those events but mentally you are absent and just feel like rushing away. The most crucial part and specifically if you dealing with social anxiety. Where you try to avoid social gatherings and family gatherings because you feel social anxiety around your in laws, who worry what they would say which will lead people to judge you and criticize you.
You make excuses to avoid such events but you are forced to. You try to avoid things that could act as a trigger to your anxiety and put cause you excessive worry but you have a tough time explaining things to your family members.
5. You are left unattended
So you tried explaining your feelings to your husband, and he says you have got everything then why do you want to create problems? Or consider a husband expressing his anxiety to a wife and might be presumed as how can you feel such a thing, come on, it is all in your head. There the problems remain unattended which could prove very harmful in the long run.
It is observed that even generalized anxiety takes the face of anxiety attacks and panic attacks when the person is not taken seriously about his mental health conditions.
How to deal with anxiety and save our relationships?
While there could so many ways we can deal with our anxiety and save our relationships, at least the ones which matter, I will point out seven major ways to deal with anxiety and rule out its effects on your relationship with your family, friends, and colleagues.

2. Educate your family members
It is very important to talk about Mental Health, as people are not even aware of such a thing and the majority of the population choose to remain ignorant towards it until it hits them personally. Educate your family members about it by sharing informative articles and videos with them. Maybe they will not get it at once but the more you will talk about it the more it will register in their minds.
3. Repair yourself
Take time for yourself, give yourself some time. You know there is something wrong and instead of worrying about it take time to give it a moment.

How can family members contribute?
How does anxiety affect family relationships? It affects our relationships when we don’t care.
How does anxiety affect family relationships? It affects when we see things but we choose to stay ignorant.
Family members have a major part to play here. Instead of criticizing the person and looking at him or her as a lazy and spoiled brat who doesn’t want to do things, speak to him. Try to understand what’s bothering him. Research says that the positive support of the family members helps the one who is facing such a difficult trail of emotions.
Speak and be there when you see some unusual or change in behavior.
Be there when you see the person shutting himself down and going into isolation.
Check on your friends who have lost contact and suddenly disappeared from everywhere.
Be kind to people around you as you don’t know what fight he or she is fighting inside.
Be available if someone shows a sign of concern and wants to talk
Take out time for your family members
Just by being aware of our surroundings and keeping a close watch on our near and dear ones we can certainly prevent tragedies. It is observed that when no one understands the person goes into hiding and never opens up about his feelings which only worsens a general or temporary mental illness. We can save lives by being available and being aware. Be there. Be aware, take care, and spread sanity.

Anxiety is an incessant alarm; it can be rational in most cases, but the irrational feeling of always waiting for a crisis to occur with zero logical reasons is what can be alarming. Imagine for a second how it feels to wait for an important test result, nerve-racking right? Now, imagine feeling like that for absolutely no apparent reason while sitting on your couch on your day-off.
Delve deep into your subconscious, and you may find a reason, but unfortunately most of the times the trigger is not obvious. A primal and instinctive response that can cripple your train of thoughts and general well-being. Anxiety can have adverse effects on the sufferer and those around them, how? Let us walk you through it.
What Is Anxiety?
The consensus to define anxiety disorder backed by the American Psychological Association is “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure." Causes of anxiety can be split into two main types: normal feelings of anxiousness and anxiety disorders. Knowing the difference between the two can lead to identifying the cause that could channel enough distress to demand medical attention, anxiety disorders.
How Anxiety Affects Those Around You
Dealing with an anxiety disorder can be exhausting, not just for the sufferer but the sufferer’s family as well. As explained, a lot of anxiety symptoms can trouble one’s interpersonal relationships, as it gets hard carrying a functioning interaction with others. People with social anxiety, for example, have a constant fear of public embarrassments that can lead them to completely abandon any human contact or public situations.
Some people who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) can be overly dependent. They deal with their anxiety by depending on their family and loved ones completely. They find in the closeness a solace; always seeking assurance, love, and support which is great but depending entirely on that alone can put huge pressure on the relationship.
Overly dependent anxiety sufferers sometimes get paranoid and suspicious of their loved one’s feelings or intentions, leading to a distressed relationship with anyone close to them.
Others deal with GAD by being avoidant, nearly detached, fearing any real connection or closeness. They isolate themselves by putting walls between them and anyone dear to them; never opening up or showing any emotions. This might lead to being viewed as cold, distant or even emotionally unavailable by family and friends.
Treating The Issue
Seeking the medical help and attention needed is important. Some self-treatments methods can work as well as exercising, meditation and practicing relaxation techniques, getting enough sleep. Sometimes, taking supplements can go a long way as well in helping with your anxiety symptoms.
Supplements like Mimosa pudica, which you can find here https://microbeformulas.com/, were found to have some anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, and memory enhancing effects, along with the known benefits of helping with headaches, migraines, dysentery, fever, piles, and insomnia. Plus, with the right mindset, information, patience, and love, anxiety doesn’t have to be as destructive as it seems.
Don’t Be Crippled By Anxiety
Suffering from anxiety is emotionally, psychologically, and physically exhausting as it affects many systems, organs, and glands in the body, including the nervous system. While the constant stress caused by anxiety disorders can kill, watching a loved one go through this can be even more stressful and aggravating. That’s why it’s important to open up and talk about it, whether with a professional or with other people who go through this.

The Impact of Anxiety Disorders on the Family
HealthyPlace.com Staff Writer
Read about the family dysfunction caused by anxiety disorders.
Regardless of who actually has the anxiety disorder, it is a condition that affects the lifestyle of everybody in the family - whether husband, wife, mother, father, sister, brother...
While anxiety disorders, by their very nature, isolate those who suffer from them, they are also isolating for members of the victim's family. It is almost impossible to effectively explain the last minute cancellations of attendance at social events, meetings and other pre-arranged appointments. It is hard to find the right words to excuse what appears to be lack of interest or plain bad manners. And how can you expect people to understand why your brother, wife, mother or son is never seen outside the house - does he/she really exist? - to your neighbors who think you are such a strange family? You cannot. And the misinterpretations and false perceptions of you and your family continually compound the problem.
The resulting family dysfunction caused by anxiety disorders often results in the problem becoming further complicated by the psychological and physical reactions of other family members - the husband who drifts in and out of affairs because his social phobic wife is unable to participate in the social areas of his business life, the teenager who rebels against the restrictive family life imposed by his father's fear of having a panic attack, and ends up involved in drugs and petty crime, the mother who finally suffers a mental breakdown, after years of coping with the manipulations of her anxiety-disordered child...
This is why it is so important for the media to feature programs and articles which communicate the symptoms, effects and treatment of anxiety disorders. At a lesser level, however, it is equally important for the people who are directly affected - whether as sufferers of anxiety disorders or as family members - to attempt to communicate the facts within their individual circles of friends and acquaintances. Even seemingly insignificant things, such as getting a copies of this - or a similar - newsletter to the people who are important in your life or drawing their attention to television programs on the subject, can become important factors in raising awareness and creating understanding.
We are a lot more fortunate than we were ten - even five - years ago. Anxiety disorders are recognized by the health profession today. We no longer have to try to explain about something that is not officially an illness. The challenge now is to communicate the problem to the many people who are not, themselves, directly affected but who do directly or indirectly affect the lives of the people upon whom anxiety disorders impact every day.

Alright, so I've got some information from these articles. Let me try to summarize what I've learned about how anxiety affects family and friends.

First, anxiety can really strain relationships. People with anxiety might withdraw from social activities, which can make family and friends feel neglected or confused about why the person is acting that way. There's a sense that something is wrong, but without understanding anxiety, it's hard for others to know how to support them.

One article mentioned that family members might feel like they're walking on eggshells around the person with anxiety, never knowing what might trigger an episode. This can create a tense atmosphere at home. Also, if the person with anxiety relies heavily on certain family members for support, those caregivers might feel burdened or burnt out.

Another point is that anxiety can lead to avoidance behaviors. For example, someone with social anxiety might refuse to go out in public or attend family gatherings, which can make others feel hurt or wonder what's wrong.

Moreover, anxiety often co-occurs with other mental health issues like depression or substance abuse, which can further complicate family dynamics and relationships.

On the positive side, some articles suggest that educating family and friends about anxiety can help them understand what's going on and how to support the person better. Open communication is key, but that can be tough for someone with anxiety who might struggle with expressing their feelings.

Also, involving family in therapy can sometimes be beneficial, as it allows everyone to learn coping strategies together and improve their interactions.

I think it's important to note that anxiety isn't just about the person experiencing it; it ripples out and affects those around them. So, addressing anxiety isn't just about helping the individual; it's about improving the overall family environment and relationships.

Maybe I should look for more specific tips on how family and friends can support someone with anxiety.

How can other people help?
This page is for friends and family wanting to support someone who experiences anxiety or panic attacks.
It can be really difficult when someone you care about is experiencing anxiety or panic attacks, but there are things you can do to help. Here are some tips:
Don't pressure them
Try not to put pressure on your friend or family member to do more than they feel comfortable with. It's really important to be patient, listen to their wishes and take things at a pace that feels okay for them.
It's understandable to want to help them face their fears or find practical solutions, but it can be very distressing for someone to feel they're being forced into situations before they feel ready. This could even make their anxiety worse.
Try to remember that being unable to control their worries is part of having anxiety, and they aren't choosing how they feel.
"What helps me is calmness, acceptance – not trying to dispel it with 'rational' or 'logical' argument."
Helping someone who is having a panic attack
It's understandable to feel frightened if someone you care about experiences a panic attack – especially if it seems to happen without warning. But it can help if you:
try to stay calm
gently let them know that you think they might be having a panic attack and that you are there for them
encourage them to breathe slowly and deeply – it can help to do something structured or repetitive they can focus on, such as counting out loud, or asking them to watch while you gently raise your arm up and down
encourage them to stamp their feet on the spot
encourage them to sit somewhere quietly where they can focus on their breath until they feel better.
You should never encourage someone to breathe into a paper bag during a panic attack. This isn't recommended and it might not be safe.
See our page on panic attacks for more information and tips on how to cope.
Try to understand
Find out as much as you can about anxiety. This will help you understand what they are going through. Reading personal stories of anxiety can help too.
Ask about their experience. You could ask them how anxiety affects their day-to-day life, and what makes it better or worse. Listening to how they experience things could help you to empathise with how they feel.
"Be kind, be non-judgemental. Let us know it will pass, let us know you are there."
Ask how you can help
Your friend or family member may already know how you can support them – for example, helping t hem with difficult situations, talking to them calmly or doing breathing exercises with them.
By asking them what they need or how you can help, you can support them to feel more in control themselves.
Knowing that there is someone around who knows what to do if they start to feel frightened or panicked could help them feel safer and calmer.
"Reminding me to breathe, asking me what I need."
Support them to seek help
If you think your friend or family member's anxiety is becoming a problem for them, you could encourage them to seek treatment by talking to a GP or therapist. You could:
Offer to help them arrange a doctor's appointment. If they are scared of leaving the house, you could suggest they ring their GP to find out if they will do home visits and telephone appointments.
Offer support when they attend appointments. You could offer to go with them to their appointments and wait in the waiting room. You can also help them plan what they'd like to talk about with the doctor. See our page on talking to your GP for more information.
Help them seek help from a therapist. See our page on how to find a therapist for more information.
Help them research different options for support, such as community services or peer support groups such as those run by Anxiety UK and No Panic. See our useful contacts page for more information. You could also call Mind's Infoline to find out more about local services.
See our page on helping someone else seek help for more information.
Look after yourself
It can sometimes be really challenging to support someone with a mental health problem – you are not alone if you feel overwhelmed at times. It is important to remember to look after your own mental health too, so you have the energy, time and space you need to be able to help.
For example:
Set boundaries and don't take on too much. If you become unwell yourself you won't be able to support them or yourself in the same way. It is also important to decide what your limits are and how much you feel able to help.
Share your caring role with others, if you can. It's often easier to support someone if you're not doing it alone.
Talk to others about how you're feeling. You may want to be careful about how much information you share about the person you're supporting, but talking about your own feelings with someone you trust can help you feel supported too.
Find support for yourself. The organisations in useful contacts are there to support you as well. You may find peer support or therapies are a good outlet for your feelings.
For more suggestions see our pages on how to cope when supporting someone else, dealing with pressure and how to improve your mental wellbeing.

Things to remember
It can be difficult to know how to help someone you love and care for when they have gone through a distressing or frightening event.
It’s natural to want to make someone you love and care for feel better again, but it’s important to accept what has happened. There is nothing you can say or do to make the person’s pain disappear. That will happen with time, rest, and appropriate support. Explain to them that you are sorry about what they have had to experience and that you are there to help them in any way they need.
Offer support after a traumatic or distressing event
It’s always good to ask the person who has experienced a traumatic or distressing event what you can do to support them. Suggestions for supporting a friend or family member include:
Make time to be with the person and make it obvious that you are available. Sometimes, there can be a tendency to want to move someone on before they are ready, because the traumatic experience makes us feel uncomfortable. Try to avoid doing this. People who have had a traumatic experience can feel very reassured by human contact.
Don’t take their feelings to heart. They may be irritable, depressed, angry or frightened. Strong feelings and emotional outbursts are common – try not to take it personally. It is important to recognise that they have had a stressful experience and that their reactions are normal and will subside in time.
You can help by reassuring the person that their reactions are normal.
Offer practical support. You could do the housework or the grocery shopping for them, or pick up their children from school.
Encourage the person to take good care of themselves, for example, by eating well, avoiding alcohol, drugs or stimulants, and by attempting to maintain regular sleeping habits.
You may need to let the person have time by themselves.
Let them know you are there for them without judging.
Suggesting to a person that they maintain regular daily routines and habits can be helpful as well.
Talking about the trauma can be important
Suggestions include:
Allow the person to talk about what happened, even if they become upset. Just be calm yourself and listen carefully – getting upset too doesn’t help.
Don’t insist on talking if the person doesn’t want to. They may need time to be alone with their thoughts. Tell them you are there to listen whenever they feel ready.
Reassure them you care and want to understand as much as possible about what happened to them. They may say you can’t possibly understand what they went through and shut you out. If they take this approach, they risk becoming isolated from their support networks. Be patient and see what else you can do to help.
Try to make sure there is someone else they can talk to if they don’t want to talk to you about it.
If there are some difficult decisions to be made, talk about the situation with the person and help them to identify the different options. However, don’t make the decision for them. Also, if it is only a short time after the traumatic event, suggest that it might be a good idea to wait a little longer before making a decision.
What not to do or say
Some ways in which it can be unhelpful to respond include:
Don’t avoid talking about the event.
Don’t think you know how the person should think, feel or behave. Everyone’s response is different.
Don’t use general phrases such as ‘look on the bright side’ or ‘look for the silver lining’, but help them think about what they do have.
Don’t judge their thoughts or feelings – being accepted helps put things in context.
Don’t be impatient or expect them to ‘get over it’ in a certain time. It can take months or longer to recover from an event.
Don’t insist they need professional help. Not everyone who experiences a distressing event needs treatment. It will be more effective if they get it when they want it, even if that is later than is ideal.
Help them to relax and get involved in activities
Relaxation and fun are important recovery tools. Suggestions include:
Try to involve the person in physical activity, such as walking or swimming. Exercise burns off stress chemicals, reduces muscle tension and encourages better sleep.
While the person needs to spend some time alone, help them to strike a balance. Socialising – even low-key events such as sitting around with friends – can help to reduce stress levels.
Laughter is a wonderful antidote to stress. Find ways to help them to smile or laugh.
If at any time you are worried about your mental health or the mental health of a loved one, call Lifeline 13 11 14.

Check in
Get them moving

Take care of yourself
Next steps
When a loved one feels anxious, there are a few things you can do to help. Listening, checking in, and helping them support themselves can make a difference.
Everybody experiences anxiety to some degree. It’s a normal and unavoidable part of life, especially if you’re anticipating a stressful situation or going through any kind of change.
But for some people, anxiety can snowball into unmanageable worry and fear that interfere with day-to-day life.
Anxiety disorders are common and very treatable, but people who experience them may need help managing their symptoms. Below, we’ll go over some of the best ways you can support someone with anxiety.
1. Listen
Anxiety can be isolating, in part because many people are eager to change the subject or try to “cheer up” their loved one. Instead, encourage your loved one to recognize and name their anxiety.
It might sound counterintuitive to encourage someone with anxiety to talk about what’s worrying them. But in fact, putting negative feelings into words can make them less intense.
So, if you’re worried that you won’t know what to say, know that active listening might make the biggest difference of all. Ask them about their experience of anxiety and what their triggers are. If you lead with curiosity, you can’t go wrong.
If the person has a hard time talking about their anxiety out loud, you can encourage them to write it down instead. Using journaling prompts like these can help focus the mind and get into a writing flow.
2. Encourage them to try meditation or deep breathing
These are two of the most effective home remedies for anxiety.
Meditation can be performed alone or in a group. Some people with anxiety find that guided meditation is helpful, since it can help redirect the mind and slow down racing thoughts.
Many meditation apps are available, including Headspace, Calm, and Shine, with guided meditations designed specifically for anxiety.
You could also send your loved one a link to some apps for anxiety. They can browse and see what works best for them.
You can also encourage them to try a simple deep breathing exercise for anxiety.
Research has shown that deep, controlled breathing can promote feelings of relaxation by triggering the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls bodily functions when a person is at rest.
To help them practice, you could even offer to meditate or do some deep breathing with them.
3. Check in with them
When someone is experiencing anxiety, they may be so overwhelmed that they isolate themselves without meaning to.
Reaching out and asking for help requires energy that they might not feel able to summon. It may be especially challenging for people who have social anxiety.
By checking in with them regularly, you can remind them that they’re not alone, and give them a sense of community and structure.
You can also ask the person what kind of check-ins would be most helpful for them.
Some people might simply love to know that you’re thinking of them, while others would benefit from something more specific — say, a gentle reminder to take their medication, or a daily funny cat video to distract them.
Everybody’s anxiety looks a little different, so don’t be afraid to ask questions, provided they are happy to share answers.
4. Get them moving
A body of evidence suggests that regular exercise can improve mental health and help the brain cope better with stress.
But being overwhelmed by anxiety can also make it hard to prioritize exercise, so one way you can support your loved one is by offering to be their workout buddy.
Walking, yoga, light jogging, or an easy bike ride are all great options.
Keep in mind that certain intense exercise, like HIIT workouts, can stimulate the body’s fight-or-flight response. This can indirectly lead to a worsening of anxiety: The physical impact of a workout (shortness of breath, an increased heart rate, sweating) can mimic the symptoms of a panic attack.
While it doesn’t help to push someone into an exercise routine when they’re not willing, gentle encouragement and companionship can help them (and you!) get the benefits.
5. Help them find a therapist
A good therapist can be an invaluable tool for anyone dealing with anxiety. A psychologist can provide talk therapy, while a psychiatrist can prescribe medication.
But the task of finding a therapist, and dealing with the logistics of insurance coverage, can be daunting.
If they’re ready to take this step, offer to help them find the support they need.
Here are a few helpful places to start:
American Psychological Association: find a psychologist by ZIP code
American Psychiatric Association: find a psychiatrist by ZIP code
Anxiety and Depression Association of America: find a therapist who specializes in:
anxiety and specific anxiety disorders
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
A growing number of online therapy platforms are also available, including BetterHelp and Talkspace. Online therapy may be a more accessible and affordable option for some people.
If the person you’re helping has health insurance, you can also look through their plan’s provider network, or call the insurer directly if you’re unable to find professionals in their area.
Once they find a therapist, they may still need support to stick with it. Some people with anxiety may find relief straight away when they begin therapy, but for others, it may take several sessions.
The same is true with many medications for anxiety: It often takes weeks to notice a difference. If they seem reluctant to keep attending therapy or taking a medication, encourage them to give it time.
You can get more tips and resources for finding a therapist from Psych Central’s Find a Therapist resource.
6. Educate yourself
Anxiety is a blanket term that incorporates a huge number of different conditions and symptoms, so one of the most helpful things you can do is arm yourself with knowledge.
The National Institute of Mental Health has a rundown of key facts and statistics about anxiety, and a list of shareable resources that may be helpful.

What to avoid
Sometimes, what you don’t do is just as important as what you do.
When you’re trying to support someone with anxiety, it’s important to avoid minimizing or stigmatizing their experience — for example, by saying things like, “You worry too much.”
Avoid trying to dispel their anxieties with logic. It’s fine to offer reassurance, but in most cases, the person with anxiety knows that their fears aren’t rational. Saying things like “That’s never going to happen” may not be helpful.
Also avoid putting pressure on them to “fix” the problem, or do more than they feel comfortable with.
It’s natural to want to help, but sometimes focusing too much on active solutions can make someone with anxiety feel rushed and overwhelmed.
Instead, make sure you really listen to what they tell you, and allow them to move at their own pace.
Take care of yourself, too
It’s important not to lose sight of your own needs. Taking care of someone else’s emotional well-being can take a heavy toll, so make sure you’re not taking on their problems to the detriment of your own mental health.
When you fill your own cup, you have more to give to other people.
If you start to feel drained, take a step back and prioritize some self-care. That could mean doing something specific — like yoga, baking, or crafts — or simply giving yourself the gift of downtime.
Scheduling “me time” at a particular time each week can be a helpful way for empathetic people to make sure they don’t neglect their own needs.
It’s also important to set boundaries when you’re supporting someone with anxiety. Be realistic about how much time and energy you can give. Don’t be afraid to gently set limits.
Remember that while what you’re doing is incredibly valuable, it’s not your job to “fix” anyone else — and if you take responsibility for someone else’s behavior, you risk enabling them, which won’t help either of you.
Next steps
Living with anxiety can be overwhelming and exhausting, but it’s a lot easier with a solid support system.
Just by showing up, you’re making a huge difference.
You’re reminding them that they’re not alone, and that there is hope.

5 Tips to Help a Friend With Anxiety

People who struggle with anxiety often need more than psychotherapy and medication to overcome their problems. One of the most important factors is strong support from people in their lives.
Friends and family can be an integral part of the treatment system and can make a difference in recovery time as well as sustain remission. The following are guidelines for helping your friend or family member with an anxiety disorder such as generalized anxiety or social anxiety.
What Is GAD?
Be Supportive
This may seem like an obvious rule to follow, but being a good, supportive friend can be tough work. Making sure that you can listen empathically without becoming frustrated, provide helpful suggestions, and reinforce continuing with treatment is not easy, but can be the difference between quick recovery and a long-term struggle.
Try to avoid crossing boundaries that your friend has set up regarding what kind of help (or how much help) they want. Being respectful is a key component of good support.
How GAD Affects Relationships
Educate Yourself
Do what you can to learn about anxiety symptoms, treatment, and prevention. Once you become more knowledgeable, it will be easier to avoid becoming frustrated and disillusioned.
Help Find Treatment
For people who have yet to be diagnosed or are fearful of seeking professional help, a supportive friend can be an important influence in taking the first step. Helping your friend find a treatment provider and encouraging them to follow through can show that you want the best for them.
How GAD Is Treated
However, be careful not to become overly invested in this process yourself. If your friend simply does not want to get help, then most methods of trying to force them can make the situation worse and could potentially damage your friendship. Look over the anxiety treatment guide for more information.
If you or a loved one are struggling with anxiety, contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for information on support and treatment facilities in your area.
For more mental health resources, see our National Helpline Database.
Get Your Own Help
If you are in a very close relationship with someone significantly struggling with anxiety, you can also become worn out and frustrated. Activating your own support system can make the difference between helper burnout and continued support.
Talking to a therapist, advisor, or close friend to get support ​is important, but make sure not to jeopardize the confidence your friend with anxiety has in you.
Have Fun
People with anxiety don’t only need folks to discuss their problems with, they also need friends that can make their lives fun and enjoyable. Without putting too much pressure on yourself or significantly trying to alter a strong relationship, being a fun and relaxing person to be around can make you an invaluable support.

Anxiety is a condition that can close you off to others. For friends and family of those living with anxiety, this can represent a serious challenge. You want to help them deal with their condition, but you don't know what to say to them that diminishes their distress.
It's important to realize that while anxiety is not a physical condition, it's also not something that can be cured by logic or reasoning. Like a disease, anxiety is something that needs special treatment. In this article, we'll give a background on what it's like to live with anxiety, followed by information on how to help your family members or friends with anxiety.

What's Your Anxiety Score?
If you believe you have anxiety, take this 7-minute anxiety test available that will help you see how severe your anxiety is, and what can be done to treat it. Take it yourself or send it to friends and family today.

Living With Anxiety
You need to realize that anxiety disorders are not like normal anxiety. It's not like the anxiety you feel before a meeting with your boss, or when you come face to face with a bully at school. It's much more complex, much less controllable, and with passage of time, more difficult to cure.
Self-Sustaining Nature of Anxiety
The first thing to understand is that anxiety itself is self-sustaining. It causes problems with your mind and body that make it more likely to experience further anxiety. For example, anxiety leads to more negative thinking, which then precipitates Anxiety can have physical manifestations, such as hyperventilation, sweating, nausea, etc., which can be very troubling. Anxiety also creates hypersensitivity, which is a mental response that makes people more prone to noticing those physical symptoms and letting it affect them.
If anxiety were just nervousness and sweating, anxiety disorders may not be considered as serious. But anxiety is so much more than that, and the longer you live with anxiety the more prevalent these symptoms can get.
Fearing Anxiety
Anxiety can also cause people to fear the anxiety itself, which unfortunately affects other areas of their life. When you're nervous about one thing (for example, social situations) you can become nervous about other things as a result (for example, amusement park rides). So when someone starts to fear their own anxiety and its symptoms, they may also develop new anxieties, or find more situations to provoke anxiety.
Learning to Forget What You Think About Anxiety
As someone with family members or friends who have anxiety or a panic disorder, it's important to understand what anxiety really is. For example, did you know that someone with anxiety can experience physical symptoms even when they're not mentally anxious? Did you know that one of the symptoms of a panic attack is a feeling of imminent death or doom, combined with intense physical symptoms that are nearly identical to heart attacks?
If you've never had anxiety, it's extremely difficult to empathize and understand, because it is so much different than the normal anxieties people experience in their everyday life. If you start trying to "cure" your friend's anxiety by assuming you understand what they're dealing with, you're going to struggle, and you may actually upset your friend or family member more.

The Do's and Don'ts of Anxiety
With that in mind, it's time to go over some tips on how to help a friend with anxiety. Note that every person is different and has different needs. There are some people who want to talk about their anxieties, and there are others who may have never mentioned it. So even with these do's and don'ts, it's hard to know exactly what you should do. However, this can be a helpful guide.
Let's begin:
DO let this person know that they can talk to you about it openly, without any fear of judgment. It's very important that they know that you're there to lend them an ear, and that you aren't going to judge them or change the way you think/feel about them based on anything they say - even if they say the same fear over and over again (because for many, the fears and thoughts are nearly exactly the same each time).
DON'T get frustrated. Those with anxiety really do know that their fears shouldn't bother them, but as hard as they try they can't stop, and expecting them to use logic to control their anxiety is extremely difficult, if not impossible.
DO spend time with them as much as possible. You being around them is a bigger help than you realize. In fact, they may not realize it either. But time spent with others makes it harder to think about their anxieties, and that makes a difference.
DON'T bring up the anxiety often. This is a tricky one - while you want to be there to talk about it, there are some anxieties, like panic attacks, that can be triggered by thinking about it. In other words, if you ask someone "how are your panic attacks?" you may accidentally trigger an attack. Let them bring it up with you.
DO tell them to call you anytime, anywhere. Talking on the phone and knowing someone is there to pick up can actually be incredibly comforting to someone that is trying to control their anxiety. Anxiety can make people feel lost and alone. Knowing that someone is a phone call away reduces that feeling.
DON'T let anxiety affect you as well. Make sure that you are working on your own stress and anxiety, because the way you feel can have an effect on the way others feel, especially as you spend more and more time again. If you're dealing with anxiety yourself, the other person is going to deal with more anxiety as well.
DO be forgiving. Anxiety can make people irritable. It's not in the control of the person with anxiety. Ideally, try your best to be forgiving. Let them know that you understand, and that even if it's not fair you're not going to quit the friendship because of it.
DON'T expect massive, immediate turnarounds. Unfortunately, controlling anxiety does take time. Those that try to cure it too fast often find they have setbacks that are sometimes worse than the initial anxiety. It's very important that you understand that curing anxiety can take a lot of time, and even on the way there, there are going to be issues that come up and fears that they're going to have. It's natural.
DO exciting activities. Try to be outdoors. Find things to do that don't involve alcohol (since alcohol can cause setbacks in anxiety treatments). Stay active. Exercise itself is a remedy for anxiety, and creating new memories can help people cope with some of the stresses of life. So try your best to get out and do things together.
DON'T guilt trip. It can be hard, but you have to remember that those with anxiety often struggle to get out of their own head. They want to relate to you, talk to you, and be friendly, but they have an incredibly hard time dealing with the thoughts they can't control. They take over their mind and their memories. If you push them too hard to get more attention or get them out of their bubble, they may withdraw further.
DO be proud of them when they improve. They'll be able to see it on your face. Remember that anxiety changes thought patterns and can make people think and feel much more negative, which unfortunately means that many of them are going to interpret your facial expressions negatively, assuming you're annoyed with them or ashamed of them. Thus making sure to highlight your positive emotions and your pride - and actually being happy when you see recovery while avoiding feeling frustrated during setbacks - can be very valuable.
DON'T give up hope. Anxiety is a treatable condition. The person in your life isn't going to always feel or believe it's treatable, and there are going to be times when even you think it might keep going forever, but the reality is that anxiety is perhaps one of the most treatable conditions available today.
DO be yourself. You don't need to change who you are, and the person with anxiety doesn't want you to change either. You are close for a reason. Be yourself. The fact that you're looking for what you can do to help this person with anxiety proves that you're a good influence in their life. Be positive, have fun, and be the person that your friends or family member loves.
Dealing with anxiety is an uphill battle, and it does take a toll on others around them. Anxiety can strain relationships, and may even cause significant stress on a loved one. Some people find that they actually start developing anxieties of their own.
But a supportive friend is an extremely effective way to treat your own anxiety. Learn from the above tips to better understand how to help your friend, family member, or a partner and you'll give them the best opportunity to overcome their anxiety and grow closer to you as a result.
SUMMARY:
Those that love someone with anxiety may feel helpless that they cannot help their partner or friend. Anxiety is treatable, but it’s also a very individual experience. Learning more about anxiety is the best thing you can do for them, as well as encouraging them if they decide they’re ready to treat it.

So, I've got a bunch of information here about how anxiety affects family and friends, and also some tips on how to support someone with anxiety. Let me try to synthesize this information.

First, anxiety can really strain relationships. People with anxiety might withdraw from social activities, which can make family and friends feel neglected or confused. Family members might feel like they're walking on eggshells, never knowing what might trigger an anxiety episode. Caregivers can feel burdened or burnt out if they're providing a lot of support.

Anxiety can lead to avoidance behaviors, like refusing to go out in public or attend family gatherings, which can hurt relationships. Additionally, anxiety often co-occurs with other mental health issues like depression or substance abuse, complicating family dynamics even further.

On the positive side, educating family and friends about anxiety can help them understand what's going on and how to support the person better. Open communication is key, but it can be tough for someone with anxiety to express their feelings.

Involving family in therapy can sometimes be beneficial, as it allows everyone to learn coping strategies together and improve their interactions.

From the articles, I've gathered some specific tips on how to help someone with anxiety:

1. **Don't Pressure Them:** It's important not to push someone with anxiety into situations they're not ready for. Being patient and respecting their comfort levels is crucial.

2. **Help During Panic Attacks:** Knowing how to handle panic attacks can be helpful. Encouraging slow, deep breathing and providing a calm environment can make a difference.

3. **Try to Understand:** Educate yourself about anxiety to better understand what the person is going through. Reading personal stories or seeking information from reliable sources can provide insights.

4. **Ask How You Can Help:** Sometimes, the person with anxiety knows best what kind of support they need. Asking them directly can ensure that you're providing the right kind of assistance.

5. **Support Them to Seek Help:** Encourage the person to seek professional help if their anxiety is impacting their life significantly. Offer to help them find a therapist or accompany them to appointments.

6. **Look After Yourself:** Supporting someone with anxiety can be stressful. It's important to take care of your own mental health to avoid burnout. Set boundaries, share the caring role if possible, and seek support for yourself when needed.

7. **Encourage Self-Care:** Help the person maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate sleep, as these can all positively impact mental health.

8. **Be Patient:** Recovery from anxiety takes time, and setbacks are common. It's important to be patient and持续支持 the person through their journey.

9. **Avoid Minimizing Their Feelings:** Don't tell them to "just relax" or "stop worrying." Their anxiety is real and valid, and dismissing their feelings can make them feel worse.

10. **Educate Others:** Raising awareness about anxiety can help reduce stigma and increase understanding among the wider community.

I think one of the most important takeaways is that anxiety isn't just an individual issue; it affects the entire family dynamic. Therefore, supporting the person with anxiety should also involve supporting the family system as a whole.

Additionally, it's crucial to remember that everyone's experience with anxiety is unique. What works for one person may not work for another, so it's important to be flexible and adapt your support approach accordingly.

I also noticed that some resources强调了寻求专业帮助的重要性。While friends and family can provide invaluable support, professional treatment is often necessary for managing anxiety effectively.

Lastly, taking care of oneself as a caregiver is essential. Burnout is a real risk when you're constantly supporting someone else, so it's important to have your own support system and engage in self-care activities.

Overall, supporting someone with anxiety requires empathy, patience, and a willingness to educate oneself about the condition. By providing a supportive environment and encouraging professional help when needed, friends and family can play a vital role in helping someone manage their anxiety.
