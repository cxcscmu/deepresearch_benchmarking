So I need to figure out why apartheid ended in South Africa. I know that apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that was enforced by the South African government from 1948 until the early 1990s. But I'm not exactly sure what led to its eventual demise. I think I should start by understanding what apartheid was and how it functioned before delving into the reasons for its end.

First off, apartheid was a policy implemented by the National Party of South Africa, which came to power in 1948. It was a systematic form of racism where non-white people were segregated from whites in all aspects of life, including housing, education, and even public amenities. The government passed a series of laws that entrenched this racial separation, such as the Population Registration Act, which classified residents into racial groups, and the Group Areas Act, which segregated cities and towns.

Now, to understand why apartheid ended, I need to look at both internal and external factors that contributed to its collapse. Internally, there was a lot of resistance to apartheid within South Africa. Groups like the African National Congress (ANC), the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), and trade unions organized protests, strikes, and other forms of civil disobedience against the regime. One notable event was the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, where police opened fire on peaceful protesters, killing many and galvanizing international opinion against apartheid.

Externally, countries around the world began to impose sanctions and boycotts against South Africa in protest of its racist policies. Many nations severed diplomatic ties, and international sporting events were canceled or moved elsewhere. The United Nations also played a role by imposing arms embargoes and calling for an end to apartheid.

I think another important factor was the changing global political climate during the latter half of the 20th century. The civil rights movement in the United States and decolonization in Africa and Asia challenged the legitimacy of racial discrimination and white minority rule. This shift in international norms put increasing pressure on South Africa to reform its policies.

Additionally, the economy of South Africa suffered under apartheid due to brain drain, labor unrest, and the isolation imposed by sanctions. The cost of maintaining the apartheid system became unsustainable, both financially and in terms of the country's reputation on the global stage.

In the 1980s, there were more intense protests and violence within South Africa, fueled by economic hardships and continued oppression. The government, led by President P.W. Botha, tried to implement some reforms, but they were seen as insufficient by the opposition.

Then, in 1990, F.W. de Klerk became president and began to dismantle apartheid. He lifted the ban on opposition parties like the ANC, released political prisoners including Nelson Mandela, and started negotiations for a transition to majority rule. In 1994, the first fully democratic elections were held, marking the official end of apartheid.

So, to sum it up, apartheid ended due to a combination of internal resistance, external pressure, economic strains, and shifting international norms. The persistent struggle of South Africans against oppression, coupled with global condemnation and sanctions, eventually forced the apartheid regime to relinquish power and pave the way for a democratic South Africa.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Apartheid ended due to a combination of internal resistance, external pressure, economic strains, and shifting international norms.}} \]
