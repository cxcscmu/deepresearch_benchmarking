Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects tourism. Hmm, that sounds like a pretty big topic. I mean, climate change is altering weather patterns, sea levels are rising, and there are more extreme weather events. Tourism is about people traveling to different places for leisure or business. So, how do these two things connect?

First off, I should probably understand what aspects of tourism could be impacted by climate change. Maybe starting with popular tourist destinations? Like beaches, mountains, cities, and so on. Each of these places might be affected differently by climate change.

Let me think about beaches. Sea levels are rising due to climate change, which could lead to erosion and loss of coastal areas. That would directly affect beach tourism. Also, hotter temperatures might make some beaches too hot to enjoy during certain times of the year. On the other hand, maybe some places will become more attractive if their climate becomes milder.

What about mountain resorts? Well, skiing is a big part of mountain tourism, and with warmer temperatures, there might be less snow, which could shorten ski seasons or even make some resorts unviable. But maybe in higher altitudes, there will still be snow, so those places could see an increase in tourists.

Cities might also be affected. Some cities are already dealing with heatwaves, which could make visiting them uncomfortable during summer months. Additionally, increased frequency of extreme weather events like hurricanes or floods could disrupt travel plans and deter tourists.

I should also consider the impact on wildlife tourism. Changes in climate can affect animal habitats and migration patterns, which could alter the experiences tourists have when visiting national parks or going on safaris.

Another angle is the economic impact. Tourism is a major industry for many countries, and if climate change negatively affects it, there could be serious economic consequences. For example, island nations that rely heavily on beach tourism might suffer if their coastlines are destroyed.

Moreover, tourism itself contributes to climate change through transportation emissions, especially from flights. So, there’s a bit of a feedback loop there.

Wait, maybe I should look into whether there are any studies or reports that have already explored this relationship. It would be helpful to have some data or examples to support my thoughts.

How Climate Change Is Affecting Tourism
Destination & Tourism Janeen Christoff January 08, 2017
Climate change is of great concern for the tourism industry and there are several reasons why, as illustrated in a new report from GreenBiz .

The World's Best Travel Loyalty Programs
“More than many other industries, tourism relies on a stable climate, whether attracting customers to lavish lakes, bountiful beaches or majestic mountains,” notes Mike Hower.
More extreme weather has the ability to wreak havoc on the travel industry.
“Even if the world follows through on its landmark commitments outlined in the Paris Agreement, we’ve already reached a point of no return. We still may avoid the worst impacts if we get our act together, but significant damage already has been done enough to forecast unpredictable weather into the foreseeable future,” Hower reports.
While warming may be okay for some destinations for a while, the overall effects will not be beneficial.
Hower points to California’s Lake Tahoe region as an example of how climate change is already having an impact on tourism.

“A lack of snowfall tied to California’s climate change-perpetuated drought led to several years of record-low attendance at ski resorts, which in turn harmed restaurants, hotels and other businesses accustomed to servicing customers drawn by snow sports,” he writes.
This has given rise to concerns that the ski industry may not be sustainable in the Sierras as the weather becomes more unpredictable.
Hower also points out that businesses in tropical regions could also suffer.
“While businesses in the tropics might enjoy longer beach seasons warmer temperatures in the mid-latitudes could reduce tourists’ motivation to travel there, opting instead for nearby destinations, according to the World Meteorological Organization,” Hower points out.
Rising sea levels have a part to play, as well, as does the business of tourism itself.
“Tourism is responsible for about 5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a United Nations report (PDF) on climate change and tourism. A vast majority of these emissions come from getting tourists to and from their destinations,” says Hower.
But travel can be done in ways that help rather than hinder destinations.
“Seeing the world first person and meeting people who are different on the surface can shake tourists out of trivial day-to-day concerns. It can build the recognition that climate change doesn’t care about man-made borders — we all sink or swim together,” says Hower.

How Is Tourism Affected By Climate Change?

The tourism sector is one of the largest and fastest-growing economic areas across the world. In 2015, about 1,186 million international tourists traveled to various destinations representing a 4.6% increase over the previous year. In 2016, the tourism and travel industry accounted for 10.2% of the global GDP and 6.6% of the world’s total annual export. It is projected that travel and tourism will surpass retail and public services by contributing 2.5 to 4% of full employment by 2027. Climate is one of the main drivers of international tourism. The tourism sector has an essential place in the post-Kyoto Protocol roadmap due to its global economic and social value, because of its role in sustainable development and its strong relationship with climate. Compelling scientific evidence shows that the global climate has changed significantly compared to the pre-industrial era. The climate change phenomenon is expected to continue throughout the 21century and beyond with serious ramifications including, sea-level rise, increased occurrence and intensity of adverse weather events such as storms, ocean warming, droughts, and glacier melting. The regional manifestation of climate will be highly sensitive to tourists and tourist destinations alike, hence requiring adaptation from all tourism stakeholders. The effects of climate change are already becoming evident at various destinations across the world. Global climate change has also begun influencing decision-making in the tourism sector.
Implications For Tourism Demand Patterns
The natural environment, climate, and personal safety are among the key factors that influence destination choice. Experts believe that global climate change is expected to have a significant impact on all three elements at the regional level. Tourists have a more exceptional ability to adapt to the effects of climate change as they can avoid destinations suffering from the adverse impacts of climate change or change the timing of travel to avoid unfavorable climate conditions. The response of tourists to climate change impact on destinations and other attractions will, therefore, reshape demand patterns and the tourism industry as a whole. Understanding and anticipating the potential seasonal and geographic shifts in tourism demand will be critical for major stakeholders in the sector. Tourists from temperate countries, that currently dominate international travel are expected to adapt their travel plans to take advantage of new climatic conditions closer to home. The shift in travel patterns will have huge implications, including more spending in resident and neighboring nations and less spending in warmer countries currently frequented by tourists from temperate regions.
Coastal And Island Destinations
Coastal and beach ecosystems are among the most diverse and productive habitats on the planet. The coastal areas are comprised of barrier islands, mangroves, estuaries, beaches, and salt marshes. Beach tourism is one of the most dominant market segments that constitute a crucial part of small island nations and developing countries. For example, in the Caribbean, tourism is ranked 1stin the relative contribution of tourism to GDP out of 12 regions, making it one of the most tourism-dependent areas of the world. Coastal and Island destinations are vulnerable to the indirect and direct impacts of climate change such as coastal erosion, coastal boundary change, storms, and extreme climatic events, sea-level rise, and physical damage to infrastructure.
The impact of climate change on coastal tourism is already being felt in some parts of the world. For example, the rising sea level is causing changes in coastal areas in Cua Dai, Vietnam, in one of the significant estuary regions that attract tourists. The vulnerability and risks to such areas are often coupled with a low adaptive capacity, particularly in coastal destinations of developing nations and small island nations. The seasonality of beach tourism could also be exacerbated by climate change. Going into the future, the impact of climate change on different coastal regions will vary significantly, and in some instances, it might be beneficial. For example, the shoulder season in traditional beach destinations such as the Mediterranean might lengthen and the winter season could become more appealing to tourists leading to an expansion in tourism in such areas. Northern coastal areas might also benefit from warmer summers, thus attracting more tourists and lengthening the summer season.
Mountain And Winter Tourism Destinations
Mountainous regions are critical tourism destinations in several countries. Mountain tourism is most popular among the urban and busy city population as it offers peaceful locations, low-temperature conditions, and natural landscape. Climate change has severe impacts in mountain regions; for example, a rise in temperature could result in the melting of glaciers, changes in precipitation, increased pests, and a shift in seasons. Pristine mountain landscapes covered in snow, which are the main attractions in such areas, are the most vulnerable to climate change. In some areas, however, climate change might bring more opportunities. For example, shortening in the winter period and a lengthening of the summer period might provide opportunities for other outdoor opportunities such as hiking, trekking, and mountain biking. The effects of climate change in mountainous areas could be dealt with if stakeholders stimulate product and seasonal diversification. Diversification could involve creating spas, implementing snowmaking, grooming ski slopes to reduce snow depth requirements, improve insurance cover to deal with natural disasters like avalanches, and improve emergency preparedness.
Forest And Biodiversity Tourism
National parks are among the most popular destinations in the forest and biodiversity tourism subsector. In recent years, visits to forests as places for recreational activities such as hiking have been gaining popularity. Tourists visiting such areas select such destinations due to their unusual nature. Some of the most popular recreational activities in such areas include bird watching and hiking. Experts believe that regions such as the Amazon, which is a biodiversity hotspot, are likely to be adversely affected by climate change. Modeled predictions suggest that climate change will result in a 12% increase in forest fires by 2050 in the Amazon basin. Climate change is also likely to result in a shift in species range in various habitats. Climate change has also been blamed for the more frequent and intense forest fires that are displacing and killing animals in different parts of the world, leading to declining tourism activity.
Safari Destinations
The effects of climate change in safari destinations are already being felt in many countries. In mid-2012, flooding led to a three-day closure of the main road to the Maasai Mara National Reserve, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Kenya, which severely affected tourism activities in the area.
Ocean And Sea Life Tourism
Oceans occupy 70% of the Earth’s surface and are home to a wide range of biodiversity, which makes them suitable for various leisure activities such as marine wildlife watching. Oceans and seas in hard to reach areas are increasingly getting more attention from researchers and holidaymakers. Ease of travel has led to increased interest in marine wildlife, including whales, sharks, dolphins, sea lions, and turtles. Sailing, cruising, and diving are some of the ways used to explore such regions. Experts estimate diving tourism has been increasing at a rate of 20% a year, four times faster than global tourism. Climate change is adversely affecting some of the ocean and sea life tourism destinations such as the Great Barrier Reef along the coast of Australia through processes such as ocean acidification (OA). OA results in acidic conditions within the marine environment, which makes such places inhabitable for various calcium producing organisms. Bleaching of coral reefs has also been observed in the Indian Ocean near Kenya, Tanzania, India, and Sri Lanka. Bleaching is not only threatening the coral reefs but also fish that depend on them for habitat.
Mitigating Climate Change In The Tourism Sector
An average tourist journey generates an estimated 0.25 t of CO2emissions. Emissions in the tourism sector can vary significantly per tourist trip; from a few kilograms of CO2to 9 t of C02in long-distance, cruise based journeys. Transportation alone contributes about 75% of CO2emissions generated by the sector, with aviation making up the bulk of it (40%). Stakeholders in the tourism sector need to develop measures to deal with emissions in transport to deal with climate change. Technological developments are likely to play a vital role in reducing C02emissions. For example, a shift to electric safari vehicles that have zero emissions has been observed in countries such as Kenya and South Africa. In addition to technological development, governments and other major players in the tourism sector should also implement regulatory and market-based measures as well as behavioral changes. While implementing market-based measures in developing countries, steps should be taken to ensure not to jeopardize poverty eradication objectives.
Reducing Emissions In The Accommodation Subsector
The accommodations sub-sector accounts for 20% of the emissions generated in the tourism sector. The subsector is an intensive energy consumer. Experts, however, believe that there is significant potential in improving carbon efficiency. The use of existing low emission technologies and the implementation of best practices are likely to reduce emissions by 30% to 40%. Proper energy management could also mean business due to savings in the energy bill. An increasing number of hotel chains are improving energy efficiency, reducing energy use, and utilizing renewable sources of energy. Some hotels have also established a climate fund account that addresses issues related to climate change. Certification and eco-labeling programs are also encouraging hotels to take climate-friendly measures to promote their businesses.

Climate Change and Tourism
Tourism is one of the main forces of economic development for tourist destinations that provides significant economic benefits, including tax revenues, investments, and jobs (Mahadevan & Suardi, 2019; Sharpley, 2018). At the same time, the positive economic impacts of tourism are often outweighed by the environmental costs for local communities (Garau-Vadell et al., 2018; Uysal et al., 2016) that negatively impact residents’ health, well-being, and quality of life.
Environmental impacts are mainly related to the increased usage of resources, infrastructure, and facilities. Furthermore, local destination development policies are often focused on satisfying the needs of tourists rather than sustainability and environmental protection. The negative environmental outcomes include air pollution, water pollution, wildlife destruction, plant destruction, deforestation, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from different kinds of transportation (Postma & Schmuecker, 2017). Many tourism destinations in the world suffer from global warming. For example, saving Australia’s Great Barrier Reef from the ravages of bleaching requires immediate actions on reducing global warming (Gelineau, 2017).
At the same time, tourism also brings positive environmental impacts through important environmental services for host countries and energy efficiency innovations (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2020). Furthermore, the relationships between tourism development and climate change are bidirectional. The growth of tourism and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions influences climate change, while climate change also affects tourism demand (Patterson et al., 2006). The tourism industry is also associated with high levels of energy consumption for hotels, transportation, tourist attractions, etc., which also contribute to environmental pollution (Gössling, 2002).
The literature suggests that tourism is responsible for about 10% of the total carbon emissions in the world (Gabbatiss, 2018). As a result, there is no lack of debate about the organizations that should pay the costs of climate change outcomes, and tourism stakeholders are discussed as the potential financial resources of climate change adaptation (Hess & Kelman, 2017). For example, several authors recommend governments in Small Island Development States (SIDS) to encourage tourism enterprises to invest in adaptation to climate changes (e.g., Hess, Pauw, & Papyrakis, 2015). Another example is related to the excessive pollution caused by cruise ships. Vidal (2016) describes the trail of pollution behind the biggest cruise ship Harmony of the Seas in Southampton.
At the same time, it is difficult to directly analyze the relationships between tourism statistics and climate change indicators. On the one hand, the environmental impacts of tourism can be quantitatively assessed through the data on greenhouse gas emissions, PM 2.5 pollution, air quality indexes, land management metrics, ecological footprint, human-wildlife conflict monitoring, and some other techniques (Mikayilov et al., 2019). On the other hand, the causality of these relationships is not obvious due to the nature of research methodology traditionally applied in tourism descriptive statistics which say nothing about the direction of causality. In order to determine causality, it is necessary to observe variation in independent variables such as tourism arrivals and then measure the changes in the dependent variable such as carbon emissions or climate change. Identification of causality should be made by establishing covariation between variables, determining the time-order relationship with the cause preceding the effect, and eliminating alternative causes, including noon-tourism transportation, using fossil fuels, deforestation, etc. Taking into account the potential negative environmental impacts of tourism, it will be more beneficial for the governments and international organizations to nudge environmentally friendly behavior of tourism providers, tourists, and tourism destinations by providing additional benefits for the most sustainable practices, restricting using certain ways of transportation, and encouraging tourists to minimize their environmental impacts by using behavioral insights from psychological research (Amir et al., 2005; Barberis, 2018).

1. Introduction
Climate science shows that, in the 21st century, changes in the Earth's climate will take place at an unprecedented rate (Solomon et al., 2007 ). The spatial and temporal pattern of tourism demand can be expected to adjust to this, either as a result of the direct effects of climate change, such as rising temperatures, or due to secondary effects, such as rising sea levels, a loss of snow cover or impacts on the landscape. Despite the economic significance of the Travel and Tourism Industry, estimated as accounting for 9.1% of the Gross Domestic Product worldwide (WTTC, 2012 ), and tourism's apparent overwhelming dependence on climatic factors, literature on the economic implications of climate change has been dominated by other sectors such as agriculture – with a lower weight in economic terms, estimated as representing 6.1% of the Gross Domestic Product (CIA, 2012) –, while tourism has been pushed into the background. This is reflected in successive reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in which tourism only featured more prominently in the last AR4 Report (IPCC, 2007 ).
The relative extent to which tourism has been overlooked in literature on climate change could be explained by the uncertainty and complexity of expected tourism demand reactions. In a recent study, Gössling, Scott, Hall, Ceron, and Dubois (2012) highlight the complexity of understanding tourist perceptions and reactions to the impacts of climate change as a means of anticipating the decline or increase of specific tourism markets and seasonal shifts in tourism demand. They argue that tourism stands out for its substantial adaptive capacity, which must be combined with other uncertainties concerning the implementation of future mitigation policies and their impacts on transportation systems, together with the wide range of climate change impacts on destinations and broader impacts on society and economic development.
However, the tourism industry today needs to anticipate the consequences of climate change on future demand. Despite controversies regarding the weaknesses of statistical models in predicting tourist flows under scenarios of climate change (Bigano. et al., 2006b, Gössling and Hall, 2006 ), strategic planning is now needed by the tourism industry in terms of new infrastructures and the detection of mid and long-run business opportunities. The results of literature on tourism and climate change should be contextualized, implying that all the determinants of tourism demand – except for climate, whose influence is being analysed – should be held constant. Consequently it must be assumed that a high level of uncertainty will remain, given the difficulties involved in forecasting social phenomena in the medium and long run. For instance, with the winter tourism market segment, although it is almost impossible to provide information on the changing preferences of potential tourists visiting mountain resorts during the next 50 years, it is feasible to evaluate the physical consequences of a loss of snow cover brought about by climate change. An idea of future snow cover can then be forecast by quantifying expected snowfalls, which in turn will implicitly determine the availability of winter tourism conditions.
Similarly, optimal tourism conditions can also be evaluated by assuming that some tourism activities require a certain level of favourable climate conditions. For instance, visits to nature reserves, cycling, golf tourism, beach tourism, nautical tourism or city tourism can require certain weather conditions. In this case, an assessment is needed of what tourists perceive to be optimal conditions, and a subsequent evaluation of future climate conditions will then determine a destination's diminished or improved attractiveness for tourists. Evidently, changes in climatic preferences are hard to anticipate and only optimal climate conditions can be projected.
Although the inclusion of climatic determinants in modelling exercises in the field of tourism demand has traditionally been disregarded, since the turn of the century the incorporation of climatic variables (such as temperature, precipitation and wind) in tourism demand models has become more common (Goh, 2012 ). The effect of climate on tourism demand is taken as a short-run determinant in the context of time series and as a push and pull structural determinant when both discrete choice models and aggregate tourism models are considered. Since estimation techniques usually entail the isolation of each of the determinants, it is possible to evaluate the marginal contribution of climatic factors to tourism demand while the rest of the variables are held constant.
As a result, over the last fifteen years numerous quantitative studies have attempted to evaluate the consequences of climate change on tourism. So far, however, no attempt has been made to compile these findings to any great extent in order to try and identify a regular pattern as means of building up knowledge and establishing certain general principles. Due to the recent emergence of multiple quantitative methodologies for assessing the consequences of climate change on tourism, this paper aims to evaluate these different alternatives, demonstrating that despite the different approaches used to tackle the problem, the results show a significant consistency. What is more, because a pioneering joint analysis is made of the different alternatives, it is possible to highlight some of the main advantages and limitations of each one.
2. Evaluations through physical changes
A change in the depth of snow cover is the most direct consequence of climate change, and winter tourism is heavily dependent on the reliability of snow cover at mountain resorts. As a result, the financial viability of winter tourism depends on favourable snow conditions. However, reliable snow cover will rise to higher altitudes over the coming years if climate change occurs (Elsasser & Bürki, 2002 ). Adaptational strategies play an important role in the winter tourism segment (e.g. artificial snow production), and anticipating the consequences of climate change on the depth of snow cover has become a key factor in management and strategic decision-making. Breiling and Charamza (1999) analysed the impact of a 2 °C temperature change on seasonal snow cover depth for all areas of Austria, finding that it leads to a reduction in the length of the ski season and usability of ski facilities. Warming will have a strong impact on low altitude resorts, which are expected to disappear first by the authors, while the remaining resorts will become more expensive due to the reduced supply. Further studies have been made of winter sports tourism in Scotland (Harrison, Winterbottom, & Shephard, 1999 ), Switzerland (Elsasser & Messerli, 2001 ), Canada (Scott, McBoyle, Minogue, & Mills, 2006 ), the Alps (Rixen et al., 2011, Soboll and Dingeldey, 2012) and Australia (Pickering, 2011 ).
Methodologically, all these studies seek to estimate the amount of precipitation that falls as snow and rain, snow accumulation, and snowmelt. Historical precipitation data can be analysed for each mountain resort in order to determine the temperatures that best predict historical snowfall amounts. Then, by using projected temperature and precipitation data for different climate change scenarios (or by assuming the existence of a certain trend in temperatures and precipitation), it is possible to estimate the amount of snow precipitation that determines snow accumulation. Breiling and Charamza, 1999, Harrison et al., 1999 Elsasser and Messerli (2001), Scott et al., 2006, Rixen et al., 2011 and Soboll and Dingeldey (2012) and other similar studies find a general decline in natural skiing conditions, although this will be less of a problem at high altitude sites. At this point it is important to note that the use of snowmaking machines should be taken into consideration in the final evaluation, even though this partial solution is also temperature dependent.
Despite winter tourism's special interest appeal, the importance of sun and sand tourism cannot be ignored because it is also affected by climate change. Just as winter tourism depends on snow, summer tourism at some destinations relies on other physical conditions that are required for tourism activities. Although the development of models for this broad area (sun and sand tourism) is in the initial stage, the rise in sea level and its consequences on beach coverage (Nicholls et al., 2011 ), coral reef health (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007 ), the proliferation of jellyfish (Purcell, 2012) and algal blooms (Englebert, McDermott, & Kleinheinz, 2008) should be on the agenda of future quantification of the effects of climate change on tourism. These quantified assessments could be considered at both a global and regional level. It should be possible to characterize the extension of beaches, coral reef coverage, jellyfish and other tourism-related environmental attributes sensitive to climate change at a global level. If all these characteristics are projected in the context of climate change, then the link with tourism can be established. On the other hand, at a local level, if a particular region is popular because of its natural environment, the role of each of the natural characteristics in attracting tourism can be estimated. Consequently, future tourism demand can be projected once the environmental attributes altered by climate change have been pinpointed.
In this context, it is important to note that although some exploratory studies have demonstrated the relative irrelevance of tourism opinions when faced with a marginal loss of environmental quality (Gössling, Bredberg, Randow, Sandström, & Svensson, 2006 ), a certain threshold level – defined sometimes by visibility, the abundance and variety of different species, the occurrence of algae or the physical disappearance of beaches – seems to exist (Gössling, Lindén, Helmersson, Liljenberg, & Quarm, 2007 ), showing that tourists might respond to climate changes in a non-linear way. Although a slight change in environmental quality cannot be detected through simple techniques, it is suggested that ecosystem responses to pressures are characterized by discontinuities and threshold effects, hindering accurate estimations of the consequences on tourism.
3. Climate indexes
A climate index is a set of climate variables combined through a mathematical formula to capture human comfort preferences. The potential changes in human comfort levels suggested by a combination of a climate index and scenarios of climate change could have profound implications for the tourism industry. Mieczkowski (1985) was among the first to apply the results of climate indexes for tourism-related activities by developing a tourism climate index (TCI). Initially, Mieczkowski (1985) identified 12 climate variables from relevant literature to be included in the TCI. However, due to meteorological data constraints, the number of climate variables included in the TCI was reduced to seven, combined in five sub-indexes to form the most popular TCI. A standardized rating system, ranging from 5 (optional) to −1 (extremely unfavourable), was devised to provide a common measurement procedure for each of the sub-indexes. Analytically, the TCI can be derived from the following equation: (1) TCI=2(4 C i d+C i a+2 S u n+2 Pr e c+W i n d)where Cid is the daytime thermal comfort index; Cia is the daily thermal comfort index; Sun is an index of the amount of sunshine; Prec is an index of the amount of precipitation; and Wind is the index of the appreciation of wind. Bearing in mind that TCI scores range from −20 to 100, Mieczkowski (1985) proposed a classification of TCI scores, with values in excess of 60 corresponding to ‘good’ conditions, scores exceeding 70 expressing ‘very good’ climatic conditions, levels of over 80 corresponding to ‘excellent’ conditions, and scores of 90 or more standing for ‘ideal’ circumstances.
Although the Mieczkowski index was not originally devised to explore the impacts of climate change on tourism, since climatologists can provide future data for the five sub-indexes, it is possible to evaluate the climatic attractiveness of regions under different climate change scenarios and to compare them with the current situation. This has been carried out for Europe (Rotmans, Hulme, & Downing, 1994 ), European beaches (Moreno & Amelung, 2009 ), Mediterranean countries (Amelung & Viner, 2006 ), North America (Scott, McBoyle, & Schwartzentruber, 2004) and even on a worldwide scale (Amelung, Nicholls, & Viner, 2007 ). It should be noted that maps depicting the TCI show a strong correlation with currently popular destinations, suggesting that the index performs quite well as a predictor of tourist arrivals.
The weights used in Equation (1) give the highest weight to the daytime comfort index, reflecting the fact that tourists are generally most active during the day. The amount of sunshine and amount of precipitation are given the second highest weights, followed by daily thermal comfort and wind speed. Although these weights are ultimately subjective because they are founded on expert judgements, more recent versions of the TCI have been based on declared tourist preferences, gathered through questionnaires. Morgan et al. (2000) collected the preferences of 1354 beach users on holiday at different destinations, thus adapting the index to different tourist market segments through the use of different weights.
One of the main goals of climate indexes is to seek simplicity in analyses of seasonal patterns. Because the TCI's sub-indexes are based on monthly data, the implications of projected climate change on the seasonality of tourism can be revealed. In this way, Amelung et al. (2007) show that countries in northern Europe may experience substantial improvements in summer climate conditions while northern Mediterranean countries that currently attract traditional “sun and sand” summer holidaymakers are likely to become too hot for comfort in the current summer season, contrasting with improved climate conditions during the non-summer period. Thus, while northern countries are expected to become more attractive to tourists with climate change, the consequences for actual warmer destinations remain uncertain owing to the final balance between a loss of attractiveness during the summer and a gain in attractiveness during the rest of the year.
However, it should be pointed out that sometimes perceptions of climate differ from objective climate measurements, with the former being a determinant of human behaviour. Within this framework, the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature index recently emerged as an alternative to the TCI, which was originally developed to assess human comfort in general (Matzarakis, Mayer, & Iziomon, 1999 ). It has also been applied to tourism comfort by Lin and Matzarakis (2011), who create PET seasonal distribution maps, showing that Taiwan and Eastern China are perceived to be comfortable during spring and autumn for those residing in temperate regions, while only the southern region during spring and the northern region during summer are regarded as being comfortable for those residing in sub-tropical regions.
Overall, the main advantages of climate indexes are that they provide an easy, quick, objective view of the relationship between climate conditions and tourism attractiveness that can be applied both locally and globally. Additionally, they can be adapted to different market segments with specific climatic preferences. The main drawback of TCIs, nonetheless, is the inability to provide a quantitative measure of the impact on tourism in economic terms or from the perspective of tourism arrivals. This explains why Amelung and Moreno, 2012, Goh, 2012 and Eugenio-Martín and Campos-Soria (2010) recently included the TCI as an independent variable in a tourism demand model. However, this perspective, also based on revealed preferences, brings us to the following section.
4. Tourism demand models
The absence of literature on climate change to take into account the tourism sector has been associated with the omission of climate variables in tourism demand models since the turn of the century (Goh, 2012 ). In the review by Crouch (1994), only a limited number of papers were found to have included climate or weather variables as determinants and, on many occasions, with limited success (Barry & O'Hagan, 1972 ). A feasible explanation for this omission could be researchers and planners' interest in income elasticities and/or price elasticities as a means of achieving accurate tourism demand forecasts – a key issue for service industries with relatively high fixed costs – or, alternatively, as a means of evaluating the consequences of taxes or exchange rate policies. This explains why tourism demand literature has been dominated by time series models and frequently linked to forecasting issues (Song & Li, 2008 ). Thus, as climate is a relatively stable variable, the climate factor does not have the required variability and it is not correlated with the determining variable, so no bias in estimating elasticities is expected.
However, with increasing interest in climate issues and, more precisely, in evaluating the consequences of climate change on tourism, some literature on tourism demand modelling has integrated climate and weather factors into the estimation of tourism demand. Hence, consumers are assumed to reveal their climate preferences through their purchasing habits. Once their climate preferences are known and, assuming that the remaining variables are held constant, it is possible to project future trends through projected climate conditions. Note that, with this approach, the analysis focuses on the tourists rather than the physical conditions. Within the framework of tourism demand modelling, three main perspectives have been adopted: time series analysis, discrete choice models, and aggregate tourism models.
4.1. Time series analysis
Within the context of time series analysis, it is preferable to talk about weather (short-term atmospheric conditions) rather than climate (a region's mean atmospheric conditions) because, with time series, the most popular approach is to attempt to capture some kind of short-term relationship between tourism demand and an extreme weather event. Thus, Subak et al. (2000) assess the tourism impacts of the unusually hot summer of 1995 and the warm period from November 1994 through to October 1995 in the UK, showing that the tourism sector displayed clear differences in its response to hot summer and warm winter anomalies. Agnew and Palutikof (2006) explore the sensitivity of UK tourism to weather conditions using monthly data for domestic tourism and annual data for trips abroad, showing that outbound tourist flows are responsive to the previous year's weather variability, whereas domestic tourism is responsive to variability within the year of the trip. Using the unusually warm year of 1995 in the UK, the potential impact of climate change is evaluated, suggesting that the generally warmer drier conditions of 1995 benefited the UK domestic tourist industry although the previous year's wetter and cloudier-than-average conditions seemed to encourage more trips abroad.
Taking a more general framework and using a monthly time series model, it is suggested that, on the one hand, the cyclical-trend component can be captured through an ARIMA model (Rosselló, Riera, & Cardenas, 2011 ), even including prices and other economic determinants (Álvarez and Rosselló, 2010, Rosselló, 2011 ). On the other hand, because meteorological variables can display a high variability and they are not present in the long run, it is hypothesized that they affect the short run of time series and consequently cannot be captured though ARIMA or economic factors, remaining in the error term. Thus the hypothesis to be tested is whether extreme short-term weather episodes are related to this residual term. Analytically, the problem can be summarized in terms of a Transfer Function Model: (2) ϕ p(L)Y t=θ p(L)a t+φ b(L)d t where Yt is the number of tourism flows per month t; at is the innovation or moving average term; dt is the weather variable (or set of weather variables) that could influence the number of tourism flows; φp(L) and φp(L) are the lag operator polynomials for both Yt and at respectively, capturing the cyclical-trend component (the long-term component) of Yt, as is common practice in ARIMA modelling; and θp(L) is the lag operator polynomial (or transfer function) for the variables determining the weather, thus assuming that some lag between the observation of the weather variables and tourist flow data occurs.
By estimating Equation (2), intra-sample values can be predicted and compared with simulated predictions of the dt variables under different scenarios of climate change. For instance, using the transfer function methodology, Rosselló et al. (2011) found a significant relationship between British tourists abroad and different British weather variables, such as temperature, heat waves, air frost days and sunshine duration. Using different simulations of average temperature warming, they found that a 1 °C rise in the UK's average temperature will lead to a 1.73% annual decrease in British outbound flows, a percentage that is not uniform throughout the year, given the expected stronger impact during the wintertime (2.1% in December versus 1.33% in May). Again, this result suggests the presence of non-linear relationships between temperature and tourist flows.
Recent literature has been dominated by the use of more complex structures. Kulendran and Dwyer (2012) use the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity modelling approach to identify the relationship between climate variables such as maximum temperatures, relative humidity, sunshine hours and seasonal variations, defined as the repetitive and predictable movement around the trend line in holiday tourism demand within the context of seasonal variations in holiday tourism demand to Australia. Otero-Giráldez, Álvarez-Díaz, and González-Gómez (2012) also found there to be a significant positive connection between the North Atlantic Oscillation – as a meteorological indicator – and tourism demand in Galicia (Spain) using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model. Goh (2012) built an Error Correction Model for tourism demand which also explores the presence of structural changes in estimations using the TCI as a determining variable, showing that the climate index has a significant positive relationship for all the tourism demand series under analysis.
To summarize, analyses of the relationship between climate (or weather) and tourism, using time series models, have demonstrated a current, real relationship between tourism and climatology. Like the TCI, one of the main purposes of using time series is to analyse seasonality. However, it should be noted that, within this framework, only short-term relationships can be captured, despite long-term climate change issues.
4.2. Discrete choice modelling
Within the framework of revealed preferences, a second approach is to use Discrete Choice Models. In this context, the relevant question is why people choose a particular destination, and the theoretical background can be found in Lancaster (1966), where the proposed source of utility are the characteristics of commodities and services and not commodities or services in themselves. Tourism choices are considered to be a process of both quantitative and qualitative consumption. The quantitative unit of tourism consumption can be represented by the number of days' stay, the number of visits etc. The qualitative unit of tourism consumption is represented by the bundle of characteristics provided by destinations. Different destinations provide different bundles of characteristics in the form of heterogeneous tourism goods. Attractions are characteristics whose amount will depend on the destination's climate, natural and historical attributes, and on other features. Taking the utility theory into account within the context of tourism decisions, as formally described for the first time in Morley (1992), a new framework is introduced that allows for the consideration of different perspectives of tourism decisions, together with a larger set of explanatory variables. Analytically, the utility Uni that a tourist n derives from choosing to visit destination i is assumed to take the following form: (3) ɛ U n i=β n ′ x n i+ɛ n i where β n ′ x n i is the deterministic portion of the received utility if destination i is visited. Therefore xni are the observed attributes that characterize the alternatives open to tourists and βn is the vector of estimated coefficients for tourist n, representing his/her tastes. Lastly, the error term ɛni captures the variation in preferences among the population of tourists. As individuals are assumed to visit the destination yielding the greatest utility, the probability πni of them choosing the i-th alternative is: (4) ɛ ɛ π n i=Pr(β n ′ x n i+ɛ n i>β n ′ x n j+ɛ n j)∀ j ≠ i
Thus individuals or households with exactly the same socioeconomic and demographic characteristics might choose very different destinations. However, over and above the consideration of the utility theory, through the use of random utility models it is generally recognized that tourists have different tastes and that choosing a final destination is not an independent decision, but the final decision of a set of choices. In this sense, it is argued that once tourists have decided to go on holiday and have established a budget and mode of transport, they choose a destination conditional upon their preferences and the attributes characterizing the alternatives in the choice set (Eugenio-Martín, 2003 ).
This framework for modelling tourism demand from a microeconomic perspective has become of interest to different tourism stakeholders, such as tourism marketing analysts, because of its high potential for identifying the determinants of destination choice decisions. It is important to note that choosing a destination is considered to be one of the most complex stages in the decision process by tourists, with a wide number of variables (dependent on the aim of the study) that are likely to influence such decisions (Marcussen, 2011 ).
Within the context of climate change and tourism, using a Discrete Choice Model for European households, Eugenio-Martín and Campos-Soria (2010) focus their analysis on the relationship between climate in the home area and the choice of taking a holiday in the tourist's home region or abroad, showing that the climate in the home region is a strong determinant of holiday destination choices. They show that residents in regions with better climate indexes have a higher probability of domestic travel and a lower probability of travelling abroad, while residents of colder regions tend to travel abroad more often than residents of warmer ones.
By estimating the βn vector in Equation (4), they project how individuals' choices change when climatic input for Europe changes, evaluating the probability of foreign and/or domestic travel. Thus, under a scenario of climate change, a relatively weak relationship is found when an evaluation of both foreign and domestic travel is considered. However, it seems that a rise in temperature increases the likelihood of domestic travel and lowers the likelihood of foreign travel, a result that was also obtained with time series.
Using the same methodology, Bujosa and Rosselló (2013) investigate the impact of climate change on destination choice decisions within a context of domestic summer coastal tourism in Spain. Once the destinations have been characterized in terms of the travel cost and coastal ‘attractors’ (temperature and beach-related attributes), the observed pattern of interprovincial domestic trips is modelled, showing trade-offs between temperature and attractiveness in the likelihood of a particular destination being chosen. Using A1FI and B1 climate change scenarios (IPCC, 2000 ), they show that Spain's colder northern provinces would benefit from rising temperatures, while provinces in the south would experience a decrease in the frequency of trips. In this application, it is important to emphasize the use of a squared term for temperature, thus providing an estimation of maximum or minimum comfort temperatures, and to highlight the non-linear relationship between tourism and climate.
The use of discrete choice models to evaluate the effects of climate change on tourism is a recent phenomenon and assumptions about the utility function should be more deeply investigated. For example, when the sum of individual utilities is used, tourists are assumed to be risk neutral, a hypothesis that can sometimes be hard to justify within the framework of tourism choices.
4.3. Aggregate tourism demand models
Aggregate tourism demand modelling continues to be a popular issue in tourism literature. Reviews by Lim, 1999, Li et al., 2005 and Song and Li (2008) show that tourism demand estimations mainly focus on time series models, thus including variables with significant short-term variability, such as prices and income, while neglecting structural determinants, such as climate, which are expected to be captured by the constant term.
However, with the growing interest in climate issues, a set of aggregate tourism demand models have emerged that focus on climate variables. Madison's pioneering study (2001) presents a cross-sectional model of destinations chosen by British tourists, using classic price determinants of tourism demand and incorporating climate variables in terms of attractors. The model's estimation allows the trade-off between climate and holiday expenditure to be quantified and, through the introduction of non-linear effects (through a 4th order polynomial), the ‘optimal’ climate for generating British tourism is identified. The findings are used to predict the impact of several climate change scenarios on different tourist destinations. In a similar way, using aggregate data and a regression analysis, Lise and Tol (2002) find optimal temperatures at travel destinations for different tourists and tourist activities, showing that OECD tourists prefer an average temperature for the hottest month of the year of 21 °C, indicating that, in a scenario of gradual warming, tourists will spend their holidays in different places than their current ones. Taking a global perspective, Hamilton et al., 2005a, Hamilton et al., 2005b) present what is known as the Hamburg Tourism Model (HTM), consisting of the estimation of two equations for international tourist departures and arrivals for a specific year. Analytically: (5) ln A d=α 0+α 1 G d+α 2 T d+α 3 T d 2+α 4 C d+α 5 ln Y d (6) ln D O R P O R=β 0+β 1 T O R+β 2 T O R 2+β 3 B O R+β 4 Y O R+β 5 ln G O R where A refers to the total number of arrivals in country d; D is the total number of departures from country OR; P is the population in thousands; G is the surface area in squared kilometres; T is the country's mean yearly temperature for the period 1961–1990 in degrees centigrade; C is the length of the coastline in kilometres; Y is the country's per-capita income; B is the number of countries bordering a particular country; and αi and βj are parameters to be estimated econometrically.
Hamilton et al., 2005a, Hamilton et al., 2005b use the HTM to analyse how climate change alters the relative appeal of countries, studying the redistribution of tourist arrivals and departures due to changes in population, per-capita income and climate change. The results show that in the medium to long term tourism will grow in absolute terms although this increase will be smaller than population and income changes and it will not be homogeneously distributed, with a higher growth for colder countries and lower one for warmer ones. With climate change, the currently predominant group of international tourists – sun and sand lovers from Western Europe – would also stay closer to home, implying a relatively small drop in total international tourist numbers and the total distance travelled. However, the authors stress that changes induced by climate change are generally much smaller than those resulting from population and economic growth.
As an aggregate model, the HTM has been criticized and extended in many ways, although the methodology's improvement has often implied a loss of generalization. Bigano, Hamilton, & Tol (2006) extend the HTM by considering substitution between domestic and international tourism, while also analysing tourist expenditure. Nonetheless, taking into account these two issues implies limiting the sample countries included in the model due to data restrictions, and only 45 countries of origin travelling to 200 destination countries are considered. Hamilton and Tol (2007) assess the impact of climate change on tourism from a regional perspective in Germany, the UK and Ireland, based on different scenarios of climate change for the regions under analysis. They suggest that non-uniform warming within countries might lead to tourist behaviour patterns that are regionally different, pointing to the need to develop HTM methods on a lower scale than a national one.
Recent updates of the HTM can be found in Rosselló and Santana (2012) and Tol and Walsh (2012), who use bilateral tourism flows and consider the nature of the data's dynamics by testing changes in tourism preferences linked to climate conditions. Despite the relatively high level of complexity of the specification and estimation process, using specific projected climatic, population and economic data related to A2, B1 and B2 scenarios, Rosselló and Santana (2012) forecast tourist arrivals for 2080, finding similar results to previous works and thus providing more evidence that climate change would imply a weakening of the currently predominant international tourism flow from North to South.
5. Conclusions
Many tourist destinations around the world are contemplating how they would be affected by climate change, with studies of tourism demand being one of the main focuses of attention. Despite the uncertainties and complexity of evaluating expected tourism demand responses as a result of climate change, research into this issue has just started to appear the scientific literature, recognising the complex nature of tourism demand decisions by isolating the effect of climate on tourism. This paper summarizes some of the methodologies used in tourism literature that seek to quantitatively evaluate the effect of climate change on tourism and to extrapolate this relationship into the future. The methodologies are grouped into three categories: studies based on a consideration of physical changes, the use of climate indexes to analyse tourism attractiveness, and tourism demand modelling based on revealed preferences.
Correlations can be made between current tourism demand patterns and both physical attributes and climate indexes, suggesting that climate performs well as a predictor of tourist arrivals. Nonetheless, in tourism demand models, the inclusion of temperature alone as a determining climatic variable has tended to prevail. Although many papers that use demand models have tried to include other variables as well as temperature, the results have shown that, due to a problem of multicollinearity (a correlation between temperature and other climatic variables) or the irrelevance of certain other climatic variables, temperature has been the most decisive influential climatic variable. Most recent studies have also tried to incorporate climate indexes into tourism demand models.
One of the common results of the different methodologies is that climate change is a negative outcome for warm destinations whatever the methodology that is used. The search for a more comfortable climate is found to be one of the main motivations determining global tourism flows and, as such, climate change will imply a loss of attractiveness for traditional winter resorts and traditional warmer destinations worldwide. Conversely, it seems that climate change will, increase domestic trips, especially in colder countries, and it could exert a positive influence on seasonality by increasing the attraction of certain destinations during winter months. This is what revealed preference methods show. What is more, this would be an opportunity for the industry to attract the growing short-break segment during non-summer months by taking advantage of better winter climate conditions. Whatever the case, further research is required. Another finding common to the different approaches is the non-linear relationship that apparently exists between tourism and climate. More precisely, an inverted u-shape has been found in the relationship between temperature and tourism demand using different methodological perspectives, thus revealing the existence of optimal climatic conditions for tourism.
Nevertheless, some questions remain. Will some destinations be too hot for visitors? The inverted u-shape can be explained by both the existence of a turning point (the destination will be too hot), an issue that is supported by tourism climate indexes, and simply by an increase in competitors, a result mainly supported by tourism demand models. Which tourist segments will be most sensitive to climate change? What will the induced effects of climate change be on biodiversity loss, dry episodes and changes to beaches ?
Given the aim of this paper, the research findings were limited to studies that report quantitative evidence of the relationship between tourism and climate in order to extrapolate this relationship to different climate change scenarios. Other non-empirical studies, however, may be applicable insofar as they provide relevant theories that can contribute to a broader knowledge of future tourism responses to climate change. This paper does not attempt to gather the findings of all relevant empirical studies, given certain constraints, such as the possible existence of a number of unpublished studies. Nevertheless, a reasonably comprehensive series of studies was analysed and the resulting extensive set of findings is fairly representative.
The results of this paper could be a useful guide for other researchers and practitioners interested in carrying out similar studies of how to assess the effects of climate change on tourism. The most suitable approach, however, will depend on the circumstances and objectives of the said study. It would be wrong to blindly adopt any one approach without first assessing its limitations and assumptions and, in this sense, this paper could serve as a good reference tool.

1. How does climate impact tourism?
Many types of tourism are weather dependent and by extension, climate dependent. It is therefore very likely that climate change will affect your business area sooner or later. Climate change can reduce snow cover, increase and prolong heat waves or change the patterns of annual rainfall for example. Climate change is a relatively slow process, so perhaps in your region, the changes are not so obvious in the short run; yet, in that case, the effects may be strong in neighboring or competing areas and thereby still influence your business area.
The effects of climate change on your business area can be manifold, and be both negative and positive. If you are unprepared your organization may suffer from the negative effects, while being unable to benefit from possible positive effects. Next to climate change also climate variability (e.g. variably cold and tepid winters) is important for many types of tourism, while climate change can make the variability more extreme.
For many countries and regions in Europe studies have already been conducted, e.g. regarding heat waves, reduction of snow cover, extreme rainfall, drought, etc. You can inquire with your municipality, region, or sector organization what kind of information is already available.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can find out about how climate change affects tourism.

First, there's an article from TravelPulse about how climate change is affecting tourism. It mentions that tourism relies heavily on a stable climate, and more extreme weather can disrupt travel plans and deter tourists. It gives examples like the lack of snow in California's Lake Tahoe affecting ski resorts and potentially making some ski industries unsustainable. It also talks about how warmer temperatures in tropical regions might not be as appealing if nearby destinations become more comfortable due to climate change.

Another article from WorldAtlas goes into more detail about different types of tourism and how they're affected. It talks about coastal and island destinations being vulnerable to sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and more frequent and intense storms. For mountain and winter tourism, it mentions that warmer temperatures could shorten winter seasons and reduce snow cover, which is bad for skiing, but might make summer activities more appealing. Forest and biodiversity tourism could be impacted by changes in species ranges and increased forest fires. Safari destinations might face more flooding, which can disrupt access to wildlife areas. Ocean and sea life tourism, like diving, could be affected by coral bleaching and ocean acidification.

There's also a piece from Tourism Impacts that discusses both the environmental impacts of tourism and how tourism contributes to climate change. It mentions that tourism is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions, largely due to transportation. So, there's a feedback loop where tourism contributes to climate change, which in turn affects tourism destinations.

Another scholarly article from ScienceDirect talks about different methods to evaluate the effects of climate change on tourism. It discusses using climate indexes like the Tourism Climate Index (TCI) to assess the attractiveness of destinations based on climate factors. The article suggests that northern European countries might become more attractive for summer tourism as temperatures rise, while traditionally warmer destinations might become too hot during summer months but potentially more pleasant in other seasons.

Lastly, there's a FAQ from EU-MACS about how climate impacts tourism. It confirms that many types of tourism are weather-dependent and thus sensitive to climate change. It advises that businesses should be prepared to adapt to both negative and positive impacts of climate change in their areas.

So, summarizing all this information, climate change affects tourism in several ways:

1. **Coastal and Island Destinations:** Sea-level rise threatens beaches and infrastructure. Increased frequency and intensity of storms can damage properties and disrupt travel.

2. **Mountain and Winter Tourism:** Warmer temperatures reduce snow cover, shortening ski seasons and potentially making some resorts unviable. However, warmer summers could attract more tourists to these areas for different activities.

3. **Forest and Biodiversity Tourism:** Changes in temperature and precipitation can alter ecosystems, leading to shifts in species distributions and increased risks of forest fires, which can degrade natural attractions.

4. **Safari Destinations:** More extreme weather events like floods can disrupt operations and affect wildlife viewing experiences.

5. **Ocean and Sea Life Tourism:** Coral bleaching and ocean acidification threaten marine life, impacting activities like diving and snorkeling.

6. **General Impacts:** Changes in temperature can make some destinations too hot or too cold for comfort, affecting visitor numbers. Seasonality may shift, with some destinations becoming more attractive in off-peak seasons.

Additionally, tourism itself contributes to climate change through emissions from transportation, particularly air travel, which creates a feedback loop where tourism exacerbates the very problem that threatens its own existence.

It seems clear that tourism industries need to adapt to these changes, possibly by diversifying offerings, investing in sustainability, and preparing for more variable weather conditions. Destinations that fail to adapt may see a decline in tourism, while those that can mitigate the impacts and capitalize on new opportunities may thrive.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change affects tourism through various channels including sea-level rise impacting coastal destinations, reduced snow cover affecting winter sports, altered ecosystems threatening biodiversity tourism, and more extreme weather events disrupting operations. Simultaneously, tourism contributes to climate change via emissions from transportation, creating a feedback loop that necessitates adaptive strategies for sustainability.}} \]
