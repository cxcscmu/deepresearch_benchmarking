So I have this question: "How did Louis Pasteur change the world?" I know that Louis Pasteur was a French scientist, but I'm not exactly sure about all the ways he impacted the world. I think I need to do some research to get a better understanding.

First, I should probably start by finding out who Louis Pasteur was and what he's famous for. I remember something about pasteurization, but I'm not sure if that's his only contribution. There might be more to his work that had a significant impact on the world.

Let me consider starting with a general search about Louis Pasteur to get an overview of his life and achievements. Maybe look for reputable sources like educational websites or Encyclopedia Britannica.

Alternatively, I could look for specific contributions he made to science and society. For example, I think he worked in the field of microbiology and developed vaccines. Maybe I should search for "Louis Pasteur contributions to science" or "Impact of Louis Pasteur on medicine."

Wait, I also recall that he worked on rabies vaccine. Was he the first one to develop a vaccine for rabies? That must have been a significant achievement in medical history.

Perhaps I should make a list of his key accomplishments and then think about how each of them changed the world. For instance:

1. Pasteurization: This process kills bacteria in foods and drinks, making them safer to consume. This must have reduced the spread of diseases through contaminated food and milk.

2. Germ theory: Pasteur is often credited with developing the germ theory of disease, which suggests that many diseases are caused by microorganisms. This was a groundbreaking idea that revolutionized medicine and public health.

3. Vaccines: He developed vaccines for several diseases, including rabies and anthrax. Vaccination has saved countless lives and is one of the most important public health measures.

4. Fermentation: Pasteur studied fermentation in wine and beer and showed that it was caused by living organisms. This led to improvements in food production and preservation.

I need to verify these points and see how each of them specifically changed the world. Maybe I should look for statistics on how pasteurization has reduced disease outbreaks or how vaccines have eradicated certain diseases.

Let me start by searching for information on pasteurization. I can look for articles or reports that discuss its impact on public health.

Pasteurization
As mass production and distribution of milk took off back in the 1800s, we started to realize that people were becoming sick from milkborne outbreaks (crazy stuff like tuberculosis, yikes!). In 1864, Louis Pasteur developed a method of killing harmful bacteria and extending the shelf life of commonly consumed beverages. While his original intent for pasteurization was to be used for more social cocktails like beer and wine, it was discovered as being equally as helpful with the outbreaks associated with milk. This process was named “pasteurization” after its brilliant designer. Pasteurization involves heating liquids at high temperatures for short amounts of time. Pasteurization kills harmful microbes in milk without affecting the taste or nutritional value (sterilization= all bacteria are destroyed).
Excerpt taken from the Conference for Food Protection addressing the Senate:
“Each year, foodborne diseases sicken an estimated 48 million Americans, killing 3,000 of them. Many of these deaths are preventable. Relying on sound science and proven safety interventions- such as pasteurization- is one way to prevent illness. Prior to pasteurization, milk was a common source of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, Q fever, diphtheria, severe streptococcal infections, typhoid fever, and other foodborne illnesses. The incidence of disease outbreaks associated with milk has fallen dramatically since pasteurization of milk became widespread. The number of milk-related outbreaks has dropped from nearly 25 percent of all disease outbreaks due to contaminated food and water in 1938 to less than 1 percent of reported outbreaks today. Importantly, of that 1 percent, an overwhelming majority- 70 percent- of outbreaks are linked to raw milk.”
How can milk become contaminated? Let’s go through a Mooo-arvelous thought train:
Think about how dirty your pet can get. Regardless of how clean you keep Fido, he is still sometimes tracks dirt and who knows what else into the house. Now consider a cow (OR a goat)- not the most sanitary animal you can think of (Sorry Bessie!). No matter what extraordinary measures a dairy farmer takes to keep cows clean, there will still be germs on and around the cow. Plus, throw in the fact that cows live on a farm (again, not the shining example of sanitary) and add humans into the mix (a whole other story!). Some examples of ways milk becomes contaminated include*:
Cow feces coming into contact with the milk (it’s all pretty close down there!)
Infection of the cow’s udder (A.K.A. mastitis)
Bacteria that live on the cows skin- don’t worry Bessie, we all have it
Farming environment (dirt, feed, equipment)
Insects, rodents and other disease carrying animals on the farm
Humans (contamination from clothing, improper handwashing, etc.)
Drugs used to treat sick cows
*All of these apply regardless of the milking animal. Goat milk has the same potential for contamination as cow’s milk!
So to reduce the risk of contaminants in your cup, we pasteurize. There are two very common ways to pasteurize milk: 1) batch (commonly known as ‘vat’) pasteurization and 2) continuous flow pasteurization. Batch pasteurization involves heating every particle of milk in a large tank or vat to a minimum of 145° F for a minimum of 30 minutes.
Examples of continuous flow pasteurization are:
High-Temperature, Short-Time (HSTS) pasteurization: requires that the milk be held at a minimum of 161°F for 15 seconds.
Ultra-High Temperature (UHT) pasteurization: uses much higher temperatures varying from 275-302°F for 4-15 seconds.
Both HSTS and UHT use similar methods of forcing raw milk through metal pipes and thin metal plates. The metal is heated on the outside, which heats the flowing milk to the appropriate temperature. This system allows for the appropriate time for heat control before it pushes the milk to the rapid cooling area of the pasteurizer. The expedited cooling of the milk to a temperature below 41°F helps to prevent further bacterial growth (the stuff responsible for spoilage) that may still be present and can thrive at middle temperatures (this is why you must keep your milk in the refrigerator!). The cold milk is then bottled or stored in a sealed container to ensure no contaminates enter after the pasteurization process. To become an “expert” on the process of pasteurization, take a look at the FDA’s mini-online course.
The pasteurization of milk has saved countless lives and even more cartons of milk! Bacteria not only causes milk to sour but certain types of bacteria also cause illness, so minimizing bacteria in milk is important. Drinking ONLY pasteurized milk from an approved source is the only way of ensuring the safety of your milk and protecting you and your family.

Pasteurization is hugely important and a widely used as a tool to improve food safety, most notably in milk, egg products, canned goods, and many others. As other answers have noted, it reduces or eliminates the microbial load in foods that might otherwise harbor dangerous pathogens.
Pasteurization serves no purpose in food that is already essentially free of pathogens or spoilage organisms.

If by good bacteria you mean those that don’t cause disease, I think the answer is mostly yes it does. However, even “good” bacteria can cause milk to spoil more quickly.
Of course the bacteria in milk can also be cultured intentionally to make fermented foods such as yoghurt and cheese, though usually specific cultures are added deliberately to get the desired result.

Why is the pasteurization of milk preferred over sterilization?
Because while the 2 of them is them have the same goal, sterilization require processes making the milk tasting not like milk.
Sterilization kill microbes and spores. Pasteurization kill microbes, but leaves spores alive.
Pasteurization heating the milk at certain temperature, then keep it there till the living, working microbes die.
The higher the temperature, the less time required to complete pasteurization, but at higher temperature some taste and texture changes could occur. This cause the difference in the taste of raw, old pasteurized and UHT milk.
Difference Between Sterilization and Pasteurization
Sterilization vs Pasteurization Some of the microorganisms are useful and even necessary for everyday life. However, there are a huge number of microorganisms that can cause disease or damage to useful resources. Different methods are used in order to kill harmful microorganisms. The sterilization is a process that destroys all microorganisms and their spores, while the pasteurization destroys only the vegetative forms of the bacteria and the spores survive. What is Sterilization? Sterilization is a destruction of all microorganisms and their spores. The process kills pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms, vegetative and spore forms, viruses. Sterilization can be physical or chemical. Physical sterilization is: Sterilization with heat; Cold sterilization. Sterilization with heat is dry or wet. The first one uses hot air (combustion), and the second one – water vapor (boiling). With the temperature rise above the critical for the microorganisms, they quickly die. The critical threshold varies between the groups of micro-organisms. The vegetative forms of the bacteria are poorly resistant to heat, the viruses and molds are with an intermediate resistance, and the spores are the most resistant. The mechanism of action of the sterilization with heat is generally limited to irreversible changes in proteins in the cytoplasm (coagulation) and the inactivation of some important enzymes. Cold physical sterilization is done with bacterial filters or with radiation. The radiation used for sterilization can be: Non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation; Ultrasound; Ionizing rays. Practical application for sterilization have gamma rays from natural radioactive substances and high-speed electrons from high-voltage apparatus. They have a strong penetrating ability and the sterilized materials have a long shelf life. Chemical sterilization is: Gas sterilization using chemical agents; Cold chemical sterilization. Chemical sterilization can be done with: Halogen-containing preparations (containing chlorine or iodine); Phenol derivatives; Aldehydes; Alcohols; Oxidants; Surfactants; Guanidine compounds; Acids and bases; Combined preparations, etc. The chemical compounds used for sterilization have different mechanisms of action, advantages, and disadvantages. For example, chlorine-containing compounds release chlorine, which leads to the formation of toxic chloramines in the bacterial cytoplasm. They have a wide spectrum of action and a strong bactericidal effect, but a lower virucidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal and sporicidal effect. They emit a severe irritating odor and irritate the skin and mucous membranes in contacts. Aldehydes alkylate cellular proteins and nucleic acids of the microorganisms. They have bactericidal, sporicidal, fungicidal, and virucidal action. Aldehydes are toxic and irritating to the skin, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, eyes, and have a carcinogenic effect (formaldehyde). They have a strong irritating smell and high allergenic potentia

Pasteurized milk in Japan
A Chicago Department of Health poster explains home pasteurization to mothers
Pasteurization or pasteurisation is a process in which packaged and non-packaged foods (such as milk and fruit juices) are treated with mild heat, usually to less than 100 °C (212 °F), to eliminate pathogens and extend shelf life. 
The process is intended to destroy or deactivate organisms and enzymes that contribute to spoilage or risk of disease, including vegetative bacteria, but not bacterial spores.[1] [2]
The process was named after the French microbiologist, Louis Pasteur, whose research in the 1860s demonstrated that thermal processing would deactivate unwanted microorganisms in wine.[2] [3] Spoilage enzymes are also inactivated during pasteurization. Today, pasteurization is used widely in the dairy industry and other food processing industries to achieve food preservation and food safety.[3]
By the year 1999, most liquid products were heat treated in a continuous system where heat can be applied using a plate heat exchanger or the direct or indirect use of hot water and steam. Due to the mild heat, there are minor changes to the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of the treated foods. [4] Pascalization or high pressure processing (HPP) and pulsed electric field (PEF) are non-thermal processes that are also used to pasteurize foods. [1]

History[edit]
Louis Pasteur's pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of the germ theory of disease.
The process of heating wine for preservation purposes has been known in China since AD 1117, and was documented in Japan in the diary Tamonin-nikki, written by a series of monks between 1478 and 1618. [5]
Much later, in 1768, research performed by Italian priest and scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani proved a product could be made "sterile" after thermal processing. Spallanzani boiled meat broth for one hour, sealed the container immediately after boiling, and noticed that the broth did not spoil and was free from microorganisms. [2] [6] In 1795, a Parisian chef and confectioner named Nicolas Appert began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups. He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water. [7] In that same year, the French military offered a cash prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food. After some 14 or 15 years of experimenting, Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. [8] Later that year, Appert published L'Art de conserver les substances animales et végétales (" The Art of Preserving Animal and Vegetable Substances "). This was the first cookbook of its kind on modern food preservation methods. [9] [10]
La Maison Appert (English: The House of Appert ), in the town of Massy, near Paris, became the first food-bottling factory in the world, [7] preserving a variety of foods in sealed bottles. Appert's method was to fill thick, large-mouthed glass bottles with produce of every description, ranging from beef and fowl to eggs, milk and prepared dishes. He left air space at the top of the bottle, and the cork would then be sealed firmly in the jar by using a vise. The bottle was then wrapped in canvas to protect it while it was dunked into boiling water and then boiled for as much time as Appert deemed appropriate for cooking the contents thoroughly. Appert patented his method, sometimes called appertisation in his honor. [11]
Appert's method was so simple and workable that it quickly became widespread. In 1810, British inventor and merchant Peter Durand, also of French origin, patented his own method, but this time in a tin can, so creating the modern-day process of canning foods. In 1812, Englishmen Bryan Donkin and John Hall purchased both patents and began producing preserves. Just a decade later, Appert's method of canning had made its way to America. [12][full citation needed] Tin can production was not common until the beginning of the 20th century, partly because a hammer and chisel were needed to open cans until the invention of a can opener by Robert Yeates in 1855. [7]
A less aggressive method was developed by French chemist Louis Pasteur during an 1864 [13] summer holiday in Arbois. To remedy the frequent acidity of the local aged wines, he found out experimentally that it is sufficient to heat a young wine to only about 50–60 °C (122–140 °F) for a short time to kill the microbes, and that the wine could subsequently be aged without sacrificing the final quality. [13] In honour of Pasteur, this process is known as "pasteurization". [2] [14] Pasteurization was originally used as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring, [15] and it would be many years before milk was pasteurized.[citation needed] In the United States in the 1870s, before milk was regulated, it was common for milk to contain substances intended to mask spoilage. [16]
Milk[edit]
Further information: Raw milk
180 kilograms (400 lb) of milk in a cheese vat
Milk is an excellent medium for microbial growth, [17] and when it is stored at ambient temperature bacteria and other pathogens soon proliferate. [18] The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source, making it one of the world's most dangerous food products. [19] [20] Diseases prevented by pasteurization can include tuberculosis, brucellosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and Q-fever; it also kills the harmful bacteria Salmonella, Listeria, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157:H7,[21] [22] among others.
Prior to industrialization, dairy cows were kept in urban areas to limit the time between milk production and consumption, hence the risk of disease transmission via raw milk was reduced. [23] As urban densities increased and supply chains lengthened to the distance from country to city, raw milk (often days old) became recognized as a source of disease. For example, between 1912 and 1937, some 65,000 people died of tuberculosis contracted from consuming milk in England and Wales alone. [24] Because tuberculosis has a long incubation period in humans, it was difficult to link unpasteurized milk consumption with the disease. [25] In 1892, chemist Ernst Lederle experimentally inoculated milk from tuberculosis-diseased cows into guinea pigs, which caused them to develop the disease. [26] In 1910, Lederle, then in the role of Commissioner of Health, introduced mandatory pasteurization of milk in New York City.[26]
Developed countries adopted milk pasteurization to prevent such disease and loss of life, and as a result milk is now considered a safer food. [27] A traditional form of pasteurization by scalding and straining of cream to increase the keeping qualities of butter was practiced in Great Britain in the 18th century and was introduced to Boston in the British Colonies by 1773, [28] although it was not widely practiced in the United States for the next 20 years. Pasteurization of milk was suggested by Franz von Soxhlet in 1886. [29] In the early 20th century, Milton Joseph Rosenau established the standards – i.e. low-temperature, slow heating at 60 °C (140 °F) for 20 minutes – for the pasteurization of milk [30] [31] while at the United States Marine Hospital Service, notably in his publication of The Milk Question (1912). [32] States in the U.S. soon began enacting mandatory dairy pasteurization laws, with the first in 1947, and in 1973 the U.S. federal government required pasteurization of milk used in any interstate commerce. [33]
The shelf life of refrigerated pasteurized milk is greater than that of raw milk. For example, high-temperature, short-time (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging ), it can even be stored non-refrigerated for up to 9 months. [34]
According to the Centers for Disease Control, between 1998 and 2011, 79% of dairy-related disease outbreaks in the United States were due to raw milk or cheese products. [35] They report 148 outbreaks and 2,384 illnesses (with 284 requiring hospitalization), as well as two deaths due to raw milk or cheese products during the same time period. [35]
Medical equipment[edit]
Medical equipment, notably respiratory and anesthesia equipment, is often disinfected using hot water, as an alternative to chemical disinfection. The temperature is raised to 70 °C (158 °F) for 30 minutes. [36]
Pasteurization process[edit]
General overview of the pasteurization process. The milk starts at the left and enters the piping with functioning enzymes that, when heat-treated, become denatured and stop the enzymes from functioning. This helps to stop pathogen growth by stopping the functionality of the cell. The cooling process helps stop the milk from undergoing the Maillard reaction and caramelization. The pasteurization process also has the ability to heat the cells to the point that they burst from pressure build-up.
Pasteurization is a mild heat treatment of liquid foods (both packaged and unpackaged) where products are typically heated to below 100 °C. The heat treatment and cooling process are designed to inhibit a phase change of the product. The acidity of the food determines the parameters (time and temperature) of the heat treatment as well as the duration of shelf life. Parameters also take into account nutritional and sensory qualities that are sensitive to heat.
In acidic foods (pH <4.6), such as fruit juice and beer, the heat treatments are designed to inactivate enzymes (pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase in fruit juices) and destroy spoilage microbes (yeast and lactobacillus ). Due to the low pH of acidic foods, pathogens are unable to grow. The shelf-life is thereby extended several weeks. In less acidic foods (pH >4.6), such as milk and liquid eggs, the heat treatments are designed to destroy pathogens and spoilage organisms (yeast and molds). Not all spoilage organisms are destroyed under pasteurization parameters, thus subsequent refrigeration is necessary. [1]
Equipment[edit]
Food can be pasteurized in two ways: either before or after being packaged into containers. When food is packaged in glass, hot water is used to lower the risk of thermal shock. Plastics and metals are also used to package foods, and these are generally pasteurized with steam or hot water since the risk of thermal shock is low. [1]
Most liquid foods are pasteurized using continuous systems that have a heating zone, hold tube, and cooling zone, after which the product is filled into the package. Plate heat exchangers are used for low- viscosity products such as animal milks, nut milks and juices. A plate heat exchanger is composed of many thin vertical stainless steel plates which separate the liquid from the heating or cooling medium. Scraped surface heat exchangers contain an inner rotating shaft in the tube, and serve to scrape highly viscous material which might accumulate on the wall of the tube. [37]
Shell or tube heat exchangers are designed for the pasteurization of foods that are non-Newtonian fluids, such as dairy products, tomato ketchup and baby foods. A tube heat exchanger is made up of concentric stainless steel tubes. Food passes through the inner tube while the heating/cooling medium is circulated through the outer or inner tube.
The benefits of using a heat exchanger to pasteurize non-packaged foods versus pasteurizing foods in containers are:
Heat exchangers provide uniform treatment, and there is greater flexibility with regards to the products which can be pasteurized on these plates
The process is more energy-efficient compared to pasteurizing foods in packaged containers [1]
Greater throughput
After being heated in a heat exchanger, the product flows through a hold tube for a set period of time to achieve the required treatment. If pasteurization temperature or time is not achieved, a flow diversion valve is utilized to divert under-processed product back to the raw product tank. [38] If the product is adequately processed, it is cooled in a heat exchanger, then filled.
High-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization, such as that used for milk (71.5 °C (160.7 °F) for 15 seconds) ensures safety of milk and provides a refrigerated shelf life of approximately two weeks. In ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pasteurization, milk is pasteurized at 135 °C (275 °F) for 1–2 seconds, which provides the same level of safety, but along with the packaging, extends shelf life to three months under refrigeration. [39]
Verification[edit]
Direct microbiological techniques are the ultimate measurement of pathogen contamination, but these are costly and time-consuming, which means that products have a reduced shelf-life by the time pasteurization is verified.
As a result of the unsuitability of microbiological techniques, milk pasteurization efficacy is typically monitored by checking for the presence of alkaline phosphatase, which is denatured by pasteurization. Destruction of alkaline phosphatase ensures the destruction of common milk pathogens. Therefore, the presence of alkaline phosphatase is an ideal indicator of pasteurization efficacy. [40] [41] For liquid eggs, the effectiveness of the heat treatment is measured by the residual activity of α-amylase.[1]
Efficacy against pathogenic bacteria[edit]
During the early 20th century, there was no robust knowledge of what time and temperature combinations would inactivate pathogenic bacteria in milk, and so a number of different pasteurization standards were in use. By 1943, both HTST pasteurization conditions of 72 °C (162 °F) for 15 seconds, as well as batch pasteurization conditions of 63 °C (145 °F) for 30 minutes, were confirmed by studies of the complete thermal death (as best as could be measured at that time) for a range of pathogenic bacteria in milk. [42] Complete inactivation of Coxiella burnetii (which was thought at the time to cause Q fever by oral ingestion of infected milk) [43] [44] as well as of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis)[45] were later demonstrated. For all practical purposes, these conditions were adequate for destroying almost all yeasts, molds, and common spoilage bacteria and also for ensuring adequate destruction of common pathogenic, heat-resistant organisms. However, the microbiological techniques used until the 1960s did not allow for the actual reduction of bacteria to be enumerated. Demonstration of the extent of inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by milk pasteurization came from a study of surviving bacteria in milk that was heat-treated after being deliberately spiked with high levels of the most heat-resistant strains of the most significant milk-borne pathogens. [46]
The mean log 10 reductions and temperatures of inactivation of the major milk-borne pathogens during a 15-second treatment are:
Staphylococcus aureus > 6.7 at 66.5 °C (151.7 °F)
Yersinia enterocolitica > 6.8 at 62.5 °C (144.5 °F)
pathogenic Escherichia coli > 6.8 at 65 °C (149 °F)
Cronobacter sakazakii > 6.7 at 67.5 °C (153.5 °F)
Listeria monocytogenes > 6.9 at 65.5 °C (149.9 °F)
Salmonella ser. Typhimurium > 6.9 at 61.5 °C (142.7 °F) [46]
(A log 10 reduction between 6 and 7 means that 1 bacterium out of 1 million (10 6) to 10 million (10 7) bacteria survive the treatment.)
The Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk notes that milk pasteurization is designed to achieve at least a 5 log 10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii.[47] The Code also notes that: "The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72 °C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63 °C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that "To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high". The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that use test tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger-scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization. [48]
As a precaution, modern HTST pasteurization processes must be designed with flow-rate restriction as well as divert valves which ensure that the milk is heated evenly and that no part of the milk is subject to a shorter time or a lower temperature. It is common for the temperatures to exceed 72 °C by 1.5 °C or 2 °C. [48]
Double pasteurization[edit]
Pasteurization is not sterilization and does not kill spores. "Double" pasteurization, which involves a secondary heating process, can extend shelf life by killing spores that have germinated. [49]
The acceptance of double pasteurization varies by jurisdiction. In places where it is allowed, milk is initially pasteurized when it is collected from the farm so it does not spoil before processing. Many countries prohibit the labelling of such milk as "pasteurized" but allow it to be marked "thermized", which refers to a lower-temperature process. [50]
Effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods[edit]
Because of its mild heat treatment, pasteurization increases the shelf-life by a few days or weeks. [1] However, this mild heat also means there are only minor changes to heat-labile vitamins in the foods. [4]
Milk[edit]
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, [51] it was found that pasteurization appeared to reduce concentrations of vitamins B12 and E, but it also increased concentrations of vitamin A. Apart from meta-analysis, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the effect of pasteurization on vitamins A, B12, and E based merely on consultation of the vast literature available. [51] Milk is not an important source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible. [52] [53] However, milk is considered an important source of vitamin A, [54] and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. [51] Results of meta-analyses reveal that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk is also not an important source of these vitamins. [54] [53] A significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations was found after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83 mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1 mg/day, [52] milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization does not appear to be a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.
Sensory effects[edit]
Pasteurization also has a small but measurable effect on the sensory attributes of the foods that are processed. [1] In fruit juices, pasteurization may result in loss of volatile aroma compounds. [4] Fruit juice products undergo a deaeration process prior to pasteurization that may be responsible for this loss. Deaeration also minimizes the loss of nutrients like vitamin C and carotene.[1] To prevent the decrease in quality resulting from the loss in volatile compounds, volatile recovery, though costly, can be utilized to produce higher-quality juice products. [4]
In regards to color, the pasteurization process does not have much effect on pigments such as chlorophylls, anthocyanins and carotenoids in plants and animal tissues. In fruit juices, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is the main enzyme responsible for causing browning and color changes. However, this enzyme is deactivated in the deaeration step prior to pasteurization with the removal of oxygen. [4]
In milk, the color difference between pasteurized and raw milk is related to the homogenization step that takes place prior to pasteurization. Before pasteurization milk is homogenized to emulsify its fat and water-soluble components, which results in the pasteurized milk having a whiter appearance compared to raw milk. [1] For vegetable products, color degradation is dependent on the temperature conditions and the duration of heating. [55]
Pasteurization may result in some textural loss as a result of enzymatic and non-enzymatic transformations in the structure of pectin if the processing temperatures are too high as a result. However, with mild heat treatment pasteurization, tissue softening in the vegetables that causes textural loss is not of concern as long as the temperature does not get above 80 °C (176 °F). [55]
Novel pasteurization methods[edit]
Other thermal and non-thermal processes have been developed to pasteurize foods as a way of reducing the effects on nutritional and sensory characteristics of foods and preventing degradation of heat-labile nutrients. Pascalization or high pressure processing (HPP), [1] [56] [57] pulsed electric field (PEF), [1] [56] [57] ionising radiation, high pressure homogenisation, UV decontamination, pulsed high intensity light, high intensity laser, pulsed white light, high power ultrasound, oscillating magnetic fields, high voltage arc discharge, and streamer plasma [56] [57] are examples of these non-thermal pasteurization methods that are currently commercially utilized.
Microwave volumetric heating (MVH) is the newest available pasteurization technology. It uses microwaves to heat liquids, suspensions, or semi-solids in a continuous flow. Because MVH delivers energy evenly and deeply into the whole body of a flowing product, it allows for gentler and shorter heating, so that almost all heat-sensitive substances in the milk are preserved. [58]
Low Temperature, Short Time (LTST) is a patented method that implies spraying droplets in a chamber heated below the usual pasteurization temperatures. It takes several thousandth of a second to treat liquid products, so the method is also known as the millisecond technology (MST). It significantly extends the shelf life of products (50+ days) when combined with HTST [59] without damaging the nutrients or flavor. LTST has been commercial since 2019. [60]

Achievements in Public Health, 1900-1999: Safer and Healthier Foods
During the early 20th century, contaminated food, milk, and water caused many foodborne
infections, including typhoid fever, tuberculosis, botulism, and scarlet fever. In 1906,
Upton Sinclair described in his novel The Jungle the unwholesome working environment in
the Chicago meat-packing industry and the unsanitary conditions under which food was
produced. Public awareness dramatically increased and led to the passage of the Pure Food
and Drug Act (1). Once the sources and characteristics of foodborne diseases were
identified--long before vaccines or antibiotics--they could be controlled by handwashing,
sanitation, refrigeration, pasteurization, and pesticide application. Healthier animal
care, feeding, and processing also improved food supply safety. In 1900, the incidence of
typhoid fever was approximately 100 per 100,000 population; by 1920, it had decreased to
33.8, and by 1950, to 1.7 (Figure 1 ). During the 1940s, studies of
autopsied muscle samples showed that 16% of persons in the United States had
trichinellosis; 300-400 cases were diagnosed every year, and 10-20 deaths occurred (2).
Since then, the rate of infection has declined markedly; from 1991 through 1996, three
deaths and an average of 38 cases per year were reported (3).
Nutritional sciences also were in their infancy at the start of the century. Unknown
was the concept that minerals and vitamins were necessary to prevent diseases caused by
dietary deficiencies. Recurring nutritional deficiency diseases, including rickets,
scurvy, beri-beri, and pellagra were thought to be infectious diseases. By 1900,
biochemists and physiologists had identified protein, fat, and carbohydrates as the basic
nutrients in food. By 1916, new data had led to the discovery that food contained
vitamins, and the lack of "vital amines" could cause disease. These scientific
discoveries and the resulting public health policies, such as food fortification programs,
led to substantial reductions in nutritional deficiency diseases during the first half of
the century. The focus of nutrition programs shifted in the second half of the century
from disease prevention to control of chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease
and obesity.
Food Safety
Perishable foods contain nutrients that pathogenic microorganisms require to reproduce.
Bacteria such as Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp., and Staphylococcus sp. can multiply quickly to sufficient numbers to cause illness. Prompt refrigeration
slows bacterial growth and keeps food fresh and edible.
At the turn of the 20th century, consumers kept food fresh by placing it on a block of
ice or, in cold weather, burying it in the yard or storing it on a window sill outside.
During the 1920s, refrigerators with freezer compartments became available for household
use. Another process that reduced the incidence of disease was invented by Louis
Pasteur--pasteurization. Although the process was applied first in wine preservation, when
milk producers adopted the process, pasteurization eliminated a substantial vector of
foodborne disease (see box, page 907). In 1924, the Public
Health Service created a document to assist Alabama in developing a statewide milk
sanitation program. This document evolved into the Grade A Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, a
voluntary agreement that established uniform sanitation standards for the interstate
shipment of Grade A milk and now serves as the basis of milk safety laws in the 50 states
and Puerto Rico (4).
Along with improved crop varieties, insecticides and herbicides have increased crop
yields, decreased food costs, and enhanced the appearance of food. Without proper
controls, however, the residues of some pesticides that remain on foods can create
potential health risks (5). Before 1910, no legislation existed to ensure the safety of
food and feed crops that were sprayed and dusted with pesticides. In 1910, the first
pesticide legislation was designed to protect consumers from impure or improperly labeled
products. During the 1950s and 1960s, pesticide regulation evolved to require maximum
allowable residue levels of pesticides on foods and to deny registrations for unsafe or
ineffective products. During the 1970s, acting under these strengthened laws, the newly
formed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed DDT and several other highly
persistent pesticides from the marketplace. In 1996, the Food Quality Protection Act set a
stricter safety standard and required the review of older allowable residue levels to
determine whether they were safe. In 1999, federal and state laws required that pesticides
meet specific safety standards; the EPA reviews and registers each product before it can
be used and sets levels and restrictions on each product intended for food or feed crops.
Newly recognized foodborne pathogens have emerged in the United States since the late
1970s; contributing factors include changes in agricultural practices and food processing
operations, and the globalization of the food supply (Table 1 ).
Seemingly healthy food animals can be reservoirs of human pathogens. During the 1980s, for
example, an epidemic of egg-associated Salmonella serotype Enteritidis infection
spread to an estimated 45% of the nation's egg-laying flocks, which resulted in a large
increase in egg-associated foodborne illness within the United States (6,7). Escherichia
coli O157:H7, which can cause severe infections and death in humans, produces no signs
of illness in its nonhuman hosts (8). In 1993, a severe outbreak of E. coli O157:H7
infections attributed to consumption of undercooked ground beef (9) resulted in 501 cases
of illness, 151 hospitalizations, and three deaths, and led to a restructuring of the meat
inspection process. The most common foodborne infectious agent may be the calicivirus (a
Norwalk-like virus), which can pass from the unwashed hands of an infected foodhandler to
the meal of a consumer. Animal husbandry and meat production improvements that have
contributed to reducing pathogens in the food supply include pathogen eradication
campaigns, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs (10), better
animal feeding regulations (11), the use of uncontaminated water in food processing (12),
more effective food preservatives (13), improved antimicrobial products for sanitizing
food processing equipment and facilities, and adequate surveillance of foodhandling and
preparation methods (14). HACCP programs also are mandatory for the seafood industry (15).
Improved surveillance, applied research, and outbreak investigations have elucidated
the mechanisms of contamination that are leading to new control measures for foodborne
pathogens. In meat-processing plants (16), the incidence of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections has decreased. However, in 1998, apparently unrelated cases of Listeria infections were linked when an epidemiologic investigation indicated that isolates from
all cases shared the same genetic DNA fingerprint; approximately 100 cases and 22 deaths
were traced to eating hot dogs and deli meats produced in a single manufacturing plant
(17). In 1998, a multistate outbreak of shigellosis was traced to imported parsley (18).
During 1997-1998 in the United States, outbreaks of cyclosporiasis were associated with
mesclun mix lettuce, basil/basil-containing products, and Guatemalan raspberries (19).
These instances highlight the need for measures that prevent food contamination closer to
its point of production, particularly if the food is eaten raw or is difficult to wash
(20).
Any 21st century improvement will be accelerated by new diagnostic techniques and the
rapid exchange of information through use of electronic networks and the Internet.
PulseNet, for example, is a network of laboratories in state health departments, CDC, and
food regulatory agencies. In this network, the genetic DNA fingerprints of specific
pathogens can be identified and shared electronically among laboratories, enhancing the
ability to detect, investigate, and control geographically distant yet related outbreaks.
Another example of technology is DPDx, a computer network that identifies parasitic
pathogens. By combining PulseNet and DPDx with field epidemiologic investigations, the
public health system can rapidly identify and control outbreaks. CDC, the Food and Drug
Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), other federal agencies, and
private organizations are enhancing food safety by collaborating in education, training,
research, technology, and transfer of information and by considering food safety as a
whole--from farm to table.
Nutrition
The discovery of essential nutrients and their roles in disease prevention has been
instrumental in almost eliminating nutritional deficiency diseases such as goiter,
rickets, and pellagra in the United States. During 1922-1927, with the implementation of a
statewide prevention program, the goiter rate in Michigan fell from 38.6% to 9.0 % (21).
In 1921, rickets was considered the most common nutritional disease of children, affecting
approximately 75% of infants in New York City (22). In the 1940s, the fortification of
milk with vitamin D was a critical step in rickets control.
Because of food restrictions and shortages during the first world war, scientific
discoveries in nutrition were translated quickly into public health policy; in 1917, USDA
issued the first dietary recommendations based on five food groups; in 1924, iodine was
added to salt to prevent goiter. The 1921-1929 Maternal and Infancy Act enabled state
health departments to employ nutritionists, and during the 1930s, the federal government
developed food relief and food commodity distribution programs, including school feeding
and nutrition education programs, and national food consumption surveys.
Pellagra is a good example of the translation of scientific understanding to public
health action to prevent nutritional deficiency. Pellagra, a classic dietary deficiency
disease caused by insufficient niacin, was noted in the South after the Civil War. Then
considered infectious, it was known as the disease of the four Ds: diarrhea, dermatitis,
dementia, and death. The first outbreak was reported in 1907. In 1909, more than 1000
cases were estimated based on reports from 13 states. One year later, approximately 3000
cases were suspected nationwide based on estimates from 30 states and the District of
Columbia. By the end of 1911, pellagra had been reported in all but nine states, and
prevalence estimates had increased nearly ninefold (23). During 1906-1940, approximately 3
million cases and approximately 100,000 deaths were attributed to pellagra (24). From 1914
until his death in 1929, Joseph Goldberger, a Public Health Service physician, conducted
groundbreaking studies that demonstrated that pellagra was not infectious but was
associated with poverty and poor diet. Despite compelling evidence, his hypothesis
remained controversial and unconfirmed until 1937. The near elimination of pellagra by the
end of the 1940s (Figure 2) has been attributed to improved diet and
health associated with economic recovery during the 1940s and to the enrichment of flour
with niacin. Today, most physicians in the United States have never seen pellagra although
outbreaks continue to occur, particularly among refugees and during emergencies in
developing countries (25).
The growth of publicly funded nutrition programs was accelerated during the early 1940s
because of reports that 25% of draftees showed evidence of past or present malnutrition; a
frequent cause of rejection from military service was tooth decay or loss. In 1941,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened the National Nutrition Conference for Defense,
which led to the first recommended dietary allowances of nutrients, and resulted in
issuance of War Order Number One, a program to enrich wheat flour with vitamins and iron.
In 1998, the most recent food fortification program was initiated; folic acid, a
water-soluble vitamin, was added to cereal and grain products to prevent neural tube
defects.
While the first half of the century was devoted to preventing and controlling
nutritional deficiency disease, the focus of the second half has been on preventing
chronic disease with initiation of the Framingham Heart Study in 1949. This landmark study
identified the contribution of diet and sedentary lifestyles to the development of
cardiovascular disease, and the effect of elevated serum cholesterol on the risk for
coronary heart disease. With increased awareness, public health nutrition programs have
sought strategies to improve diets. By the 1970s, food and nutrition labeling and other
consumer information programs stimulated the development of products low in fat, saturated
fat, and cholesterol. Since then, persons in the United States have significantly
decreased their dietary intakes of total fat from approximately 40% of total calorie
intake in 1977-1978 to 33% in 1994-1996, approaching the recommended 30% (26); saturated
fat intake and serum cholesterol levels also have decreased (27). Prevention efforts,
including changes in diet (28) and lifestyle and early detection and improved treatment,
have contributed to impressive declines in mortality from heart disease and stroke (29).
Populations with diets rich in fruits and vegetables have a substantially lower risk
for many types of cancer. In 1991, the National Cancer Institute and the Produce for
Better Health Foundation launched a program to encourage eating at least five servings of
fruits and vegetables daily. Although public awareness of the "5 A Day" message
has increased, only approximately 36% of persons in the United States aged greater than or
equal to 2 years achieved the daily goal of five or more servings of fruits and vegetables
(28). A diet rich in fruits and vegetables that provide vitamins, antioxidants (including
carotenoids), other phytochemicals, and fiber is associated with additional health
benefits, including decreased risk for cardiovascular disease.
The most urgent challenge to nutritional health during the 21st century will be
obesity. In the United States, with an abundant, inexpensive food supply and a largely
sedentary population, overnutrition has become an important contributor to morbidity and
mortality in adults. As early as 1902, USDA's W.O. Atwater linked dietary intake to
health, noting that "the evils of overeating may not be felt at once, but sooner or
later they are sure to appear--perhaps in an excessive amount of fatty tissue, perhaps in
general debility, perhaps in actual disease" (30). In U.S. adults, overweight (body
mass index [BMI] of greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI greater than or
equal to 30 kg/m2) have increased markedly, especially since the 1970s. In the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994), the crude
prevalence of overweight for adults aged greater than or equal to 20 years was 54.9%. From
1976-1980 (NHANES II) to 1988-1994 (NHANES III), the prevalence of obesity increased from
14.5% to 22.5% (31).
Overweight and obesity increase risk for and complications of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis, and other chronic
disorders; total costs attributable to obesity are an estimated $100 billion annually
(32). Obesity also is a growing problem in developing countries where it is associated
with substantial morbidity and where malnutrition, particularly deficiencies of iron,
iodine, and vitamin A, affects approximately 2 billion people. Increasing physical
activity in the U.S. population is an important step (33), but effective prevention and
control of overweight and obesity will require concerted public health action.
As the U.S. population ages, attention to both nutrition and food safety will become
increasingly important. Challenges will include maintaining and improving nutritional
status, because nutrient needs change with aging, and assuring food quality and safety,
which is important to an older, more vulnerable population. Continuing challenges for
public health action include reducing iron deficiency, especially in infants, young
children, and women of childbearing age; improving initiation and duration of
breastfeeding; improving folate status for women of childbearing age; and applying
emerging knowledge about nutrition on dietary patterns and behavior that promote health
and reduce risk for chronic disease. Behavioral research indicates that successful
nutrition promotion activities focus on specific behaviors, have a strong consumer
orientation, segment and target consumers, use multiple reinforcing channels, and
continually refine the messages (34). These techniques form a paradigm to achieve public
health goals and to communicate and motivate consumers to change their behavior.

Why Pasteurization? | Ice Cream Private Label
Why Pasteurization?
by Darryl David | Oct 20, 2014 | Dairy & Industry News
The Purpose of Pasteurization
To increase dairy safety for the consumer by destroying disease causing microorganisms (pathogens) that may be present in milk or cream.
To increase keeping the quality of dairy products by destroying spoilage microorganisms and enzymes that contribute to the reduced quality and shelf life.
Besides the sanitation factor, pasteurization (or the cooking process) can also aid in ingredient blending which I believe contributes to the overall  improvement of a product.  Pasteurization is required for products other than dairy including water, fruit drinks and beer.  The main event that forced non dairy beverages to pasteurize was in 1996 by a producer called Odwalla, a producer of fresh fruit juices.
Due to the product picking up bacteria through the manufacturing and being packed cold and non-pasteurized there was an E. coli outbreak. As a result of the outbreak, 16-month-old Anna Gimmestad of Greeley, Colorado, died from kidney failure,[5] and at least 66 people became sick. [11] Fourteen children were hospitalized with hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a severe kidney and blood disorder, and were, according to doctors, “likely to have permanent kidney damage and other lasting problems”. [1]
Time and time again I hear from people, that the cooking stage of the process can kill the good properties of a products well as the bad.  My response is depending on the ingredient a modification can be made to adding certain ingredients post pasteurization and in most cases is because the “heat shock” killed a large percentage of essential enzymes, vitamins or minerals.  The point is in many instances, with proper assistance a product can be cooked without sacrificing vital points of the product.
Here is a chart that offers insight on pasteurization temperatures and cook time with different products and packaging.

So, from the search results, I've gathered that pasteurization is a process that involves heating food, especially milk and other liquids, to specific temperatures for certain periods to kill harmful microorganisms and extend shelf life. It was developed by Louis Pasteur in the 19th century initially for wine and later applied to milk to prevent diseases like tuberculosis and to improve food safety.

Looking back at my initial thoughts, I had listed several key contributions of Louis Pasteur, including pasteurization, the development of the germ theory of disease, vaccine creation, and studies in fermentation. The search results confirm and expand on these points, particularly emphasizing the impact of pasteurization on public health and food safety.

For instance, Doc 1 from the Virginia Department of Health explains how pasteurization was developed in response to outbreaks of diseases linked to contaminated milk in the 1800s. It mentions that pasteurization kills harmful bacteria without affecting the taste or nutritional value of milk, and it has significantly reduced the incidence of milk-related disease outbreaks.

Doc 2 from Quora provides a concise explanation of the importance of pasteurization, highlighting its role in improving food safety by reducing the microbial load in foods that might harbor dangerous pathogens. It also notes that pasteurization doesn't affect foods that are already free from pathogens or spoilage organisms, and that its benefits outweigh any slight degradation in quality.

Doc 3 from Wikipedia offers a comprehensive overview of pasteurization, including its history, process, and various applications beyond just milk, such as in beer, fruit juices, and other liquid foods. It explains that pasteurization uses mild heat to eliminate pathogens and spoilage organisms, and it differentiates between methods like HTST (High Temperature Short Time) and UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) pasteurization.

Doc 4 from the CDC discusses achievements in public health related to safer and healthier foods, mentioning pasteurization as a key factor in reducing foodborne diseases, particularly in milk. It provides historical context, such as the decline in typhoid fever incidence and the control of trichinellosis, attributing these improvements partly to pasteurization and other food safety measures.

Doc 5 from Ice Cream Private Label focuses on the purpose of pasteurization in increasing dairy safety and quality, and it includes a table detailing different pasteurization conditions for various products and systems, which could be useful for understanding the technical aspects of the process.

Reflecting on these documents, it's clear that pasteurization has been a pivotal advancement in food safety, significantly reducing the transmission of diseases through contaminated foods and extending the shelf life of perishable items. Its impact on public health has been profound, saving countless lives and improving overall quality of life.

Moreover, pasteurization isn't just about killing pathogens; it also helps in controlling spoilage organisms, thereby reducing food waste. The process has been adapted and optimized for different types of foods and packaging, ensuring its relevance across various industries.

Beyond pasteurization, Louis Pasteur's work on the germ theory of disease revolutionized medicine and hygiene practices. His development of vaccines, particularly for rabies, has saved numerous lives and set the foundation for modern vaccination programs.

His studies on fermentation also had a significant impact on the food and beverage industry, leading to improvements in the production and preservation of wines, beers, and other fermented products.

In summary, Louis Pasteur changed the world through his pioneering work in microbiology, which led to advancements in food safety, medicine, and agriculture. His inventions and theories have had lasting impacts on public health and continue to influence these fields today.

So, to answer the question "How did Louis Pasteur change the world?"—Pasteur changed the world by developing pasteurization, which improved food safety and reduced disease transmission; by establishing the germ theory of disease, which transformed medical practices; by creating vaccines that have saved millions of lives; and by advancing our understanding of fermentation processes, which has benefited the food and beverage industry.
