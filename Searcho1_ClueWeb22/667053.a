I'm trying to figure out what might happen if business strategy isn't the driver in a company. So, first off, I need to understand what a business strategy is and why it's important.

A business strategy is basically a plan that outlines how a company plans to achieve its goals and objectives. It's like a roadmap that guides the company's decisions and actions. It takes into account the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the market.

So, if business strategy isn't the driver, that means something else is guiding the company's decisions. Maybe it's short-term profits, maybe it's following industry trends without a clear plan, or perhaps it's focusing on specific products or services without considering the overall direction of the company.

Let me think about this. If a company doesn't have a clear business strategy driving its decisions, it might struggle in several ways.

First, without a strategy, the company might lack focus. It could be spreading its resources too thin by pursuing too many opportunities without prioritizing which ones align best with its capabilities and market needs. This could lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

Second, without a strategic approach, the company might not be adaptable to changes in the market. Strategies often include contingency plans and scenarios to deal with different market conditions. Without that, the company might react impulsively to changes rather than having a planned response.

Third, a lack of strategy could lead to poor decision-making. Decisions might be based on gut feelings or short-term gains rather than long-term sustainability and growth.

Fourth, without a clear strategy, it's hard for employees to understand the company's direction and their roles in achieving its goals. This could lead to low morale and decreased productivity.

Fifth, investors and stakeholders might lose confidence in the company if they don't see a clear plan for how the company intends to create value and achieve success.

Let me see if I can find some examples or research that supports these points. Maybe looking up cases where companies failed because they lacked a solid business strategy.

7 Spectacular Business Strategy Failures
There’s risk involved in every business decision, and choosing the right strategy isn’t always easy. However, there are a few cautionary tales business people should keep in mind before following down a path.
Below we revisit 7 business strategy failures and outline how you can avoid them in your decision making.
1. Iridium – Gambling on Technology
Iridium was a company that produced global satellite phones. Backed by Motorola, it spent $5 billion to expand and launch its wireless satellite phone range. To work, the system relied on 66 satellites, which were not yet in place. In an effort to make this happen, the company put itself in $1.5 billion of debt.
Further, each handset was priced at $3000 and cost $5 a minute per call, on top of other significant monthly charges. Customers rejected this and in 1999 the company filed for bankruptcy, less than a year after launching.
2. Green Tree Financial – Bad Loans
Green Tree Financial was another company devastated by the Global Financial Crisis. The company extended 30-year mortgages for trailers and homes. These mortgages were high risk as they relied on profiting from origination fees. This was a strategic failure as trailers lose value quickly.
Many owners defaulted and were then subject to exorbitant fees and harassment, tactics which resulted in litigation against the company. Green Tree Financial was backed by Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, but fell into more and more debt as owners defaulted.
In another strategic bungle, Conseco acquired Green Tree Financial and with it, it’s large debt.
3. eBay – Misguided Merger
Although 70-90% of mergers fail, on the 10 th birthday of her online auction site, eBay, Meg Whitman spent USD $3.1 billion on Skype, which was then, only two years old. Whitman believed that Skype would boost its e-commerce strategy, along with eBay’s auctions and PayPal’s online payment system.
Skype’s value soon dropped to USD $1.4 billion. Whitman resigned and was replaced by former business consultant John Donahoe, who sold 65% of Skype, arguing that it was a strong standalone business. To cope with losses, eBay cut 10% of its workforce in 2008. Donahoe also moved away from eBay’s flea market auction style towards more set prices from larger retailers, a strategy which angered many sellers. Today Skype is worth USD $8.5 billion under Microsoft.
4. Kodak – Need for Change
Kodak is synonymous with photography. Their print processing methods were global and technologies ahead of the competition. However, the company ultimately came crashing down because it didn’t change their strategy with the market.
Kodak invented the digital camera in 1975. Even though they produced a report on predicted future trends in the market, management decided that the technology wouldn’t disrupt the market so strategic change was unnecessary. They had 10 years to act, but didn’t. The company lost 75% of its value before filing for bankruptcy in 2012.
5. Schlitz Brewing Company – The Customer Knows Best
The Schlitz Brewing Company, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, had been running for over a hundred years and produced the best selling beer in the United States. However, CEO Robert Uihlein wanted more.
Uihlein proposed a massive shift in its manufacturing to increase speed-to-market and profitability. He found a way of cutting brewing time from 40 days to 15 days, replacing barley malt with corn syrup. He also switched stabilisers to circumvent labelling laws. This was going well for him until customers noticed that it tasted awful because it hadn’t been fermented properly.
Because of this, each beer had a thick sediment which was compared with mucous. Schlitz was forced to make a secret recall of 10 million bottles of beer costing over USD $1.4 million.
6. Donald Trump – Trumping the Lot
There’s perhaps no more iconic businessman than Donald Trump. He tries and fails, and tries again. Among his many business ventures, there’s Trump Airlines, Trump Vodka, Trump Mortgages, Trump Casinos, Trump Towers (hotels) and Trump: The Game (a board game). And as this list suggests, all of them were branded with his name.
Let’s just look at Trump Airlines for now. In 1988, Trump paid USD $365 million for Eastern Air Shuttle, an airline that made hourly short haul flights between Boston, New York City and Washington D.C. Despite the airline previously being a very standard, no-fuss service, Trump sought to turn it into a luxury experience by adding maple-wood veneer to floors, chrome to seatbelt latches and gold-plated bathroom features. But like many of his ventures, it ultimately went bust. The airline never made a profit due to pre-Gulf War fuel prices and a lack of customer interest. He was forced to default on his loan and turn the company over to creditors.
7. Enron – Crooked Dealings
Enron exemplifies corporate corruption. The energy company was named ‘America’s Most Innovative Company’ for six years between 1996 and 2001. It rose to dramatic heights, only to later fall, bringing Wall St crashing with it.
The relaxed regulatory environment the late 1990s allowed Enron set to up numerous new arms of its business (such as Enron Online or Special Purpose Vehicles) and claim projected profit on the books despite not making any money. Among other methods, they also cut deals with other energy providers in order to manipulate the market.
Even though Enron was as dodgy as they come, highly reputable accounting firm Arthur Anderson LLP offered its support to the company. The bubble eventually burst in 2001 when the company began to crumble under its own weight. Investors and auditors were suspicious and investigations found its management and accountants guilty of conspiracy, insider trading and securities fraud.
As these cautionary tales suggest, choosing a business strategy can be a road fraught with dangers. For expert financial advice, contact our trusted advisors today.

Most Popular Examples of Top Companies That Failed Business Strategy

Business strategy has been a serious business buzzword for a decade. Top leaders ponder about how to craft strategic business objectives that are aligned with the organization’s business needs.
It is hard-hitting to see how corporations like Kodak, Nokia, Blockbuster, Yahoo, and many others were severely shriveled, foundered and shrunk. There are few yet some of the world’s top companies (80’s) that once existed are now long gone.
A familiar tale of woe you’re bound to hear at just about any business strategy conference you’ll attend.
The business world is and will always remain to be harsh. Even those that managed to survive for years have grown obsolete.
As said by Dr. Graeme Edwards, “It’s not the plan that is important, it’s the planning.”
The business strategist must ensure they build successful strategic plans to help businesses remain vital and sustainable.
Organizations that didn’t change with time are taken into the abyss of irrelevance. They have either been acquired by other top rivals or they’ve just failed with their business strategies.
History keeps reminding us that even though we’re in the worst days of greatest failure there will never be a shortage of business strategists to warn us against the perils of failed business strategies. However, it is for us to embrace any upcoming change we often ignore.
Phil McKinney, CEO of CableLabs made a statement that goes, “without a robust and resilient innovation strategy, no company can survive.”
World’s top companies that followed the best business strategies, yet fail, why?
Eastman Kodak
You’d be surprised, for almost a century no company could compete for the commercialization in terms of Kodak.
This didn’t last long, they blew their chance of leading the digital era as they were in denial for way too long.
Ever since the 80s, they’ve been trying to expand into other fields like document management, pharmaceuticals, healthcare imaging, memory chips – and the saddest part is – they could never return to their original state.
The magic just vanished as Kodak’s leaders failed to see the digital revolution to be the next era in the world of photography.
Yahoo
While web aggregation and the online search was under the virgin territory, yahoo charged their customers for services like file sharing and e-mail. When this was happening, Google, on the other hand, provided these services for free of cost.
Well, everybody flocked to Google. This approach of customers came out to be a commendable result for Google, which still holds a name for itself to date. While Yahoo grew to be the largest portal for sports, news coverage, financial, and web. It has hereby drifted into original entertainment, job-hunting services, and video streaming.
USD 45 billion buyouts offered by Microsoft turned out to be a huge loss since the market value for Yahoo drops down to USD 19 billion.
Nokia
One of the largest company that drastically failed because they didn’t embrace the concept of software and didn’t put their focus on hardware due fear of having alienation of the current users.
Undoubtedly Nokia was the global leader in mobile phones during the 90s and 2000s.
When the internet came into existence, besides Nokia, other mobile companies started embracing how data and not voice would be the future’s aspect of communication.
This was one of Nokia’s biggest mistakes – not wanting to take the lead on user experience causing them to develop a messed-up operating system and a bad user experience which wasn’t the right fit for the current market.
However, in 2008 Nokia did try getting into competition with android but miserably failed.
Blockbuster
2004, a year when Blockbuster was at its peak. They even manage to survive the transition phase from VHS to DVD. All these came to a downfall when Netflix began forwarding videos via mail, a phase when cable, as well as phone companies, started providing videos on-demand. A phase when Redbox started renting out videos for a buck per night through vending machines. Since video streaming is now possible via phone and computer, Blockbuster’s retail outlets tend to become outdated thus leading to the closure of hundreds of stores. The firm is trying to copy some of the competitors’ business strategy, yet they have failed the chances to cope up.
Rather than being a leader today, it has started chasing the industry.
Turning down the offer made by the founder of Netflix Reed Hastings was the biggest mistake former CEO of Blockbuster John Antioco committed.
Today, Netflix stands to be a USD 28 billion-dollar company.
Other companies that failed to rise in the industry
Tie Rack, Segway, IBM, Blackberry Motion, Dell, Motorola, Polaroid, Pan Am, Borders, Tower Records, Compaq, General Motors, Pets.com, and Sears are names of the other companies that failed to rise again in the market due to bad business strategies.
Reasons why business strategies fail – why business strategist must keep a check on
Zero succession plan
Who will be your future leaders? Do you have these names on your fingertips? Having zero or no succession plan will lead toward the death of your business.
Poor managerial skills and management
Micro-managing, inability to listen and working without having the right strategic leadership are signs of poor managerial and management skills.
Lag in planning
Most often business fails due to lack of short-term and long-term planning. It is vital to have strategized business plans planned of time – where will your business head in a months’ time to the next year.
Following premature upscaling
Simply put, the scaling of businesses is good only when done at the right time. If you prematurely scale your business, you will eventually destroy it. Well, Pets.com failed because they tried to scale up way too fast.
Yes, it is true, most businesses fail yet rise again. Those that rise aren’t the result of a miracle but the result of executing the right business strategy.

5 Reasons Why Strategy Fails
5 Reasons Why Strategy Fails
By bMighty.com July
							2, 2008
Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
By: Nilofer Merchant
I've watched strategy being developed within companies like Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, and Nokia. I've seen strategy created by individuals. I've seen the big suits of Bain and McKinsey at work. I've seen it done well, and occasionally I've seen it done poorly. Having read more than 100 books that define the best thinking on strategy, I've noticed that following the existing methods often doesn't yield success.
It's not just the methodology. Here are five reasons strategy fails in small businesses, in midsize businesses, and in large enterprises:
1. The Blame Game
How many times have you seen a strategy move into execution, then fail? Typically, the postmortem involves blame. It was poor leadership. We didn't execute correctly. We had bad market data. Our customers decided they wanted something else. The timing was off. There are hundreds more, and you've heard many of them.
Underneath the failure is something deeper -- a strategy creation process that's gone off the rails.
The problem isn't actually people, management, or other issues. It's what strategy is seen as being and how it's developed within an organization.
When there's a mismatch, people can be fearful and confused if they have information that contradicts the new strategy. When the strategy doesn't gibe with what employees know to be true, they may wonder if they're supposed to speak out or remain silent. Employees wonder if they'll get in trouble if they do, or even if they don't, say anything. They worry about being called "too tactical" or "insubordinate" because their reality-check doesn't match up with what the CEO wants enacted.
When a business reaches this point, the strategy has already failed. In the musical The Wiz, the wicked witch Evillene sings a song titled "Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News." If that's your tune, get rid of it. It's a sign of serious structural problems.
2. Lack of Team Involvement
Large companies often see strategy as an annual activity done by an elite group of people who sequester themselves in a conference room. In smaller organizations, it more often comes as an edict from on high delivered to the people on the ground who must enact it.
Strategy is tricky -- it's both a thing and an action.
As a thing, a vision, a direction, everyone in the company owns strategy. As an action, it requires specific people to carry it out within the organization. Lack of such involvement is one of the major predictors of strategy failure. When employees aren't invited -- or even given permission -- to question high-level strategy, watch out. A CEO may miss key questions such as "Is this strategy the best way to achieve our goal?" "Do we even know how to do this?" or "Have we researched this fully?" The team, even if given permission, may not have a formal place to discuss such questions, and organizations don't usually invite conversations of this type.
The solution? Get the conversation going on an internal blog with comments, through a discussion thread, or on a strategy wiki that involves everyone in the organization. You'll be surprised how many times an important piece of knowledge is contributed by someone you thought wouldn't be interested.
3. Here We Are -- But Where Are We?
How did this happen? How did we get here? We need to understand where today's strategy models came from and how they operate. This will show us why the lack of key structural elements can almost always predict failure.
The two basic forms of traditional strategy are predictive and emergent. Both are highly codified and well-documented. They're usually used at the CEO level.
Predictive strategy is top-down and sets a direction based on research predictions about what market conditions are expected to be. The work is quantitative, relying on data, analytics, and expert intelligence to build a picture of an evolving market. It offers tools to design strategies that will succeed in the market as depicted.
Emergent strategy is bottom up and takes a wait-and-see approach. The ideas that catch fire are added to resources that help the whole bear fruit. The focus is on the enablement of the organization to develop competing options that mirror the real-time competition going on in the market. It supports a portfolio approach to an organization's evolving itself into the future.The method you choose depends on the management structure of your organization, the industry the company is in, and the company culture -- among other variables. The emergent model is more flexible, where some might say the predictive model is old school. What causes failure in both is the failure to integrate feedback loops to enable adjustment on the fly.
4. Execution
Popular media has focused on execution for the past five years. The logic was that the problem was that companies simply didn't know how to execute strategy. Titles such as The New Science of Strategy Execution: How Established Firms Become Fast, Sleek Wealth Creators and Execution: How to Break It Down and Get It Done support this notion. This points us in the direction of the results that have been missing, but still misses the mark by suggesting that a systematic approach will guarantee better results.
This is an incomplete idea -- even the idea of "flawless execution" assumes there's a target everyone is aiming toward. When is the last time you saw that level of alignment in any business, regardless of size?
Point being that a process reinforces the ability of people throughout an organization to synchronize, know what to adjust for, make good decisions, and know when to feed information back into the system for fine-tuning.
Tools are just tools. What's important is the way companies make decisions and choose which tools to use, as well as when and how to use them; that determines how effective the tools will be.
5. Decision-Making
In the United States, we're surrounded by overabundance and often don't recognize it. The same thing can happen inside a company regarding the plethora of decisions that need to be made. Poor decision-making can kill a strategy if people in the organization are unable to see it as a source of strategy failure.
Too many goals or conflicting imperatives create a situation where everything is a priority. In that scenario, nothing really gets accomplished. Business owners must know how to select and prioritize, edit, and delete. Given a situation in which you're developing a new line of business, decide how you want to help customers choose, and communicate it clearly within your team and to the company. Make the branding, packaging, sales, and channel shift clean and easy -- including the conversation about compensation and rewards.
Great decisions can be made by teams. But sometimes when decisions are made by teams without broader review, feedback is missed or fails to take into account cross-functional understanding. That person in sales may just hold the key as to how you can better engage the channel. Build in time for review, but make sure you're looking for targeted input. This isn't a consensus-building exercise.
Whether the decision is solo or team-based, it can be a challenge. Make it, move on, and make sure you have installed a process that will provide you with an early-warning signal if you need to revisit what you've decided. The one thing that's always constant in the market and in SMBs is change. It's a given that adjustments will need to be made -- develop the ability to adjust to change smoothly.

It is said that up to 50% of businesses fail within five years of inception. Most of these business start and end in obscurity. A few of them, however, start up with the verve of a cannonball, only to crash with equal fanfare. Some of the companies listed below, like Enron and DeLorean, exemplify this cataclysmic appeal. Others, like Pan Am and Woolworth’s, just tug at our heartstrings.
Check out the 25 worst business failures in history below:
25. Fashion Café
Want some Newports with that iceberg lettuce?
A restaurant that serves gargantuan burgers and fried appetizers founded by a bunch of supermodels and fey fashionistas didn’t work? Hmm, I wonder why. “The $20 Salad Extraordinaire,” created exclusively for Naomi Campbell, reportedly consisted of a glass of champagne, a pack of Newports and two slices of tomato accompanied by an iceberg leaf. Famed restaurateur Tommaso Buti was the “brains” behind the operation. He over-franchised the cafes, was accused of mismanagement, then followed Christy Turlington in selling his stake in the company. Buti, already accused of defrauding investors, was arrested in 2000 and charged with wire fraud, conspiracy, money laundering, and transportation of stolen property.
24. CBGB
A legend turns into a men’s store
In 2006, after 33 years of offering up legends like the Talking Heads, Blondie, Misfits and the stalwart Ramones, CBGB, the most famous underground alt-rock/punk club in the world, closed its doors. It was shuttered to make way for a high-end men’s fashion store. Patti Smith gave the historic club an emotional, if punk, goodbye by tearing the stage and room apart. Ironically, the very same shrine that so many skinny-jean hipsters and adrenaline-fueled punks would come to mourn was originally started by Hilly Kristal as a venue for his favorite music: “Country, Blue Grass and Blues.”
23. The Edsel
Ford’s biggest flop
In 1958, Ford’s newest vehicle, launched on “E-Day,” flailed, flopped, and imploded. Ford kept the Edsel under wraps as a new kind of futuristic, experimental car. One fateful day in 1958, the Edsel was revealed…and immediately faceplanted. This car of the future was blah by anyone’s standards. By November 1959, when Ford finally mercy-killed the Edsel, it had lost an estimated $250 million–nearly $2 billion in today’s dollars. Edsel is now synonymous with a marketing business failure.
22. Flooz.com
The name says it all
Flooz.com blew through up to $50 million dollars trying to convince new Internet users that money online would work like frequent flier miles or gift cards. Part of that money went to a notoriously bad ad campaign featuring Whoopi Goldberg (before she was cool again). And the name? Flooz is derived from the Arabic word for money. In August, 2001 the company folded their chairs and went home. Apparently, people could just use their credit cards. Whoops!
21. The Hit Factory
A New York classic goes condo
Deep in New York, in the heart of Hell’s Kitchen, The Hit Factory was one the world’s most recognized recording Studios. Started by Edward Germano in 1975, it saw everyone from Tony Bennett to U2 record amazing tracks. After Germano’s death in 2003, his wife Janice took over operations. Citing the “digital age,” she closed the doors and sold the building, moving the operations to an existing Hit Factory in Miami. Troy Germano, Edward’s son, later acknowledged publicly that his mother simply closed it out of greed. She wanted to move to Miami and thought she could make good money on the building’s sale. It is now a luxury condominium complex, with prices starting at $1 million.
20. Betamax
BetaWrong
I could give you facts, figures, and dates to support why Betamax failed so miserably, but that would be a blog post unto itself. Suffice it to say: Betamax was bulky, complicated, ugly, expensive, publicly ridiculed, horribly marketed, disdained by the media, and only capable of limited recording and playback. The capper? Most Hollywood movies that people rented were just a little bit over one hour. Too bad…and good riddance.
19. SwissAir
The “Flying Bank” ends up buried
The former national airline of Switzerland, Swissair, used to be so financially stable that it was known as the “Flying Bank.” Founded in 1931, Swissair epitomized international transportation until the late 1990s, when the airline’s board decided to follow an aggressive borrowing and acquisition policy called the Hunter strategy. Then, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 put a void in the company’s plans Swissair found itself hamstrung with debt. Unlike some other airlines, however, Swissair couldn’t handle the financial hit. Mismanagement and bad ideas—trundling large sums of cash to purchase fuel at foreign airports, for example—left the airline gasping for oxygen. In 2002, Switzerland was embarrassed to lose its national icon for good.
18. Ponzi’s Security Exchange Company
Bernie Madoff’s famous forebear
It’s quite an achievement to have a breed of financial scam named after yourself. Charles Ponzi, an Italian immigrant, ran a staggering 6-month pyramid scheme in 1920 by gaining investments (over $15 million) from an ever-growing pool of more than 40,000 investors. Ponzi would use “profits” from new investors to pay “interest” to old ones. Using a trade system of international reply coupons for postage stamps and leveraging exchange rates, Ponzi made a lot of people money through the “Securities Exchange Company,” which claimed to leverage exchange rates through an international postage stamp reply coupon trading system (this mouthful of a phrase reminds me of how people described derivatives in 2008). But his scheme ruined lives–including Charles’ own. After jumping a few bails, he did prison time from 1926 through 1934. Years later, he died, penniless, in a Brazil charity hospital, half-blind and partially paralyzed.
17. Woolworth’s
The bad economy bullies Woolies towards its own demise
Brits, who held “ Woolies ” close to their hearts, were were crushed when this comfort food and houseware retailer closed its last 807 stores after nearly 100 years of service on High Street and beyond. At one time, Woolworths was the leading music retailer in the entire U.K. During the 1950s and 60s, the store was instrumental to the Beatles’ sales success Indeed, Woolies also played a role in breaking Madonna to the rest of the world. Hey, she’s a Brit now. Maybe she’ll pony up the cash to save them? Not likely.
16. Premier Smokeless Cigarette
Taste-wise, charcoal just doesn’t cut it
A smokeless cigarette has been the holy grail of tobacco ever since Reagan lit up a Chesterfield on broadcast TV. In an effort to reduce the harmful effects of inhaling cigarette smoke, RJ Reynolds launched the Premier cigarette, a “smokeless nicotine delivery mechanism that looks and feels like a premium cigarette,” in 1988. The product ended up a miserable flop. Not only did this expensive cig taste like charcoal, it ended up being employed by drug users as a handy “delivery mechanism” for substances other than tobacco. The cost of the project? A cool $1 billion.
15. Bre-X Minerals
Fool’s gold strikes again
If someone tells you they’ve struck gold on the isle of Borneo, grab your money and run the other way. In 1995, Bre-X Minerals was a tiny mining company based in Calgary with stock worth under $1 when they announced they had found extensive deposits of Gold in Busang, Indonesia. As a result, their stock shot to almost $300 CAD a share. A series of strange events, including a man fallen from a helicopter and eaten by tigers, roused enough suspicion to unravel the fraud. By 199, an outside analysis of the sites samples revealed that Bre-X had faked their findings by “salting” samples with gold dust. Within weeks, the NASDAQ and TSX delisted the company, which at one point held a market cap of $4.4 billion. Investors slapped their foreheads, and Bre-X Minerals slunk into history as a major business failure.
14. IndyMac
IndySplat
On July 11, 2008 the FDIC seized the assets of the largest Savings and Loan in Los Angeles and the 7th largest loan originator in the country. The seizure sparked rumors of bank runs. It also gave the public the first real, Main Street glimpse of the Financial Crisis of 2008. IndyMac was founded in 1995 as Countrywide Mortgage Investment. Its purpose was to provide a means of collateralizing loans too high in value for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to service. At the time of its seizure, IndyMac held nearly $30 billion in assets, making it the fourth largest bank failure in history.
13. Edison Records
First isn’t always best
It’s always difficult being first. Thomas Edison founded the first record company and invented the phonograph, the first device made for recording and playback of sound, in 1877. This achievement led to all of the music industry as we now know it. Surprisingly, it was also the first dictaphone in history used by businesses. World War I shortened the supply of materials Edison could use for his highly secret wax recipe, used in manufacturing. The company’s market share fell. As other companies seized the opportunity the make “needle-cut” records (an Edison Labs invention) Edison Records lost customers and credibility. It closed its doors in 1929.

12. Tucker Automobiles
There’s a reason only four of them ever died
The ambitious car company that Preston Tucker started was only in business one year (‘47-‘48). It produced a mere of 51 cars, but its story remains enshrined in museums, car clubs, film and even a video game where everyone drives a Tucker. The fatal flaw? Offering customers the option to buy their accessories before their car was built. This program started a witch-hunt by the SEC. Amid accusations of fraud and the “Big Three’s” influence over government, Tucker Automobiles went belly-up. I will spare you the argument of whether it was the best car ever made, but out of that original 51, 47 Tuckers still exist today. Let that be your clue.
11. Sharper Image
Buy, but do not inhale
Started in 1977 as a catalog selling jogging watches, the Sharper Image eventually grew into a high-end customer electronics store. As iPods and other branded, high-tech items took over the store’s traditional market share, it launched into the infomercial business with the Oreck vacuum and Ionic Breeze. Unfortunately, the Ionic Breeze did not purify the air as it said it did. After losing a lawsuit against Consumer Reports for a negative review, the testing company released findings that the Ionic breeze actually produced trace levels of ozone. In 2008, the store went bankrupt, forcing shoppers to buy their overpriced, Japanese made, brushed steel, throw-away executive gifts elsewhere.
10. Washington Mutual Bank
See bank run
WaMu was America’s largest Savings and Loan association, the sixth largest bank in the U.S., and (drumroll please…) the largest bank failure in history. Let that sink in for a minute. After a 10-day run on the bank in late September 2008, with total withdrawals in excess of $16 billion USD–almost 10% of the deposits–the FDIC seized WaMu’s assets. JPMorgan Chase bought WaMu subsidiaries the next day for what many suspect at pennies on the dollar. The holding company is currently in Chapter 11.
9. Enron
They made the E crooked for a reason
Enron was an energy sector leader that started to dabble in e-commerce and exotic investment areas, such as weather futures. In 2001, Enron, once valued at $90 billion and the 7th largest company in the United States, went bankrupt. It took jobs, investor savings, retiree futures and even some lives with it. In following years, it emerged that they shredded documents, started partnerships with their own shell companies, and engaged in massive inside trading. Enron is now synonymous with the business outcomes of galloping greed.
8. Polaroid
Go digital or die
Shake it like a Polaroid picture! You know you’re good when your name is the product. (Hello, Kleenex). But while you and I were buying our first digital camera, printing pictures and later taking photos with our phones and PDA’s, the execs at Polaroid were snapping and shaking their pictures into oblivion. So loved was the brand that countless people took daily shots of and created art, diaries and literature using these magical snapshots taped to their walls or to the street. The leader of an amazing niche technology that so enriched anyone born before 1980, Polaroid went bankrupt in 2005. The name may emerge again, but the brand and the impact will always be retro.
7. Atkins Nutritionals
Fadkins takes a bad fall
Apparently, bread won. Remember when all of your friends ordered their lunch without the bun and no potatoes, but with lard-laden beef and cheese? Atkins engineered the “low-carb” craze, a fad diet claiming you could “lose fat by eating fat.” Dr. Robert Atkins released Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution in 1972. In 1992, revised version gained popularity; the fad really took off at the beginning of millennium. Questions arose from the medical community about the diet’s long-term effects. Countless others, from the FDA to top chefs, also lined up to take shots at it. In 2003, it was reported to a skeptical public that the good doctor slipped on an icy sidewalk and died. The company went bankrupt within two years amidst the suspicion that his diet killed him. Meanwhile, a fickle public ditched low-card for the next fad. A year later, a leaked medical examinations report revealed that Dr. Atkins, 72, had a history of heart attack and congestive heart failure. He weighed 258 pounds at death.
6. Bethlehem Steel
When service kills steel
Everything you know about historic America has Bethlehem Steel in it. Founded when James Buchanan was our nation’s president, Bethlehem Steel was the backbone of the first blasting furnace, railroads, skyscrapers, coal, nuclear reactors, warships, cargo vessels, large construction projects like arenas, and other major infrastructural accomplishments. However, the company never adjusted to the new service-based economy that gained ground in the 1990s. Cheap imports worsened the situation. Bethlehem Steel, a piece of American history, disappeared forever when it filed for bankruptcy in 2001.
5. Pets.com
Big isn’t better
Pet’s can’t drive, and sock puppets make bad spokespeople, but Pets.com made the dot-com bubble their own in 2000. They overexpanded by opening a nationwide network of warehouses nationwide too quickly (taking a hint from Starbucks). Unfortunately, profits never caught up with media buys for commercials. In marketing, nothing is worse than having everyone know who you are and no one interested in what you sell. Widely recognized as the icon or poster child for dot-com failure, its stock went from over $11 in early 2000 to just $.19 on Election Day that same year, when the company closed its doors.
4. White Star Lines’ “Titanic”
A disaster of titanic proportions
White Star Lines, which built the Titanic, has oddly disappeared from the lore surrounding the fated giant. The fated vessel was conceived of in 1907, when executives Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie drastically changed and expanded their shipping transportation business to compete with Cunard’s new luxury oceanliners. The result was a line of gargantuan luxury liners that moved more passengers and freight than anyone else on the market. Three ships came out of the venture: The Olympic, the Titanic, and the Brittanic. You know the rest of the story. Cue the music!
3. Commodore Computers
You can’t kill the C64
Between 1983-1986, Apple, IBM, and Atari computer were quaking in their boots. The reason? The Commodore 64 was selling 2 million units a year and dominated nearly 50% of the total market. As the company tried to innovate by releasing the Commodore plus/4, a faster, smarter version with a color screen, they alienated their original customer base. The new model was incompatible with the cherished C64. Commodore tried to discontinue the old line in the US by 1990 and announced it would stop shipping them in 1995. The tactic didn’t work. Customers all over Europe continued to snap up the C64s until it became impossible for the company to manufacture them at a reasonable price without selling new, more expensive models. As they say, “you can’t kill the C64.” The company went bankrupt in the spring 1994.
2. DeLorean Motor Company
A man, his cocaine, and his car
As is often the case in the automobile industry, it’s hard to separate the man from the vehicle. John DeLorean was a hero amongst the very rich for creating the kind of car the future promised. With a stainless steel-skinned body, sleek lines and doors that opened vertically (gull wings), his DMC-12 hit the streets in 1980. Over the next three years, only 8,900 cars would be made. The car played a feature role in “Back to the Future” and become a potent status symbol. Then, in 1983, a sting revealed John on tape saying “this cocaine is as good as gold,” referring to a suitcase full of drugs valued at $24 million. Later acquitted on entrapment grounds and cleared of defrauding his partners, he would never gain the investor’s trust again.
1. Pan Am
The icon that didn’t pan out
It’s amazing how a country’s identity can be so closely tied to a business. Such was the case with PanAm. Founded in 1927, the airline was a part of American culture for the better part of the 20th century. It led the industry in international flights and luxury travel. It was also the first airline to make widespread use of jumbo jets, and the first to use an air staff of stewardesses as a PR focal point. Little girls grew up wanting to be PanAm stewardesses, and boys grew up wanting to pilot one of the fleet. Heck, the Beatles arrived on one. Unfortunately, as an American icon, PanAm was also a target for terrorism. A few horrific incidents, coupled with the increased global competition that came with deregulation, caused the airline—and its accompanying era—to collapse in 1991.

Failed Business Strategy - 3 Examples of Business Strategies That Didn't Work
Home Business and Economics Games That Businesses Play—3 Famous Examples of Failed Business Strategy
Games That Businesses Play—3 Famous Examples of Failed Business Strategy
From the Lecture Series: Critical Business Skills for Success
April 10, 2017 Business and Economics, Business Skills

Sun Tzu wrote of the importance of analyzing your enemy. This is crucial in business strategy, as well as in the military. Strong businesses put themselves in the shoes of their rivals, to anticipate how those competitors will react, and to help them plot a more effective strategy. Even iconic companies that failed to do this have lost to their competitors.

Failed Business Strategy—Netflix vs. Blockbuster
Let’s think about this in the context of Netflix and Blockbuster. Netflix entered the market in 1999, confronting the incumbent, Blockbuster. Blockbuster had a choice. How hard would they fight this new player, or would they accommodate? How did that play out in the movie-rental business? One important decision that Blockbuster confronted early on was the question of cutting late fees.
This is a transcript from the video series Critical Business Skills for Success. Watch it now, on Wondrium.
Netflix came into the market with a different pricing model: They weren’t charging per movie; they were charging a monthly subscription. Customers paid a certain fixed amount per month and rented as many movies as they wanted. Within that, they didn’t have to return each movie in a prescribed period of time. You could keep the movie for more days than Blockbuster typically allowed for their customers. But to rent more new movies, you eventually had to return what you already had. Netflix imposed a limit, but there were not traditional late fees.

Blockbuster had to decide. Would they cut late fees, which some customers disliked, to compete with Netflix? Netflix was anticipating Blockbusters’ next move. Would the video giant come after them?
It’s interesting to look at the economic motives of Blockbuster. Netflix likely did, based on my conversations with people in the industry. Blockbuster was generating at least $300 million per year in late fees in the early 2000s. In some years, that was more than the total operating profit of the entire company. They were dependent on late-fee revenue for their profitability.
In their first few years, Netflix only had a few hundred thousand subscribers to Blockbuster’s millions of customers. If Blockbuster cuts late fees, they destroy the entire profitability of the firm. But what do they gain by saving a tiny slice of market share? Ultimately, Blockbuster chose to accommodate and kept late fees in place. In their interest to preserve profitability at the time, they ceded a few 100,000 customers to Netflix, rather than try to save a bit of market share and sacrifice their revenue.
Blockbuster’s projection was that Netflix would not grow that rapidly. (Image: By Netflix – Netflix Media Center/Public domain)
Of course, you might say that was shortsighted. What about the long run? What if Netflix starts to grow and grow rapidly? Blockbuster’s projection was that Netflix would not grow that rapidly, that it was a niche player catering to a certain subset of customers, and would never go mainstream. With that expectation, they weren’t willing to eliminate late fees to save that tiny slice of the market.
Blockbuster’s projection was that Netflix would not grow that rapidly, that it was a niche player catering to a certain subset of customers, and that it would never go mainstream.
They were wrong, of course. The decision to cut late fees came years later, after their financials began to turn. The number of customers Netflix had built up and accumulated became so large that the accommodation strategy Blockbuster instituted cost them a great deal of money. Too late, they finally cut late fees.

Avoid a Failing Strategy with Competition — Clorox vs. Procter & Gamble
There’s a few other principles here we can learn about competitors and how they respond to one another. One key for the incumbent is, what signal are they sending to other potential entrants by their behavior today? The focus is not what is the short-term impact on profit, but what is the long-term impact on the competitive dynamic? Do they play nice, or fight? If they fight aggressively, does it deter other entrepreneurs from coming into that market segment?
Think about what you’re trying to do as an incumbent player in these markets. What you’d love to do is take action up front to deter entry before the player even comes in, and therefore, avoid the situation of having to take a huge hit to profits later on. Could you engage in preemptive action?
Several years ago, Clorox and Procter & Gamble were in an interesting competitive situation. Procter & Gamble, maker of laundry detergents like Tide, was thinking about entering the bleach category. This was one area in the laundry detergent aisle that they did not compete in. Clorox was the dominant player. Most Americans use the word Clorox and bleach interchangeably; the brand was the product.
Procter & Gamble’s plan was to test market their new bleach in Portland, Maine. Why Portland Maine? It was far from Clorox’s headquarters in California, it was a small market, and they were all set with a couponing and sampling strategy for introducing their product to test it out.
Clorox caught wind of this. They launched a preemptive attack to deter entry by P&G. They delivered a gallon of bleach to every household in Portland, Maine.
What did Procter & Gamble do? They realized their whole sampling and couponing strategy wouldn’t do much good once every household had an extra bottle of bleach already on hand. Moreover, we just learned that Clorox is going to fight to the death in that market. It wouldn’t be an easy battle.
What did Procter & Gamble do? They realized their whole sampling and couponing strategy wouldn’t much good once every household had an extra bottle of bleach already on hand. Moreover, they learned that Clorox was going to fight to the death in that market. It wouldn’t be an easy battle. They never entered the market; they decided to forsake the bleach category. A preemptive strike that deterred entry turned out to be a very effective business strategy.
As a potential entrant, assess the competitor’s response. Think about the range of factors that might suggest aggressive moves the incumbent makes that could be harmful to you as an entrepreneur. Are you in a slow-growth market? Is this a situation where the incumbent is starving for new customers, where there is no growth, and therefore, they might fight to preserve the customers they already have?

Economy of Scale and Failing Business Strategy
In the 1980s, NutraSweet was the dominant player in the aspartame, or artificial sweetener, market. Their biggest customers were Coke and Pepsi. In fact, Coke and Pepsi accounted for almost half of their sales worldwide. As their patents were about to expire, new businesses were looking to enter the market to compete. Holland Sweetener was one of those firms.
How would NutraSweet respond? Would they retaliate aggressively? Holland Sweetener made two big mistakes in their efforts to enter this market. The first was they didn’t fully understand how powerful NutraSweet’s cost advantage was over them.
It turns out there were huge economies of scale in the aspartame market and a substantial learning curve. The cost of producing aspartame had been falling significantly for years and NutraSweet gained more and more experience producing this good.
It was the same basic product. With no cost advantage and no differentiation, they were toast.
And as for huge economies of scale—you only needed a few factories to produce enough aspartame to serve the entire worldwide market. What did this mean for Holland Sweetener? It meant the incumbent could fight, and fight aggressively, because they could bring the price way down and still make money due to their cost advantage. Plus, Holland Sweetener had no other way of differentiating their product. It was the same basic product. With no cost advantage and no differentiation, they were toast.
If they had applied a little game theory to understand NutraSweet’s behavior with respect to Coke and Pepsi, they could have avoided their second mistake. Holland Sweetener counted on Coke and Pepsi shifting some of their volume over. They figured Coke and Pepsi didn’t want to be so dependent on NutraSweet, and that the soda companies would want to shift some of their volume, especially if offered a more attractive price.
Learn more about the battle between NutraSweet and Holland Sweetener
But Coke and Pepsi were caught in a prisoner’s dilemma, as explained by NYU Professor Adam Brandenburger. He said Coke and Pepsi were caught in a situation where it would have been in their interest to switch some volume and get a better price from Holland Sweetener, but neither wanted to move first. Each looked and said, “If we move, will our opponent attack us?” Will Pepsi say to Coke, “You’re changing an ingredient, and it’s changing the taste of your soda.” Maybe that’s not true, but would they try to argue that to the customer? And so, NutraSweet was able to retain those customers. Neither wanted to switch, and Holland Sweetener never made money in the artificial sweetener market.
Common Questions About Failed Business Strategy
Q: What are the reasons why businesses fail?
Businesses can fail due to indifference from the public, a change in the market, or an inability to effectively respond to competition.
Q: Why do big companies fail?
Big companies usually fail due to inadequate leadership, inability to listen to customers and give them what they want, and failure of long-term planning.
Q: How can a business avoid failure?
To avoid failure, businesses should not minimize their competition. In the case of Netflix, even though they were a much smaller company at the start, they still posed a legitimate threat to Blockbuster.
Q: How do you fix a failing company?
If your company is failing, you should go back to the drawing board and ask employees and customers for input.

Alright, so I've got some information here about companies that failed due to lack of business strategy. Let me see what I can gather from these documents.

From Doc 1, it talks about seven business strategy failures, including companies like Iridium, Green Tree Financial, eBay, Kodak, Schlitz Brewing Company, Donald Trump's ventures, and Enron. Each of these companies faced different challenges, but the common theme seems to be that they didn't adapt to changes in their industries or markets.

Doc 2 discusses why business strategies fail and provides examples of companies that failed despite having what seemed like solid strategies. It mentions Kodak, Nokia, Yahoo, and Blockbuster, among others. The reasons cited include not embracing new technologies, poor management, and lack of planning.

Doc 3 delves into five reasons why strategy fails in small, medium, and large businesses. These reasons are:

1. The Blame Game: When strategy fails, there's often a lot of finger-pointing instead of addressing the underlying issues in the strategy creation process.

2. Lack of Team Involvement: Strategy is often developed by a select few without input from the broader team, leading to a disconnect between the strategy and the people who need to implement it.

3. Here We Are -- But Where Are We?: This seems to be about understanding the origins and current state of strategy models and recognizing when key structural elements are missing.

4. Execution: Even with a good strategy, execution can fail if there are no proper processes in place to ensure alignment and adjustment.

5. Decision-Making: Poor decision-making can derail a strategy, especially in dynamic environments where changes need to be addressed promptly.

Doc 4 is a list of 25 worst business failures in history, providing brief descriptions of each. It includes companies like Fashion Café, CBGB, the Edsel, Flooz.com, The Hit Factory, Betamax, SwissAir, Ponzi’s Security Exchange Company, Woolworth’s, Premier Smokeless Cigarette, Bre-X Minerals, IndyMac, Edison Records, Tucker Automobiles, Sharper Image, Washington Mutual Bank, Enron, Polaroid, Atkins Nutritionals, Bethlehem Steel, Pets.com, White Star Lines’ Titanic, Commodore Computers, DeLorean Motor Company, and Pan Am.

Doc 5 discusses three examples of failed business strategies: Netflix vs. Blockbuster, Clorox vs. Procter & Gamble, and NutraSweet vs. Holland Sweetener. It emphasizes the importance of understanding how competitors might respond to strategic moves and the need for preemptive actions to deter entry or to effectively compete.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that when business strategy isn't the driver, several negative outcomes can occur:

1. **Lack of Focus:** Without a clear strategy, companies may spread themselves too thin, pursuing too many opportunities without prioritizing effectively. This can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

2. **Inability to Adapt:** A static strategy fails to account for changes in the market, technology, or consumer behavior. Companies that don't adapt risk becoming obsolete.

3. **Poor Decision-Making:** Without a strategic framework, decisions may be based on short-term gains or personal biases rather than long-term sustainability and growth.

4. **Employee Confusion and Low Morale:** When employees don't understand the company's direction or their role in achieving its goals, it can lead to confusion, low morale, and decreased productivity.

5. **Loss of Investor Confidence:** Stakeholders look for a clear plan and direction from a company. A lack of strategy can erode confidence and lead to divestment.

6. **Competitive Disadvantage:** Rivals who have a well-defined strategy can outmaneuver companies that lack direction, leading to market share losses.

7. **Resource Misallocation:** Without strategic guidance, resources may be wasted on initiatives that don't align with the company's core competencies or market needs.

Looking back at the examples:

- **Kodak** invented the digital camera but didn't pursue it because they thought it wouldn't disrupt their film business. This failure to adapt to technological changes led to their downfall.

- **Blockbuster** had the opportunity to acquire Netflix but declined, missing the shift to online streaming and subscription models.

- **Enron** engaged in fraudulent activities and had a flawed business model that collapsed under scrutiny.

These companies illustrate the importance of having a proactive business strategy that anticipates changes and positions the company to capitalize on new opportunities while mitigating risks.

Moreover, the articles强调了战略制定过程中的参与度和沟通的重要性。当员工没有被纳入战略制定过程中，或者没有机会提供反馈时，他们可能对战略缺乏承诺，从而影响执行效果。

此外，执行是战略成功的关键因素之一。即使有最好的战略，如果执行不力，也会导致失败。因此，确保有适当的流程和系统来支持战略的实施至关重要。

最后，决策质量对于战略的成功也至关重要。在快速变化的商业环境中，公司需要能够迅速做出明智的决策，并根据需要调整战略。

综上所述，如果没有业务战略作为驱动力，公司可能会面临多种问题，包括缺乏焦点、适应能力差、决策不佳、员工士气低落、投资者信心丧失以及竞争力下降。这些因素综合起来可能导致公司的衰败甚至破产。

**最终答案**

$$\boxed{\text{公司可能面临缺乏焦点、适应能力差、决策不佳、员工士气低落、投资者信心丧失以及竞争力下降等问题，最终可能导致衰败或破产。}}$$
