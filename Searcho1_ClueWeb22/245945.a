Alright, so I've got this question about Paine’s style and how it contributes to the persuasiveness of his text. First off, I need to make sure I understand who Paine is and what text we're talking about. I think Paine refers to Thomas Paine, a famous political activist and philosopher from the 18th century. He wrote some really influential works like "Common Sense" and "The Rights of Man." Probably, the text in question is "Common Sense," which played a significant role in inspiring the American Revolution.

So, my task is to analyze how Paine’s writing style makes his arguments more persuasive. To do this, I need to look into the elements of his style: his choice of words, sentence structure, rhetorical devices, and overall approach to presenting his ideas.

First, I should probably read or recall some parts of "Common Sense" to get a sense of his style. But since I don't have the text right now, I might need to look up some excerpts or analyses of his writing style.

Let me start by searching for information on Thomas Paine’s writing style in "Common Sense."

We may look at Paine’s style today and need a second to adjust to how it was written. However, Paine’s style was solid. He wrote to express and explain ideas, to try to bring intellectual thought to a language that the common man could understand.
Paine has flourishes of genius, yes; but Paine’s writing is rarely unnecessarily verbose. It is grounded in a desire to express complex ideas by relating them to other concepts, an interdisciplinary method. Paine’s writing draws information from not only current events, but he consistently pulled from the past. Yet, with a constant eye on the future;

Thomas Paine was a journalist, essayist and social reformer. He wrote to change political opinion and worked as an embedded reporter during the revolutionary war. He wrote for the common man. Presenting social and political issues in ways that resonated emotionally with both farmers and intellectuals.

Was Thomas Paine a slaveholder?
No, not at all. Thomas Paine, called “The Father of the American Revolution", for writing “Common Sense," owned no slaves. He was known to be strongly against slavery. He found it repulsive. He grew up Quaker in England and those Quakers were the starters of the abolitionist movement which both started first in England and had the most success there. It was an article of Quaker faith. Quaker societies cut ties with the slave trade and demanded that all men followed in their footsteps.
He was a member of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negro

How did Britain respond to Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" (1776)? Did other European powers ever get a chance to read Paine’s works? If so, what were their opinions on it?
Paine’s republicanism, in the sense of questioning why monarchs came to be set over society, was certainly not far removed from Enlightenment thought current at the time. But when he followed through, logically enough, in his Age of Reason, to dethrone God as an active participant in human history, he was suddenly seen as a wildly dangerous atheist, and was burned in effigy. A witty epitaph summed it up:
“Here lies TOM PAINE, who wrote in Liberty's defence,/But in his Age of Reason, lost his Common Sense”

Shakespeare's style of writing is Shakespearean. He was one of the creators, perhaps the foremost creator, of early modern English. He invented new words which today are quite common and which we take for granted, such as "amazement" and "lackluster." Some very simple words, such as "luggage" and "bedroom," are credited to Shakespeare. The new words he added to our vocabulary number over 1700. Shakespeare's vocabulary, based on his written remains, is said to be the largest of any writer to date, at 24,000 words.

Originally Answered: Is "Rights of Man" by Thomas Paine worth the read?
Toally… Rights of Man by Thomas paine was the answer to Edmond Burke who criticized the French revolution in support of Monarchy and King rule and heredity power bestowed on them by God. If you accept the premise of Edmond Burke you would have to accept the system of caste too. Just because he writes about anecdotal example of good kings who are benevolent. Burke appeals to your emotions while Paine appeal to your intellection and destroys Burke’s position. You need to read both of them.

Paine was brought up as a Quaker. As an adult, he was an avowed Deist, which meant that he believed in the existence of a Divine Creator while denying revelation, miracles, and the divinity of Christ. He expounded his religious views in his book The Age of Reason. That book proved to be very controversial when it was published. Up to then, deism had primarily been a religious outlook that was prevalent among the well educated gentry.

Thomas Paine states Christianity is a parody on the worship of the sun. What do you think?
No, I don’t think that it is a parody. But it is to some extent syncretic, and has taken aspects of other religions around it during its formative centuries. And these included sun worshiping religions. So some aspects, particularly of ritual and of art, are derived from sun worship.

Brief Biography of Thomas Paine
Thomas Paine was born in England to Joseph (a farmer and corset-maker) and Frances Pain. In his youth, he was apprenticed to his father and then established himself in his father’s trade of corset-making in Sandwich, Kent. By the late 1760s, when Paine was in his thirties, he began taking a deeper interest in civic matters, and his pro-republican, anti-monarchical commitments began to take shape. During a down-and-out period of his life—his business had failed, he had to sell his household in order to avoid debtors’ prison, and he was separated from his wife—he moved to London and met Benjamin Franklin. Soon after, Franklin gave Paine a letter of recommendation, allowing Paine to move and settle in Britain’s American colonies in 1774. Paine began working as a writer and editor, finding success in pitching his essays to a common audience. In 1776, he anonymously published Common Sense and soon followed it up with The American Crisis. After the American Revolution, he served on the Congressional Committee of Foreign Affairs and later moved to France, becoming heavily involved in the French Revolution during the 1790s. For his radical views, he was jailed for a year in Paris, subsequently returning to the United States, where he died in obscurity.

Historical Context of Common Sense
Common Sense was written at the beginning of the American Revolution (1775-1783) which secured the American colonies’ independence from Great Britain. In particular, Paine references Britain’s taxation of the American colonies without adequate representation, dating back to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 and building to such protests as the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Following a 1774 Continental Congress, tensions continued to mount as British soldiers occupied Boston and later tried to destroy colonial military supplies, with battle breaking out at Lexington and Concord in 1775 and Britain finally being expelled from Boston by the Continental Army in March 1776, not long after

Extra Credit for Common Sense
Gone Viral. Common Sense was an unprecedented publishing success. Though estimates vary, it may have sold as many as 500,000 copies in the colonies by the end of the American Revolution, meaning that an estimated 20 percent of colonists would have owned a copy—especially remarkable given that its popularity spread primarily by word of mouth.
Trying Times. In late 1776, George Washington ordered his officers to read part of Paine’s The American Crisis, a pamphlet series following up on Common Sense, to the Continental Army on the eve of the crossing of the Delaware.

'Common Sense' was a pamphlet by Thomas Paine made to tell the public what he thought about America being independent of Great Britain. Learn how the public received his ideas and what the document did for the revolution in America. Updated: 01/06/2022
Thomas Paine
How many times have you seen a commercial that made you really want something? Maybe it was a toy or tickets to a new movie. Today, when companies or people want to publicize their ideas and products, they can make a commercial and show it online or on television.
But during colonial times--long before computers, radios, and televisions--the only way to share information was by speaking or writing. Thomas Paine used the written word to let people know how he felt about what was happening in the world in general, and in the American colonies in particular.
Interestingly enough, Thomas Paine was actually born in Great Britain, the country from which he wanted America to separate! While in London, Thomas Paine met Benjamin Franklin, who convinced him to move to America. In 1774, Paine arrived in Philadelphia and became a journalist, a person who writes for newspapers. Not long afterwards, he wrote 'Common Sense'.

'Common Sense'
Have you ever loved a book so much that you read it over and over? For many American colonists, 'Common Sense' was one of those books, although some consider it a pamphlet because it's so short (just 48 pages). It's considered to be one of the most influential pieces of writing in American history.
Organized into four sections, 'Common Sense' explains why no country should have a king and why the American colonies should come together and rebel against Great Britain. In Part One, Paine describes the difference between government and society, arguing that living as a society is easier and more efficient. However, since people have a tendency to do bad things, there must be a government to protect them.
In Part Two, Paine discusses why he was against the idea of a monarchy, which is a country ruled by a king or queen. As he believed that all men were created equal, one person should not have the authority to rule over thousands. He also opposed someone becoming a king or queen just because he or she had been born into a royal family. He felt this led to unqualified and unfair rulers.

One of the Founding Fathers, Thomas Paine, in his pamphlet, “Common Sense”, addressed a response to the American Revolution. Paine’s purpose for writing the piece was to convince the colonists to declare independence from Great Britain. He adopts a patriotic tone, explaining the advantages of and the need to proclaim independence from a tyrannical country. Paine also utilizes multiple rhetorical strategies, and any means necessary, to persuade his audience to share in his beliefs. With the use of constructed argument and rhetorical devices such as ethos, logos and pathos, as well as diction and syntax, Paine is able to present the argument that the United States should strive for its independence from England.
In the first sentence of Section 3 of Common Sense, Thomas Paine writes ‘In the following pages, I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense” (326). This complex utilization of both syntax and diction right-off-the-bat from Paine shows that he intends on wasting no time in conveying his point. He is presenting his audience with simple facts from which plain arguments will develop, allowing the conclusion to be common sense.

Common Sense (Pamphlet) by Thomas Paine Summary & Full Text
Common Sense (Pamphlet)
View the Complete Text
Common Sense was written by Thomas Paine on January 10, 1776. The 48-page pamphlet presented an argument for freedom from British rule. Paine wrote in such a style that common people could easily understand, using Biblical quotes which Protestants understood. The document played a major part in uniting colonists before the Revolutionary War for freedom from the British. Common Sense also led to the Declaration of Independence later that year.
The Author, Thomas Paine
Ironically, Thomas Paine was born in England. Dropping out of school at age 13, he developed interests in science, religion, and ethics. He tried working in his father’s corset shop, and also worked as a grocer, teacher, and tax collector. His rebellious ideas and political ideas led him to write about various human inequities. In 1774, Paine met Benjamin Franklin in London, where Franklin convinced him to move to America at a time when the colonists were on the brink of revolution. He saw independence as a great cause, declaring his opposition to the British monarchy.
The Intent
Common Sense presented two main points: independence from England, and the creation of a democratic republic. Because of its treasonous content, Paine wrote Common Sense anonymously. He wrote in a language colonists used every day, making a more significant impact in spelling out the inequities which colonists faced under British rule. The clearly defined reasoning in his writing led colonists to unite in the patriotic cause of freedom.  Volcanoes. At a time when American colonists were on the brink of revolution, Common Sense focused on reasons for independence from Britain. Paine pointed out that there was no sense for an island to rule a continent. He reminded the colonists that America was not a British nation, but a nation composed of many different people, of varied influences. He also posed a moral question, asking, “If Britain was the true ‘mother’ country, would a mother burden her children, and treat them badly?” A more practical and less emotional topic was that the distance between the two nations prevented timely correspondence of governing petitions and issues. The charge was that Britain did not consider the best interests of the colonies that represented it. Being a part of Britain would also involve America in unnecessary wars. This would prevent the colonists from foreign trade. Paine pointed out that colonists were oppressed and persecuted under British rule.
The Impact
Thomas Paine’s pamphlet supposedly sold 500,000 copies in its first year of circulation. Because Paine was intent in pointing out an alternative to British rule, he donated any royalties from Common Sense to George Washington’s Continental Army. He intended to assist the oppressed colonists and a fair and worthwhile cause, the American Revolutionary War. To the American colonists, Paine’s straightforward and simply-written expressions made political ideas real to the people. He targeted the deeply felt sentiments of the colonists, presenting reasons for breaking free in a manner that they understood. Common Sense made the war for freedom an individual choice, which could be attained in a united manner by the colonists. Continue to the Full Text »

Alright, so from these search results, I can gather that Thomas Paine was a political activist and philosopher who wrote "Common Sense," a pamphlet that played a significant role in inspiring the American Revolution. His writing style was aimed at the common people, using simple language and appealing to their emotions and reason.

From Doc 1 on Quora, it mentions that Paine wrote to express and explain ideas in a way that the common man could understand. He used flourishes of genius but wasn't unnecessarily verbose. His writing was grounded in expressing complex ideas by relating them to other concepts, often drawing from history and looking toward the future.

Doc 2 from Litcharts provides a brief introduction to "Common Sense," noting that it was a political pamphlet advocating for American independence from Great Britain. It seems like the pamphlet was divided into sections, each addressing different aspects of why independence was necessary and beneficial.

Doc 3 from Study.com offers a simplified explanation of "Common Sense" for kids, emphasizing that Paine wanted to tell the public his thoughts on America being independent of Great Britain. It highlights that the pamphlet was very popular and influential in encouraging the revolution.

Doc 4 appears to be a student's essay analyzing the rhetorical strategies Paine used in "Common Sense." It mentions that Paine employed ethos, logos, and pathos to persuade his audience. The essay also notes Paine's use of syntax and diction to present his arguments effectively.

Doc 5 from TotallyHistory.com gives a summary of "Common Sense," including background on Paine's life and the intent behind the pamphlet. It emphasizes that Paine wrote in a style that common people could understand, using biblical quotes to appeal to Protestant values. The document also highlights the impact of "Common Sense," suggesting it sold hundreds of thousands of copies and influenced the Declaration of Independence.

From these sources, I can see that Paine's style was characterized by simplicity, accessibility, and a direct appeal to the reader's emotions and logic. He used straightforward language and relatable examples to make his case for independence.

To answer the question of how Paine’s style contributes to the persuasiveness of the text, I need to look deeper into specific elements of his style and see how they enhance his arguments.

First, Paine’s use of simple, clear language makes his ideas accessible to a wide audience, including those who weren't educated elites. This democratization of information was crucial in mobilizing public opinion towards independence.

Second, his employment of rhetorical devices like ethos, logos, and pathos helps to build a multi-faceted argument that appeals to readers' sense of morality, logic, and emotion. Ethos establishes his credibility, logos presents logical arguments, and pathos evokes emotional responses.

Third, Paine’s structuring of the pamphlet into sections likely helps organize his thoughts and present a coherent progression of ideas, making it easier for readers to follow and be convinced by his reasoning.

Fourth, his use of historical references and analogies allows readers to connect his arguments to familiar events and concepts, thereby enhancing the persuasiveness of his claims.

Fifth, Paine’s direct address to the reader, perhaps using second-person point of view, creates a sense of intimacy and immediacy, making the reader feel personally engaged with the message.

Lastly, his passionate tone and conviction likely inspire similar feelings in his readers, fostering a sense of urgency and commitment to the cause of independence.

To further support this analysis, I might need to look at specific excerpts from "Common Sense" and examine how Paine’s stylistic choices affect the presentation of his arguments.

Let me consider searching for specific quotes or passages from "Common Sense" to analyze.

“THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated”

“Of all the systems of religion that ever were invented, there is no more derogatory to the Almighty, more unedifying to man, more repugnant to reason, and more contradictory to itself than this thing called Christianity. Too absurd for belief, too impossible to convince, and too inconsistent for practice, it renders the heart torpid or produces only atheists or fanatics. As an engine of power, it serves the purpose of despotism, and as a means of wealth, the avarice of priests, but so far as respects the good of man in general it leads to nothing here or hereafter.”

Common Sense
Thomas Paine
Common Sense is a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775–1776 advocating independence from Great Britain to people in the Thirteen Colonies. Writing in clear and persuasive prose, Paine marshaled moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution, and became an immediate sensation.

Did Thomas Paine say to argue with a person?
To argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring to convert an atheist by scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals.

Voltaire

Do we all have common sense?
Simply put, not everyone can be of average height or weight, temperament or personality, cognitive ability, social status; yet, almost all people think they are (see also: Lake Wobegon Effect). That is, by definition, not everyone can have common sense. Not everyone will have the same definition of common sense.
Why is it called common sense?
In the original 14th century meaning of the term, ‘common sense’ was a sense like our other senses. It was an internal feeling that was regarded as the common bond that united all the other human senses, the ‘five wits’ as they were known, and was something akin to what we now call ‘heart’.
Is common sense more important than intelligence?
Common sense thus is always important except the common sense would change with intelligence and may not remain common sense for others. Hence common sense could be said important but needs to modified with intelligence or else someone else would be seen as more intelligent.

The 5 Best Thomas Paine Quotes From ‘Common Sense’
By: Dominic Lynch
July 03, 2015
7 min read
Independence Day is almost here, and what better way to celebrate it than by honoring Thomas Paine and “Common Sense”?
“Common Sense” was a short work but had an enormous impact on colonial America’s decision to break its ties with Great Britain. Paine was an English defector to the American cause. Born in 1737, he immigrated to America in 1774 after leading a life of disappointment in England. He initially settled in Philadelphia under the tutelage of Richard Bache, Benjamin Franklin’s son-in-law. A year later, he was hired to write for and edit The Pennsylvania Magazine, although he left his position the same year.
In January 1776, two years after arriving in America and six months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, Paine anonymously published “Common Sense” to immediate success. It sold more than 100,000 copies within the first three months, and even today remains one of the best -selling (if not the best-selling) American titles of all time. The pamphlet galvanized support for an armed rebellion and moved America from the lukewarm column into the solidly independent one.
Several factors assisted “Common Sense’s” wild success. First, it was easy to read. Even today, 239 years after it was published, the language remains incredibly simple. Compare “Common Sense” with the writings of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams, or any of the other Founders, and the difference in language, tone, and diction is striking. Paine uses all the high-brow Enlightenment theories that other thinkers used, but he articulated them better than anyone before, and arguably since.
Secondly, it is a short work. The first edition was only 48 pages, and later editions did not add much to the page count. Combined with easy-to-understand language, the work was more accessible to more people, and was often read aloud to the illiterate. Third, and what I believe to be most important, Paine’s reasons for independence really were—and continue to be—common sense. Of course, Paine was biased against Great Britain, but his arguments are nonetheless compelling, and often agreeable. The title of the work is neither a misnomer nor hyperbole. His arguments really are common sense.
Among many great quotes and choice vocabulary, these are the top five quotes from “ Common Sense.”
1. On the Legitimacy of the English Monarchy
England, since the conquest, has known some few good monarchs, but groaned beneath as much larger number of bad ones, yet no man in his senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very honorable one. A French bastard, landing with an armed banditti, and establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives, is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original. It certainly hath no divinity in it. However, it is needless to spend much time in exposing the folly of hereditary right, if there are any so weak as to believe it, let them promiscuously worship the ass and lion, and welcome. I shall neither copy their humility, nor disturb their devotion.
2. On Governance from Abroad
It is repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things, to all examples from the former ages, to suppose, that this continent can longer remain subject to any external power. The most sanguine in Britain does not think so. The utmost stretch of human wisdom cannot, at this time, compass a plan short of separation, which can promise the continent even a year’s security. Reconciliation is now a falacious dream. Nature hath deserted the connexion, and Art cannot supply her place. For, as Milton wisely expresses, ‘never can true reconcilement grow where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep.’
Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual. Our prayers have been rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us, that nothing flatters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings more than repeated petitioning—and nothing hath contributed more than that very measure to make the Kings of Europe absolute: Witness Denmark and Sweden. Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do, for God’s sake, let us come to a final separation, and not leave the next generation to be cutting throats, under the violated unmeaning names of parent and child.
3. On the Cause of Revolution
O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth! Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression. Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia, and Africa, have long expelled her.—Europe regards her like a stranger, and England hath given her warning to depart. O! receive the fugitive, and prepare in time an asylum for mankind.
4. On America’s Natural Advantages and Continental Government
In almost every article of defence we abound. Hemp flourishes even to rankness so that we need not want cordage. Our iron is superior to that of other countries. Our small arms equal to any in the world. Cannon we can cast at pleasure. Saltpetre and gunpowder we are every day producing. Our knowledge is hourly improving. Resolution is our inherent character, and courage hath never yet forsaken us. Wherefore, what is it that we want? Why is it that we hesitate? From Britain we can expect nothing but ruin. If she is once admitted to the government of America again, this Continent will not be worth living in. Jealousies will be always arising; insurrections will be constantly happening; and who will go forth to quell them? Who will venture his life to reduce his own countrymen to a foreign obedience? The difference between Pennsylvania and Connecticut, respecting some unlocated lands, shows the insignificance of a British government, and fully proves that nothing but Continental authority can regulate Continental matters.
5. On Religious Liberty
As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of government to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know of no other business which government hath to do therewith. Let a man throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle, which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head. Suspicion is the companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society. For myself, I fully and conscientiously believe that it is the will of the Almighty that there should be a diversity of religious opinions among us. It affords a larger field for our Christian kindness; were we all of one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter for probation; and on this liberal principle I look on the various denominations among us to be like children of the same family, differing only in what is called their Christian names.
Bonus Quote
Under our present denomination of British subjects, we can neither be received nor heard abroad; the custom of all Courts is against us, and will be so, until by an independence we take rank with other nations.
These proceedings may at first seem strange and difficult, but like all other steps which we have already passed over, will in a little time become familiar and agreeable; and until an independence is declared, the Continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day, yet knows it must be done, hates to set about it, wishes it over, and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity.

Okay, so from these quotes, I can see several themes in Paine’s writing style. He often uses straightforward language and makes bold statements that are easy to understand. For example, in the quote, "These are the times that try men's souls," he captures the essence of challenging times in a simple yet powerful way.

Another notable aspect is his use of metaphors and comparisons. In the quote, "Time makes more converts than reason," he suggests that people are more likely to change their minds over time rather than through logical arguments alone. This shows his understanding of human nature and how persuasion works.

Moreover, Paine frequently appeals to the reader's sense of justice and morality. In "Common Sense," he argues against the institution of monarchy, calling it a source of tyranny and oppression. His rhetoric is designed to evoke emotions and challenge established norms.

Looking back at the earlier search results, especially the analysis from Doc 4, which is a student's essay, it seems that Paine effectively employs ethos, logos, and pathos to strengthen his arguments. Ethos establishes his credibility, logos appeals to logic and reason, and pathos taps into the readers' emotions.

Additionally, Paine's use of historical references and analogies helps to ground his arguments in familiar contexts. For instance, in discussing the flaws of hereditary monarchy, he points out that it's illogical to pass down power based on bloodlines, using examples from history to support his观点.

Furthermore, his repetition of certain phrases and ideas reinforces his message. For example, the recurring theme of independence being necessary for happiness and prosperity is driven home throughout "Common Sense."

Considering all these elements, it's clear that Paine’s style is deliberately crafted to be accessible and persuasive. He wants to reach a broad audience, including those who may not have extensive education, and convince them of the righteousness of the American cause.

To further solidify this analysis, perhaps I should look for scholarly articles or critiques that delve deeper into Paine’s writing techniques in "Common Sense."

Thomas Paine’s Common Sense: Analysis
The power of words is not to be underestimated. In 1776, Thomas Paine released a simple pamphlet that was to change the course of history. As the title “Common Sense” implies, the pamphlet addressed the American people to enlighten their minds, and to persuade them to fight for complete independence from Britain. Despite Paine’s failure to achieve objectivity, it is his appeal to reason, solid argumentation, and straightforwardness that make his pamphlet so powerful.
Common Sense as a whole ignites reason in the minds of the American people. He simply depicts the bitter reality the Americans live under the British rule, then calculates the dire subsequences. “because, any submission to or dependence on Great Britain tends directly to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels, and sets us at variance with nations who would otherwise seek our friendship and against whom we have neither anger nor complaint.”

The American reader would immediately nod at this argument because it is only sensible that the alliance with Britain will drag Americans into needless wars. Paine appealed to reason to enforce his arguments. This stems up from being influenced by the writings of the Age of Reason such as John Locke’s.
“Bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touchstone of nature and then tell me whether you can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully serve the power that hath carried fire and sword into your land?” nature is a reoccurring word in the pamphlet. Paine refers to Locke’s state of nature theory and innate natural rights. He wants the Americans to be fully convinced that Britain is violating their natural right to be free, to own property, and to pursuit happiness.
One of the main reasons Common Sense became so influential is the straightforwardness Paine used to deliver his arguments. Paine knew his audience was mostly common people. Therefore, he avoided ambiguous language and kept away from dense metaphors. This way, the message is reachable and clear. “Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation.
The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’TIS TIME TO PART.” Paine uses short sentences to get right to the point. He also gives bold statements like “Tis Time to Part.” That radiates his confident tone. Moreover, Paine wanted to ridicule his opponents. That is why, he frequently uses sarcasm “ Come, come, we shall be friends again for all this .” By this mimic, he makes those who support reconciliation with Britain feel naïve and ridiculous. Thus, he makes his arguments more valid and more evident.

Benedict Arnold: Biography & General
In Common Sense, Thomas Paine tries to steer clear from subjectivity, yet he fails. In the beginning, he announces that he will present facts and reasonable arguments “In the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense.” Which he does. He gives the reader the impression of an all-knowing author. However, his attitudes towards Britain and her American supporters (also towards religion) force him to resurface as a first-person narrator instead of an omniscient narrator.
“I challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation to show a single advantage that this continent can reap by being connected with Great Britain.” The use of the first-person exposes him to be just a man speaking his mind, and not the all-knowing source of knowledge he leads us to believe. Nonetheless, this technic of hiding his presence in Common Sense gives more credibility to what he says.
Thomas Paine’s Common Sense remains an instrumental literary work that fuelled the determination inside the Americans for independence. It is a simple pamphlet, yet sharper than a sword.

Brief Biography of Thomas Paine
Thomas Paine was born in England to Joseph (a farmer and corset-maker) and Frances Pain. In his youth, he was apprenticed to his father and then established himself in his father’s trade of corset-making in Sandwich, Kent. By the late 1760s, when Paine was in his thirties, he began taking a deeper interest in civic matters, and his pro-republican, anti-monarchical commitments began to take shape. During a down-and-out period of his life—his business had failed, he had to sell his household in order to avoid debtors’ prison, and he was separated from his wife—he moved to London and met Benjamin Franklin. Soon after, Franklin gave Paine a letter of recommendation, allowing Paine to move and settle in Britain’s American colonies in 1774. Paine began working as a writer and editor, finding success in pitching his essays to a common audience. In 1776, he anonymously published Common Sense and soon followed it up with The American Crisis. After the American Revolution, he served on the Congressional Committee of Foreign Affairs and later moved to France, becoming heavily involved in the French Revolution during the 1790s. For his radical views, he was jailed for a year in Paris, subsequently returning to the United States, where he died in obscurity.

Historical Context of Common Sense
Common Sense was written at the beginning of the American Revolution (1775-1783) which secured the American colonies’ independence from Great Britain. In particular, Paine references Britain’s taxation of the American colonies without adequate representation, dating back to the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 and building to such protests as the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Following a 1774 Continental Congress, tensions continued to mount as British soldiers occupied Boston and later tried to destroy colonial military supplies, with battle breaking out at Lexington and Concord in 1775 and Britain finally being expelled from Boston by the Continental Army in March 1776, not long after

Extra Credit for Common Sense
Gone Viral. Common Sense was an unprecedented publishing success. Though estimates vary, it may have sold as many as 500,000 copies in the colonies by the end of the American Revolution, meaning that an estimated 20 percent of colonists would have owned a copy—especially remarkable given that its popularity spread primarily by word of mouth.
Trying Times. In late 1776, George Washington ordered his officers to read part of Paine’s The American Crisis, a pamphlet series following up on Common Sense, to the Continental Army on the eve of the crossing of the Delaware.

Among the most influential authors and reformers of his age, Thomas Paine (1737–1809) was born in England but went on to play an important role in both the American and French Revolutions. In 1774, he emigrated to America where, for a time, he helped to edit the Pennsylvania Magazine. On January 10, 1776, he published his pamphlet Common Sense, a persuasive argument for th

"Time makes more converts than reason." – Thomas Paine
And with that early quote, this reader steadily became enthralled with a founding father. I sincerely wish this novella-sized essay had been required reading while I was still in high school—or at any point in my education, for that matter.
(Okay, if I'm being honest, my teenage self wanted history explained something like this...)

“A pamphlet called ‘Commonsense’ makes a great noise. One of the vilest things that ever was published to the world. Full of false representations, lies, calumny, and treason, whose principles are to subvert all Kingly Governments and erect an Independent Republic.” ~Nicholas Cresswell
One could argue that without Thomas Paine’s ‘Common Sense’ of January 1776, there would be no American Declaration of Independence of July 1776. True there was discontent and animosity between England and Colonial

One of the most important works from any writer during the American War for Independence. During the darkest days of the struggle, Gen.

It is easy to see why it affected people of its time in the way that it did, as it is clearly and simply written and sets forth in undeniable logic the issues in question at the time.

This pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775–1776 makes a case for the independence of the Thirteen Colonies from Great Britain. Taking into consideration examples drawn from antiquity, medieval England, and recent history, written in plain style and distributed widely, it was tailored to appeal to the largest numbers.

4.5 stars. Scathing, derogatory rhetoric directed at the King of England in particular and the British in general designed to arouse the "passions" of the American colonists to embrace the idea of independence from Britian.

Most Americans have at least a general knowledge of the events that sparked the American Revolution. Long story short (and super simplified) — British Parliament passed the Tea Act in mid 1773 allowing a British tea company to sell basically untaxed tea from China in the colonies while the colonists were still being taxed and therefore forced to sell higher priced tea. This set off an intense debate about the colonists being taxed without representation, culminating in the Boston Tea Party. As p

Paine, Thomas, 1737-1809. Thomas Paine’s Common Sense: The Call to Independence. Woodbury, N.Y.: Barron’s Educational Series, Inc., 1975. Print.
Thomas Paine was born in Thetford, Norfolk, on February 9, 1737. Paine was an immigrant to America in 1774 and was then a fighter in the American Revolution. When he wrote Common Sense in 1776, he made history by writing the first paper to support American independence and fight against England. He believed that the colonies no longer needed to be attached to England and that they needed to be able to freely trade with other companies. After he had written The American Crisis, his third pamphlet, he sailed back to Europe where he was later imprisoned. He wrote one final paper before his death in 1809. “Of the Origin and Design of Government in General,” is perhaps the most important section of Common Sense seeing as it talks about the importance of a good society and how we can run a country by being kind to one another.
In writing Common Sense, Thomas Paine is trying to convey to the people on how vital setting up a good society is when creating a new colony. This pamphlet was a groundbreaker, which is why Thomas was very careful in his choice of words here. He wanted to express his feeling to the public, while also giving them a fair chance to believe what they wanted to believe. He thought that the king should not have a role in the colonies choices and that they should be able to have a country of their own. Paine also thinks that if America steps up and becomes an independent country, many others will follow in these footsteps. Through this pamphlet, Paine wanted to show others how having a strong society built on the right beliefs could make this country great.
Thomas states in the first section of Common Sense, “Society in every state is a blessing, but Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil” (Paine, pge 2). He believed that the government put a cap on how advanced the people of this nation could be. Although Paine had many suggestions as to how to remedy the problem, his biggest push was to just have people be kind to one another. If people were just kind, there would be no need for rebuking, which means no need for the government. One example that Paine gave was the thought of a group of people on a secluded island. This group of people would learn to work together as a society, and would not need a monarchy ruling over them. This example was to combats England’s opinion that every country needs one ruler to govern all of the people. Though the colonists may have read what Paine was trying to convey, he now had to get his plan of a new society into action.
Throughout this pamphlet Paine has stated his views – anonymously – many times, it was up to the people now on what course of action they wanted to take. In his final thoughts, Thomas Paine had a sense of urgency to separate from the king and from England. He believed that if the colonies did not spit from England, they would not be able to stay together. In response to the king’s speech, (urging the colonies not to rebel) Paine combated by saying that the king’s speech did not scare the colonists but made ready for war. Though his opinion was unpopular at first, Thomas Paine had the courage to put himself out there and stand for a change. Paine was a very passionate man about the subject of society and government, and I believe our country is better for it. He pushed for the things he believed in – separating from England – and tried to show others that if you love each other and care for one another we can help the greater good.

From these additional search results, I can see that "Common Sense" was a pivotal work in galvanizing support for American independence from Great Britain. Paine's straightforward language and compelling arguments resonated with the colonists, helping to shift public opinion towards revolution.

In Doc 1 from SparkNotes, there's a summary of "Common Sense" divided into sections, which suggests that Paine structured his pamphlet methodically to build his case for independence. This structural approach likely aided in the persuasiveness of his writing, as it allowed readers to follow his logic step by step.

Doc 2 from SchoolWorkHelper provides an analysis of "Common Sense," highlighting Paine's appeal to reason, solid argumentation, and straightforwardness. The author notes that Paine's use of John Locke's ideas on natural rights强化了他的论点，使读者信服英国正在侵犯他们的自然权利。

Doc 3 from Litcharts offers a concise introduction to "Common Sense," including historical context and key themes. It mentions that Paine's writing was aimed at a broad audience, using language that was accessible to common people, which aligns with the earlier observations about his style.

Doc 4 from Goodreads includes a synopsis of "Common Sense" and mentions that it was written to argue for American independence from Great Britain. The synopsis touches on Paine's criticism of hereditary monarchy and his advocacy for a democratic republic, which are central themes in the pamphlet.

Doc 5 from Essaysauce.com provides an analysis of "Common Sense," focusing on Paine's views on society and government. The essay emphasizes Paine's belief in the importance of a good society and his idea that kindness among people could reduce the need for government intervention.

Overall, these sources reinforce the idea that Paine's style in "Common Sense" was characterized by clarity, directness, and a compelling use of reason and emotion to persuade his audience. His ability to present complex ideas in a simple manner and to connect with the common people was key to the pamphlet's success and influence on the American Revolution.

To further explore how Paine's style contributes to the persuasiveness of "Common Sense," I might consider looking at specific rhetorical strategies he employed, such as the use of rhetorical questions, appeals to patriotism, and the framing of independence as a natural and necessary step for the colonies.

Perhaps I should look for academic articles or criticism that delve into the rhetorical techniques used in "Common Sense."

One of the Founding Fathers, Thomas Paine, in his pamphlet, “Common Sense”, addressed a response to the American Revolution. Paine’s purpose for writing the piece was to convince the colonists to declare independence from Great Britain. He adopts a patriotic tone, explaining the advantages of and the need to proclaim independence from a tyrannical country. Paine also utilizes multiple rhetorical strategies, and any means necessary, to persuade his audience to share in his beliefs. With the use of constructed argument and rhetorical devices such as ethos, logos and pathos, as well as diction and syntax, Paine is able to present the argument that the United States should strive for its independence from England.
In the first sentence of Section 3 of Common Sense, Thomas Paine writes ‘In the following pages, I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense” (326). This complex utilization of both syntax and diction right-off-the-bat from Paine shows that he intends on wasting no time in conveying his point. He is presenting his audience with simple facts from which plain arguments will develop, allowing the conclusion to be common sense.

Thomas Paine "Common Sense" Rhetorical Analysis - Rosalie Swinarski
Thomas Paine "Common Sense" Rhetorical Analysis
11/25/2014
10 Comments
Writer, Thomas Paine, in his pamphlet, "Common Sense", addresses the problems arising under British rule. Paine’s main purpose is to use syntax, pathos, and other literary devices to bring awareness to the problems coming about and to convince people to start doing something about it. Throughout the pamphlet, Thomas Paine develops a very informal and sometimes even sarcastic tone when writing. Paine does this to use rhetorical questions and grab the attention of the reader. He also uses this as a way to persuade the reader to take action against the British so that problems in America will not get worse.
Paine begins in the introduction by using syntax to describe what he will talk about throughout the pamphlet. He explains that one of his main purposes of writing the piece was to help people and bring awareness to situations, and not compliment on what they’ve done so far. He then goes on to say that America will be affected by the actions of all men and little problems shouldn’t be challenged, for example, what should be right in the first place. This is simply “Common Sense” to him.
Paine then starts to move on and continue to use syntax and lists throughout his writing. Syntax is one of the main rhetorical strategies used in the pamphlet. Paine uses it to help build emotion, describe relationships, and give parallels or opposites. In this case, he uses syntax to make a list of what he believes to be Common Sense. He talks about how a man should be able to cast aside all prejudice and focus on the bigger problems and broaden his perspective of things.
Paine also uses metaphors in his work. Paine uses the metaphor of a parent-child relationship when talking about Britain and America. He describes how England isn’t a good mother country for abandoning its child (America) and forcing conflict onto her. He then goes on to say that Europe should be the “adopted parent” country to America because it is there where she is safe and treated kindly. This parent image is repeated throughout the pamphlet and used to prove that America should seek its independence from Britain.
Thomas Paine’s use of parallels and pathos help to build emotion even though he says he’s purpose isn’t to build fear or hysteria. He contradicts himself by making a list of positives and giving a negative opposite to follow. This helps to build fear and describe what kind of men people are being faced with: “...weak men who cannot see, prejudiced men who will not see…” Not only does this state opposites, but it also states the weaknesses of men and he is pointing out flaws.
Thomas Paine concludes with using rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions help Paine to reach his purpose by using a form of persuasion. He is asking a question to make himself seem more valid, but not actually wanting an answer. For example, he uses a list of them on page 331, asking his readers if any of these situations has ever happened to them. It helps him to gain his purpose of persuasion by building more emotion with every question he asks. It also helps him to gain a more informal tone so that it’ll seem like he is appealing to the reader.
Paine helps to get his purpose across to his readers by using syntax to help make lists and build emotions. He also uses the image of a parent-child relationship to show how America was being neglected by Great Britain and it was only harming them to not try to become an independent nation. Paine thought that America would bring itself to disaster by not fighting for independence and that is what he tried to persuade his readers of in "Common Sense".

Thomas Paine’s Common Sense: Analysis
The power of words is not to be underestimated. In 1776, Thomas Paine released a simple pamphlet that was to change the course of history. As the title “Common Sense” implies, the pamphlet addressed the American people to enlighten their minds, and to persuade them to fight for complete independence from Britain. Despite Paine’s failure to achieve objectivity, it is his appeal to reason, solid argumentation, and straightforwardness that make his pamphlet so powerful.
Common Sense as a whole ignites reason in the minds of the American people. He simply depicts the bitter reality the Americans live under the British rule, then calculates the dire subsequences. “because, any submission to or dependence on Great Britain tends directly to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels, and sets us at variance with nations who would otherwise seek our friendship and against whom we have neither anger nor complaint.”

The American reader would immediately nod at this argument because it is only sensible that the alliance with Britain will drag Americans into needless wars. Paine appealed to reason to enforce his arguments. This stems up from being influenced by the writings of the Age of Reason such as John Locke’s.
“Bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touchstone of nature and then tell me whether you can hereafter love, honour, and faithfully serve the power that hath carried fire and sword into your land?” nature is a reoccurring word in the pamphlet. Paine refers to Locke’s state of nature theory and innate natural rights. He wants the Americans to be fully convinced that Britain is violating their natural right to be free, to own property, and to pursuit happiness.
One of the main reasons Common Sense became so influential is the straightforwardness Paine used to deliver his arguments. Paine knew his audience was mostly common people. Therefore, he avoided ambiguous language and kept away from dense metaphors. This way, the message is reachable and clear. “Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation.
The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’TIS TIME TO PART.” Paine uses short sentences to get right to the point. He also gives bold statements like “Tis Time to Part.” That radiates his confident tone. Moreover, Paine wanted to ridicule his opponents. That is why, he frequently uses sarcasm “ Come, come, we shall be friends again for all this .” By this mimic, he makes those who support reconciliation with Britain feel naïve and ridiculous. Thus, he makes his arguments more valid and more evident.

Benedict Arnold: Biography & General
In Common Sense, Thomas Paine tries to steer clear from subjectivity, yet he fails. In the beginning, he announces that he will present facts and reasonable arguments “In the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense.” Which he does. He gives the reader the impression of an all-knowing author. However, his attitudes towards Britain and her American supporters (also towards religion) force him to resurface as a first-person narrator instead of an omniscient narrator.
“I challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation to show a single advantage that this continent can reap by being connected with Great Britain.” The use of the first-person exposes him to be just a man speaking his mind, and not the all-knowing source of knowledge he leads us to believe. Nonetheless, this technic of hiding his presence in Common Sense gives more credibility to what he says.
Thomas Paine’s Common Sense remains an instrumental literary work that fuelled the determination inside the Americans for independence. It is a simple pamphlet, yet sharper than a sword.

The era of the 1770’s was one of confusion, rebellion, and liberation. The British had stopped its salutary neglect of the American colonies and now taxed them heavily to make up for their losses in the seven years’ war. During this turmoil, an upstarting journalist in Philadelphia by the name of Thomas Paine wrote a pamphlet entitled common sense. His simple purpose for this fairly large document was for his fellow man to set aside his or her prejudices and listen to his arguments; mainly that the time for talking has passed and the only thing left to do is raise arms. Paine wields the argumentative appeals, Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in a strong and yet eloquent way that adds immense power to his disputes with Britain.
Paine begins by establishing a credible ethos that he adapts throughout the discussion. Paine “offers nothing more than simple facts, plain arguments, and common sense” and is not “induced by motives of pride, party or resentment” because he is unbiased in the topics discussed. This shows how Paine is a person who values the facts above his personal beliefs. This allows other people to believe in what he says because they know he is not trying to sway them in his favor. Later on Paine’s passion for the topic is plainly shown because he believes “the sun never shined on a cause of greater worth” and that it is “our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourselves, to renounce the alliance”. Paine is not a regular journalist writing for no reason but one that truly believes in the cause of liberation. People who understand this will listen because they know he means what he says. ---. Paine’s ethos is adapted to the different situation he is talking about to most benefit the points he is making.
Pathos is a unique but devastating tool that Paine employs to add emotional emphasis to his arguments. Patriotism is what will help us for “Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith and honor” and we shall “render this continent the glory of the earth”. These simple works inspire patriotism in the reader for they show how great we can be if we choose liberation. By using this feeling, Paine makes the reader feel like it is there duty and patriotic will to fight for their new country. Furthermore Paine points out that Britain “would have defended Turkey from the same motive, viz. — for the sake of trade and dominion” and asks if “your house [has] been burnt? Your property been destroyed before your face? Your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on, or bread to live on?” or “Have you lost a parent or a child by their hands, and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor?”. Britain is not the nice governing country they want people to believe and uses these facts open the colonists to that idea. Paine shows that there is no other course of action than to fight back against those that have wronged you. ---. Paine establishes a variety of emotions via pathos that help the reader to understand why he is making these points.
One of the most overwhelming tools that Paine uses is Logos for it is one of the backbones to his entire pamphlet, you should do something because it is logical to do it. An overriding idea in this time is that the colonies need Britain because we have needed them in the past. Paine simply rebuts this by pointing out that “we may as well assert that because a child has thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat” and continues on with “that the first twenty years of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty”. It doesn’t make sense to say that just because it worked in the past, it will also work in the future. Another idea presented is that Britain protects the colonies from enemies in war. However Paine reminds colonist that “we should be at peace with France and Spain” and “France and Spain never were, nor perhaps ever will be, our enemies as Americans, but as our being the subjects of Great Britain.” If the colonies were not part of Britain, then they would not be in any wars or in any danger from attack. ---. Logos is heavily used in Thomas Paine’s pamphlet because it is a major factor in his arguments.
Thomas Paine used Ethos, Pathos, and Logos very adamantly to further his arguments and help the reader understand where he was coming from and what he wished to be accomplished. He wanted colonist to fight against the British and unshackle themselves from its repressive monarchy. He told of how the British is not a help, but in fact a burden that leads to war, death, and destruction. The British have put Boston in a terrible position for simple protests against unfair taxation of tee. In addition they massacred many innocent colonists in Lexington just to put a stop to two men that they had a disagreement with.
