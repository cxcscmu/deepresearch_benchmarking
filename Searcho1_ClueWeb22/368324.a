I'm trying to understand why some people think the cost of the death penalty is worth it. So, first off, I need to consider what the death penalty is and what costs are associated with it. The death penalty is a legal punishment where a person convicted of a serious crime, usually murder, is executed by the state. Now, costs involved would include legal proceedings, housing the inmate on death row, and the execution process itself.

But, I guess the question isn't so much about the financial costs, but rather whether the benefits outweigh the costs, making it worth it. So, perhaps I should think about the reasons people support the death penalty and see if those reasons justify the expenses involved.

Let me consider some possible arguments in favor of the death penalty. One common argument is that it acts as a deterrent to serious crimes, meaning that the threat of execution discourages potential criminals from committing severe offenses. Another argument is that it provides retribution, or just deserts, for the most heinous crimes. Some also argue that it saves long-term costs by avoiding the need for lifelong incarceration.

First, regarding deterrence: Does the death penalty actually deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment without parole? This is a tricky question because it requires looking at statistical data and studies on the subject. I recall that there have been many studies trying to establish a link between the death penalty and reduced homicide rates, but the results are mixed.

Let me look into this further. Maybe I can find some recent research or reports on the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent.

Does the Death Penalty Deter Crime?
Richard  Berk
There have been claims for decades that in the United States the death penalty serves as a deterrent. When there are executions, violent crime decreases. But there have also been claims that executions “brutalize” society because government agencies diminish respect for life when the death penalty is applied. With brutalization comes an increase in violent crime, and especially homicides. Both sides assert that there is credible research supporting their position. In fact, a committee of the National Research Council has concluded that existing studies are far too methodologically flawed to draw conclusions one way or another. Neither side can maintain that they have empirical support. In most years, most states execute no one, and that pattern seems to be on the rise. One cannot study the impact of executions when they are hardly ever imposed, and it is difficult to separate any impact of the death penalty from the large number of other factors that affect the amount and kinds of crime. The committee’s conclusion about the claim that the death penalty deters is “can’t tell.”

Overview
Deterrence is probably the most commonly expressed rationale for the death penalty. The essence of the theory is that the threat of being executed in the future will be sufficient to cause a significant number of people to refrain from committing a heinous crime they had otherwise planned. Deterrence is not principally concerned with the prevention of further killing by an already convicted death-penalty defendant. That falls under the topic of incapacitation.
Deterrence should not be considered in a vacuum. The critical question is not whether potential criminals will be dissuaded from killing because they would face the death penalty rather than no punishment at all. Other punishments such as life without parole might provide equal deterrence at far less costs and without the attendant risk of executing an innocent person. Whether the death penalty is a proven method of lowering the murder rate has been subjected to many studies over many decades.
It is not enough to compare jurisdictions with the death penalty to those without unless the study controls for the many other variables that could affect the murder rate. For example, lower unemployment rates correlate with lower crime rates. More police involvement in the local community seems to reduce crime. The death penalty affects only a tiny percentage of even those who commit murder. Its effect is very difficult to pinpoint, and the National Academy of Sciences has concluded that past studies have neither proven nor disproven a deterrent effect.
At Issue
If the death penalty is not a proven deterrent to murder, is it worth the excessive costs, risks of error, uncertainty of completion, and other problems that are inherent to its practice? On the political level, the deterrent value of the death penalty is often taken for granted without a careful examination of the research or a consideration of less risky alternatives. This is especially relevant given that death penalty use has been declining dramatically. Most states are not carrying out any executions in a given year.
What DPIC Offers
DPIC has collected many of the deterrent studies that have been conducted in the modern era and has summarized their results. It also provides some of the raw data on which such studies rely, such as the murder rate for each state in each year in the modern era, along with the number of executions and death sentences for each state in the same periods.

Capital punishment is such a costly, controversial, and divisive issue that, unless it succeeds in saving lives, it clearly should be abolished – as it already has been in the European Union and in 101 countries around the world But does the death penalty save lives?  Let’s consider the relevant factors and the evidence.
Some feel the question of whether the death penalty deters can be argued as a matter of theory: capital punishment is worse than other penalties therefore it must lead to fewer killings. This contention misses much of the complexity of the modern death penalty.  First, theory can’t tell us whether the spectacle of state-sanctioned killings operates to unhinge marginal minds into thinking that their own grievances merit similar forms of retribution that they then try to inflict on their own. Even if some other criminals were deterred by the death penalty, one must ask whether these avoided crimes would be more than offset by the possible brutalisation effect.
Second, operating a death penalty regime – at least in the United States – has been incredibly costly, as each case resulting in a death sentence will spend years in various types of legal appeals, eating up the valuable time of judges, prosecutors, and defence lawyers, overwhelmingly at government expense.
The best research on the issue suggests that life imprisonment is a less costly penalty, since locking someone up is far less expensive than both locking them up and paying a team of lawyers for many years – often decades – to debate whether a sentence of death should be imposed. In California, for example, execution is only the third leading cause of death for those on death row (behind old age and suicide).
Some might contend that the lengthy appeals are a needless burden that should be jettisoned so that the penalty is administered more cheaply and quickly, but the large number of exonerations of those on death row (155 including 21 by DNA evidence at last count) underscores the danger of any effort to short circuit the judicial process. Killing a few innocent defendants is an unavoidable consequence of having a capital regime – so unless there is some clear evidence of deterrence, it is hard to argue positively for the death penalty.
Lack of evidence
So what is the evidence on deterrence?  Here the answer is clear: there is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion.
A number of studies – all of which, unfortunately, are only available via subscripton – purported to find deterrent effects but all of these studies collapse after errors in coding, measuring statistical significance, or in establishing causal relationships are corrected. A panel of the National Academy of Sciences addressed the deterrence question directly in 2012 and unanimously concluded that there was no credible evidence that the death penalty deters homicides.
The report went on to say that the issue of deterrence should be removed from any discussion of the death penalty given this lack of credible evidence.  But if the deterrence argument disappears, so does the case for the death penalty.
Troy Davis was executed in Georgia in September 2011. World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, CC BY
Those familiar with criminal justice issues are not surprised by the lack of deterrence. To get the death penalty in the United States one has to commit an extraordinarily heinous crime, as evidenced by the fact that last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place.
Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment.
Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction.
Wasted resources
A better way to address the problem of homicide is to take the resources that would otherwise be wasted in operating a death penalty regime and use them on strategies that are known to reduce crime, such as hiring and properly training police officers and solving crimes.
Over the past three decades there has been a downward trend in the number of murders that lead to arrest and conviction to the point that only about half of all murders are now punished. The graphic below shows the steady decline in the number of homicides cleared by arrest in Connecticut, which mimics the national trend. Of course, even if there is an arrest, there may not be a conviction so the percentage of killers who are punished is smaller than this figure suggests.
Murder cases cleared by arrest or other means: 1970 - 2009. John Donohoe, Author provided
Far better for both justice and deterrence if the resources saved by scrapping the death penalty could be used to increase the chance that killers would be caught and punished –  and taken off the streets.
To give a sense of the burden of capital punishment, note that over the past 35 years the state of California spent roughly $4 billion to execute 13 individuals. The $4 billion would have been enough to hire roughly 80,000 police officers who, if appropriately assigned, would be expected to prevent 466 murders (and much other crime) in California – far more than any of the most optimistic (albeit discredited) views of the possible benefits of capital punishment.
In other words, since the death penalty is a costly and inefficient system, its use will waste resources that could be expended on crime-fighting measures that are known to be effective. It is not surprising that last summer a federal judge ruled that California’s capital regime is unconstitutional on the grounds that it serves no legitimate penological interest.
The sharp decline in executions in the US from the peak of 98 in 1999 down to 35 last year (with death sentences falling from a 1996 peak of 315 to 73), coupled with the steady pace of states abolishing the death penalty over the past eight years (including conservative Nebraska in May) shows that “smart on crime” entails shunning capital punishment.
With zero evidence that the death penalty provides any tangible benefits and very clear indications of its monetary, human, and social costs, this is one programme about which there can be little debate that its costs undeniably outweigh any possible benefits.

Does the death penalty act as a deterrent to crime?
Medieval Justice
Does the death penalty act as a deterrent to crime?
No is the short and long answer.
Shoaib Daniyal
Aug 01, 2015 · 09:15 am
“Studies and statistics support the view that there is no direct correlation between death penalty and deterrence,” wrote Shashi Tharoor, one of the few Indian politicians to take a stand against the death penalty in the wake of Yakub Memon’s hanging.
That’s what everyone says when supporting the abolition of the death penalty, right? But, to apply Wikipedia’s standards to this debate, where’s the citation? Is there really no correlation between the death penalty and a reduction in crime?
First, let’s sharpen the query. The question isn’t whether the death penalty provides a deterrent effect. The question is, “Does the death penalty provide a deterrent effect that is greater than that of long-term incarceration”. If not, then it’s obvious that the death penalty is redundant from the point of view of deterrence.
American lesson
The United States has had a long history of debate on the death penalty and it’s instructive to look at some studies there.
The first thing researchers would look for is a correlation between homicide rates and the death penalty. If the death penalty had a significant deterrent effect compared to other methods of punishment, such as long-term incarceration, then it should come up in the data. Think of, say, higher rates of obesity among soft drink consumers or higher rates of cancer in smokers as an equivalent study.
Researcher Thorsten Sellin took American crime data from 1920 to 1958 and ran a comparison between US states which had the death penalty and neighbouring states which had abolished it.
Sellin found no apparent correlation in the rate of homicides with the existence of a death penalty. Neighbouring states had similar crime patterns, unaffected by whether they were willing to hang people or not.
Moreover, when states removed the death penalty, they didn’t see more murders. In fact, when North Carolina stopped executing people in 2006, it saw a fall in its murder rate.
Brutalisation effect
This effect holds even today. In fact, at present, US states without a death penalty have lower rates of murder than states with a death penalty.
This increase in murder rates with the death penalty – the “brutalisation effect”, as it’s called, is actually not that uncommon. California, as it so happens, had higher rates of murder between 1952 and 1967, when it was executing people, as compared to 1968-’91 when it wasn’t. In a study conducted by Bower and Pierce, it was found that between 1907 and 1963 in New York, murder rates increased on an average in the month following an execution.
While all of this is compelling data, it must be noted that none of these completely rule out the deterrent effect of executions. They just prove that it’s not very large, at best. The issue here is that researchers are hamstrung by the fact that they can only conduct a very limited number of empirical experiments, since of course, you can’t, say, execute people on a whim to test your hypothesis.
Grey area
In fact, in 1976, a study by economist Isaac Ehrlich showed a slight negative relationship, between the murder rate and the execution rate. This created quite a stir in the US, since much of the public mood there, quite like in India, is rather in favour of the death penalty.
Unfortunately, Ehrlich’s study didn’t hold up too well to scrutiny. John Lamperti, Professor of Mathematics, Dartmouth College, writes that “indication of deterrence was extremely unstable when small changes were made in Ehrlich’s assumptions”.
“The earlier conclusion, that US murder statistics give no evidence for a unique deterrent effect of capital punishment, still stands,” summarised Lamperti.
As noted above, given the limitations of the type of experiments researchers can conduct, they can never be 100% sure that there is no deterrent effect of capital punishment. Or, for that matter, be 100% sure that there is one. As John Lamperti noted, an ideal experiment would be along the lines of the Salk vaccine trial, where almost a million children were involved, some being administered the real vaccine and others a placebo. Of course, nothing like that can be carried out for the death penalty for obvious moral reasons. We can’t put people to death to conduct an experiment.
Consensus on its redundancy
Nevertheless, we can be quite sure that even if there is a deterrent effect, it is small. And most of the people who matter think it is either nonexistent or is small enough to be ignored for all practical purposes. In other words, there is a consensus on the redundancy of the death penalty in deterring crime.
In a 2009 survey, Professor Michael Radelet and Traci Lacock of the University of Colorado found that an overwhelming majority of top US criminologists didn’t think the death penalty had any special deterrent effect on murder rates.
This result is backed by a survey of police chiefs in the US too, for whom more usage of the death penalty is an area of least concern. “I have seen the ugliness of murder up close and personal,” said Gregory Ruff, a US police officer for 23 years. “But I have never heard a murder suspect say they thought about the death penalty as a consequence of their actions prior to committing their crimes.”
The company India keeps
Given this overwhelming consensus on its lack of effectiveness, countries as a whole are moving away from the death penalty. The UK abolished it in 1973, Canada in 1976, France in 1981, Australia in 1985, Italy in 1994, Spain and South Africa in 1995. The United States is the outlier here in the developed world since it still retains death penalty (not only in this case, in the First World the US is a conservative leader ). As the Economist puts it, “America is unusual among rich countries in that it still executes people”, but support for the move is falling and it’s only a matter of time before it does away with it too. At the state level, already 38% of US states have abolished the death penalty.
Meanwhile, India is in depressing company when it comes to allowing death sentences. Some of the other prominent countries which allow state-sanctioned murder as a means of justice are China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, North Korea and, fittingly, our subcontinental twin, Pakistan.

Does the Death Penalty Effectively Deter Crime?
The death penalty in America has been effective since 1608. Throughout the years following the first execution, criminal behaviors have begun to deteriorate. Capital punishment was first formed to deter crime and treason. As a result, it increased the rate of crime, according to researchers. Punishing criminals by death does not effectively deter crime because criminals are not concerned with consequences, apprehension, and judges are not willing to pay the expenses.
During the stage of mens rea, thoughts of committing a crime also known as a “guilty mind”, a quick thought of what crime will happen and how it will be conducted is decided. There’s not enough time to think of the consequence, “The findings suggest that 76% of active criminals and 89% of the most violent criminals either perceive no risk of apprehension or are incognizant of the likely punishments for their crimes.”(The Deterrence Hypothesis) Concluding this hypothesis criminals are convinced they will get away with the crime so they do not plan for the possible consequences.

When committing a crime, the person doing it does not carefully think through the sequences. According to Maggie Koerth, “The interviews suggested that people trying to prevent crime don’t always understand how people think when they are committing crimes.” The government officials only create fundamentals based on the aftermath of a crime. Although laws are created to prevent crime, it does not stand for the “what if “circumstances. The only thoughts on a criminal’s mind at the instant of the action is how they will do it, if was premeditated. When a crime such as murder is off of impulse, something happens to trigger harmful activity; their only thoughts are why they are doing it. In either circumstance criminals will think of themselves as not apprehendable. As a result, criminals continue to transgress because they have no intent of getting caught so there is no need to think about consequences.
The procedure leading up to capital punishment plays a huge role in how serious criminals take apprehension. In a criminal’s mind, apprehension is not a problem because at least 30 percent of crimes go unsolved. According to New York Post, “A new FBI report found that roughly 40 percent of the nation’s slayings went unsolved last year.” Meaning that over 6,000 criminals got away with crime. The serious crimes of people who really deserve the death penalty never get it.
Capital punishment has become an useless source of punishment. “After more than 40 years of experimenting with capital punishment, it is time to recognize that we have found no way to narrow the death penalty so that it applies only to the “worst of the worst. “It also remains prone to terrible errors and unacceptable arbitrariness.”(Laurence H. Tribe) A Couple of errors would be wrongfully sentencing someone to death and too many retrials. Wrongful verdicts can cause the retrials which leads to turn overs. Retrials help free people who were sentenced to death on the wrong term. “For cases whose outcomes are known, an astonishing 82% of retried death row inmates turned out not to deserve the death penalty; 7% were not guilty.”(Technical Errors Can Kill)
In the early periods of the death penalty in Georgia a person would have been hung. Alice Riley was the first person executed in Georgia; she was hung for murder. These executions were free and the criminals were easily detected. The way the court system has improved and the new expenses have a great impact on the availability of performing executions now compared to earlier centuries. Not only is the death penalty useless, it’s expensive. Sentencing death is least likely for first time offenders so they are more likely to be convicted of the most dangerous crimes. “The average cost of defending a trial in a federal death case is $620,932, about 8 times that of a federal murder case in which the death penalty is not sought.”(Death Penalty Information center) Researchers believe that because the death penalty is so expensive, they are least likely to sentence a person to it. This makes offenders more likely to consider enacting any crimes they feel necessary.
Debt in the courtroom is increasing as criminal behavior expands. According to DPIC, “because of the high costs of pursuing death penalty cases, Georgia’s public defender system has run out of funds. Most of state’s 72 capital cases have been brought to a standstill. The judge in one recent high-profile case has put off jury selection until September 10 because of the funding crisis.” “Our current death penalty system does not “work” when two of three death verdicts are too flawed to serve their purpose, when most can’t be salvaged and when the cost of each failed verdict is measured in hundreds of thousands of tax dollars, decades of time and untold anguish for victims needing closure.” During this period of contraction, criminals are becoming more defenseless. They are feeling as if the death penalty is collapsing. Over the years, Georgia has had a higher a higher rate of death sentences than every previous year. This is which causes the extreme debt and gap for murderers to get away with crime.
In conclusion, the penal system, courts, corrections and police, has evolved over the years. The evolution of the courts has caused an disruption in deterrence of crime. The death penalty was proven non-deterrent based off of how criminals think today compared to the past century. Consequences are never considered right before committing a crime because there is not enough time to think. Apprehension has become harder over the years. Criminals are now fleeing and covering their tracks making it hard to detain them or know what law was actually violated. The debt of America has also become a problem in executions. It limits the amount of people who should actually be put on death row. As followed, these factors make criminals doubt they will experience death row.

Alright, so I've looked into whether the death penalty deters crime, and it seems like there's a lot of disagreement and conflicting evidence. Some people think it does deter crime because the fear of death might stop potential criminals, while others argue that there's no real proof that it works, and that other factors play bigger roles in preventing crime.

From what I've read, especially in that report from the National Research Council, it seems like the studies on this topic are too flawed to make a clear conclusion. So, maybe the death penalty doesn't necessarily deter crime more than other punishments.

Now, another argument for the death penalty is retribution—that some crimes are so heinous that the only appropriate punishment is death. This is more about justice and giving victims' families a sense of closure. But, is that enough to justify the costs and controversies surrounding the death penalty?

Also, some argue that the death penalty saves money in the long run by avoiding the need to house inmates for life. But, from what I've seen in some of the articles, the process of pursuing the death penalty is actually more expensive due to the extensive legal procedures and appeals.

So, if the death penalty isn't a better deterrent and is more costly, why do some people still think it's worth it? Maybe it's because of moral beliefs or a sense of justice that demands the ultimate punishment for the most serious crimes.

But, I have to consider whether that justifies the risks, like executing innocent people. There have been cases where individuals on death row have been exonerated, which is a huge concern.

Perhaps the value of the death penalty lies in its symbolic importance rather than its practical benefits. It sends a strong message about society's condemnation of certain crimes.

However, I'm not sure if that symbolic value is enough to outweigh the actual costs and risks involved.

Maybe I need to look into other aspects, like the impact on victims' families. Do they feel a sense of closure from executions, and is that worth the resources spent on the death penalty?

Alternatively, are there other ways to support victims' families that might be more effective and less costly?

I should also consider international perspectives. Many developed countries have abolished the death penalty without seeing increases in crime rates. What can we learn from their experiences?

Overall, it seems like the death penalty is a complex issue with no clear-cut answers. While some may see it as worth the cost for reasons of deterrence or retribution, the evidence isn't conclusive, and there are significant drawbacks to consider.

In the end, deciding whether the death penalty is worth it comes down to weighing these factors and determining what prioritizes societal values and safety most effectively.
