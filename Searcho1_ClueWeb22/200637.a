Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects birds. I don't know too much about this topic off the top of my head, so I think I should start by doing some research. I'll use the search tool to look up information on climate change and its impacts on birds.

First, I'll search for "climate change effects on birds." Let me write that down.

Issues
A discussion of avian responses to climate change is of interest for a number of reasons. First, because birds are relatively easy to identify and measure and their responses to environmental perturbation are relatively well known, they are useful as indicators of ecological change (1). Furthermore, birds are of conservation interest in their own right. Bird populations face global conservation challenges, with 1 in 8 species facing a high risk of extinction in the near future according to a recent report (2). Finally, birds perform significant ecosystem services with consequences for human health and well-being, including pest control, sanitation, seed dispersal and pollination (3).

Likely Changes
Research on birds has shown that climate change affects birds both directly and indirectly. The distributions of birds are closely associated with both winter and summer temperatures, and increased temperatures due to climate change may directly affect birds by forcing them to use more energy for thermoregulation. This can disrupt their maintenance (the energy needed by organisms to maintain their basal levels of activity and condition) , reproduction, timing of breeding and migration, and reduce survival or fitness (4). Birds may respond to these costs by shifting their ranges over time to areas with more suitable thermal conditions, but habitat and other resources may be insufficient or unsuitable for their needs (5).
Generally speaking, global temperatures decrease with increased latitude and elevation, so a fundamental prediction of climate scientists is that species will shift towards the poles and upward in elevation (6; 7). Long-term changes in North American bird distributions show clear evidence of latitudinal shifts, with many species shifting their geographic distributions northwards over the past few decades (8, 9). Elevational shifts have also been reported in long-term datasets, and these shifts appear to implicate changes in precipitation as well as temperature. In the Sierra Nevada mountains, data show that the majority of species ranges have shifted upwards in elevation since the 1940s, with some bird species more closely associated with temperature shifts and others with changes in precipitation (10).
Climate-related shifts in species distribution along latitudinal and elevation gradients have important implications for conservation. If shifts in temperature take place at a more rapid rate than vegetation responses, or occur beyond the boundaries of suitable potential vegetation, then bird populations could be forced into areas of marginal habitat where they are likely to experience decreased survival and reproduction (4). With elevational shifts, the area available for species to colonize as ranges shift upwards also decreases with elevation (11). For this reason, montane species are considered to be especially vulnerable to climate change. This concern is highlighted by recent evidence of declines of montane spruce-fir indicator species on the White Mountain National Forest, including the threatened Bicknell’s Thrush (Catharus bicknelli; 12). Analyses of these same data also show an upward shift of bird species from lower forest areas into montane forest, which is consistent with general observed patterns that show middle elevation species shifting upwards (13).
In contrast to expectations, DeLuca (13) also reported that the montane spruce-fir bird species that occupy the forests nearest tree line are actually shifting downwards in elevation. This might at first seem like a cause for optimism, since there is more area at lower elevations, and thus montane bird ranges would not be constricted at the lower end of an elevational gradient. A more detailed analysis however indicates that lower elevations are marginal habitats for montane birds where they experience lower pairing and nesting success, and therefore lower reproductive success. These results demonstrate some important aspects of climate change research: they contradict the prevailing paradigm that species will respond to climate change by shifting their ranges towards higher elevations, and they highlight the necessity of considering aspects of fitness as well as the distribution of organisms in relation to climate change, because shifts might not be adaptive.
In addition to these direct effects, increased temperatures associated with climate change have the potential to cause a myriad of indirect effects.. One of the most widely reported is the de-synchronization of migrant bird reproduction with food resources. Many bird species synchronize their nesting cycle so the period of maximum food requirements of the young coincides with the maximum food availability (14). In the case of migratory birds, which comprise the majority of species and individuals in many temperate ecosystems, their departures from winter areas are related to photoperiod, whereas the availability of their largely insect food resources is affected by plant phenology. Since plant phenology is related to climate and is advancing in most regions, migratory bird species are in some cases arriving and therefore breeding too late to keep pace with the timing of their food supply (15).
Other indirect effects are mediated by changes in the types and timing of disturbance. In parts of the western U.S., climate change is manifested by drought conditions that increase the frequency and severity of wildfires. These disturbances can impact birds directly by destroying nests and altering habitats. For example, in the Great Basin the effects of drought on fire regimes is compounded by the invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum ), an exotic species introduced from Eurasia. Cheatgrass is more flammable than native grasses, and as drought conditions increase, fire frequency and severity increases and plant species adapted for less severe fire regimes are replaced by cheatgrass, which further increases extreme fire behavior. The synergistic effects of climate, fire and invasion are blamed for loss and fragmentation of big sagebrush habitats needed by sagebrush obligates like sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanus) sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli ), and greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus ), a candidate species for listing under the Endangered Species Act (16). West Nile virus models also show climate’s influence in this region, predicting disease spread to more western locations and states. This could impact vulnerable birds like the greater sage-grouse, which withdraws during droughts to water sources where it can be infected by mosquitos potentially carrying the virus. Finally, studies of high elevation birds in Arizona show that lower snowpack associated with climate change allows greater access to montane areas by elk, and recent declines in several species of migratory songbirds could be the result of decreased reproductive success resulting from habitat degradation from over-browsing (17).
There have been dramatic changes in global climate before, however the current challenge to species and ecosystems from climate is not only the degree of change but the rate. Rapid changes in environmental conditions are likely to exceed the ability of many bird species to adapt via natural selection (18). This concern has led to increased interest in identifying species characteristics associated with vulnerability to climate change (19). In addition to the examples presented above showing that montane and western grassland species are negatively affected, analyses of data from the Breeding Bird Survey are underway to determine whether traits like migratory status, clutch size or geographic range affect the vulnerability of bird species to climate change, as indicated by elevational and latitudinal shifts in their distributions (20). Because responses to climate change are largely species-specific it is expected that species will recombine into novel communities, which could present additional challenges as species are exposed to predators or competitors for whom they have no evolved defenses (21).
Management Options
Strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on bird populations include maintaining the resilience of their habitats by reducing compound stressors that potentially interact with climate change and magnify its impact. The effect of cheatgrass on fire regimes mentioned above is an example that illustrates the potential compounding effects of invasives. Other examples include habitat fragmentation and pollution. Where necessary, habitat resilience can be increased through active management, which can maintain robust growth and reproduction of native plants to mitigate the impacts of drought, heat stress and other climate-related effects (22). Other strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change include increasing the area of protected lands to include greater representation of habitat refugia, where species are predicted to be buffered from the effects of climate change because of site characteristics. Establishing and maintaining habitat connectivity among preserves and along elevational and latitudinal gradients by establishing corridors or networks of preserves could also facilitate shifts by climate-sensitive species (23).
Projects are underway nationwide to enhance resiliency through habitat improvement of ecosystems considered susceptible to climate change. For example, the Central Appalachian Spruce Restoration Initiative is a multi-partner collaboration of individuals and organizations who share the common goal of restoring the red spruce-northern hardwood ecosystem across the high elevation landscapes of Central Appalachia. The US Forest Service is a key player in this initiative, and recent accomplishments include planting, silvicultural treatments and removal of exotic species to enhance spruce regeneration, as well as reforestation and habitat acquisition to reduce fragmentation. These efforts will help priority species within this threatened ecosystem to withstand the effects of climate change or shift their range to track suitable climate conditions. Similar practices are being embraced by National Forests in their forest plan revisions. For example, the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona implements fuels control treatments and mechanical thinnings in an attempt to reduce the risk of pest and disease outbreaks and catastrophic wildfire, all of which are expected to increase with continued climate change.

What's in the Story?

You step outside on a scorching summer day only to be hit with a wall of heat. The heat seems heavy and overpowering and you feel like you could melt. While you might crank up your air conditioning and jump in a pool to deal with the heat, what can other animals do? Animals don’t have air-conditioned houses or warm coats to deal with changes in the weather, but they do have other ways to keep cool or stay warm.
Scientists think that the weather is going to change quite a bit in some places over the next few decades. This shift, called climate change, might permanently affect the weather. Althoughanimals can make some changes to help them survive this weather shift, the weather might be changing too much over a short period of time. Because of this, animals might not be able to adapt quickly enough with the weather to survive.
If certain animals can’t change with the weather, they might be at risk of going extinct. In the PLOS Biology article, “ Quantitative Assessment of the Importance of Phenotypic Plasticity in Adaptation to Climate Change in Wild Bird Populations ,” scientists explored how birds deal with shifts in the weather due to climate change.
A Whole New World

Climate is the average weather in a place over a long period of time. Our climate is changing, and scientists think that this change is partially caused by humans. Although the TVs we watch and the cars we use to travel make our lives more enjoyable, all of these things require energy.
Recently, humans have been using a lot more energy than ever before, and scientists think that this is causing the climate to change all over the world. Because of these changes, some places will get warmer and others will get colder. Others might get drier or have a lot more storms.
Changes in climate may cause problems for many animals. For example, it may be more difficult for them to find food. Imagine if you were a small bird that ate seeds on the forest floor. If the weather became much colder, the plants that grow these seeds could die. This would greatly affect your ability to find food because these seeds would no longer be there.
Changing with the Change
In response to different climate, many birds will have to adjust in order to survive. If a bird is able to survive in a particular environment, scientists say that the bird is well adapted to the environment. Adaptations can come in different forms and some even allow an animal to respond better to a changing environment. They can enable physical changes, like the growth of new, brightly colored feathers during the breeding season, or they can cause changes in an animal's behavior, like the timing of mating.
How much a bird can respond to changes in their normal environment depends on something called phenotypic plasticity. If you went outside in the cold a lot and your arm and leg hair began to grow much thicker, you would have a lot of phenotypic plasticity. This is because certain features of your appearance would be changing in response to changes in the environment. These responses work best when they are short-term. More long-term changes might require adaptations, which would be changes between different generations of birds.
Studying the Birds

To learn how birds responded to changes in climate, scientists studied a population of birds called great tits. Great tits are small birds that can fit in your hand. Scientists needed to be able to watch the birds closely during the egg laying and egg hatching season, so they built nestboxes for the birds. These boxes look like normal birdhouses you might see in your neighbor's backyard.
Every April, some great tits would lay their eggs in these nestboxes. The eggs would eventually hatch and the bird babies, called nestlings, would live in the nestbox until they were ready to leave.
Why do these birds lay eggs in April? So that their young will hatch at just the right time. This is when there are a lot of caterpillars available for the young birds to eat. If great tits lay their eggs too early, their babies will hatch before there is enough food and they will starve. If the birds lay their eggs too late, many of the caterpillars will be eaten before their babies hatch.
How did the scientists figure out when the birds laid their eggs? From 1960 to 2010, scientists watched the nestboxes from April to June. They counted how many birds laid eggs in the nestboxes and wrote down the day each year when the birds laid their eggs. They also recorded the temperature each year during this time of the season. This ended up being very important to understanding the food that was available to the young hatchling birds.
Baby Bird Food
Scientists found that when the average temperature in the spring increased, caterpillars started emerging earlier and the birds also laid their eggs earlier. Click for more detail.
The time in spring when caterpillars are easily found depends on the temperature outside. With the climate changing (and specifically, warming in some areas), scientists noticed that caterpillars were emerging earlier and earlier each spring.
Because the caterpillars were arriving earlier, scientists wanted to know whether the birds would time when they lay their eggs to match the time when the most caterpillars would be available for food. They also wanted to know if the day the birds laid their eggs would change with specific changes in the weather, like temperature.
The scientists found that the birds had high phenotypic plasticity. When the temperature increased by 1°C, the caterpillars began emerging earlier. In response, the birds laid their eggs earlier, by 5 days. This meant that their babies continued to hatch when the most caterpillars were available. The birds were changing their behavior as the climate changed so that their babies would have enough food to eat.
Changing for the Better
Because of these changes in behavior, scientists concluded that the birds were adapting to climate change. They believed that the high phenotypic plasticity of the birds is what allowed them to change their behavior in order to survive.
This is great news for these birds. Their ability to change with the changing climate means they have a chance to survive even as the climate changes. But other animals might not be able to make these kinds of changes. If scientists study these other animals more closely, hopefully they can figure out ways to improve the chance of survival for animals that might be affected by climate change.

Abstract
Weather is of major importance for the population dynamics of birds, but the implications of climate change have only recently begun to be addressed. There is already compelling evidence that birds have been affected by recent climate changes. This review suggests that although there is a substantial body of evidence for changes in the phenology of birds, particularly of the timing of migration and of nesting, the consequences of these responses for a species’ population dynamics is still an area requiring in-depth research. The potential for phenological miscuing (responding inappropriately to climate change, including a lack of response) and for phenological disjunction (in which a bird species becomes out of synchrony with its environment) are beginning to be demonstrated, and are also important areas for further research. The study of climatically induced distributional change is currently at a predictive modelling stage, and will need to develop methods for testing these predictions. Overall, there is a range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could potentially inhibit adaptation to climate change and these are a high priority for research.
The impact of weather on the population biology of birds has been a major field of study by ornithologists over the past half century. It has featured prominently in reviews of the subject since Lack's seminal books The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers and Population Studies of Birds (Lack 1954, 1966) up to present-day works, such as Newton's Population Limitation in Birds (Newton 1998 ). Weather not only affects the metabolic rate of birds (e.g. cold weather requiring increased energy expenditure for body maintenance) but also exerts other indirect and direct effects on bird behaviour. For example, it can influence foraging conditions and the ability to carry out other essential behaviours, such as courtship. Weather also impacts on breeding success through, for example, chilling or starvation of young (Newton 1998 ). Extreme weather events, such as prolonged frozen spells and droughts, can have catastrophic effects on bird populations, including long-term effects on whole cohorts (Stenseth et al. 2002 ). An example of regularly occurring catastrophic events that affect seabirds over a large geographical scale are those due to El Niño events, when periodic warming alters oceanic currents along the west coast of the Americas, leading to crashes in fish abundance and catastrophic breeding failure or even adult mortality among seabirds in the Pacific (Barber & Chavez 1983, 1986, Schreiber & Schreiber 1984 ).
The implications for birds of climate change, i.e. long-term shifts in average weather, have only recently begun to be addressed. There is already compelling evidence that animals and plants have been affected by recent climate change (e.g. Walther et al. 2002, Parmesan & Yohe 2003, Root et al. 2003 ). These effects include earlier breeding; changes in timing of migration; changes in breeding performance (egg size, nesting success); changes in population sizes; changes in population distributions; and changes in selection differentials between components of a population. Birds have the capacity to be important bioindicators, a concept that is readily understandable by the general public and policy-makers because birds are both popular and often have an iconic or totemic status throughout the world (for example, storks are known as ‘rain birds’ in Africa and eagles have been used for centuries as heraldic symbols throughout Europe and North America).
In this paper I briefly review evidence to show that recent climate change has already affected populations of birds and consider the key areas where future research is required. The paper will not address the impact of sea-level changes as these are dealt with elsewhere in this supplement (Atkinson et al. 2004, Watkinson et al. 2004 ).
CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTIONS AND GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE
Speculations that the northward spread of southern species is due to climate change are difficult to substantiate. There is a wide range of potentially confounding factors that might also affect bird distributions. Thus, although the expansion of the range of Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata in the UK since the 1960s is likely to be due to a lack of severe winters (Gibbons & Wotton 1996 ), this hypothesis has yet to be tested rigorously. Sparks et al. (2002) provide a range of suggestions of the potential ‘winners and losers’ among bird species in the UK with climate change, based on the biological attributes of each species. The truth about such speculations can only be tested by careful monitoring and spatial modelling exercises.
Changes in distributions can best be measured by repeated large-scale surveys of suitable habitat, but these require substantial effort, often by a large number of observers. In practice, this is mainly achieved by mass-participation surveys such as those carried out in the UK by volunteers for the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO). For example, two atlases of breeding bird distribution in the British Isles were carried out in 1968–72 (Sharrock 1976) and in 1988–91 (Gibbons et al. 1993 ). These were analysed by Thomas and Lennon (1999 ), who compared the mean locations in the two atlases of (a) the ten northernmost 10-km grid squares for 59 species with southern distributions and (b) the ten southernmost squares for 42 species with northern distributions. They first had to take into account any overall increases or decreases in distribution, because these would tend to change the margins irrespective of climate change. They concluded that the mean shift in the northern edge of southern species was 19 km northwards (after controlling for any change in the number of squares occupied). However, northerly species showed no significant change in the southern edge of their boundaries. They suggested that the most likely cause of the shift in the northern edge of southern species was clim-ate warming and, although mean temperatures in the UK were warmer in the latter period than the in the former, other possible explanations for the pattern, such as land-use change, were not considered.
Altitudinal shifts are also likely to occur as a result of climate warming, and the best demonstration of this comes from the montane cloud forests of Costa Rica. Pounds et al. (1999) show how warming has raised the average altitude at the base of the orographic cloudbank, resulting in the colonization of previously cloud-forest areas by bird species from lower altitudes. There are concerns that similar effects will occur in temperate zones (Watt et al. 1998 ); for example, modelling in the UK suggests that the range of species such as Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis will contract or that it will even disappear from its current breeding areas in the montane zones of the Grampians in Scotland under different standard scenarios of climate change (Berry et al. 2001 ).
Opportunistic observations of unusual events of charismatic species can provide sufficient evidence of range changes in response to climate change. For example, Kinzelbach et al. (1997) collated historical records of the occurrence of European Bee-eaters Merops apiaster north of the Alps between 1500 and 1900 and found a close correlation with warmer winter temperatures. Bee-eaters were absent in years of longer, colder winters.
Change in distributions is the field of study in which predictive modelling is particularly strong. When species distributions are accurately mapped, it is possible to correlate the presence or absence of a species with environmental variables, including climate. For example, Root (1988a, 1998b) and Root and Schneider (1993) found strong statistical correlations between the distribution and abundance of a majority of 148 wintering landbirds and six large-scale environmental factors, mainly climatic ones. They suggested that climate change is likely to have a large effect on their future distributions. Gates et al. (1994) used multivariate regression to model the distributions of several species in the UK, in relation to land-use and climate factors. The latter factors were shown to have strong influences on bird distribution, with large-scale redistributions predicted with climate warming. A more recent development has been the use of neural network modelling to relate bird distributions to climate factors in Europe and the UK as a means of exploring the potential impact of scenarios of climate change (Berry et al. 2001 ). A similar method is the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP), based on an iterative artificial intelligence-based approach, which Peterson et al. (2002) have used to show how the ecological niches of 1870 species of birds, mammals and butterflies in Mexico will respond to various scenarios of climate change. They showed that although extinctions and drastic range reductions are likely to be relatively infrequent, species turnover in some communities may become > 40%, suggesting severe ecological perturbation. The use of climate envelopes to describe the spatial distribution of birds is a useful heuristic approach, but the testing of such predictions can only be made against current patterns of distribution and will need to await measurements of distributional change before they can be properly validated. Furthermore, one needs to be aware that current distributions may be due to factors other than climate, although they may correlate well with it. To take a theoretical example, Red Kites Milvus milvus in the UK were restricted for much of the 20th century to parts of Wales, where game preservation did not take hold, due mainly to persecution in the 19th and 20th centuries (Newton 1998 ). But the Welsh climate would have given a naïve modeller an entirely false indication of the species’ climatic needs, and it has now been re-introduced very successfully to parts of central and eastern England and Scotland (Wotton et al. 2002 ), where the climate is very much drier.
CHANGES IN PHENOLOGY
This is the area of study for which there is the strongest evidence of the impact of climate change on birds. In particular, there have been studies to show changes in the timing of migration and in average laying dates, many of which are based on observations made over wide geographical areas or over long time periods by networks of volunteers.
Changes in the phenology of autumn migration are reviewed elsewhere in these proceedings (Sparks & Mason 2004 ), but observations made over broad areas such as English counties and those made at point locations show general trends towards earlier spring arrivals for many species (e.g. Mason 1995, Forchhammer et al. 1998, Bradley et al. 1999, Sparks 1999, Loxton & Sparks 1999, Jenkins & Watson 2000, Sparks & Mason 2001, Sueur & Triplet 2001, Gilyazov & Sparks 2002, Hüppop & Hüppop 2003 ). In some areas, although timing in the arrival of spring migrants is earlier in warmer springs, no trends are yet apparent, because local temperatures have yet to show any trend (e.g. Barrett 2002) or there are trends towards later arrival because local temperatures have tended to become cooler (e.g. Sparks & Braslavska 2001 ). Although many of these datasets are based on records of the first arrival, such data appear to be relatively robust for the analysis of trends (Sparks 1999, Sparks et al. 2001 ). Far fewer data are available on the departure of migrants in the autumn, but such data suggest that last observations of birds have tended to become later, with a consequence that duration of stay on the breeding grounds has increased for some species (Sparks & Mason 2001, Gilyazov & Sparks 2002 ).
Long-term observations of the passage of migrants at a long-term ringing station (‘Fringilla’) on the Courish Spit of the Baltic coast of Russia have shown that warmer springs are not only associated with earlier spring arrivals but are also associated with earlier migration of juveniles in the autumn, suggesting earlier breeding (Sokolov et al. 1998 ). In the UK, a correlation between timing of spring arrival and mean laying dates has been demonstrated for a small number of species (Sparks et al. 2001 ).
Probably the longest and largest scale dataset on the timing of breeding derives from the BTO's Nest Record Scheme (NRS; Crick et al. 2003 ). Started in 1939, it currently collects c. 30 000 individual nest histories per annum for c . 120 species of bird from throughout the UK. Initial analysis of data for 65 species over a 25-year period (1971–95) showed that 20 exhibited statistically significant trends towards earlier laying and only one had become significantly later. Overall, 51 species showed trends towards laying earlier (regardless of significance), which was a statistically significant proportion (Crick et al. 1997 ). The results showed that trends were not restricted to particular ecological or taxonomic groups, with trend-revealing representatives including waterbirds, corvids, resident and migrant insectivores and seed-eaters. Early nesting species (such as Magpie Pica pica) were as likely to show earlier laying as late nesting species (such as Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra ). A subsequent analysis of those species for which the scheme held more than 1000 laying dates, and over a longer time period (spanning 57 years: 1939–95), found that laying date was related to temperature or rainfall for 31 of 36 species (86%) (Crick & Sparks 1999 ). Just over half of the species (53%) showed long-term trends in laying date over time, of which 37% could be statistically accounted for by changes in climate. Using national-level climate scenarios of future change, Crick and Sparks (1999) predicted that average laying dates will be earlier for 75% of species by the year 2080. Over the longer term, trends in laying date were often curvilinear, mirroring curvilinear trends in spring temperatures since 1940, suggesting the results are unlikely to be the consequence of spurious correlation. The only other major study using extensively gathered data also shows a general trend towards earlier laying. Dunn and Winkler (1999) analysed 3450 nest records from the North American nest record schemes between 1959 and 1991 and found that the mean lay date of Tree Swallow Tachycineta bicolor had shifted an average of 9 days earlier and that the main factor correlated with this was change in air temperature. The results from such schemes provide some of the best evidence to date of the widespread impact of existing climate change on wildlife.
To complement such extensive studies, intensive studies undertaken at single locations have also been able to provide evidence for changes in laying date in relation to climate change (e.g. Järvinen 1989, McCleery & Perrins 1998, Slater 1999 ). An unusual study from outside the temperate zone is of Mexican Jays Aphelocoma ultramarina (Brown et al. 1999) in arid zone Arizona. Trends towards earlier laying in this species were related to trends of warming in the two months prior to egg-laying. Stevenson and Bryant (2000) suggested that, on the basis of energetics studies, one would predict that the impacts of climate warming should be more evident in smaller bodied species than in larger bodied ones. They showed, using data in Crick and Sparks (1999 ), that the degree of advancement for a species, per °C warming, was inversely correlated to body mass. Thus, there may be physiological reasons why species may differ in their response to climate change.
Meta-analyses of results from intensive studies have allowed the generality of findings from individual studies to be tested. Sanz (2002) drew together information from 92 study sites of Great Tit Paris major and from 75 study sites of Blue Tit P. caeruleus from across the Western Palaearctic. He correlated annual estimates of laying date with values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a north–south alternation in relative atmospheric masses between the high-pressure system over the Azores and the low-pressure system centred on Iceland. The NAO affects the strength of westerly winds blowing across the North Atlantic and positive values of the NAO are associated with warmer, moister winters (see Stenseth et al. 2002 ). The slopes of the relationship between laying dates and NAO varied geographically for these species. They were more negative in the west than in the east for both species, but were more negative in the north for Blue Tit and in the south for Great Tit. These results were obtained even though potentially confounding factors, such as latitude, longitude, elevation and habitat, were included in the analyses. A similar investigation of 24 other such datasets gathered over a smaller geographical part of Europe also found variation in response to climate warming (Visser et al. 2003 ). However, differences in response, even between spatially close populations, appeared to be linked to changes in the degree of double brooding within a population. Where populations decreased the likelihood of double brooding in response to warming, laying dates were retarded, probably because individuals were no longer attempting to ‘fit two broods into the season’ but were attempting to optimize the laying of a single clutch in response to likely changes in the abundance of food (cf. Crick et al. 1993 ).
IMPACTS ON DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS
The impacts of climate change on demographic factors, breeding performance and survival, which affect the population dynamics of species, have been less well explored than phenology. There is often a range of interacting factors that may influence any one demographic parameter, such that the influence of weather or climate may be difficult to elucidate clearly. For example, clutch size may vary with laying date (both calendar and with respect to the start of the nesting season), age and experience, population density, and a range of environmental factors such as latitude, altitude and habitat. However, several studies have shown trends in various aspects of breeding performance that correlate with trends in climate.
Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca have been studied in both Germany and Finland, showing increases in egg size with warmer springs (Järvinen 1994 ), and clutch sizes have tended to increase with earlier laying dates and warmer springs (Järvinen 1996, Winkel & Hudde 1997 ). However, nest success in Finland has not increased because it is related most to June temperatures, which had not shown any trend in that region (Järvinen 1989 ), whereas it had improved in Germany, at a lower latitude (Winkel & Hudde 1997 ). Interestingly, Sanz's (2002) meta-analysis of tit studies showed no trend of increasing clutch sizes across the Western Palaearctic, despite trends towards earlier laying. This suggests that distribution of the seasonal trend in clutch sizes for these species has shifted earlier rather than ‘extrapolating earlier’ from the ‘normal’ trend to produce larger clutches with an earlier calendar date. Winkler et al. (2002) has found a similar pattern for Tree Swallows in North America, which they describe as adopting the ‘relative’ rather than ‘absolute’ model of seasonal variation in clutch size.
Several long-term studies of seabirds have demonstrated a climatic influence on breeding performance. Aebischer et al. (1990) showed that the laying date, clutch size and brood size of Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla at a colony by the North Sea were related to a measure of ‘westerly weather’, which is analogous to the impact of the NAO (see above). They were also able to demonstrate parallel impacts at lower levels in the food chain, through phytoplankton and zooplankton and herring stocks, which suggests the mechanism for such changes. A more recent study of Fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, based on data gathered at a colony in Orkney (off the north coast of Scotland) between 1950 and 2000, showed that hatching and fledging success were related to the NAO, due potentially to the climate effects on the abundance of their crustacean and fish food supplies or due to the impact of severe winter weather on parental body condition (Thompson & Ollason 2001 ). Furthermore, the cohort recruitment rate of Fulmars was related to growing season temperatures in the year of their birth, despite recruitment occurring some 5 years later due to delayed maturity (Thompson & Ollason 2001 ). The response of marine seabirds to climate change may depend on the response of their main prey to changes in warmth. In a site in Siberia, the planktivorous auklets (Crested Aethia cristatella and Parakeet Cyclorhynchus psittacula) increase their reproductive success when sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) are lower, because they feed on macro-zooplankton that are favoured under such conditions; by contrast, the piscivorous puffins (Horned Fratercula corniculata and Tufted Lunda cirrhata) have better reproductive success when SSTs are higher, because this favours the mesoplankton that are eaten by the fish that are eaten by the puffins (Kitaysky & Golubova 2000 ). In this case, long-term changes in SSTs are likely to affect the viability of the populations of each group of species in different ways and may alter the seabird community in the area.
The only demographic study that also investigated the impact of climate change on survival rates is of a large colony of Emperor Penguins Aptenodytes forsteri in Terre Adelie, Antarctica, since the 1960s (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001 ). This colony declined in the mid-1970s due to decreased adult survival during a relatively warm period. High SSTs are associated with poorer Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba production and reduced populations of the fish and squid that feed upon them, all prey of the penguins. Although higher SSTs reduce the distance that parent penguins must travel to reach the sea (because of reduced pack ice), the benefit of this, in terms of improved hatching success, was relatively insignificant for maintaining colony size. Thus climate change can affect different aspects of a species’ demography in both positive and negative ways at the same time.
POPULATION CHANGE
The detection of population change in response to climate change is likely to be affected by the masking effects of density-dependent population regulation. Populations will often tend to regulate themselves to a certain level after transient or longer-term changes in a particular component of a species’ demography (Newton 1998 ). Green (1999) also showed how density-dependent processes will tend to mask short-term demographic changes that lead to population change. Thus, long-term census datasets, such as that of Grey Heron Ardea cinerea measured annually in the UK since 1928, show significant weather-driven population crashes (after severe winters) due to poor survival, followed by recovery over the following years (Marchant et al. 2004 ). Other census studies show annual fluctuations in relation to fluctuations in weather (e.g. Crick 1999; Forchhammer et al. 1998) but these are not likely to show any trend of population increase. They might show changes in the degree of fluctuation as winter temperatures become less variable (and higher).
The study of Emperor Penguins partly illustrates these effects: a transient decline in survival rates led to a decline in population size, which stabilized at a new lower level once survival recovered (Barbraud & Weimerskirch 2001 ). However, density-dependent processes have not facilitated a return to former population levels, possibly in this case because the environment has become more variable, thereby inhibiting density-dependent recovery.
A similar major decline in a penguin population is reported for Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome on Campbell Island (Cunningham & Moors 1994 ). These have declined by 94% since the early 1940s, associated with rises in SSTs and declines in their fish prey (although it should be noted that over-fishing was not considered as a factor in this study). Veit et al. (1996, 1997) also report declines in the numbers of Sooty Shearwaters Puffinus griseus off the west coast of North America in the non-breeding season. The population declined by 90% since 1987, associated with increased SSTs and declines in their zooplankton prey (Roemmich & McGowan 1995 ). Although there is some suggestion that this population may have re-distributed itself towards the north-west Pacific (Spear & Ainley 1999 ), it provides evidence of significant change in the marine ecosystem as a result of apparently minor climate warming (a 0.7 °C increase in SSTs).
CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL SELECTION
The ready response of many species to recent climate change indicates that most species have the phenotypic plasticity to cope with such change. Przybylo et al. (2000) have demonstrated this in the responses of Collared Flycatchers Ficedula albicollis, with respect to variation in various aspects of their breeding performance (including laying date and clutch size) and morphological traits (tarsus and wing length).
However, there is growing evidence that some species may find it difficult to adapt to climate change because, for example, of the use of inappropriate environmental cues as phenological triggers, or because different parts of a food chain may respond differentially to climate change (Harrington et al. 1999 ).
Montane habitats in the Colorado mountains provide examples of phenological miscuing: higher spring temperatures have led to the earlier arrival of American Robins Turdus migratorius and the earlier emergence of Yellow-bellied Marmots Marmota flaviventris from hibernation (Inouye et al. 2000 ). However, despite higher temperatures, the date of snowmelt has not changed because of the greater volumes of snow present due to increases in winter precipitation with the higher temperatures. Thus the interval between arrival or emergence and the first date of bare ground has actually grown and may cause problems for migratory and hibernating species.
In Europe, there is evidence that long-distance migrants may suffer from the effects of phenological miscuing. Berthold (1990) suggested that long-distance migrants might be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, if the cues they use to time their departure from their wintering grounds do not change sufficiently to allow them to take advantage of the earlier arrival of spring on their breeding grounds. This is the case particularly if they respond to endogenous rhythms or to environmental stimuli unrelated to temperature (Gwinner 1996 ). Certainly, there is some evidence that long-distance migrants have not responded as rapidly to climate change as short-distance migrants (Jenkins & Watson 2000, Penuelas et al. 2002 ).
Both and Visser (2001) report that Pied Flycatchers in The Netherlands have not advanced their arrival date, probably because of phenological miscuing on their wintering grounds, which has constrained their ability to advance the start of breeding. The latter has the potential to lead to phenological disjunction with the resources that they require for successful breeding. Although Great Tits can shift their laying dates earlier in response to earlier warm spring weather, often in parallel with the emergence of their caterpillar prey (Perrins 1991 ), they cannot significantly decrease their incubation period. Their caterpillar prey, however, can halve their development time in sufficiently warm weather and pupate earlier, leading to an early shortage of the prey that Great Tits feed to their young (Buse et al. 1999 ). This phenological disjunction between predator and prey has led to a trend in selection differentials, such that an increasingly greater proportion of recruits in the following year come from early nesting individuals (Visser et al. 1998 ).
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Ornithology has provided some of the best examples of the impacts of recent climate change on wildlife from around the world, but we have only begun to scratch the surface. The best studied area, primarily because of the existence of long-term datasets, is that of phenological change (Sparks & Crick 1999 ). The consequences of such change are barely explored, but the potential for phenological miscuing and phenological disjunction to the detriment of the species concerned has already been observed.
One research area where immediate attention is urgently needed is the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could potentially inhibit adaptation to climatic change. Such factors include:
1
Lack of phenotypic/genotypic adaptability: species that are unable to respond to climate change may be most vulnerable to climate change.
2
Dispersal ability: species with poor dispersal ability may be unable to move with changes in their climate space, especially when compounded by habitat fragmentation.
3
Ecological specialization: rapid changes in the environment are likely to favour generalist/adaptable species and be detrimental to highly specialized species adapted to a fine ecological niche.
4
Small population size: will make species more vulnerable to rapid stochastic changes, if the climate becomes more variable, as predicted.
5
Increases in the frequency of extreme events: populations can be severely reduced by extreme climatic events, and an increase in their frequency may affect the viability of populations in the long term.
6
Loss of habitat or decline in habitat quality: climate change may affect the viability of the habitats that birds use, changing the timing and abundance of their food supplies and other resources. Large-scale changes in agriculture, including crop types and pesticide usage (in response to changing pest populations), will be a particularly important factor for many bird species that live in human-modified habitats.
7
Changes in the range of other species: where species range expansion or contraction occurs in response to climate change, changes in the level of competition and predation may occur (Davis et al. 1998a, 1998b, Harrington et al. 1999 ). The potential for invasive and alien species to have detrimental impacts is another important factor that needs to be considered: some species that are currently benign or inhibited from colonizing certain areas may change their attributes under changed environmental conditions.
Although the complexities of multi-trophic interactions are important areas for research, there is still much work needed in the area of understanding the impact of climate change on the population dynamics of individual species. Stenseth et al. (2002) point out that climate variability can affect populations in a density-independent manner, but may also affect the strength of density dependence regulating a population. Population modelling, similar in scope to pioneering work undertaken by Rodenhouse (1992 ), is urgently needed so that we can go beyond single parameter studies and begin to understand the complexities of the interactions between different components of a species’ demography.

How climate change is affecting birds
Conclusions

Climate change is now affecting bird species’ behaviour, ranges and population dynamics;
Some bird species are already experiencing negative impacts; and
In the future, climate change will put large numbers of birds at risk of extinction.
Egg laying is occurring earlier
One large-scale study showed that birds are laying eggs up at an average rate of 6.6 days earlier per decade.
The Common Murre in North America has advanced its breeding date 24 days per decade.
North American Tree Swallows are nesting up to 9 days earlier than 30 years ago, corresponding to an increase in average spring temperatures.
Migration times are shifting
Birds are migrating earlier in the spring. A study of 63 years of data for 96 species of bird migrants in Canada showed that 27 species have altered their arrival dates significantly, with most arriving earlier, in conjunction with warming spring temperatures.
Birds also seem to be delaying autumn departure: in a study of 13 North American passerines, 6 species were found to delay their departure dates in conjunction with global warming.
Some birds in Europe are even failing to migrate all together.
Bird behaviour and their environment are becoming mismatched
Much of a bird’s life cycle and behaviour is closely linked to cues from the environment, like changing seasons. A mismatch occurs when birds cannot shift their behaviour, such as breeding times, enough to coincide with changes in environment, such as when prey is available.
Long-distance migrants are particularly at risk of a mismatch as it is harder for them to know what conditions might be like at the end of the migration route. For example, wood warblers in North America aren’t migrating earlier from their neotropical wintering grounds, despite earlier springs in their northern breeding ranges – this risks a late arrival, after spring food sources on breeding grounds are gone.
Distributions are changing
Bird populations are expected to shift poleward, or to higher elevations, to stay with their ideal temperatures as the climate changes.
A study of 35 North American warbler species found that the range of occurrence of seven of the species (Prothonotary Warbler, Blue-winged Warbler, Golden-winged Warbler, Black-throated Gray Warbler, Pine Warbler, Hooded Warbler, and Cape May Warbler) has shifted significantly north in the past 24 years, by an average of 65 miles. None of the birds shifted to the south.
Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas data demonstrates that “southern” birds species such as Tufted Titmouse, Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher, Northern Mockingbird, and Red-bellied Woodpecker have increased in number and have expanded their range northwards in Ontario compared to 20 years ago.
These climate-induced shifts are not always a solution to coping with a warming climate. Birds on the move could be stymied in their efforts to find new ranges by fragmentation, human development, or natural geological features like large bodies of water.
Ecological communities are disrupted
Global warming can change entire ecological communities. Food and nesting material that birds depend on may no longer be there. Birds may face new prey, parasites, competitors, and predators to which they are not adapted.
In the northern Hudson Bay area, mosquitoes now reach peak numbers earlier in the spring. Thick-billed Murres breeding in the area have not adjusted their behaviour, and the combination of heat and mosquitoes is causing higher egg loss and greater adult mortality.
Parts of southwestern Ontario may end up with 14 fewer species of warblers than are currently found there. This could lead to increased outbreaks of some forest pests like spruce budworms.
2005 saw unprecedented failures of colonies of seabirds on the Pacific coast of North America. Only 8% of the Cassin’s Auklets nesting on Triangle Island were successful. This is because late northerly winds delayed coastal upwelling, which affected plankton growth and caused a decline in the fish species on which the seabirds depend.
Tufted Puffins at Canadian sites have breeding success near zero when water is at its warmest, which could mean that Canada’s largest breeding colony for this species, Scott Island Marine National Wildlife Area would become unsuitable for Tufted Puffins if water continues to warm.
Extinction risks are on the rise
Birds most at risk of extinction from climate change are those with restricted ranges, poor ability to move their range, small populations, or those already facing conservation challenges.
Migratory birds are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects, because they depend on multiple habitats and sites.
Arctic birds are particularly vulnerable – warming is occurring rapidly here, and at least 85 of the world’s bird species breed in global Arctic regions. Vast areas of habitat, including tundra and sea ice, will be lost. Sea ice retreat could have severe consequences for Ivory Gulls, which forage along sea ice. Canadian Ivory Gulls have already declined in number by 90% over the past two decades.
Conclusions
Climate change is now affecting bird species’ behaviour, ranges and population dynamics;
Some bird species are already experiencing negative impacts; and
In the future, climate change will put large numbers of birds at risk of extinction.

How climate change is affecting birds - Bird Vibes
How climate change is affecting birds
January 6, 2022 by Estefani R.
When we think of climate change, we usually think of droughts, wildfires, storms, and how they’re affecting humans. However, have you ever wondered how climate change is affecting birds?
Published in the journal Trends in Ecology and Environment, recent research suggested that the constantly changing environment may cause animals and birds to ‘shapeshift’ to adapt to climate change.
According to bird researcher Sara Ryding, “Climate change is not only a human problem; animals have to adapt to it as well. Some “warm-blooded” animals are shapeshifting. They are getting larger beaks, legs, and ears to better regulate their body temperatures as the planet gets hotter.”
Animals are shifting their morphologies to have proportionately larger appendages in response to climate change and its associated temperature increases.
Among shape-shifters, birds are leading the charge. Several species of Australian parrots have shown, on average, a 4%-10% increase in bill size since 1871. This is positively correlated with the summer temperature each year.
Birds aren’t getting bigger exclusively. Separate researches have shown that migrating birds have been steadily shrinking as global temperatures rise.
How are birds adapting to climate change?
According to research done by Dr. Matthew Symonds, there is a pattern between increased climatic temperatures and an increase in the size of the beaks of parrot species in southern and eastern Australia.
The researchers examined 410 bird skins, collected between 1871 and 2008. They found that 4 of the 5 species examined had measurably bigger beaks now than they had in the 19 th Century.
The Gang-gang cockatoo had a reported increase on its beak’s size in the last decades
They found an increase in beak surface area of between 4% and 10%. “We have been able to show there has been an increase in the size of the beaks, in line with the increase in the temperature these parts of Australia,” he said.
“However, we can’t yet conclusively rule out the effect of other environmental factors, such as changes in habitat or food availability.
Big beaks help to cool down
Big beaks can be used to dissipate excess body heat. Birds can pump blood to their highly vascularized bills, enabling them to lose excess heat when they get hot.
As a consequence, according to research done by Dr. Schraft, beaks can serve as radiators when birds need to cool down. Basically, an equivalent of humans sweating on a hot summer day.
That is really important because their bodies are very well insulated so thermoregulation can’t happen through sweating. It’s like having a fluffy warm coat you can’t take off during Summer.
Puffins use their beaks to cool down while they’re hunting in the ocean
Puffin birds evolved to have large bills to dump extra body heat. Thus so they don’t overheat while flying by the ocean to hunt food for their chicks during the breeding season.
Smaller bodies, larger wingspans
According to a study from the University of Michigan using a four-decade specimen series of 70,716 individuals of 52 North American migratory bird species, scientists demonstrated that increasing annual summer temperature over a 40-year period predicted consistent reductions in body size across these diverse species.
David Willard is an ornithologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and he has studied 70,716 bird specimens since 1978, which provided the data for a new study.
There is evidence to suggest that warming-induced body size reduction is a general response to climate change, and reveal a similarly consistent and unexpected shift in body shape. The warming temperatures caused a decrease in bird’s body size, which in turn caused the increase in wing length.
According to a BCC interview, the scientists aren’t exactly sure why warmer temperatures cause birds to shrink. One theory is that smaller animals are better at cooling off, losing body heat more quickly due to their larger surface-area-to-volume ratios.
Migrating to colder climates
According research from the University of Helsinki, climate change is driving species’ distribution towards the poles and mountaintops, resulting in changes to bird communities.
“Climate change is reshaping bird communities so that abundance of southern species increase, while the abundance of northern species is reduced,” says Senior curator Aleksi Lehikoinen from the Finnish Museum of Natural History Luomus, which is part of the University of Helsinki.
“In Finland, wintering bird communities in particular have changed due to the rapid increase in abundance of southern species, such as the tufted duck, the blackbird and the goldfinch. As winters become warmer faster than summers, our winter bird communities will continue to change rapidly also in the future,” Lehikoinen explains.
Little time to evolve
Though birds are trying to adapt their bodies to overcome challenges presented by global warming, there is not much time for them to adapt.
“It’s high time we recognized that animals also have to adapt to these changes. But this is occurring over a far shorter timescale than would have occurred through most of the evolutionary time”.
“Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is ‘fine’.
Sara Ryding
“It just means they are evolving to survive it — but we’re not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are, or indeed that all species are capable of changing and surviving.”
Conclusion
There is not much we can help in larger scale of things. Like anything that regards climate change, most of us are just helpless and can’t make much of an impact in an individual scale.
However, birds are doing what they can to adapt and survive the harsh consequences climate change is bringing. Let’s hope that is enough to keep the survival of most bird especies.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can make of them.

First, there's a document from the USDA's Climate Change Resource Center about the effects of climate change on terrestrial birds in North America. It seems pretty comprehensive. It talks about how birds are good indicators of ecological change because they're easy to study, and they're important for conservation and ecosystem services like pest control and pollination.

The document mentions that climate change affects birds both directly and indirectly. Directly, by affecting their energy use for things like staying warm or cool, which can impact their breeding and survival. Indirectly, through changes in their habitats and food sources.

It says that generally, birds are shifting their ranges towards the poles and to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures. That makes sense because temperatures decrease as you go north or up in elevation. So, birds are moving to areas with temperatures they're adapted to.

But, there are complications. For example, if temperatures change faster than vegetation can adapt, birds might end up in areas where their food and habitat aren't suitable. Also, at higher elevations, the area available for birds to inhabit gets smaller, which could lead to overcrowding and competition for resources.

There's also mention of some bird species shifting their ranges downward in elevation, which seems counterintuitive. But the explanation is that lower elevations might be marginal habitats where these birds don't do as well in terms of reproduction. So, even though they're moving to follow temperature changes, it might not always be beneficial for them.

Another indirect effect is the mismatch in timing between when birds arrive at their breeding grounds and when their food sources are available. For migratory birds, their timing is often based on day length, but their food, like insects, emerges based on temperature and plant growth. So, if springs are getting warmer and insects are peaking earlier, but birds are still arriving on their usual schedule, there might not be enough food for their chicks.

There are also impacts from changes in disturbance patterns, like more frequent and severe wildfires due to drought conditions, which can destroy nests and habitats. In some areas, invasive species like cheatgrass are spreading due to climate change, leading to more intense fires and displacement of native plants that birds depend on.

The document concludes by saying that because responses to climate change vary by species, bird communities are likely to重组 into new combinations, which could lead to further challenges as species interact in new ways.

Okay, that's a lot of information. Next, there's an article from Ask A Biologist about how birds are changing with climate change. It focuses on a study of great tits and how they're adjusting their breeding times to match the availability of caterpillars, their main food source for their chicks.

The article explains that great tits lay their eggs earlier in warmer springs when caterpillars emerge earlier. This is an example of phenotypic plasticity, where animals adjust their behaviors in response to environmental changes without genetic changes. The study shows that great tits can adjust their laying dates quite flexibly in response to temperature changes, which helps their chicks have enough food.

However, the article also notes that not all birds may be able to adjust as quickly or effectively, which could put them at risk. So, while some species can adapt behaviorally, others might struggle, leading to population declines or even extinction.

Moving on, there's a paper from the journal Ibis titled "The impact of climate change on birds" by Humphrey Q.P. Crick. This seems like a detailed review of the subject. It discusses how birds have been affected by recent climate change, focusing on changes in their distributions, phenology (timing of life events like migration and breeding), demographic factors, and even natural selection.

The paper mentions that many bird species are expanding their ranges northward in response to warming temperatures, with some species moving into new areas where they previously didn't occur. For example, in the UK, some southern species are moving north, while no clear shifts are seen in northern species.

Regarding phenology, the paper cites numerous studies showing that many bird species are migrating earlier in the spring and sometimes staying later in the fall. Breeding is also starting earlier for many species, with laying dates advancing over the decades.

However, the paper points out that while there's a lot of evidence for these phenological changes, there's less research on how these changes affect bird populations in terms of survival and reproduction. It suggests that more work is needed to understand the ecological consequences of these shifts.

There are also discussions about how climate change can lead to mismatches between birds' timing and the availability of their food sources, which can negatively impact breeding success. For example, if birds arrive at their breeding grounds too late and miss the peak of insect abundance, their chicks may not get enough food.

Furthermore, the paper mentions that some bird species may not be able to adjust their timing enough to keep up with the rapid changes in climate, making them vulnerable to population declines.

Another important point is that climate change can affect different life stages differently. For instance, warmer temperatures might benefit adult survival but harm chick survival if food resources are mismatched.

The paper also touches on how climate change can alter species interactions, such as changes in predator-prey dynamics or competition between species, which can have cascading effects on ecosystems.

Lastly, it emphasizes the need for more research on how intrinsic factors, like a species' ability to adapt, and extrinsic factors, like habitat quality and availability, influence a species' vulnerability to climate change.

Okay, so this paper seems to provide a broad overview of the impacts of climate change on birds, highlighting both observed changes and areas needing further research.

Next, there's a webpage from Nature Canada about how climate change is affecting birds. It summarizes some key points, like earlier egg-laying, shifted migration times, mismatches in timing with food availability, range shifts, disruptions in ecological communities, and increased extinction risks, particularly for Arctic birds.

It gives specific examples, such as common murres advancing their breeding dates, tree swallows nesting earlier, and warbler species shifting their ranges northward in Ontario. It also mentions negative impacts, like breeding failures in seabirds due to changes in ocean conditions and potential losses of warbler species in certain regions.

The page concludes by emphasizing that climate change is already affecting birds in various ways and that future changes could put many species at risk of extinction.

Finally, there's an article from Bird Vibes that discusses how birds are adapting to climate change, including physical changes like larger beaks and legs to help regulate body temperature, and smaller body sizes with larger wingspans to cope with warmer temperatures.

The article mentions studies showing that some Australian parrot species have larger beaks now compared to the past, likely to help dissipate heat, and that migrating birds have been getting smaller over time, possibly to lose heat more efficiently.

It also talks about birds shifting their ranges to cooler areas, such as moving towards the poles or to higher elevations.

The article concludes by acknowledging that while birds are trying to adapt, the pace of climate change may be too rapid for many species to keep up, and that more needs to be done to understand and mitigate these impacts.

So, synthesizing all this information, it's clear that climate change is having multifaceted impacts on birds. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **Range Shifts:** Many bird species are moving to higher latitudes or elevations in response to warming temperatures, seeking more suitable climatic conditions.

2. **Phenological Changes:** Birds are adjusting the timing of their migrations, breeding, and other life events in response to earlier springs and warmer temperatures. For example, laying eggs earlier to coincide with peak food availability.

3. **Physiological Adaptations:** Some birds are developing larger beaks, legs, or ears to better regulate their body temperatures in warmer climates.

4. **Body Size Changes:** There's evidence that some birds are getting smaller in response to rising temperatures, possibly to increase heat dissipation.

5. **Mismatch in Timing:** There's a risk of phenological mismatches, where birds' timing of breeding doesn't align with the availability of their food sources, which can negatively impact their reproductive success.

6. **Habitat Alterations:** Changes in climate can alter habitats, affecting the availability of food and nesting sites, and leading to disruptions in ecological communities.

7. **Increased Extinction Risks:** Vulnerable species, especially those with narrow ranges, specific habitat requirements, or limited ability to adapt, face higher risks of extinction due to climate change.

Overall, while some bird species are showing adaptability in response to climate change, the rapid pace of change poses significant challenges, and many species are likely to be negatively impacted if current trends continue.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change is affecting birds through range shifts, changes in timing of life events, physiological adaptations, body size changes, mismatches in food availability, habitat alterations, and increased extinction risks.}} \]
