Alright, I've got this question: "Why is there a shortage of distilled water?" Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. First off, I need to understand what distilled water is. I think distilled water is water that has been purified through a process of heating it to vapor and then condensing it back into liquid form, which removes impurities and minerals. So, it's really pure water.

Now, why would there be a shortage of it? Is it because the process of distillation is expensive or time-consuming? Maybe both. Producing distilled water requires energy to heat the water and then collect the vapor, which might make it costly compared to regular water. Perhaps in some areas, there aren't enough facilities to produce distilled water, leading to shortages.

Wait a minute, but distilled water is used in various industries like pharmaceuticals, laboratories, and car batteries, among others. If there's a high demand from these sectors, and if production can't keep up, that could lead to shortages.

Also, maybe there are environmental factors. If there's a drought or water scarcity in an area, that could affect the supply of water available for distillation, thus causing a shortage of distilled water.

Let me think about the current global situation. Are there any specific events or circumstances that might be causing a shortage right now? For example, during the pandemic, there was a surge in demand for medical supplies, which might have increased the need for distilled water in hospitals and labs. That could potentially lead to shortages if the demand surpasses the production capacity.

Alternatively, perhaps there are issues with the distribution of distilled water. If there are problems with logistics or transportation, that could also cause localized shortages.

I should probably look up some information to get a better understanding. Maybe there have been recent news articles or reports on this topic. Let me try to search for "shortage of distilled water" and see what comes up.

Distilled water shortage - Hackettstown NJ
Distilled water shortage
Why is it so difficult to find distilled water in stores? It’s used in appliances that can be clogged by regular water like humidifiers. It’s not a healthy substitute for drinking water. Perhaps more of it is being diverted to heath care facilities. Any ideas?
Pa ✉
Mar '20
Pa:  Yes, I've been having difficulty finding distilled water for my mom's humidifier. I did find some last week in Weiss.
Puden
Mar '20
I use for my cigar humidor, a gallon lasts me a really long time. Maybe people are buying it mistakenly?
Steve ✉
Mar '20
Yes, it is used in healthcare/labs.
iJay ✉
Mar '20
While I wouldn't drink it, can't you use dehumidifier water as an alternative? https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health-technology-you-asked/water-dehumidifier-drinkable
As to what's out --- bread machine mixes, laxatives AND tp -- go figure, it just does not make sense either by demand or supply.  Not to mention many items available in stores but not online ---- thought it would be easier/safer to ship from a central location....  Just can't understand why American manufacturing can't get a handle on this yet.  Nor why no-one is forecasting the future except to say: "don't worry, be happy, it will be alright...."  Time for straight talk please.
Good luck.

I think distilled water is used in some oxygen machines?
Gardenfish ✉
Mar '20
I know it is used in CPAP machines during sleeping. I agree that it is probably used with oxygen or in any respiratory type machines so a person doesn't dry out.

It’s also used for NetiPots/Neti spray bottles. We were going through a number of gallons when my husband was recovering from nasal surgery. We’re down to the last gallon. I believe you can boil water for 10 minutes to use in place of distilled.
Blackcat ✉
Mar '20
Boiling is not a substitute for distilled, in fact it makes the particulate matter in the water denser as you are removing water but not solids when you boil. (Distilled water is made by capturing the steam and leaving behind the solids.)   If you have a reverse osmosis or very fine water filter you are better off using that.   Using regular water in CPAP or humidifiers will leave calcium residue behind in the tank, you can minimize by not letting it get low. i.e. when you tank gets to 1/2 dump out the remaining water (which is now has a higher level of solids.) and add new fresh water.

You can distill your own if interested, Check out www.Waterwise.com

Wal-Mart in Mansfield had a bunch of distilled water two days ago. I always get it there. I use it often for our humidifiers. Sometimes distilled water is by the laundry supplies...that is where it's at in Shop Rite in Mansfield.

You really shouldn't use anything but distilled water in medical devices.like that.  Any other water has dissolved minerals (especially "hard" water) that will create deposits which degrade equipment, block nozzles, etc.
You should check the instructions on your machine.  If you're lucky it may say you can use tap water temporarily if you run out of distilled and can't find any.  Try checking online with drug stores and grocery stores for it locally.  You're likely to come up with some that way.  You can always make your own, but it's a bit of a pain without the right equipment.
To do that, you have to put water in a pot or kettle and tilt the lid of the pot off to the side and leaning over something like a Pyrex measuring cup to catch the steam as it condenses on the lid and rolls down.  Of course you have to watch it so the pot doesn't boil to empty.  You Also lose a good amount from the area not covered, though you can try to use a larger lid that would cover the pot, yet allow a tilt.    What you collect in the Pyrex container is steam distilled water.   I'm sure Youtube has some instructional video(s) on how to make your own as well.

Have you tried other grocery stores? Not really seeing a shortage from my experience.

Just came from Target and they had plenty of distilled water--think it was 85 cents.a gallon
Mr. Resident ✉
Aug '21
Look in the laundry section of your grocery store.  I used to buy it a Shop-Rite when I was in NJ.  Now I buy it at the local Kroeger (King Sooper) or Walmart, in Colorado they keep it with the drinking water and seltzer.
Agust ✉
Aug '21
I've used bottled spring or even tap water in a pinch without any damage to the machine.
You have to consider the mechanics of it... the water sits in a plastic tank with a metal disk at the bottom. The disk is gently warmed to facilitate evaporation as pressurized air is blown across the water and increase humidity into the air that is blown into your face.
The airflow is in one direction, so damage to the internal motor and fan or other components is unlikely. After prolonged use, you might need to scrub some scale off the metal disk and the plastic tank, but that's about it.

I use it when I make soap and lotions and it's in short supply here in Salem, Oregon too.

If you live in a golf resort town as I do in Arizona, there is absolutely no distilled water anywhere for weeks now.....none in grocery stores or Target, etc.  Batteries used in golf carts require distilled water.  I use distilled water for large expensive houseplants and certain appliances.
