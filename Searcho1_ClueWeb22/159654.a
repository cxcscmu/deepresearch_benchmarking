I've been hearing a lot about people taking ivermectin for COVID-19, but I'm not sure why. I know that ivermectin is a medication, but I thought it was主要用于治疗寄生虫感染。So, why are people using it for COVID? Is there any scientific evidence to support its use in treating or preventing COVID-19? I need to understand this better.

First, I should probably look up what ivermectin is and what it's normally used for. Then, I can see if there's any research on its effectiveness against COVID-19.

Let me start by searching for "what is ivermectin used for." I'll do that now.

Ivermectin - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Ivermectin
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Ivermectin is a medication used to treat parasite infestations. They can treat head lice, scabies, river blindness (onchocerciasis), strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, and lymphatic filariasis.[1] [2]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation has been widely spread saying that ivermectin is beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19.[3] [4] Though this cannot be proven to be true. [5] [6] General confusion, the infodemic and the lack of effective treatment seemingly attributed to individuals to repurpose various medications -  including ivermectin - on the market without approved indications for COVID-19 as potentially effective treatments and purchase them from unapproved websites.

Ivermectin Use in Veterinary Medicine: What you need to know
Sep 01, 2021 Share on
Written by Joseph Smith, DVM, MPS, PhD, , Assistant Professor of Farm Animal Medicine and Pharmacology, UTCVM Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences.
On September 1, 2021, the American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association, and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists released a statement on ending use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19.
Ivermectin is a member of the avermectin family of drugs that were originally developed in the 1970s. A researcher in Japan isolated a bacteria of the genus Streptomyces near a golf course in Honshu. The bacteria was noted to produce a compound that would clear roundworm infections in mice. In 2015, the researcher, Satoshi Ōmura, and his research partner, William C Campbell, received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the avermectins.
Ivermectin functions by interfering with channels that are used to relay signals in nerve and muscle cells. The drug binds to these channels, and as a result, the channel is left in an “open” position, which allows for an increased inhibitory effect. This leads to paralysis and the eventual death of the parasite or insect. It is important to note that while parasites and insects are more sensitive to ivermectin, the drug can act on the same receptors in mammalian cells.
Ivermectin has many uses in veterinary medicine. As an anthelmintic (“Dewormer”) medication it can be used to treat multiple species of internal and external parasites. Internal parasite species that can be treated with ivermectin include gastrointestinal worms (primarily roundworms) in horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats as well as lungworms in cattle and pigs. External parasites that can be treated with ivermectin in large animals include lice, mites, and grubs. In people, ivermectin is used for the treatment of river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis. It has additional uses for the treatment of lice and mite infestations in people.
There have been many recent reports of ivermectin as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in humans. It is important to keep in mind that these are preliminary studies that have not yet led to approved treatments by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Currently, robust and controlled studies on the effectiveness and safety of ivermectin for COVID infections are lacking. The FDA warns, “ Using any treatment for COVID-19 that’s not approved or authorized by the FDA, unless part of a clinical trial, can cause serious harm .” Ivermectin can cause toxicity in people, with adverse effects as severe as ataxia, coma, nervous system depression, and death. Using large animal formulations of ivermectin in species where it is not approved has led to overdose situations. For example: in the veterinary literature there are reports of ivermectin overdoses from the administration of the equine product to dogs, cats, ponies, and goats. At this time the FDA does not recommend the use of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19. People should discuss disease treatment or prevention with their health care provider.

Ivermectin is an antihelminthic medication that can be used to treat worms inside your body or mites on your body. Typically, oral ivermectin is used to treat worms, while topical ivermectin is prescribed for head lice, scabies, or other external conditions. The good news is, it usually only takes a single oral or topical dose to do the job and kill the nasty little critters! Ivermectin is only available by prescription, so follow your doctor’s instructions closely when using it. [1]
Method 1
Oral Ivermectin
1
Talk to your doctor about your suitability for ivermectin treatment. Oral ivermectin is typically used to treat worm infections, especially the worms strongyloides stercoralis and onchocerca volvulus.[2]
A single dose of ivermectin is usually sufficient to paralyze and kill the worms. [3]
Worm infections can cause weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and other symptoms. Visit your doctor for an assessment of your symptoms, testing, and a proper diagnosis. [4]
XExpert SourceMohammad Dar, MD
Board Certified Internist & Health Policy DirectorExpert Interview.  3 September 2021.
Oral ivermectin is safe for most people, but it is not recommended for pregnant women. Nursing women should use it only with extra caution.
Make sure your doctor knows about all medications and supplements you take, since drug interactions are possible.
2
Get a prescription for a single oral dose of ivermectin. Regardless of why your doctor prescribes ivermectin for you, you’ll almost certainly only have to take it one time. Depending on your age, weight, and condition, you may need to take one or multiple tablets as part of this single dose. [5]
Oral ivermectin typically comes in 3 mg tablets, so you may be prescribed 1-4 tablets for your single dose.
Make sure you are clear on your doctor’s instructions for taking the medication.
Ivermectin, in oral or topical form, is only available by prescription.
3
Take the medication on empty stomach, 1 hour before breakfast. Ivermectin is absorbed more quickly and efficiently on an empty stomach, which is the case right after you wake up in the morning. For the best results, take the medicine first thing in the morning, then wait at least an hour before eating. [6]
If your doctor gives you alternate instructions on when to take the medication, follow them.
4
Drink a full glass of water with your ivermectin dose. For safety when swallowing, and to help spur the absorption of the medication, it’s best to drink 8  fl oz (240 ml) of water when taking your dose of ivermectin. Pop the tablet in your mouth, take a big sip of water, swallow the tablet, and repeat the process if you’re taking additional tablets. Then finish off the glass of water. [7]
If you want to take the tablets with any beverage other than plain water, clear it with your doctor first.
5
Watch for side effects and report them if they’re serious. Most people who take oral ivermectin experience only mild side effects, or none at all. The side effects are usually caused by the dying worms, rather than by the medication itself. [8]
Possible side effects include headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, diarrhea, and swelling of the face or eyes. These typically occur within 1 day and last for no more than 1-2 days.
If any of the above side effects are moderate or severe, or if you have any difficulty breathing or seeing, contact your doctor right away.
6
Take a corticosteroid if directed and as directed. If you’re using oral ivermectin to kill worms, your doctor may also prescribe a corticosteroid to deal with inflammation that may be caused by the death of the worms. It’s very important that you follow your doctor’s instructions carefully when taking a corticosteroid, as they can cause significant side effects. [9]
You may be prescribed corticosteroids for several days or a week, then have to taper off the medication with lower doses over several days.
Side effects can include high blood pressure, increased blood sugar levels, night sweats, weight gain, and mood swings, among others.
7
Repeat the dosage in 3-12 months if recommended. A single dose of oral ivermectin is typically sufficient to kill off the worms in your body. However, your doctor will likely recommend a return visit in several months, and may at that time prescribe another dose of ivermectin. [10]
If this is the case, you’ll take the ivermectin exactly as before.
Method 2
Topical Ivermectin
1
Ask your doctor about ivermectin for lice or other conditions. While oral ivermectin usually targets worms living inside your body, topical ivermectin is typically used to kill tiny critters living on your body. It’s a treatment option for head lice, for example, but you’ll have to get a prescription from your doctor to use it. [11]
For lice treatment, a 0.5% ivermectin lotion is usually prescribed. [12]
XResearch source
Topical ivermectin may also be prescribed for other external conditions, especially scabies. In some cases oral ivermectin is used for scabies, though. [13]
XTrustworthy SourceAmerican Academy of Family PhysiciansOrganization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communitiesGo to source
The steps in this section describe using topical ivermectin for head lice, so follow your doctor’s instructions if you’re using it for scabies or any other external condition.
2
Follow your doctor’s instructions for a single head lice treatment. In most cases, you only have to apply ivermectin once in order to kill head lice. Your doctor will probably prescribe a single-use tube of topical ivermectin and give you specific application instructions. Listen carefully to your doctor’s instructions and follow them exactly. [14]
Never use more than one dose of ivermectin unless instructed by your doctor. If there is any ivermectin left after your dose, throw it away.
3
Apply the lotion to your scalp and work it through the lice-infested hair. Massage the lotion outward from your scalp to the tips of your hair. Use enough of the lotion to thinly coat all the hair on your head. [15]
Try not to get any ivermectin in your eyes or mouth. Rinse with lots of clean water if you do get a small amount in your eyes or mouth. Contact your doctor if you get a significant amount in your mouth or eyes.
With a good mirror, an adult can usually manage doing a self-treatment. Never let a child try to apply ivermectin themselves, however.
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after applying the lotion.
4
Rinse the lotion out with water after 10 minutes. It’s important that you leave the lotion on for 10 minutes—this gives it time to paralyze and kill the lice. After 10 minutes is up, take a shower or use a rinsing cup to fully rinse away the lotion. Use nothing but clean water. [16]
Do not use shampoo to rinse out the lotion. You want some traces of it to be left behind so it can continue to do its work.
Make sure you don’t get any lotion in your eyes or mouth while rinsing.
Wash your hands with soap and water after rinsing out the lotion.
5
Use a lice comb to remove lice eggs in your damp hair. After rinsing out the ivermectin, remove any tangles from your hair with a regular comb or brush. Then, go section-by-section with the lice comb and comb out each section of hair from root to tip. Dip the comb in a bowl of soapy water after every brush stroke. [17]
Lice eggs look like brownish sesame seeds. Use a magnifying glass if you’re having trouble spotting them.
Once you're done, flush the soapy water (and lice eggs) down the toilet, then sanitize your lice comb and regular comb or brush in a mixture of 16  fl oz (470 ml) of hot water and 2 tsp (10 ml) of ammonia for at least 10 minutes. Finish by washing your hands with soap and water again.
You won’t need to use the ivermectin again, but you should repeat this combing process at least once per week for 3 weeks. Contact your doctor if you still spot lice or eggs after 3 weeks.
6
Sanitize your clothing and personal care items. Wash all the towels, bedding, and clothing that you’ve worn or used recently in hot water, or have them dry cleaned. Sanitize any personal care items that touch your head—like combs and hair clips—in the same type of ammonia solution you used for the lice comb. [18]
If you don’t take this step, you’ll probably become re-infested with head lice.
7
Manage mild side effects and report serious ones. Topical ivermectin usually causes only mild side effects. These most commonly include redness, itching, dryness, or dandruff in the application area. You may also experience mild swelling, redness, or irritation around your eyes. [19]
Talk to your doctor beforehand regarding any other side effects you should look out for.
Contact your doctor if you have any moderate to severe side effects.

Ivermectin — codes and concepts
open
What is ivermectin?
Ivermectin is a macrocyclic lactone medicine used to treat parasitic infections. In New Zealand, ivermectin is available in 3 mg tablets (Stromectol™). Ivermectin cream (Soolantra™) was approved by the FDA in December 2014 but is not yet readily available.
What is ivermectin used for?
Ivermectin is effective against infections with:
Parasitic worms including: onchocerciasis (river blindness), strongyloides, cutaneous larva migrans and filiariasis such as onchocerciasis
Ectoparasites, including scabies
Ivermectin has been used extensively as part of the World Health Organisation's Onchocerciasis Eradication Program. It has FDA approval for the treatment of strongyloides and onchocerciasis in the United States, other use is termed ‘off label’.
In treatment of scabies its use may be appropriate in selected cases where topical therapy is impractical or has failed and is particularly useful in cases of crusted scabies (also called ‘Norwegian’ scabies).
Ivermectin can also be used to control demodicosis. Ivermectin cream has been shown to reduce papulopustular rosacea, which is thought to be due to its effects on demodex mites and its anti- inflammatory action.
A 2021 Cochrane Review has not found sufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin for preventing or treating COVID-19.
Scabies can be treated with ivermectin
Burrows
Scabies hypersensitivity rash
Crusted scabies
How does ivermectin work?
Ivermectin stimulates excessive release of neurotransmitters in the peripheral nervous system of parasites. It is thought to work by paralysing the parasite or inactivating the parasite gut. In humans the neurotransmitters acted on by ivermectin are in the brain. A protective barrier, called the blood-brain barrier, blocks ivermectin from reaching the human brain.
Is ivermectin safe?
Oral ivermectin appears to be a safe medication.
Ivermectin is primarily metabolised in the liver by CYP450-3A47 and has a plasma half life of 16 hours. It is almost exclusively excreted in faeces with minimal clearance by the kidneys. It therefore does not require dose adjustment for people with renal failure. There have been some reports of a mild anti- coagulation effect. However, this is usually not significant enough to alter coagulation parameters such as the prothrombin ratio.
How is oral ivermectin taken?
Ivermectin is taken as a single dose with a glass of water. The tablets can be crushed, for example to be given via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. It is rapidly absorbed from the gut and metabolised in the liver.
Infestation
Dose regime
Onchocerciasis
Single dose of 150mcg/kg (may be repeated every 3 to 12 months)
Strongyloidiasis
Single dose of 200mcg/kg
Scabies
Dose of 200mcg/kg repeated in 7 to 14 days
Cutaneous larva migrans
Single dose of 200mcg/kg
Side effects of ivermectin
Side effects of oral ivermectin are rare and usually minor. These include:
Transient tachycardia (fast heart rate)
Flushing
Nausea
Lightheadedness
In treatment of onchocerciasis; fever, rash, muscle or joint aches and tender glands and eye irritation/swelling or pain
In treatment of strongyloidiasis; diarrhoea, skin rash
More severe neurological side effects are theoretically possible in rare susceptible individuals
The safety of ivermectin in pregnant women has not been studied and such use is not recommended. Studies in animals have shown an increase in birth defects. Safety and effectiveness in children under 15kg has not been established. Ivermectin passes into breast milk and use during breast feeding is not recommended.
Ivermectin cream can irritate and cause a burning sensation on treated skin.
Drug interactions with ivermectin
No significant drug interactions with ivermectin are recognised.
New Zealand approved datasheets are the official source of information for these prescription medicines, including approved uses and risk information. Check the individual New Zealand datasheet on the Medsafe website.

Update: Can Ivermectin be used to treat COVID-19?
What is ivermectin?
Ivermectin is an anti-parasite medication used to treat parasitic diseases.
Ivermectin is an FDA approved drug for use in humans to treat a variety of parasitic infections including parasitic worms, hookworm and whipworm. It may also be used as an effective treatment for a wide range of other conditions and as a treatment of onchocerciasis, intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis or river blindness.
The antiviral activity of Ivermectin has been shown against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses, for example, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and others.
Ivermectin and Covid-19 Treatment
Ivermectin is currently being investigated in a clinical trial as a potential COVID-19 treatment for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Virus, which is the virus that causes COVID-19. The FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 infection in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 to reduce viral replication, except in clinical trials.
Experimental studies for ivermectin as an adjunct treatment for antiviral effects of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients: a randomized multi-center clinical trial. There is currently insufficient evidence from the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients for the treatment of severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms.
Click for further information on using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 and other prevention and investigational treatments and discuss with your health care provider.
The CDC are reporting adverse effects associated with ivermectin misuse and overdose are increasing. In some cases people have taken veterinary products intended for use in large animals such as horses, sheep, and cattle. These products are highly concentrated and result in overdoses when used by humans. DO NOT TAKE IVERMECTIN PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR ANIMAL USE.
Warnings
You will need to have a stool exam after taking ivermectin to make sure the infection is gone. Some patients may need to take another dose of ivermectin to treat the infection.
Ivermectin may make you feel dizzy. To lower the chance of feeling dizzy or passing out, rise slowly if you have been sitting or lying down. Be careful going up and down stairs.
Before taking this medicine
You should not use ivermectin if you are allergic to it.
To make sure ivermectin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have:
liver or kidney disease; or
cancer, HIV or AIDS, or other conditions that can weaken your immune system.
It is not known whether ivermectin will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant while using this medication.
Ivermectin can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.
Ivermectin should not be given to a child who weighs less than 33 pounds (15 kg).
How should I take ivermectin?
Never take ivermectin in larger amounts, or for longer than recommended by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label.
Take ivermectin on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.
Ivermectin is usually given as a single dose. Take this medicine with a full glass of water.
To effectively treat your infection, you may need to take ivermectin again several months to a year after your first dose.
If you have a weak immune system (caused by disease or by using certain medicine), you may need to take more than one dose of ivermectin. Some people who have a weak immune system need to take this medicine on a regular basis. Follow your doctor's instructions.
To make sure this medicine is working, you may need to provide frequent stool samples.
Store this medicine at room temperature away from moisture and heat.

Popular FAQ
Is ivermectin safe for humans, and what is it used for?
When taken as directed, ivermectin is safe for humans to use. The tablets are taken by mouth to treat intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, two tropical infections caused by parasitic worms. Topical ivermectin is approved to treat head lice and rosacea.
Is Ivermectin FDA approved as a Covid Treatment?
No, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any form of ivermectin for treatment of COVID-19. To date, no data has shown it to be effective for treating or preventing COVID-19. The forms that are available for human use are approved to treat infections caused by parasitic worms or for rosacea.
Self-medicating with large doses of ivermectin can cause:
Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Low blood pressure
Allergic reactions
Dizziness
Balance problems
Seizures
Coma
Death
Does ivermectin cause infertility?
Ivermectin is not known to cause infertility, and it is not stated as a side effect on the FDA label. In September 2021, misinformation was spread online about ivermectin causing male infertility. It was based on a very small flawed 2002 study mentioned in a 2011 study. Animal studies with rats given 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg did not show any adverse effects related to fertility.
Should you drink Ivermectin for Covid treatment?
No. Many people have gotten very sick and had to be hospitalized after taking forms of ivermectin that are only approved for use in animals. Animal ivermectin products are very different from those approved for humans. Taking animal ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in people is dangerous.
Who makes Ivermectin?
Ivermectin is a generic medication made by several different manufacturers. It also comes under the brand name Stromectol, which is made by Merck Sharp & Dohme Co.
Is ivermectin an over-the-counter (OTC) drug?
Sklice lotion, which is a form of ivermectin approved to treat head lice, is available OTC. Other forms and dosages of ivermectin for human use require a prescription from your health care provider.

Alright, so from the search results, I can see that ivermectin is primarily used as an anti-parasitic medication. It's used to treat infections caused by parasites like worms and mites. For example, it's used to treat conditions like river blindness, strongyloidiasis, and scabies. So, that's its main purpose.

Now, regarding its use for COVID-19, it seems like there's a lot of controversy and misinformation out there. From what I'm reading, the FDA has not approved ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Despite that, some people are still taking it for this purpose, which is concerning because it can lead to serious health risks.

One of the search results mentions that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread misinformation about ivermectin being beneficial for treating and preventing COVID-19. It also says that general confusion and the lack of effective treatment have led some individuals to repurpose medications like ivermectin without approved indications for COVID-19.

Another search result refers to a Cochrane Review from 2021 that didn't find sufficient evidence to support the use of ivermectin for preventing or treating COVID-19. So, based on current scientific evidence, it doesn't seem like ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19.

However, despite this, I've heard of people taking ivermectin for COVID-19. I think part of the reason might be that some early studies suggested it could have antiviral properties, but subsequent research hasn't confirmed its efficacy for COVID-19 specifically.

Moreover, there's been a lot of confusion because ivermectin is an approved medication for other conditions, so some people might think it's safe to take for COVID-19 as well. But as the search results indicate, self-medicating with ivermectin for COVID-19 can lead to serious side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, allergic reactions, dizziness, balance problems, seizures, coma, and even death.

There's also been an issue with people mistakenly taking veterinary formulations of ivermectin, which are much stronger and intended for larger animals. These can be extremely dangerous for humans and have led to numerous hospitalizations.

So, to summarize, ivermectin is approved for treating parasitic infections, but not for COVID-19. People are taking it for COVID-19 despite the lack of evidence for its effectiveness and the potential for serious side effects. It's crucial for individuals to rely on accurate information from reputable sources and to consult with healthcare professionals before taking any medication for off-label uses.

I think that covers the main points. If there's anything else I should consider, I can look into it further.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People are taking ivermectin for COVID-19 despite its lack of approval and efficacy for this purpose, driven by misinformation and confusion during the pandemic.}} \]
