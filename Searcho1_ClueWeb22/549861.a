I'm trying to understand why so many young people seem to be attracted to communism. It's a bit puzzling because communism has a complex history with both positive and negative aspects. I need to approach this thoughtfully and consider various perspectives.

First, I should probably define what communism is, at least in general terms, so that I'm clear about what I'm discussing. Communism is an ideological system that advocates for a classless society in which all property is communally owned, and everyone contributes and benefits according to their abilities and needs. It's based on the works of Marx and Engels, who critiqued capitalism and proposed communism as an alternative.

Now, considering that, why would young people today be interested in such an ideology? Maybe I should look into some recent surveys or studies that have explored this trend. Perhaps there have been polls or academic research on the subject.

Let me try to find some data on this. Maybe something like "young people's views on communism" or "rising support for communism among millennials and gen z."

Teachers and parents protest over school closures in Oakland
Neal Adams: Comic book artist Neal Adams dies at age 80
Communism continues to be viewed positively by a significant portion of the U.S. population, especially young people: 28% of Generation Z have a favorable view of communism, 30% view Marxism in the same manner, and only one-third understand the Chinese Communist Party has killed more than Nazism.

The 28% of young Americans who view communism favorably are either ignorant or cold-hearted. Take the Holodomor, for example. Between 1931 and 1934, the Soviet government starved ethnic Ukrainians through a man-made famine in which at least 3.9 million Ukrainians died. Red Famine author Anne Applebaum’s description of the famine is enough to turn your stomach:
“In the first phase the body consumes its stores of glucose. Feelings of extreme hunger set in… In the second phase, which can last several weeks, the body begins to consume its own fats and the organism weakens drastically. In the third phase, the body devours its own proteins, cannibalising tissues and muscles. Eventually the skin becomes thin, the eyes distended, the legs and belly swollen as extreme imbalances lead the body to retain water.”
Besides Joseph Stalin, the list of massacres by Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China is extensive. Between the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Land Reform, and the Cultural Revolution, it’s estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70 million Chinese lost their lives. One survivor of the Cultural Revolution, York College professor Zehao Zhou, recalled: “Two enemies of the state lived under the same roof as me — my sister and my father.” His sister’s crime? Being a schoolteacher. His father’s? Serving with Americans during World War II. When Zehao’s father died from years of assaults by the Red Guard, a paramilitary movement, Zehao was not even allowed to mourn him as he was an “enemy of the state.”
And while the current Cuban regime has been nowhere near as bloody, its strict authoritarianism has led to thousands of Cubans protesting in the streets for the end of communist rule.
Has the United States failed at educating its youth of these horrors?
For Americans who weren’t alive under the Cuban Missile Crisis or the fall of the Berlin Wall, communism is just an economic system, not a political one. But rebellious youth challenging the anti-communism status quo is not the only explanation for these pro-communism views. Modern politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, should be criticized.
Republican rhetoric has softened communism by associating socialism with communism, making redistributive political systems more appealing to young people disillusioned with American inequality. And influential Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, who liken democratic-socialist countries to nirvana, certainly do not help to promote capitalism as the best economic system. Statements from organizations such as Black Lives Matter, in which they blame the U.S. embargo as the cause of Cuba’s recent protests, all while praising the Cuban regime, also push pro-communism sentiments. Thankfully, some states are recognizing the issue.
Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill that would require first-hand accounts from victims of totalitarian dictatorships to be included in the K-12 civics curriculum. In the same week, the Arizona Legislature passed a similar bill in which schools will teach a comparative discussion of political ideologies, including communism. Other states should be taking note.
While Cubans protest the devastating communist regime, some Americans continue to revere communism, all while they live in a free, prosperous society. This reverence is inconceivable. Communism isn’t something that “only works in theory.” It is a murderous ideology that’s failed every time it’s been practiced. The evidence? A basic understanding of history.

Survey Finds High Support For Communism Among Millennials

History repeats itself, first as tragedy, the second as farce. — Karl Marx
If anyone needed new evidence that millennials have been deprived of a basic education, a new survey provides it with findings about their high acceptance rates of mass-murder-enabling ideologies such as socialism and communism.
Today, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) released a unique “Annual Report on U.S. Attitudes towards Socialism,” gauging Americans’ attitudes toward socialism, communism, and related ideas. Data firm YouGov conducted the polling, which informed much of the report. We’ve known millennials had a thing for Bernie Sanders’ brand of socialism for a while, but these numbers show a generation sadly misinformed about the historical and present realities of life under communism and socialism.
“An emerging generation of Americans have little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history,” said Marion Smith, VOC’s executive director. “Unfortunately, this report, which we intend to release on an annual basis, confirms this worrisome impression.”
Youth Is Wasted on the Young
For decades, especially during the Cold War, Americans have broadly held a negative view of communism and socialism, and needed little prodding to speak against such ideologies. But that has changed. The millennial generation, born in 1982 and the two decades following, have sharply different views of communism and socialism than older Americans.
According to the study, just over half of millennials (55 percent) believe communism was and still is a problem, compared with 80 percent of Baby Boomers and 91 percent of elderly Americans. Only 37 percent of millennials have a “very unfavorable” view of communism, while 57 percent of the rest of Americans do. A surprising 64 percent of Americans agreed with the classic Karl Marx statement that underpins Marxist philosophy: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.
Before Sanders’ presidential campaign, I would have been shocked to learn nearly half of millennials (45 percent) say they would vote for a socialist. It all sounds so fair, so progressive, so hipster. It correlates with millennials’ absurd unemployment rate: 12.8 percent, double the national unemployment rate. And so more than half believe America’s economic system works against them and four in 10 call for a “complete change” of America’s economic system to ensure highest earners pay their “fair share.”
It’s clear millennials are uninformed about basic economics and global affairs. Socialists’ demands for the most productive citizens to pay for the bulk of Venezuelan taxes and other socialist measures has directly led to starving citizens waiting in bread lines to eat, looting stores, and killing each other in street brawls that include trampling children to death. History and current affairs provides more than enough evidence that the pleasant-sounding mantras of socialism and communism lead directly to death chambers, starvation, and mass graves. These are realities everyone, millennials included, need for the world’s sake to know.
I Like Karl Marx and I Cannot Lie
Of course, all these beliefs that 18- to 30-somethings hold didn’t come from nowhere. They stem from spending the first quarter of their lives in a public education system that would rather teach self-esteem than history. Many history courses have discarded or greatly paraphrased how and why the Soviet Union collapsed and the stark differences between living under a free enterprise system and say, surviving during the Cold War, when socialism peaked and the contrast looked black and white.
It’s the only way to explain why 1 in 4 Americans (26 percent) and one third of millennials (32 percent) falsely believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than under Joseph Stalin. Despite embracing ideologies communist leaders represent, however, many millennials are unfamiliar with communist leaders: 42 percent recognized Mao Zedong, 40 percent Che Guevara; 18 percent Joseph Stalin; 33 percent Vladimir Lenin; and 18 percent Vladimir Putin 18.
Of those who are familiar with Lenin, 25 percent view him favorably. Instead of being responsible for founding a totalitarian dictatorship, murdering countless millions, and, oh, I don’t know, massive human rights abuses, they think he’s just a champion of the working class, like good ole’ Bernie.
If education is the bedrock of society, consider it crumbling. When schools replace God and history facts with safe places and self-esteem, it produces a generation of adults with little historical perspective and general ignorance of the world.
“This report clearly reveals a need for educating our youth on the dangerous implications of socialist ideals. We will continue to work with educators to build curriculum to address this important need,” Smith said.
These Are Our Future Leaders
The biggest problem this study reveals, second only to the devastating effects of education that’s focused more on extracurriculars and encouraging self-esteem rather than math, writing and (accurate) history books, is the fact that these young people are on due course to be state and federal politicians, teachers, law enforcement, and business people.
In his 2006 pop hit, “Waiting on the World to Change,” John Mayer (a Generation Xer) crooned, “One day our generation is gonna rule the population / so we keep waiting, waiting on the world to change.” Not only is this generation going to rule the population, but these folks embrace an ideology they think will change the world. It will—but not for the better.
Oddly, an entire generation that embraced “The Hunger Games” (and its anti-socialism themes) with gusto is going ga-ga for an ideology that would have everyone living like Katniss Everdeen’s impoverished District 12. No, socialism and the millennials who love it will bring on the Hunger Games, but in reverse, and the odds are not in anybody’s favor.
Forget waiting on the world to change. It’s time to change it. This starts with teaching millennials the truth about socialism before they rule the population into ruin.

Disturbing number of young Americans favor communism

RIP America?
A distrurbing poll found that one-third of Millennials view communism favorably.
The same poll found that 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist.
According to a poll commissioned by the Washington, D.C. area nonprofit Victims of Communism, 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist while one in three view communism favorably.
The same poll also reported that 27 percent of people believe President Donald Trump is the biggest threat to world peace. The survey placed the U.S. president over North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

According to YouGov, 36 percent of millennials say they approve of communism. That percentage is up almost 10 percent from 2018.
While most college students today are not technically “millennials,” since Pew Research identifies members of that generation as those who were between the ages of 23 and 38 in 2019, more than one-third of the millennial generation is college-educated, the most ever for a single generation, according to City Lab.
The majority of students in college today are considered Generation Z, or those who fall between the ages of 7 and 22.

The report also included other jarring statistics, including how 22 percent of millennials believe “society would be better if all private property was abolished.” In addition, 45 percent of Generation Z and millennials agree that “all higher education should be free.”
The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Executive Director Marion Smith describes this shift as the “historical amnesia” about the dangers of communism and socialism. In a statement, Smith said, “When we don’t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn’t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas.”

In 2017, Campus Reform covered a story in which a poll had similar findings: that “more millennials would prefer to live under a socialist regime than a capitalist one, though only about one-third of respondents were able to successfully define the term “socialism.”

Joseph Eklach, University of Florida Turning Point USA vice president, reacted to this poll in a statement to Campus Reform.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom because they take it for granted living in the USA. They’re in a privileged position only first world nations afford that allows them to advocate for equality. Our colleges fail to teach our generation of the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism,” Eklach said.
Campus Reform reached out to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.

More than a third of millennials approve of communism, YouGov poll indicates
‘Capitalism is clearly and undeniably failing. It’s directly responsible for the climate catastrophe and everybody knows it,’ says political science professor

More than a third of millennials in the US now approve of communism, while the popularity of capitalism has plummeted since 2018, according to YouGov polling.
The survey found just 57 per cent of 23 to 38-year-olds believe the Declaration of Independence better “guarantees freedom and equality” than the Communist Manifesto, with only 50 per cent viewing capitalism favourably.
Approval of the controversial ideology rose by 8 per cent in the past year to 36 per cent, the survey of 2,100 adults found, while appreciation for capitalism dropped by the same margin.
“It’s an alternative,” said professor of political theory at San Jose University, Lawrence Quill. “The theories are so broad they lend themselves to endorsement by very different sorts of people looking for very different things.
“[Younger generations have] no memory whatsoever of the Cold War and its related ideological battlefield. There is an absence of an ‘overlapping consensus’ based on the shared experiences of war or Cold War.”

In contrast, the proportion of those harbouring favourable views of the ideology remained extremely low among “boomers” (seven per cent) and the over-74s (four per cent).
Jodi Dean, a political science professor at New York’s Hobart and William Smith Colleges, offered further reasons for the current popularity of communism among younger generations.
“First, capitalism is clearly and undeniably failing. It’s directly responsible for the climate catastrophe and everybody knows it,” Ms Dean said.
“Second, the US right calls everything it doesn’t like ‘communist’. They call Clinton and Obama ‘communists’. With ‘communist’ as the go-to name for anything that isn’t right wing, its acceptability increases. If you don’t like the right, you’re a communist.”
While this misrepresentation of communism may have helped to boost its popularity among millennials, it appears socialism is also growing in popularity with this demographic, despite general confusion over how to define the ideology.

The survey indicates that while the vast majority of Americans consider themselves knowledgeable about socialism, they are divided over whether Scandinavia, the Soviet Union or the US itself offer the best examples of a socialist nation.
Spelling mixed news for presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, 70 per cent of millennial respondents said they were likely to vote for a socialist candidate, with the number of those “extremely likely” to do so doubling in the past year to 20 per cent.
But overall, Americans were more hesitant to endorse a democratic socialist – which Mr Sanders identifies as – with a majority of those polled saying they would hesitate, or would never vote for such a candidate.
Once ideological labels were stripped away, the results appeared to suggest that many Americans could support an anti-neoliberal message.
70 per cent of those polled described economic inequality as a major issue, with nearly two thirds of respondents believing the country’s highest earners are not paying their fair share of taxes.
Nearly half of those surveyed said a “complete change of our economic system is needed”.
However, when faced with radical proposals that could facilitate such change, the generational divide was apparent.
One in five millennials polled believe “society would be better if all private property was abolished” compared to just one per cent of over-74s, while more than a third of millennials support universal basic income compared with 17 per cent of pensioners.
“Millennials are the first generation of US Americans to have life prospects worse than their parents,” Ms Dean explained. ”The astronomical student debt load means that many young people put off the major purchases and life events linked to adulthood in the US -- buying a car or a house, getting married.

“At the same time, in highly populated cities like San Francisco, LA, Seattle, and NYC, rents are out of control. And we don’t have national healthcare.
“So paying for the basics of everyday life has become impossible. And we are told repeatedly that social security is in crisis and won’t survive. As one young person told me: ‘My retirement program is socialism’.”
Mr Quill explained how instability as a result of unbridled capitalism may have influenced this lurch to the left.
“As long as unfettered capitalism could promise growth for the majority of western populations, ruminating about the effectiveness of capitalism was kept at bay,” Mr Quill said. ”As belts tighten, and the centre of economic gravity moves east, conspicuous consumption is no longer lauded at home.”
“I actually saw someone being heckled the other day because they were driving a Tesla – you’d think the green credentials of the owner would have warranted applause, but no. Extraordinary.”
The annual poll, commissioned by Victims of Communism, also indicated more than a quarter of Americans of all ages viewed Donald Trump as a greater threat to world peace than North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un (22 per cent) and Vladimir Putin (15 per cent).
“For all the criticisms of the ignorance and illiteracy of the American public (inability to identify countries on a map, confusion over basic historical facts), it is gratifying to see that more than a quarter recognise that the US is a greater danger to world peace than Korea or Russia,” Ms Dean said.
“After all, the US has hundreds of military bases all over the world and regularly destabilises and invades other countries. It has pulled out of the Paris Accord, the nuclear deal with Iran, and the INF treaty with Russia.
“Trump appears especially erratic and unhinged, but what is most striking is how he has shed the veneer of concern with human rights that has covered US militarism for decades.”
Mr Quill suggested this general view of Mr Trump is attributed to him directly, rather than the office he holds.

“It would be easy to suggest that young Americans have fallen into a funk about their country. I don’t think this is quite right,” he said. ”
My view is that young Americans do not see Trump as the new normal. They view his presidency as an aberration, a reaction against the progressivism of the Obama years, and one that will self-correct.
“They are still very optimistic about the future (except social security provision) and think that things will get fixed somehow by someone.
“The popularity of the Green New Deal among many younger people is a case in point.”

Communism Capitalism YouGov Soviet Union Bernie Sanders Socialism Wealth inequality

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got these search results here. Let's see what they're saying about why young people like communism.

First doc is from MSN, titled "Why do so many young people like communism?" It seems like it's arguing that young people have a favorable view of communism despite its history of atrocities. The author mentions surveys showing that 28% of Gen Z have a favorable view of communism and 30% view Marxism favorably. The article points out that this might be due to a lack of education about the horrors of communism, like the Holodomor in Ukraine, the purges under Stalin, and the mass killings under Mao in China. It also criticizes both Republicans and Democrats for contributing to this perception: Republicans for equating socialism with communism and Democrats for having figures like Bernie Sanders praising democratic socialism. The article concludes by mentioning that some states are starting to include teachings about the victims of totalitarian regimes in their curriculums.

Second doc is from The Federalist, dated October 2016, discussing a survey that found high support for communism among millennials. It talks about how millennials have a different view of communism and socialism compared to older generations and attributes this to a lack of education about history, particularly the failures of communist regimes. The article mentions that 55% of millennials believe communism was and still is a problem, compared to 80% of Baby Boomers and 91% of elderly Americans. It also notes that 45% of millennials say they would vote for a socialist. The author blames the public education system for focusing on self-esteem over history and facts, leading to a generation that is uninformed about the dangers of socialism and communism.

Third doc is another MSN article, seemingly the same as the first one, so I'll skip that.

Fourth doc is from EducationViews.org, titled "Disturbing number of young Americans favor communism." It references a poll by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which found that 36% of millennials view communism favorably and 70% are likely to vote for a socialist. The article also mentions that 22% of millennials believe society would be better if all private property was abolished. The executive director of the foundation attributes this to a lack of education about the history of communism and its victims. A student from the University of Florida is quoted as saying that millennials take freedom for granted and that colleges fail to teach the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism.

Fifth doc is from The Independent, discussing a YouGov poll that shows more than a third of millennials approve of communism, while approval of capitalism has dropped. The article suggests that younger generations have no memory of the Cold War and therefore don't have the same negative associations with communism as older generations. A political science professor is quoted as saying that capitalism is failing and that the right wing in the US labels anything they don't like as "communist," which may make it more acceptable to younger people. The poll also shows that 70% of millennials are likely to vote for a socialist candidate.

So, from these articles, a few themes emerge:

1. Lack of education about the history of communism and its atrocities is a major factor. Young people may not be aware of the mass murders and famines caused by communist regimes.

2. The public education system is criticized for focusing too much on self-esteem and not enough on accurate history and economics.

3. Political figures and movements, like Bernie Sanders and democratic socialism, may be influencing young people's views positively towards socialism and, by extension, communism.

4. There's a sense of disillusionment with capitalism, especially regarding economic inequality and the climate crisis, which may make alternatives like socialism and communism more attractive to young people.

5. The absence of firsthand experience with the Cold War and communist threats means younger generations don't have the same fear or negativity towards communism as older generations.

Given this information, it seems that the main reasons young people like communism are a lack of historical knowledge about its failures and atrocities, influence from political figures who promote socialist ideas, and a growing dissatisfaction with capitalism due to economic and environmental issues.

However, it's important to note that the sources I've looked at so far are mostly from conservative outlets, which may have a bias against communism and socialism. Maybe I should look for perspectives from the left to get a more balanced view.

Let me try searching for "why young people support communism" or "young people's views on communism" with a focus on left-leaning sources.

Communism continues to be viewed positively by a significant portion of the U.S. population, especially young people: 28% of Generation Z have a favorable view of communism, 30% view Marxism in the same manner, and only one-third understand the Chinese Communist Party has killed more than Nazism.

The 28% of young Americans who view communism favorably are either ignorant or cold-hearted. Take the Holodomor, for example. Between 1931 and 1934, the Soviet government starved ethnic Ukrainians through a man-made famine in which at least 3.9 million Ukrainians died. Red Famine author Anne Applebaum’s description of the famine is enough to turn your stomach:
“In the first phase the body consumes its stores of glucose. Feelings of extreme hunger set in… In the second phase, which can last several weeks, the body begins to consume its own fats and the organism weakens drastically. In the third phase, the body devours its own proteins, cannibalising tissues and muscles. Eventually the skin becomes thin, the eyes distended, the legs and belly swollen as extreme imbalances lead the body to retain water.”
Besides Joseph Stalin, the list of massacres by Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China is extensive. Between the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Land Reform, and the Cultural Revolution, it’s estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70 million Chinese lost their lives.

Why do so many young people like communism?

Communism continues to be viewed positively by a significant portion of the U.S. population, especially young people: 28% of Generation Z have a favorable view of communism, 30% view Marxism in the same manner, and only one-third understand the Chinese Communist Party has killed more than Nazism.
The 28% of young Americans who view communism favorably are either ignorant or cold-hearted. Take the Holodomor, for example. Between 1931 and 1934, the Soviet government starved ethnic Ukrainians through a man-made famine in which at least 3.9 million Ukrainians died. Red Famine author Anne Applebaum’s description of the famine is enough to turn your stomach:
“In the first phase the body consumes its stores of glucose. Feelings of extreme hunger set in… In the second phase, which can last several weeks, the body begins to consume its own fats and the organism weakens drastically. In the third phase, the body devours its own proteins, cannibalising tissues and muscles. Eventually the skin becomes thin, the eyes distended, the legs and belly swollen as extreme imbalances lead the body to retain water.”
Besides Joseph Stalin, the list of massacres by Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China is extensive. Between the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Land Reform, and the Cultural Revolution, it’s estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70 million Chinese lost their lives. One survivor of the Cultural Revolution, York College professor Zehao Zhou, recalled: “Two enemies of the state lived under the same roof as me — my sister and my father.” His sister’s crime?

Survey Finds High Support For Communism Among Millennials

History repeats itself, first as tragedy, the second as farce. — Karl Marx
If anyone needed new evidence that millennials have been deprived of a basic education, a new survey provides it with findings about their high acceptance rates of mass-murder-enabling ideologies such as socialism and communism.
Today, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) released a unique “Annual Report on U.S. Attitudes towards Socialism,” gauging Americans’ attitudes toward socialism, communism, and related ideas. Data firm YouGov conducted the polling, which informed much of the report. We’ve known millennials had a thing for Bernie Sanders’ brand of socialism for a while, but these numbers show a generation sadly misinformed about the historical and present realities of life under communism and socialism.
“An emerging generation of Americans have little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history,” said Marion Smith, VOC’s executive director. “Unfortunately, this report, which we intend to release on an annual basis, confirms this worrisome impression.”
Youth Is Wasted on the Young
For decades, especially during the Cold War, Americans have broadly held a negative view of communism and socialism, and needed little prodding to speak against such ideologies. But that has changed. The millennial generation, born in 1982 and the two decades following, have sharply different views of communism and socialism than older Americans.
According to the study, just over half of millennials (55 percent) believe communism was and still is a problem, compared with 80 percent of Baby Boomers and 91 percent of elderly Americans. Only 37 percent of millennials have a “very unfavorable” view of communism, while 57 percent of the rest of Americans do. A surprising 64 percent of Americans agreed with the classic Karl Marx statement that underpins Marxist philosophy: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.
Before Sanders’ presidential campaign, I would have been shocked to learn nearly half of millennials (45 percent) say they would vote for a socialist. It all sounds so fair, so progressive, so hipster. It correlates with millennials’ absurd unemployment rate: 12.8 percent, double the national unemployment rate. And so more than half believe America’s economic system works against them and four in 10 call for a “complete change” of America’s economic system to ensure highest earners pay their “fair share.”
It’s clear millennials are uninformed about basic economics and global affairs. Socialists’ demands for the most productive citizens to pay for the bulk of Venezuelan taxes and other socialist measures has directly led to starving citizens waiting in bread lines to eat, looting stores, and killing each other in street brawls that include trampling children to death. History and current affairs provides more than enough evidence that the pleasant-sounding mantras of socialism and communism lead directly to death chambers, starvation, and mass graves. These are realities everyone, millennials included, need for the world’s sake to know.
I Like Karl Marx and I Cannot Lie
Of course, all these beliefs that 18- to 30-somethings hold didn’t come from nowhere. They stem from spending the first quarter of their lives in a public education system that would rather teach self-esteem than history. Many history courses have discarded or greatly paraphrased how and why the Soviet Union collapsed and the stark differences between living under a free enterprise system and say, surviving during the Cold War, when socialism peaked and the contrast looked black and white.
It’s the only way to explain why 1 in 4 Americans (26 percent) and one third of millennials (32 percent) falsely believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than under Joseph Stalin. Despite embracing ideologies communist leaders represent, however, many millennials are unfamiliar with communist leaders: 42 percent recognized Mao Zedong, 40 percent Che Guevara; 18 percent Joseph Stalin; 33 percent Vladimir Lenin; and 18 percent Vladimir Putin 18.
Of those who are familiar with Lenin, 25 percent view him favorably. Instead of being responsible for founding a totalitarian dictatorship, murdering countless millions, and, oh, I don’t know, massive human rights abuses, they think he’s just a champion of the working class, like good ole’ Bernie.
If education is the bedrock of society, consider it crumbling. When schools replace God and history facts with safe places and self-esteem, it produces a generation of adults with little historical perspective and general ignorance of the world.
“This report clearly reveals a need for educating our youth on the dangerous implications of socialist ideals. We will continue to work with educators to build curriculum to address this important need,” Smith said.
These Are Our Future Leaders
The biggest problem this study reveals, second only to the devastating effects of education that’s focused more on extracurriculars and encouraging self-esteem rather than math, writing and (accurate) history books, is the fact that these young people are on due course to be state and federal politicians, teachers, law enforcement, and business people.
In his 2006 pop hit, “Waiting on the World to Change,” John Mayer (a Generation Xer) crooned, “One day our generation is gonna rule the population / so we keep waiting, waiting on the world to change.” Not only is this generation going to rule the population, but these folks embrace an ideology they think will change the world. It will—but not for the better.
Oddly, an entire generation that embraced “The Hunger Games” (and its anti-socialism themes) with gusto is going ga-ga for an ideology that would have everyone living like Katniss Everdeen’s impoverished District 12. No, socialism and the millennials who love it will bring on the Hunger Games, but in reverse, and the odds are not in anybody’s favor.
Forget waiting on the world to change. It’s time to change it. This starts with teaching millennials the truth about socialism before they rule the population into ruin.

Half of Gen Z supports Marxism/socialism. Here’s why.
Oct 25, 2020 by
Acton Institute
by Rev. Ben Johnson
A new poll reveals the shocking extent of young Americans’ support for communism. However, it also reveals the reasons behind the popularity of collectivism and the seeds of its destruction.
The number of young Americans who have a favorable view of Marxism has increased five-fold in just one year. According to the new survey, nearly one-third of the members of Gen Z – Americans between the ages of 16 and 23 – say “Marxism” deserves our support. The term’s favorability has skyrocketed to 30% of Gen Z respondents, up from 6% in 2019.
Gen Z’s approval of socialism also creeped up nine points since last year (49% favorable in 2020, compared to 40% in 2019).
The results come from the newest edition of the “ Report on U.S. Attitudes Toward Socialism, Communism, and Collectivism ” – which is commissioned annually by the Victims of Communism Memorial (VOC) and conducted by YouGov.
But the latest VOC poll, which was released Wednesday, contains an internal contradiction:
Americans increasingly distrust the government to take care of their interests, with 87% saying they trust themselves over the government and their community (a 7% increase from 2019). This is especially the case in younger generations, with only 6% of Gen Z and 5% of Millennials trusting the government to take care of their interests, down 8% and 11% from 2019, respectively.
How can young Americans distrust the government to take care of their interests and endorse socialism, which entrusts the government with the power to redistribute wealth, direct all economic activity, and control their access to such necessities as healthcare?
The poll’s results highlight two simple answers: ignorance of socialism and a jaundiced view of the United States induced by critical theory.
Americans suffer a two-pronged ignorance of socialism: what it is and what is has done. As Simon van Zuylen-Wood explained in New York magazine last March, “the word [socialism] had lost its meaning by the time it got hot again.” Thus, 31% of VOC respondents say they believe that socialism “[m]eans a free market economy with private property” where “the government provides ample social welfare benefits, as in many Scandinavian and Western European countries.” In reality, Scandinavian countries have tried for years to inform Americans in general (and Bernie Sanders in particular) that they are not socialist, and that democratic socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fundamentally misunderstand the Scandinavian model. They jettisoned policies like the ones AOC proposes after the economic crashes of the 1980s.
Researchers have found public confusion over the socialist economic system grew in tandem with its popularity. Only 20% of registered voters in the U.S. associated socialism with government ownership of some (13%) or all (7%) of the economy in a Hill-HarrisX survey taken last May. One in three said socialism meant the government would “end poverty and provide basic things.” The same is true for Americans as a whole. A Gallup poll from October 2018 found that less than one in five U.S. citizens said socialism means abolishing private property, while 23% said socialism stands for “equality – equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution.”
Americans also have no grasp of Marxism’s bloody past – and present. The VOC finds that 32% of Americans “think that Donald Trump is responsible for the deaths of more people” than North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Twice as many Americans (64%) “say they are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany.”
However, young Americans are aware of one nation’s failings: their own. Gen Z is almost twice as likely to believe “America is a racist nation with a long history of discrimination” (51%) as to say that “America is a leading defender of freedom around the world” (27%). “Only 44% of Gen Z thinks that the American flag most accurately represents freedom,” the poll finds. Hence, Americans are more likely to advocate toppling statues depicting Robert E. Lee (30%) or Christopher Columbus (26%) than Marxist mass murderer Che Guevara (24%). Gen Z even believes U.S. President Trump did more to spread COVID-19 than China’s Xi Jinping.
“It shocks the conscience” that “four-in-ten Americans believe that their country is a ‘racist’ nation,” says VOC Executive Director Marion Smith.
Smith attributes these views to “a total failure of our education system,” as well as the “basic dishonesty in our media and popular culture.”
“When one-in-four Americans want to eliminate capitalism and embrace socialism, we know that we have failed to educate about the historical and moral failings of these ideologies,” Smith says.
Or perhaps the educational establishment has indoctrinated American students too well. Before the Pulitzer-Prize-winning 1619 Project backtracked on its central claim that the introduction of slavery represented America’s “true founding,” public schools had already taught its curriculum to “tens of thousands of students in all 50 states” … at your expense. Academia has long inculcated the neo-Marxist view of America as a patchwork of competing victim groups (racial, sexual, and gender minorities) and oppressors (straight, white, cisgender males). Discrediting the U.S. Constitution, with its checks on mob rule and embrace of a free-market economic system, as “systemically racist” represents the high-water mark of Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci’s long march through history – an effort to form a Marxist consciousness in society.
Identity politics succeeded where Das Kapital fell flat. Americans who see themselves as members of impermeable and warring tribes require the government step in to mediate their differences – and to assure that resources are evenly distributed between groups, according to a viral speech from Claremont Institute President Thomas Klingenstein. But “achieving this proportional representation requires a never-ending redistribution of wealth and power” by the federal government. “Such a massive redistribution can only be achieved by a tyrannical government” where “dissenters are silenced.” Such a government could traditionally be labeled socialist or Marxist.
To succeed, socialists “must get us to believe we are bad.” In reality, “America has brought more freedom and more prosperity to more people than any country in the history of mankind.”  To further that understanding, he has unveiled a petition to declare every election day – when Americans celebrate their right of self-determination – as “America is Good Day.” The petition has been signed by such notable figures as former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, former Sen. Jim DeMint, and Hilldale College President Larry Arnn.
In the Cold War, the struggle against Marxism was geostrategic. Today, it takes place within societies and hearts. Halting socialism’s ascent in the United States demands that we educate young people on socialism’s history of poverty and oppression – and replace the masochism masquerading as history with an appreciation of Western civilization.

RIP America?
A distrurbing poll found that one-third of Millennials view communism favorably.
The same poll found that 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist.
According to a poll commissioned by the Washington, D.C. area nonprofit Victims of Communism, 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist while one in three view communism favorably.
The same poll also reported that 27 percent of people believe President Donald Trump is the biggest threat to world peace. The survey placed the U.S. president over North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom” Tweet This
According to YouGov, 36 percent of millennials say they approve of communism. That percentage is up almost 10 percent from 2018.
While most college students today are not technically “millennials,” since Pew Research identifies members of that generation as those who were between the ages of 23 and 38 in 2019, more than one-third of the millennial generation is college-educated, the most ever for a single generation, according to City Lab.
The majority of students in college today are considered Generation Z, or those who fall between the ages of 7 and 22.

The report also included other jarring statistics, including how 22 percent of millennials believe “society would be better if all private property was abolished.” In addition, 45 percent of Generation Z and millennials agree that “all higher education should be free.”
The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Executive Director Marion Smith describes this shift as the “historical amnesia” about the dangers of communism and socialism. In a statement, Smith said, “When we don’t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn’t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas.”

In 2017, Campus Reform covered a story in which a poll had similar findings: that “more millennials would prefer to live under a socialist regime than a capitalist one, though only about one-third of respondents were able to successfully define the term “socialism.”

Joseph Eklach, University of Florida Turning Point USA vice president, reacted to this poll in a statement to Campus Reform.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom because they take it for granted living in the USA. They’re in a privileged position only first world nations afford that allows them to advocate for equality. Our colleges fail to teach our generation of the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism,” Eklach said.
Campus Reform reached out to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.

Hmm, it seems like the additional search results are similar to the first set, mostly coming from conservative outlets criticizing the lack of education about communism's history and attributing young people's support for communism to ignorance or a lack of awareness about its failures.

I need to find some left-leaning perspectives to get a more balanced view. Maybe I should look for articles or opinions from progressive or leftist sources about why young people are attracted to communism.

Let me try searching again.

Disturbing number of young Americans favor communism

RIP America?
A distrurbing poll found that one-third of Millennials view communism favorably.
The same poll found that 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist.
According to a poll commissioned by the Washington, D.C. area nonprofit Victims of Communism, 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist while one in three view communism favorably.
The same poll also reported that 27 percent of people believe President Donald Trump is the biggest threat to world peace. The survey placed the U.S. president over North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

According to YouGov, 36 percent of millennials say they approve of communism. That percentage is up almost 10 percent from 2018.
While most college students today are not technically “millennials,” since Pew Research identifies members of that generation as those who were between the ages of 23 and 38 in 2019, more than one-third of the millennial generation is college-educated, the most ever for a single generation, according to City Lab.
The majority of students in college today are considered Generation Z, or those who fall between the ages of 7 and 22.

The report also included other jarring statistics, including how 22 percent of millennials believe “society would be better if all private property was abolished.” In addition, 45 percent of Generation Z and millennials agree that “all higher education should be free.”
The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Executive Director Marion Smith describes this shift as the “historical amnesia” about the dangers of communism and socialism. In a statement, Smith said, “When we don’t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn’t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas.”

In 2017, Campus Reform covered a story in which a poll had similar findings: that “more millennials would prefer to live under a socialist regime than a capitalist one, though only about one-third of respondents were able to successfully define the term “socialism.”

Joseph Eklach, University of Florida Turning Point USA vice president, reacted to this poll in a statement to Campus Reform.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom because they take it for granted living in the USA. They’re in a privileged position only first world nations afford that allows them to advocate for equality. Our colleges fail to teach our generation of the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism,” Eklach said.
Campus Reform reached out to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.

Why More Young Americans Are Exploring Communism – The Establishment
Posted on May 31, 2018
Why More Young Americans Are Exploring Communism
Written by
Hint: It has something to do with capitalism’s failures and a so-called ‘Trump bump.’
To put it in blunt but unsurprising terms, the world is in shambles right now. Fascism is on the rise again. Hate crimes are up in the U.S. Water crises loom on the horizon. Wealth inequality has never been higher. Climate change and natural disasters abound. Mass shootings galore. Police brutality and racism. A rising threat of nuclear war.
Amidst this nightmarish backdrop, many people — particularly younger Americans  — are in search of answers, trying to identify a root cause for all of these problems. And one that’s emerging front and center is our entire economic system.
A 2011 Pew Research Center poll found that a slight majority of liberal Democrats held “negative views” of capitalism. In 2016, a Harvard University study revealed that 51% of people between the ages of 18 and 29 “don’t support” capitalism—and only 42% support it.
So if not capitalism, then what?
The study found young people favor socialism, but that’s not the only alternative. There has been an uptick of interest in a 170-year old political system — that dirtiest of C-words.
Communism.
Amidst a nightmarish backdrop, many people — particularly younger Americans — are in search of answers. Communism. Click To Tweet
It’s no secret that the United States doesn’t have the best relationship with communism; “ dirty commie ” is an insult as American as apple pie. Much of this is rooted in the The Red Scare of the 1940s and ’50s, which fueled the Cold War and the wars in Korea and Vietnam, and which had a lasting effect on how people in the U.S. view the political system. Since then, the U.S. government has interfered in multiple countries  — supporting coups and assassinating leaders — in order to weed out communism anywhere it popped up. Or was even perceived to pop up.
For some, communism brings up images of the oppressive reigns of Soviet-era Stalin and China’s Mao, and the widespread murders attributed to their regimes. Communism is sometimes thought of as Big Government coming and taking everything you own.
Critics of communism say it goes against human nature, that it can’t work because people are naturally lazy and/or selfish, that it won’t work if the state gives citizens food and shelter for nothing. Frank Zappa famously said, “communism doesn’t work because people like to own stuff.” Others say it conflicts with people’s desire for freedom by forcing them to submit to the will of big government.
But is that what communism really is?
To understand the goal of communists, it’s necessary to have a nuanced understanding of communism and its relationship to Marxism — that political movement that so many in the so-called “alt-right” are constantly railing against.
A quick overview: Marxism draws from the work of Karl Marx, a German philosopher, historian, and economist from the 1800s. He and Friedrich Engels co-authored The Communist Manifesto of 1848, and since their passing, communists and other Marx/Engels fans have been interpreting and developing upon their ideas. One expert called communism “the endpoint of Marx’s ideas.”
According to Marx, there is conflict between two classes of people. These are the capitalists — people who control the means of production, such as business owners — and the working class, who actually produce all the concrete goods of our society. In its purest form, communism espouses the belief that the means of production should be in the hands of the workers — not the government.
What many people think of as communism is actually closer to socialism, a related system that has many similarities to communism. It is socialism, not communism, that relies on “big government” to get things done. In socialism, the government owns the means of production rather than the people. In a true communist system, government as we know it today would likely not exist.
In its purest form, communism espouses the belief that the means of production should be in the hands of the workers. Click To Tweet
However, it’s important to keep in mind that these are ideas. The theories of socialism and communism are continually being developed and not every communist agrees with the next about how government should look in a communist society. Many value the idea of a true democracy rather than a representative democracy — every person gets an equal vote on every issue in the community. No one person is given power over others. There are no presidents, no governors, no mayors. In this form, communism actually overlaps with anarchist ideas more so than it does with socialist ideas.
In any case, in recent months, communist ideology has seemed to catch on with more Americans. The Communist Party USA  — a national communist organization with 7,000 registered members — has reported a significant spike in interest and membership. According to one article, CPUSA had 5,000 members in April 2017; at that time, the organization’s international secretary said, “There is growing interest in communist ideas.”
Local groups, too, have been invigorated. In my own backyard, the Seattle Communists, a chapter of the Pacific Northwest-based Communist Labor Party, has seen its numbers swell. The organization, which came to life as a spin-off of the Tacoma Communists, had only three dedicated members in the summer of 2016. Now it has 25 to 30 registered members, and a lot more people involved in its community programs (plus more than 800 Facebook followers ). It also has high-profile partnerships, including with 2017 mayoral candidate Nikkita Oliver.
When A Changemaker Runs For Mayor: An Interview With Nikkita Oliver
theestablishment.co
Why the change? Sophia, Seattle Communists’ secretary-treasurer (who doesn’t want her last name used), has no doubt that the increase in membership has to do with the results of the 2016 election. She calls it the “Trump bump” — and the Seattle Communists aren’t the only ones who’ve noticed.
“Public receptivity has gone from, ‘Is this a joke?’ in 2010 to, ‘Why do you hate freedom’ in 2012 to, ‘Yeah fuck Trump’ in 2016,” a representative of the Tacoma Communists told me. “Blessedly, we hear ‘Where do I sign up?’ just as frequently since last summer.”
This trend parallels the increase in membership for far-right groups — the Southern Poverty Law Center estimates that the Klu Klux Klan has anywhere between 5,000 and 8,000 members today. And far-right activity has been featured in the news much more than anything the communists are doing, likely due to the well-documented violent tendencies of fascist and white nationalist organizations. It also helps that they currently have a strong figurehead in Donald Trump, who has been reluctant to condemn them and has employed their people in the White House.
Further, communists believe that fascism happens when capitalism is under threat. As the economic system becomes unstable, white working class people are directed to blame immigrants and people of color and are steered toward white nationalism. Meanwhile, those with class and state power use fascism to defend against the rise of the rest of the working class as their quality of life plummets. In this sense, simultaneous rises in both far right and far left ideas are inevitable under capitalism.
It Wasn’t Just Hate. Fascism Offered Robust Social Welfare.
theestablishment.co
Against the backdrop of rising hate and bias nationally, coupled with Seattle’s rampant income and racial inequality, it’s unsurprising to see communism take flight.
“We don’t want the government to own everything,” Sophia tells me. In fact, she emphasizes, communists are widely against the U.S. government — they view it as an oppressive entity and an enemy of the people.
“What is government but a tool that a class uses to control society?”
What communists really want is for state and economic power to be put back in the hands of the community. For it to be communal. Hence, Commun ism.
To that end, the Seattle Communists — whose slogan is “fight the power, serve the people” — leverage community programs centered on efforts to build social institutions so that people don’t have to rely on the government. Their long-term goal: make it so every part of society is controlled by participatory democracy rather than state power.
The group’s earliest community involvement was in response to the rising rates of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes in Seattle’s Capitol Hill, one they felt the government wasn’t responding to effectively. So the organization revived the “ Q-Patrol ” program, where volunteers are trained in self-defense and de-escalation techniques. The group is also involved in a “serve the people” food delivery program, launched last October to bring free groceries to poor households.
The group’s idea is to actively work to improve the community in order to gain trust, so when participants hear about communism, they won’t immediately dismiss the idea. Sophia repeatedly tells me about “making the leap from protest to action.”
Although there are misconceptions about communism, Sophia believes that the word doesn’t carry the same stigma that it used to. At least in Seattle, she is frequently asked why she uses the word communism because “doesn’t it scare people away?” But only once has anyone told her that they actually object to the term. “Everybody thinks that everybody hates the word and is scared of the word, but in my experience, not a whole lot of people are.”
The real challenge is to prove that their ideas work.
Many of us grew up with the message (some would say propaganda) that communism is impossible, evil, or both. But a new day might be dawning. It’s possible that communists haven’t seen this kind of interest in their ideas since they were so thoroughly persecuted in the 1950s.
I myself have become very interested in alternatives to capitalism in recent months, and although I can’t say for sure if communism is the answer, I also definitely don’t believe it’s evil, as I was taught growing up. I also know there’s a lot more to it than I could possibly get into in one article.
If you’re interested, there’s plenty of reading out there — and you won’t be alone in your exploration.

Why More Young People Favor Socialism and What We Should Do: Mary Eberstadt

A growing number of young people now favor socialism over capitalism. According to author Mary Eberstadt, that’s because these young people have been deliberately miseducated, and they should learn more about the history and truth.
“Partly because they have been deliberately miseducated about their country’s past,” Eberstadt said in an interview with NTD’s “Capitol Report” broadcast Wednesday.
Eberstadt is a Senior Research Fellow at the Faith & Reason Institute. She is an essayist, novelist, and author of several books. She was a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution from 2002–2013 and was a speechwriter for Secretary of State George Schultz between 1985 and 1987.
Eberstadt said that it’s now been generations that a certain kind of anti-Americanism has been dominant, especially on university and college campuses.

“What young people need to understand is that there are deep reasons why they’re being fed that narrative. They are being deprived of the grandeur of their country’s history and its lessons. And the reasons for this are that they are the backbone of a political movement that exploits them, called progressivism ,” Eberstadt said.
She added that Marxism actually has a lot to do with progressivism.
“I can say this with authority because when I was in college, which was decades ago, Marxism was prevalent on all the elite campuses,” said Eberstadt, who graduated from Cornell University in 1983. “And it’s coming back in this sort of softer form that goes by socialism, but it shares a lot of Marxist precepts.”
In June, an Axios/Momentive poll showed that 51 percent of 18–24-year-olds view socialism positively, 54 percent of this age group view capitalism negatively.
Eberstadt said there’s a great need for young people to understand the history of communism and socialism and other truths that their teachers have deprived them of for political reasons.
“It was always said that socialism just hadn’t been tried right. And this was used to excuse failure after failure in every country that attempted to implement a Marxist regime,” Eberstadt continued.
“What students need to know that they are not told, what would make them far less interested in socialism, would be working knowledge of the tragedies that have transpired under plans to re-engineer human beings on a mass scale,” said Eberstadt. “We’re talking about the great famines. We’re talking about other collectivized activities that have ended up imprisoning and murdering people in the name of an abstract, higher Marxist good. And history is littered with these examples, as we know, and letting children and teenagers in on that fact is an important part of the teaching of history tomorrow.”

Besides the history of failure of collectivist experiments, other truths should also be taught in classrooms across the country, said Eberstadt.
“Number two—and this is in no particular order—the grandeur of American history with all of its problems. Number three, the economic vitality and material abundance of the free enterprise countries relative to the collectivist countries. And number four, the way in which socialist regimes, Marxist regimes, communist regimes have suppressed not only religion but the family. [They] have suppressed any other potential contender for people’s loyalties,” Eberstadt continued.
“These are all easily ascertainable facts, and we need leaders to voice them, and we need teachers to impart them.”

We have to look first at how kids emerge into adulthood,
how and why they think as they do and as we did.
Teenagers are to adult thinking as preschoolers are to playing house or super heroes.
Imagining themselves in their future roles.
New adults think in terms of black and white.
That’s the only way parents can teach right and wrong.
There isn’t enough time to teach our kids of the actual grey that is life.
There isn’t enough time to teach that you must always beware that people or groups may appear to be on the white side of things but in reality have a pitch black heart.
❤Socialism is just that. 🖤🖤🖤
Instead of yelling and demanding and pounding at them regarding this evil (I am sooo guilty of that because I’m afraid)
We have discussions about human nature because that is, bottom line, why these things become evil.
School is a kind of socialist microcosm.
Everyone is equal, taught the same, in the same rooms etc.
At lunch, when they mingle their human nature begins to show how this supposed equality can become twisted.

i really agree with the one who wrote this comment:
One thing the writer misses is teaching morality to our children as well as how to think (as opposed to what to think). The thing is, Marxism claims certain things to be good and other things to be evil. But the truth is, Marxism and atheism in general has no moral foundation to declare anything good or evil. Without a transcendent moral law giver, aka God, there is no basis to declare anything good or evil, moral or immoral. In atheism, all we have is differences of opinions.

We have unalienable Rights from God. Without God, we don’t even have Rights. All we have without God is government sanctioned permissions that can be revoked at the whim of government. But our kids, most of whom don’t believe in God, don’t realize that by getting rid of God, they are accepting that we have no Rights. And gosh! What a shocker! All these young people make up rights and then try to deny our true Rights.

They’ve been miseducated to believe that Scandinavian countries are socialist. They are actually democratic republics with capitalist economies and social welfare programs. Just like the U.S. Socialism is what Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, and China practice.

What you are describing is actually the result of a multi-generational indoctrination effort by communists. The Marxist streak started in the universities but those graduates when on to become teachers in our schools and parents. And now, the indoctrination is now even more effective as 51% accept socialism and 54% reject capitalism. Of course we have government corruption and cronyism to blame for putting a stain on capitalism while our media and book writers re-writing history to put Marxism in a glowing light while highlighting all the warts in capitalism.

I’m forever proud of my Father, i was 61 in Cuba, i saw with own eyes how the government closed our small mom n pop business, a mechanic shop with a large junk yard and a small grocery store, by 1966 they came and took everything, pay us lousy money for money, we were lucky to be able to keep the real estate that, to after live
with threat of loosing it to socialist government supporters that never work a day in their lives for it. My father made sure every time I came home repeating what the teacher told us about Capitalism, was erased forever from our minds, He told us constantly what a wonderful country Cuba was. Later we turned a room into a welding room, we made rough iron furniture, sold it in the black market, pay off whistleblowers, and the electric power guy, every time he read our electric meter.
So many privilege’s kids here in America are talking so much chiet, about Marxism, never to mention Fedrick Angels, like is a Hollywood fantasy, I would love to see how they will survive without their parents money?, do they know how to grow food if they have to?, grow live stock to feed them self, I doubted, my adult child born in America, know how to do all of that, also how to shoot a gun, God bless the Proud Boys Cubans from Miami

The truth is, millennials and gen-z have never felt themselves in immediate danger – most don’t remember 9 ⁄ 11, none were alive during the Cold War. They have been given everything and most haven’t had to work for a living, instead, living off of their parents.
Yes – there ARE exceptions to this. I’ve met many great people who have strong work ethics and a strong family structure. But the decline of our culture, the poor education and vetting OF teachers that streams down to students, and a willingness of too many parents to hand their kids over to the government to train – this is what’s causing our national rot.

Amen. It’s disingenuous to demand our liberty, on the one hand, without also being accountable for the responsibilities those rights require.
Depending on one’s age, however some of the damage (eg. US Dept of Education) was inherited from prior generations.
Education is a state right reserved under the constitution. There is no constitutional authority for the Dept of Education to exist at a federal level. In this light, arguing over the curriculum seems an exercise in futility. Much like debating how much property a thief is entitled to.
States need to restore the power over education unto themselves so curriculums May be corrected.

Okay, so I've got some more search results here, but it seems like most of them are still from conservative sources, criticizing the support for communism among young people and attributing it to a lack of education or indoctrination. I need to find some progressive or leftist perspectives to understand why young people might be attracted to communism.

Looking back at the first search results, there was one article from The Independent that had some quotes from a political science professor who offered some insights from a left-leaning perspective. Let me revisit that.

In the fourth document from The Independent, a professor named Lawrence Quill is quoted as saying that younger generations don't appreciate freedom because they take it for granted, and that colleges fail to teach the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism. Another professor, Jodi Dean, suggests that capitalism is failing and that the right-wing in the US labels anything they don't like as "communist," which makes it more acceptable to younger people.

This seems to indicate that some on the left believe that young people are turning to communism because they see capitalism as failing, particularly in addressing issues like economic inequality and the climate crisis. Additionally, there might be a perception that communism offers a more equitable alternative.

I need to find more sources that explore this perspective in depth. Maybe I should look for articles written by young people who support communism or socialism, to understand their viewpoints directly.

Let me try searching for "Why do young people support communism?" with a focus on personal stories or opinions from young adults.

Teachers and parents protest over school closures in Oakland
Neal Adams: Comic book artist Neal Adams dies at age 80
Communism continues to be viewed positively by a significant portion of the U.S. population, especially young people: 28% of Generation Z have a favorable view of communism, 30% view Marxism in the same manner, and only one-third understand the Chinese Communist Party has killed more than Nazism.

The 28% of young Americans who view communism favorably are either ignorant or cold-hearted. Take the Holodomor, for example. Between 1931 and 1934, the Soviet government starved ethnic Ukrainians through a man-made famine in which at least 3.9 million Ukrainians died. Red Famine author Anne Applebaum’s description of the famine is enough to turn your stomach:
“In the first phase the body consumes its stores of glucose. Feelings of extreme hunger set in… In the second phase, which can last several weeks, the body begins to consume its own fats and the organism weakens drastically. In the third phase, the body devours its own proteins, cannibalising tissues and muscles. Eventually the skin becomes thin, the eyes distended, the legs and belly swollen as extreme imbalances lead the body to retain water.”
Besides Joseph Stalin, the list of massacres by Mao Zedong of the People’s Republic of China is extensive. Between the Great Leap Forward, the Chinese Land Reform, and the Cultural Revolution, it’s estimated that anywhere from 50 to 70 million Chinese lost their lives. One survivor of the Cultural Revolution, York College professor Zehao Zhou, recalled: “Two enemies of the state lived under the same roof as me — my sister and my father.” His sister’s crime? Being a schoolteacher. His father’s? Serving with Americans during World War II. When Zehao’s father died from years of assaults by the Red Guard, a paramilitary movement, Zehao was not even allowed to mourn him as he was an “enemy of the state.”
And while the current Cuban regime has been nowhere near as bloody, its strict authoritarianism has led to thousands of Cubans protesting in the streets for the end of communist rule.
Has the United States failed at educating its youth of these horrors?
For Americans who weren’t alive under the Cuban Missile Crisis or the fall of the Berlin Wall, communism is just an economic system, not a political one. But rebellious youth challenging the anti-communism status quo is not the only explanation for these pro-communism views. Modern politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, should be criticized.
Republican rhetoric has softened communism by associating socialism with communism, making redistributive political systems more appealing to young people disillusioned with American inequality. And influential Democrats such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, who liken democratic-socialist countries to nirvana, certainly do not help to promote capitalism as the best economic system. Statements from organizations such as Black Lives Matter, in which they blame the U.S. embargo as the cause of Cuba’s recent protests, all while praising the Cuban regime, also push pro-communism sentiments. Thankfully, some states are recognizing the issue.
Last month, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill that would require first-hand accounts from victims of totalitarian dictatorships to be included in the K-12 civics curriculum. In the same week, the Arizona Legislature passed a similar bill in which schools will teach a comparative discussion of political ideologies, including communism. Other states should be taking note.
While Cubans protest the devastating communist regime, some Americans continue to revere communism, all while they live in a free, prosperous society. This reverence is inconceivable. Communism isn’t something that “only works in theory.” It is a murderous ideology that’s failed every time it’s been practiced. The evidence? A basic understanding of history.

RIP America?
A distrurbing poll found that one-third of Millennials view communism favorably.
The same poll found that 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist.
According to a poll commissioned by the Washington, D.C. area nonprofit Victims of Communism, 70 percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote for a socialist while one in three view communism favorably.
The same poll also reported that 27 percent of people believe President Donald Trump is the biggest threat to world peace. The survey placed the U.S. president over North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom” Tweet This
According to YouGov, 36 percent of millennials say they approve of communism. That percentage is up almost 10 percent from 2018.
While most college students today are not technically “millennials,” since Pew Research identifies members of that generation as those who were between the ages of 23 and 38 in 2019, more than one-third of the millennial generation is college-educated, the most ever for a single generation, according to City Lab.
The majority of students in college today are considered Generation Z, or those who fall between the ages of 7 and 22.

The report also included other jarring statistics, including how 22 percent of millennials believe “society would be better if all private property was abolished.” In addition, 45 percent of Generation Z and millennials agree that “all higher education should be free.”
The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Executive Director Marion Smith describes this shift as the “historical amnesia” about the dangers of communism and socialism. In a statement, Smith said, “When we don’t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn’t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas.”

In 2017, Campus Reform covered a story in which a poll had similar findings: that “more millennials would prefer to live under a socialist regime than a capitalist one, though only about one-third of respondents were able to successfully define the term “socialism.”

Joseph Eklach, University of Florida Turning Point USA vice president, reacted to this poll in a statement to Campus Reform.
“Our generation doesn’t appreciate freedom because they take it for granted living in the USA. They’re in a privileged position only first world nations afford that allows them to advocate for equality. Our colleges fail to teach our generation of the failures of socialism and the successes of capitalism,” Eklach said.
Campus Reform reached out to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.

Survey Finds High Support For Communism Among Millennials

History repeats itself, first as tragedy, the second as farce. — Karl Marx
If anyone needed new evidence that millennials have been deprived of a basic education, a new survey provides it with findings about their high acceptance rates of mass-murder-enabling ideologies such as socialism and communism.
Today, the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) released a unique “Annual Report on U.S. Attitudes towards Socialism,” gauging Americans’ attitudes toward socialism, communism, and related ideas. Data firm YouGov conducted the polling, which informed much of the report. We’ve known millennials had a thing for Bernie Sanders’ brand of socialism for a while, but these numbers show a generation sadly misinformed about the historical and present realities of life under communism and socialism.
“An emerging generation of Americans have little understanding of the collectivist system and its dark history,” said Marion Smith, VOC’s executive director. “Unfortunately, this report, which we intend to release on an annual basis, confirms this worrisome impression.”
Youth Is Wasted on the Young
For decades, especially during the Cold War, Americans have broadly held a negative view of communism and socialism, and needed little prodding to speak against such ideologies. But that has changed. The millennial generation, born in 1982 and the two decades following, have sharply different views of communism and socialism than older Americans.
According to the study, just over half of millennials (55 percent) believe communism was and still is a problem, compared with 80 percent of Baby Boomers and 91 percent of elderly Americans. Only 37 percent of millennials have a “very unfavorable” view of communism, while 57 percent of the rest of Americans do. A surprising 64 percent of Americans agreed with the classic Karl Marx statement that underpins Marxist philosophy: “From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.
Before Sanders’ presidential campaign, I would have been shocked to learn nearly half of millennials (45 percent) say they would vote for a socialist. It all sounds so fair, so progressive, so hipster. It correlates with millennials’ absurd unemployment rate: 12.8 percent, double the national unemployment rate. And so more than half believe America’s economic system works against them and four in 10 call for a “complete change” of America’s economic system to ensure highest earners pay their “fair share.”
It’s clear millennials are uninformed about basic economics and global affairs. Socialists’ demands for the most productive citizens to pay for the bulk of Venezuelan taxes and other socialist measures has directly led to starving citizens waiting in bread lines to eat, looting stores, and killing each other in street brawls that include trampling children to death. History and current affairs provides more than enough evidence that the pleasant-sounding mantras of socialism and communism lead directly to death chambers, starvation, and mass graves. These are realities everyone, millennials included, need for the world’s sake to know.
I Like Karl Marx and I Cannot Lie
Of course, all these beliefs that 18- to 30-somethings hold didn’t come from nowhere. They stem from spending the first quarter of their lives in a public education system that would rather teach self-esteem than history. Many history courses have discarded or greatly paraphrased how and why the Soviet Union collapsed and the stark differences between living under a free enterprise system and say, surviving during the Cold War, when socialism peaked and the contrast looked black and white.
It’s the only way to explain why 1 in 4 Americans (26 percent) and one third of millennials (32 percent) falsely believe more people were killed under George W. Bush than under Joseph Stalin. Despite embracing ideologies communist leaders represent, however, many millennials are unfamiliar with communist leaders: 42 percent recognized Mao Zedong, 40 percent Che Guevara; 18 percent Joseph Stalin; 33 percent Vladimir Lenin; and 18 percent Vladimir Putin 18.
Of those who are familiar with Lenin, 25 percent view him favorably. Instead of being responsible for founding a totalitarian dictatorship, murdering countless millions, and, oh, I don’t know, massive human rights abuses, they think he’s just a champion of the working class, like good ole’ Bernie.
If education is the bedrock of society, consider it crumbling. When schools replace God and history facts with safe places and self-esteem, it produces a generation of adults with little historical perspective and general ignorance of the world.
“This report clearly reveals a need for educating our youth on the dangerous implications of socialist ideals. We will continue to work with educators to build curriculum to address this important need,” Smith said.
These Are Our Future Leaders
The biggest problem this study reveals, second only to the devastating effects of education that’s focused more on extracurriculars and encouraging self-esteem rather than math, writing and (accurate) history books, is the fact that these young people are on due course to be state and federal politicians, teachers, law enforcement, and business people.
In his 2006 pop hit, “Waiting on the World to Change,” John Mayer (a Generation Xer) crooned, “One day our generation is gonna rule the population / so we keep waiting, waiting on the world to change.” Not only is this generation going to rule the population, but these folks embrace an ideology they think will change the world. It will—but not for the better.
Oddly, an entire generation that embraced “The Hunger Games” (and its anti-socialism themes) with gusto is going ga-ga for an ideology that would have everyone living like Katniss Everdeen’s impoverished District 12. No, socialism and the millennials who love it will bring on the Hunger Games, but in reverse, and the odds are not in anybody’s favor.
Forget waiting on the world to change. It’s time to change it. This starts with teaching millennials the truth about socialism before they rule the population into ruin.

Half of Gen Z supports Marxism/socialism. Here’s why.
Oct 25, 2020 by
Acton Institute
by Rev. Ben Johnson
A new poll reveals the shocking extent of young Americans’ support for communism. However, it also reveals the reasons behind the popularity of collectivism and the seeds of its destruction.
The number of young Americans who have a favorable view of Marxism has increased five-fold in just one year. According to the new survey, nearly one-third of the members of Gen Z – Americans between the ages of 16 and 23 – say “Marxism” deserves our support. The term’s favorability has skyrocketed to 30% of Gen Z respondents, up from 6% in 2019.
Gen Z’s approval of socialism also creeped up nine points since last year (49% favorable in 2020, compared to 40% in 2019).
The results come from the newest edition of the “ Report on U.S. Attitudes Toward Socialism, Communism, and Collectivism ” – which is commissioned annually by the Victims of Communism Memorial (VOC) and conducted by YouGov.
But the latest VOC poll, which was released Wednesday, contains an internal contradiction:
Americans increasingly distrust the government to take care of their interests, with 87% saying they trust themselves over the government and their community (a 7% increase from 2019). This is especially the case in younger generations, with only 6% of Gen Z and 5% of Millennials trusting the government to take care of their interests, down 8% and 11% from 2019, respectively.
How can young Americans distrust the government to take care of their interests and endorse socialism, which entrusts the government with the power to redistribute wealth, direct all economic activity, and control their access to such necessities as healthcare?
The poll’s results highlight two simple answers: ignorance of socialism and a jaundiced view of the United States induced by critical theory.
Americans suffer a two-pronged ignorance of socialism: what it is and what is has done. As Simon van Zuylen-Wood explained in New York magazine last March, “the word [socialism] had lost its meaning by the time it got hot again.” Thus, 31% of VOC respondents say they believe that socialism “[m]eans a free market economy with private property” where “the government provides ample social welfare benefits, as in many Scandinavian and Western European countries.” In reality, Scandinavian countries have tried for years to inform Americans in general (and Bernie Sanders in particular) that they are not socialist, and that democratic socialists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fundamentally misunderstand the Scandinavian model. They jettisoned policies like the ones AOC proposes after the economic crashes of the 1980s.
Researchers have found public confusion over the socialist economic system grew in tandem with its popularity. Only 20% of registered voters in the U.S. associated socialism with government ownership of some (13%) or all (7%) of the economy in a Hill-HarrisX survey taken last May. One in three said socialism meant the government would “end poverty and provide basic things.” The same is true for Americans as a whole. A Gallup poll from October 2018 found that less than one in five U.S. citizens said socialism means abolishing private property, while 23% said socialism stands for “equality – equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution.”
Americans also have no grasp of Marxism’s bloody past – and present. The VOC finds that 32% of Americans “think that Donald Trump is responsible for the deaths of more people” than North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Twice as many Americans (64%) “say they are unaware that the Chinese Communist Party is responsible for more deaths than Nazi Germany.”
However, young Americans are aware of one nation’s failings: their own. Gen Z is almost twice as likely to believe “America is a racist nation with a long history of discrimination” (51%) as to say that “America is a leading defender of freedom around the world” (27%). “Only 44% of Gen Z thinks that the American flag most accurately represents freedom,” the poll finds. Hence, Americans are more likely to advocate toppling statues depicting Robert E. Lee (30%) or Christopher Columbus (26%) than Marxist mass murderer Che Guevara (24%). Gen Z even believes U.S. President Trump did more to spread COVID-19 than China’s Xi Jinping.
“It shocks the conscience” that “four-in-ten Americans believe that their country is a ‘racist’ nation,” says VOC Executive Director Marion Smith.
Smith attributes these views to “a total failure of our education system,” as well as the “basic dishonesty in our media and popular culture.”
“When one-in-four Americans want to eliminate capitalism and embrace socialism, we know that we have failed to educate about the historical and moral failings of these ideologies,” Smith says.
Or perhaps the educational establishment has indoctrinated American students too well. Before the Pulitzer-Prize-winning 1619 Project backtracked on its central claim that the introduction of slavery represented America’s “true founding,” public schools had already taught its curriculum to “tens of thousands of students in all 50 states” … at your expense. Academia has long inculcated the neo-Marxist view of America as a patchwork of competing victim groups (racial, sexual, and gender minorities) and oppressors (straight, white, cisgender males). Discrediting the U.S. Constitution, with its checks on mob rule and embrace of a free-market economic system, as “systemically racist” represents the high-water mark of Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci’s long march through history – an effort to form a Marxist consciousness in society.
Identity politics succeeded where Das Kapital fell flat. Americans who see themselves as members of impermeable and warring tribes require the government step in to mediate their differences – and to assure that resources are evenly distributed between groups, according to a viral speech from Claremont Institute President Thomas Klingenstein. But “achieving this proportional representation requires a never-ending redistribution of wealth and power” by the federal government. “Such a massive redistribution can only be achieved by a tyrannical government” where “dissenters are silenced.” Such a government could traditionally be labeled socialist or Marxist.
To succeed, socialists “must get us to believe we are bad.” In reality, “America has brought more freedom and more prosperity to more people than any country in the history of mankind.”  To further that understanding, he has unveiled a petition to declare every election day – when Americans celebrate their right of self-determination – as “America is Good Day.” The petition has been signed by such notable figures as former Secretary of Education William J. Bennett, former Sen. Jim DeMint, and Hilldale College President Larry Arnn.
In the Cold War, the struggle against Marxism was geostrategic. Today, it takes place within societies and hearts. Halting socialism’s ascent in the United States demands that we educate young people on socialism’s history of poverty and oppression – and replace the masochism masquerading as history with an appreciation of Western civilization.

Hmm, it seems like I'm hitting a wall here. All the search results I'm getting are from conservative sources criticizing young people's support for communism and attributing it to a lack of
