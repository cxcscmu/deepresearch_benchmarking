I'm trying to understand why practical astronomy was so highly cultivated in the Arab world. I don't know much about this topic, so I need to do some research. Maybe it had something to do with navigation, or religion, or something else altogether. I should look into the historical context of the Arab world during the time when astronomy flourished there.

First, I need to know when this period was. I think it was during the Islamic Golden Age, which I believe was roughly from the 8th to the 14th century. During this time, the Islamic world was a center of scholarship and learning, and made significant contributions to many fields, including astronomy.

But why astronomy in particular? Was it because of its importance in Islam? I know that Islam has specific requirements for prayer, and determining the direction of Mecca and the times of prayer. Maybe astronomy was crucial for these purposes. Also, the Islamic calendar is lunar, so tracking the moon would be important for religious observances.

Let me think about that. If astronomy was important for religious practices, that would certainly motivate scholars to study it. But I also recall that astronomy was used for navigation, especially for sea voyages. The Arab world was known for its maritime trade, so perhaps astronomy was essential for navigation.

Moreover, astrology was also closely linked with astronomy in ancient and medieval times. Maybe the Arab scholars were interested in astrology for predicting events and understanding the heavens.

I should also consider the influence of earlier civilizations. The Greeks, for example, made significant advances in astronomy, and their works were translated into Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. Perhaps the Arab scholars built upon Greek knowledge and further developed astronomical techniques.

Additionally, the Arab world was a hub for trade and cultural exchange between the East and the West. This could have facilitated the transmission of astronomical knowledge from different cultures, allowing Arab astronomers to synthesize and improve upon existing ideas.

I should look for specific examples of Arab astronomers and their contributions. For instance, I've heard of Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Biruni, but I'm not sure about their specific achievements in astronomy.

Wait, there's also Al-Tusi and Al-Battani. I think Al-Battani made accurate measurements of the stars and planets, and his work was influential in Europe during the Renaissance.

Also, the development of astronomical instruments like the astrolabe was important. I know that astrolabes were used in the Arab world for both astronomical observations and导航。

Maybe I should look into the role of astronomy in Islamic education during that period. If astronomy was part of the standard curriculum in madrasas or other institutions of learning, that would explain why it was highly cultivated.

Furthermore, patronage by rulers and caliphs probably played a significant role. If wealthy and powerful individuals supported astronomical research, that would have encouraged scholars to pursue it.

For example, I think Caliph Al-Mamun founded the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which was a center for translation and scholarship, including astronomy.

Also, the establishment of observatories, like the Maragheh Observatory in Persia, would have provided resources and infrastructure for astronomical research.

I should consider the practical applications of astronomy beyond religion and navigation. For instance, agriculture might have benefited from astronomical knowledge, such as understanding seasons and planting cycles.

Moreover, astronomy was likely connected to mathematics, another field in which Arab scholars made significant contributions. Advances in mathematics would have aided in astronomical calculations.

I should also think about the cultural and intellectual climate of the Arab world during that time. There seemed to be a thirst for knowledge and a willingness to build upon the legacies of previous civilizations, such as the Greeks, Persians, Indians, and others.

Perhaps the Arab scholars saw astronomy as a way to understand the divine order of the universe, which aligns with Islamic principles of seeking knowledge and appreciating the creations of God.

I should look for quotes or statements from Arab astronomers of that era to see what motivated them. Maybe they wrote about the importance of astronomy in their works.

Alternatively, maybe there were philosophical or scientific movements within Islam that emphasized the study of nature and the cosmos, which would have included astronomy.

I should also consider the role of astrology in society. If astrology was widely accepted and valued, that could have driven interest in astronomy as the basis for astrological predictions.

However, I should be careful not to conflate astronomy and astrology, as they are related but distinct fields. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, while astrology is the belief that the positions and movements of celestial bodies affect human affairs.

In any case, both fields were interconnected in medieval thought, so the study of astronomy may have been driven in part by interest in astrology.

Another factor could be the need for accurate timekeeping. In addition to prayer times, mosques needed to call worshippers at specific times, and astronomy provided the means to determine precise timings.

Furthermore, the Arab world was expanding during this period, with conquests and trade reaching across continents. This expansion would have required better geographical and astronomical knowledge for navigation and administration.

I should also consider the influence of Indian and Persian astronomical traditions on the Arab world. There was certainly exchange of knowledge between these cultures, and Arab scholars translated Indian and Persian texts on astronomy.

For example, the sine function in trigonometry was introduced to Europe via Arab mathematics, which had roots in Indian astronomy.

So, it seems that a combination of religious, practical, cultural, and intellectual factors contributed to the cultivation of practical astronomy in the Arab world.

To summarize:

1. Religious requirements: determining prayer times, qibla direction, and the lunar calendar.

2. Navigation: for maritime trade and exploration.

3. Astrology: for understanding and predicting events.

4. Patronage: support from rulers and caliphs for scholarly pursuits.

5. Cultural exchange: building upon the astronomical knowledge of earlier civilizations like the Greeks, Indians, and Persians.

6. Practical applications: agriculture, timekeeping, and administration.

7. Intellectual curiosity: pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural world aligned with Islamic principles.

I think this covers the main reasons why practical astronomy flourished in the Arab world.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{A combination of religious requirements, navigation needs, astrological interests, patronage by rulers, cultural exchange, practical applications, and intellectual curiosity drove the cultivation of practical astronomy in the Arab world.}}\]
