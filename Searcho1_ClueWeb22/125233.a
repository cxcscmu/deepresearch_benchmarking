I'm trying to figure out how successful the U.S. military has been at learning from history since 1945. That's a big question, and I'm not an expert in military history, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what it means for the military to "learn from history." I think it means that they study past conflicts, strategies, and mistakes to improve their approaches in current and future operations. So, effectiveness in learning from history would likely result in better decision-making, more successful missions, and perhaps fewer repeats of past errors.

Since 1945, the United States has been involved in many conflicts, including the Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, Iraq War, and the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the Middle East. Each of these conflicts presents different scenarios and challenges, so it might be useful to look at specific examples to see if there's evidence of learning from history.

Let me start by considering the Vietnam War. I know that the U.S. military's experience in Vietnam was complex and controversial. There are arguments that the military didn't effectively learn from its experiences there, especially in terms of counterinsurgency tactics and understanding the political context of the war. Some say that mistakes made in Vietnam were repeated in later conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan.

Wait, but I also recall that after Vietnam, there was a significant transformation in the U.S. military, often referred to as the "Vietnam Syndrome." This led to changes in doctrine, training, and equipment. For instance, the Army developed new counterinsurgency strategies and placed greater emphasis on technological superiority. So, maybe there was some learning happening there.

Perhaps I should look into specific instances where the military has acknowledged historical lessons and adapted accordingly. Maybe there are reports or studies that evaluate the military's approach to historical learning.

I think it would be helpful to search for scholarly articles or books on this topic. There are probably historians and military analysts who have studied this issue in depth.

The United States’ (US) involvement in the Vietnam War has gained notoriety within the nation’s collective memory, and rightly so. Spanning twenty years and costing the lives of 58,220 Americans (US National Archives, 2018), its legacy is “protracted, costly and divisive” (Zhang, 2018, p. 244). Whilst there is still debate surrounding US involvement in Vietnam, we argue there is a consensus on the need for lessons to be learnt from its involvement. However, it is apparent that despite its legacy, successive administrations have failed to do so. This is evidenced by a string of arguably unnecessary international interventions, conducted via questionable motives and means representing a repetition of operational and non-operational factors that undermined US policy in Vietnam.
The question above posits, a number of assumptions that require discussion and clarification. Firstly, the manner in which the question is written implies that questionable decisions were made. As such, this paper will adopt the assumption that mistakes were made that therefore provide learning experiences. Following this, the second clarification to consider is whether the US can and should learn lessons from Vietnam. Whilst debatable, we believe that possession of historical knowledge is a practical instrument of action, and “a power that guides the… future” (Acton, 1895, p. 3). It is clear to us, that not only can Vietnam serve as an “undisputed learning experience” (Fromkin & Chace, 1985, p. 723), but the government should take heed of these lessons so they stand as a warning to future administrations.
Vietnam has benefited from extensive writing from a range of disciplines. Fromkin and Chace (1985) focus upon the ability and potential benefit of learning lessons from historical experiences, like Vietnam. In their work, they credit the value of historical experience and the practical lessons that can be drawn from them, however, concluding that a lack of consensus upon Vietnam in general, prevents any lessons being learned from the conflict (Fromkin & Chace, 1985, p. 746). The majority of writing on Vietnam and how it links into current US foreign policy focuses on factors that are more operational in character. Wright’s writing (2017) demonstrates clear examples of operational lessons from Vietnam that can be mapped onto the US’s current operations in Afghanistan. Interestingly, he is disparaging of the idea that historical experiences provide opportunities for learning and is thus wary of placing any such value upon them (Wright, 2017). What is clear from the existing literature is not only the significance of Vietnam’s legacy but also initial attempts to demonstrate how current attitudes towards foreign policy have been shaped, operationally, by its legacy. Yet, what appears to be absent, is a direct analysis of both operational and non-operational factors that undermined US action in Vietnam and a demonstration that these same factors have reoccurred throughout successive foreign policy action frequently to the detriment of longer-term success. Therefore, this paper will argue that not only has the US not learnt from the operational and non-operational mistakes made in Vietnam, but its failure to do so has proved detrimental to recent international interventions.
Perhaps the most observable lesson the US failed to learn from Vietnam is the necessity for the right motivations to intervene in a conflict, as well as the necessity of a structured strategy and clear goals. US reasoning for intervening in Vietnam was clear, yet this does not detract from the inherent lack of sustainability in the perceived motives for doing so. Under the doctrine of containment, the goal was to prevent the spread of communism by preventing the fall of the guardian to Central Asia, South Vietnam ( a policy enshrined in ‘domino theory’) (Powers, 1969, p. 855). The US’s obsession with this doctrine and its stalwart determination to prevent the spread of this evil ideology led the Americans “deeper and deeper into tragedy” (O’Malley, n.d.) in Southeast Asia. Yet, what the US fails to comprehend is the reality that you cannot defeat an ideology with bombs and bullets (Robertson, 2015). Ideologies are a normative collection of ideas and ideals and, given their metaphysical nature, cannot be defeated by more traditional methods the US employs combatting its enemies, thus serving as an unsustainable and ambiguous justification for war. It appears US administrations of the last two decades are yet to appreciate this reality given the continued, and frivolous, use of ‘defeating Islamist extremism’ as rationalisation for its multiple wars on terror in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria (Lieven, 2018, p. 388). Trump’s proclamation across Twitter that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria” (Trump, 2018), only demonstrates further a false exaggeration of the US’s abilities to defeat an ideology and a total lack of appreciation for the lessons Vietnam could and should have taught them.
Similarly, the attempted methods employed to combat ‘ideological enemies’, particularly via ‘nation-building’ deployed in Vietnam, and now in Afghanistan, shows a failure to learn from its experiences. Whilst such efforts are commendable, the US’s efforts to help restructure in Vietnam via the ‘Office of Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support’ failed to deliver “any effective nation-building” (Gawthorpe, 2014). Whilst the reasons for this are debatable, it should clearly serve as an appropriate caution for future administrations planning on utilising such methods. Yet when we examine the US’s now the longest war in Afghanistan, we see them again embarking on a futile mission to foster democracy and create a “functioning state” (Bandow, 2017) within Central Asia using a military force that is inherently incapable of creating a political culture or society. The ironic consequence of these attempts at nation-building is that, rather than helping discredit these fanatical ideologies, it abets the emergence of groups such as the Islamic State (Siddiqui, 2017) that simply drew the US back into the region in future conflicts. Clearly, the US has failed to learn from its own experiences, given its insistence on embarking on “morally ambiguous” (Herring, 2019) experiments in nation-building that only demonstrate the limited utility of American military power in conflicts that are political and ideological in nature.
A consequence of these previous two factors and a failure to learn from previous lessons is the frequency with which the US is drawn into unsustainable drawn-out conflicts following Vietnam. Certainly, one of the glaring oversights of America’s foreign policy in Vietnam was the lack of clarity in their strategy. Christened “the stalemate machine” (Menand, 2018), their flawed military and political strategy for the region not only cost the US any chance of success, but made what was perceived as an easily-winnable conflict into an operational quagmire. In Operation Desert Storm we see the same lack of long-term strategic thinking, a clear indictment of the fact that again lessons were not learnt. This failure is evident from the decision to end intervention unilaterally before Saddam had been chastened, condemning the US to a long-term, unavoidable presence in the Gulf to contain Iraq (Mahnken, 2011). The same is true in Afghanistan, where despite the end of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2014, 13,000 US troops still remain, continuing the ‘endless war’ which Trump repeatedly pledged to end (George, 2019). Likewise, in Syria, the lack of a succinct strategy has led to internal confusion and a struggle by even government officials to explain what US foreign policy is within the region (Borger, 2019). Ultimately, the use of containment as a doctrine for military intervention combined with ineffective and unsustainable strategies demonstrate a failure to learn from experiences in Southeast Asia, leading to successive foreign policy engagements that are little more than a Vietnam redux.
Clearly, the need to learn operational lessons from Vietnam is self-evident. What is perhaps less obvious are the non-operational lessons the US’s involvement has to offer. The most significant of these is the importance of maintaining high levels of public support for US international intervention. This was something that the US failed to achieve during the Vietnam conflict, demonstrable through the sizeable number of anti-war protests that occurred. Their effect undisguisable: dividing the American electorate to levels unseen since the Civil War (Herring, 2019, p. 104). Jump to 2003, and we see the same with protests against the unjust US intervention in Iraq, the discontent that only continued to magnify as the war continued and “American bodies piled up” (Siddiqui, 2017). The level of public frustration with the war is evident in the 10% decline in popular support for Bush Jnr one year after the 2003 invasion (Eichenberg, et al., 2006, p. 784), clearly demonstrating that the war was costing him. It would be easy to associate this public restlessness with the mere existence of US participation in the war. However, the absence of such a reaction during periods of previous conflicts (the Gulf War for example) indicates alternative factors specific to Vietnam and Iraq that triggered such a response. We have identified two indicators that not only explain the public reaction but clearly demonstrate a lack of learning on the government’s part. First, the justification for going to war, which for both Vietnam and Iraq was deemed not only illegal (Cox, 2003) but irrelevant to US interests, which is made clearer given our conclusions about using containment as validation for intervention. Second, is the government-orchestrated deceit surrounding both the motives and management of both conflicts. The leaking of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam conflict, and the revelation that Bush Jnr lied about the existence of WMDs in Iraq demonstrate why such discontent existed surrounding both conflicts. The fact that Bush’s administration failed to learn from Nixon’s handling of the situation in the 1960s, reveals another lesson not learned. Deceiving the electorate and showing a lack of appreciation for the significance of domestic support only serves to undermine an administrations’ standing and decrease backing for intervention. This is visible when we examine the reaction to the news, in January 2005, that there were no WMDs in Iraq (Bryan & Hopper, 2005) sending Bush’s approval ratings to an all-time low of 34% (compared to 87% in 2001) (Newport & Carroll, 2006). Whilst the disastrous approval ratings did not hinder Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign, his legacy of leaving America in a seemingly never-ending War Against Terror exhibits the value of maintaining public support, a lesson the Bush administration could and should have learnt from Vietnam.
The US’s determination to uphold its political standing on the international stage regardless of the commitments it draws them into, is the final lesson, in the context of this paper, that they have yet to learn. Predicated upon their innate belief in American exceptionality, and the unique mission they perceive to possess, the US appears to harbour an obsession with the credibility that not only drew them into Vietnam but affirmed their decisions to intervene in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. This steadfast certainty in their unequivocal strength has created within multiple US administrations an inherent belief that there are no “limits to…American power” (Zhang, 2018, p. 244). Yet the disastrous consequences of intervention in Vietnam severely challenged this traditional American belief and the conviction that nothing was unattainable. Despite this, America is still explicitly subscribed to the idea that they are ‘the world’s policeman’ (Trump, 2019). Explicit evidence of the very fact that they have yet to learn the lesson from Vietnam that an obsession with the unnecessary intervention will lead to nothing less than an inexorable commitment to long-term engagements resulting in a constant drain on “manpower, resources and international prestige” (Lieven, 2018, p. 388).
As this paper has attempted to demonstrate, it is clear that America still has a lot to learn from the conflict in Southeast Asia. A naïve commitment to a disproved doctrine of containment, an ignorant lack of appreciation for the value of public support and blind faith in their own exceptionality clearly reveals that the ghost of Vietnam is still omnipresent. Its lessons are something successive US administrations are still yet to appreciate given their insistence in maintaining ill-fated and unsustainable foreign policy ventures. Thus, until America welcomes the lessons Vietnam has to offer, they will be condemned to repeat them, which will only prove more damaging as the years continue.

T his quote is the basis for why military history continues to be studied at all levels of the Army. Recognizing and analyzing events, tactics, successes and failures contributes to developing a better fighting force, weapons and equipment. Over time, historians have studied famous, and not-so-famous, battles the United States has fought as well as those of our enemies.
We have learned from all of the men and women who have gone before us from the fight for liberty in our own backyard to the desert sands of the Middle East. Similarly, in the past ten years we have continued to develop combat techniques designed to address the asymmetric operating environment, urban sprawl, and jagged mountain terrain of Afghanistan and Iraq. Demonstrating we can learn from recent history, the first Army & Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual was published in 2006 while simultaneously fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now, six years later, as we maintain a large presence in Southwest Asia and other regions, the first revision of this same manual as well as all of our doctrinal references are under revision.
Our documented history has also captured events in the Army’s past that could have been easily overlooked. All of which were events that had a significant impact on both our Army and our nation. Until President Truman signed Executive Order 9981 in 1946, segregation was openly practiced in the military. The US Army Air Corps’ Tuskegee Airmen, the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion and the 6888th Postal Unit are all well-known African-American units from World War II. Over time there were other smaller ethnic groups such as Asian-Americans (Philippine Scouts) and Native Americans (Navaho Code Talkers) who also proudly served our nation. Up to 1942, women were not allowed to serve in the military but with the establishment of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps that quickly changed. In 1943, the WAAC were re-designated as the Women’s Army Corps and during World War II over 150,000 women served on both fronts. Later they would serve in Korea and Vietnam until the WAC was deactivated in 1978 and women were fully assimilated into the US Army. Why are these seemingly minor references to our history mentioned, because they had a significant impact on both our Army and our nation’s culture and climate?
Soldiers assigned to the 3d U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) and The U.S. Army Band “Pershing’s Own”, participate in a Twilight Tattoo performance, on Summerall Field, Joint Base Myer Henderson-Hall, Va., May 9, 2019. The performance was hosted by Lt. Gen. Nadja Y. West, the 44th Surgeon General of the United States Army and commanding general, U.S. Army Medical Command. Twilight Tattoo is an hour-long pageant, which showcases the history of the U.S. Army. (U.S. Army photos by Sgt. Nicholas T. Holmes)
Equally as important as our Army history but on a completely different level, smaller units possess their own histories known as a lineage. The lineage and honors of a unit include its origin, battles, awards, distinctive unit patches and insignias. The latter two articles mentioned are known as heraldic items. Army history books and websites always include a description of a unit’s heraldic items “as they reflect the history, tradition, ideals, mission, and accomplishments.” These practices stem from the Middle Ages where color and symbols reflected the heraldry, often family lineage associated with a particular unit. Generally speaking, it helped determine friend from foe. Today the U.S. Army maintains The Institute of Heraldry (TIOH) that supports the offices of the presidency, the Department of Defense and other federal agencies with its coats of arms, official seals, flags and streamers. These items possess significant value as they help to form an organization’s identity which is foundational to the larger culture and climate.
Army uniforms also have a linkage to our organizational history and tradition. A Soldier’s uniform represents many facets of Army history from the shoulder insignias, rank insignias, distinctive unit crests and special branch items such as the infantry blue cord. Many wonder why the light blue trousers of the Army Service Uniform are a different shade of blue than that of the jacket. The difference recognizes the history of Army life out west on the Great Plains during the latter part of the 19th century. The trousers faded because Soldiers packed away their coats while riding their horse or working in the hot sun. Another uniform item often misunderstood is that of the first sergeant’s rank. Few first sergeants know that the geometric shape in the center of their rank insignia is a pierced lozenge centered between chevrons and arcs; not a diamond, stripes and rockers as they are traditionally referred to. Another example is that many like to say enlisted Soldiers wear their rank on their sleeves because they do the “heavy lifting” while officers wear their rank on their shoulders because that is where they bear the responsibility of their position.

Traditions often go unseen but reside just about everywhere in our daily activities. We honor our fallen warriors in many ways; we say our farewells during unit memorial ceremonies where the fallen are represented by their helmet, boots, ID tags and rifle, they are buried in traditional military fashion with the U.S. flag after being folded and presented according to our tradition and history. There are also symbols such as the playing of “Taps”, firing details, expended rounds/casings placed inside of the flag, and often in many circumstances, full military honors provided at such places as Arlington National Cemetery led by members of the 3rd Infantry Regiment’s “Old Guard” with their horses and caisson. Accompanying this effort are the “Arlington Ladies”, an organization created in 1973, designed so that no Soldier would ever be buried alone. Another less traditional and lasting memory are when Soldiers get tattoos in order to personally honor and remember their fallen brothers and sisters. And finally, organizations never let the memory of their fallen slip away as they pay tribute to them by formally acknowledging their sacrifice at military banquets and balls with the “fallen comrade table”, toast and moment of silence.
One of our newer and very popular traditions is that of the “challenge coin”. Originating in the mid-1980s they were awarded to individuals for their excellent service or achievement and presented by a commander or command sergeant major. They started as small round, bronze in color, metal coins and have grown to playing card size in all shapes, sizes, colors and artwork. They have quickly become something of a collector’s item. Units now have deployment coins, Sgt. Morales coins, promotion coins, etc. It has expanded far beyond the Army to all military services, law enforcement agencies, businesses and yes, the president even has a coin too. Truly one of the most coveted! The important point is never to be without a coin when a “coin check” is called. No matter where that happens, a Soldier without his or her coin must buy the next round of drinks! This harkens back to days past in Germany when prior to the implementation of the Euro, a “pfennig check” was called. A pfennig was the German equivalent of a U.S. penny but half the size of a dime. Usually they were taped to the back of a Soldier’s driver’s license and held no other significance than as a way to engage at social events.

Each soldier personally received a coin from Abernethy for finishing the annual, four-day 100-mile march. (U.S. Army Photo by Spc. Stephen P. Perez)
History, traditions and customs play a significant role in our lives as Soldiers, leaders, veterans, retirees, and family members. They ground us in our past while preparing us for the future so that we never forget the men and women who have gone before us and the hard fought lessons that they learned. Through the symbols, memories, always embellished “war stories,” and opportunities to celebrate our successes and our losses we will always remain Army strong! Hooah!

Gulf War lessons, learned or not
The U.S. military had a legion of troubles in the 1990-91 Persian Gulf conflict, many of which caused unnecessary deaths to allied troops and Iraqi civilians alike. What new technologies, tactics and equipment will prevent them this time around? The first of a five-part series.

The Gulf War is remembered as a walkover by many Americans — a late 20th-century blitzkrieg. In reality, the U.S. military had a legion of troubles in the 1990-91 conflict, many of which caused unnecessary deaths to allied troops and Iraqi civilians alike. Other tragedies were averted merely by luck or Iraqi incompetence. What new tactics, technologies and procedures are in place today to ensure that some of the worst mistakes of the first Gulf War will not be repeated in a second Iraq war?
The Gulf War of popular memory bears little resemblance to the one fought by the United States and its allies against Iraq, then touted as “the fourth-largest army in the world.” By the end of the war, media-savvy U.S. military spokesmen were deriding the Iraqi forces as “the second-largest army in Iraq.”
In 1993, John Keegan, the world’s pre-eminent military historian, called the war “a triumph of incisive planning and almost faultless execution.” Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the first war and now secretary of state, concluded in his 1995 biography that even though Saddam Hussein remained in power, “the remaining Iraqi army is hardly a force with a will to fight to the death.”
Quick conclusions now look time-worn.
The larger, strategic questions now seem self-evident:
Did the United States tilt too far toward Saddam’s Iraq during the Cold War?
Should the United States have pressed on to Baghdad in 1991?
Would U.S. troops still be in Saudi Arabia today — the main issue animating al-Qaida — if Washington had supported the anti-Saddam uprisings by Iraqi Kurds and Shiites that followed the war?
After action reports
These are questions for politicians and academics, not soldiers. But the Gulf War spawned in each branch of the U.S. military a serious round of soul-searching about mistakes that had cost lives - its own and those of Iraqi non-combatants. Friendly fire claimed 24 percent of all Americans killed in action, and more British troops fell to U.S. weapons than to Iraqi ones. Entire airwings became dependent on amphetamines, the “go pills” doled out to keep pilots alert on long missions. Two huge Navy warships were nearly sunk by Iraqi mines, exposing the fleet’s inadequate mine countermeasures. Disputes over the effectiveness of attacks on Iraqi divisions bedeviled air war commanders.
Tragic errors in target selection and bombs that simply missed their intended targets caused civilian deaths that briefly threatened the coalition. And miscalculations about the effects of vaccines, the vindictiveness of Iraq’s occupying forces and the Iraqi Republican Guard’s determination to survive also had serious consequences: Gulf War Syndrome, the world’s largest ever oil spill and a failure to defang Saddam’s army when the chance arose.
In interviews with a range of officers and military analysts, MSNBC.com asked a simple question: What were the biggest tactical mistakes and lessons of the Gulf War, and what has been done to fix them?
'Friendly fire'
As dire as the statistics sound — 35 of the 146 Americans killed in action were killed by their own comrades — military officers regard the figure as relatively low. “You have to put the number of friendly casualties in context,” says Jack Jacobs, a retired Army colonel who received the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War. “Anything larger than zero is a lot. But with so few casualties overall, the friendly fire number seems large. The reality is, it is a lot lower than it would have been for a similar operation in Vietnam or World War II.”
Still, the military — at least in part because of the incidents involving American forces killing British troops — grappled with ways of further reducing the number during the 1990s.
InsertArt(1746979)One clear advantage today, according to Bill Martel, a professor at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., is that American forces now have Global Positioning Satellite devices — GPS for short — which should make their locations more “knowable” to their comrades.
Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith notes that a “battlefield coordination detachment” has been added to the Combined Air Operations Center that would call the shots in any new Iraq air war.
No one pretends these systems are flawless. During the Afghan campaign, for instance, a special forces soldier gave his own GPS coordinates rather than the coordinates of the target to a B-52 crew, with tragic results. In another instance, Canadian troops were killed in an incident still under investigation.
“I don’t think there’s any technological silver bullet that will make friendly fire events go away,” Martel says. “How do you employ tens if not hundreds of thousands of people in combat and eliminate human error? You can’t. How can you prevent someone from entering the wrong GPS coordinates? You can’t.”
But at least GPS will give U.S. forces some improvement. For the British, who expect to send up to 30,000 troops to the Gulf, there has been little done, according to Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Larpent, who commanded a unit that lost 9 men to American fire in the last war.
“Why is it that our soldiers again will have nothing better to protect them than some very rudimentary system that we used without success back then?” he asked in a letter Sunday to a British newspaper.
The ‘al-Firdos' bunker
On Feb. 13, 1991, two Stealth fighters received orders to hit a hardened shelter in Baghdad that U.S. intelligence had identified as a “command and control bunker.”
The Air Force’s desire to hit sites related to Saddam’s ability to wage war had led intelligence officers to suggest this target several times — and each time it had been rejected for lack of evidence that it was, in fact, a military target. The bunker strike was approved after an Iraqi CIA asset confirmed it was a key military bunker. In fact, while debate still rages over the Iraqi military’s use of the bunker, the two bombs dropped through its reinforced roof incinerated more than 200 civilians (the Iraqis claimed the number was far higher).

The growing percentage of “precision” munitions in the U.S. military arsenal may diminish the number of civilians killed by missed targets. Andy Krepinevich, a military analyst at the Center Strategic and Budgetary Priorities in Washington, notes that only 7 percent of bombs dropped in the Gulf War were “smart” bombs. “About 35 percent were precision munitions in Kosovo, and that climbed to about 60 percent last year in Afghanistan,” he says. “The figure may be close to 80 percent if an Iraq war happens.”

Still, the “targeting error” problem — the one that chose Al Firdos for destruction — has haunted the Air Force ever since. In Kosovo, a Stealth bomber dropped a bomb on the Chinese Embassy after the CIA and DIA failed to coordinate data on what was in the building. A Red Cross headquarters in Kabul and a wedding party in northern Afghanistan suffered similar fates.
“I think there have been strides made in the relationship between intelligence agencies and battlefield commanders,” says Gen. Perry Smith. “But you’re going to have an occasionally goof like that because of human error or a lack of real close coordination between agencies. In a 30-day war of the kind being discussed, there will be at least one. That’s just the way it is.”
Scud hunting
The effort to detect and destroy mobile Scud missiles, in retrospect, received too little attention, according to Smith. “Schwartzkopf was not a big special forces fan. We had them but didn’t use them that widely,” the general says. “We learned a lesson; we learned we could not do this from the air.”
In fact, Schwartzkopf authorized the British SAS to begin hunting Scuds two days before the ground war began. He later agreed to allow the U.S. Delta Force to join them. Not one Scud launcher was destroyed.
“Now, after Afghanistan, we have a large number of special forces, better equipped and with better sensors. Reconnaissance drones, too, will play a role, lingering over areas and swooping down.”
So-called UCAVS - Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles like the Hellfire missile-firing Predator — also makes it more likely that “real-time” intelligence can be harvested. “They may not be able to knock out a Scud launcher,” the general says, “but they can keep it busy while the F-16s are on the way.”
Anti-missile defense
When Scuds were launched, “day of” accounts told a breathless tale of triumph, all built around the idea that Patriot missiles based in Israel and Saudi Arabia had killed most, if not all, incoming Scuds.
“After the war, we examined those claims, and as it turned out, they killed a few or possibly even no Scuds completely,” Smith says. Late in the war, that reality became painfully clear when a single Scud slammed into a crowded U.S. barracks in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, killing 28, mostly U.S. Air National Guard troops.
Since then, there have been two major developments. One is a new-generation Patriot PAC-3, designed to hit oncoming warheads, rather than merely destroying the missile and leaving the warhead to follow its own altered but still deadly trajectory.
The second is a joint U.S.-Israeli program that developed a whole new system: the Arrow anti-missile system. Israel now fields a dozen batteries of these missiles, which, unlike the last-ditch Patriots, are designed to intercept Scuds in their launch mode, far away from targeted cities. “We should now be able to shoot down somewhere in the neighborhood of two-thirds of oncoming missiles,” Smith predicts. “Of course, it only takes a single missile with a chemical warhead to change the geopolitics. But this is a huge advance over where we were 12 years ago.”
Medical issues
Beyond the obvious dangers of a battlefield, the military found itself criticized harshly after the Gulf War on two fronts: inadequately preparing troops for exposure to dangerous chemicals — including biological and chemical weapons — and overusing amphetamine “Go Pills” used by pilots to stay alert on long missions.
During the war, Washington Post reporter Rick Atkinson reported in his book, “Crusade,” pilots of the 53rd Tactical Air Squadron based at Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia, became psychologically addicted to the pills. The pace was so ferocious, Atkinson reports, that an effort by the squadron’s commander to ban the pills had to be abandoned.
In Afghanistan, two pilots involved in a friendly fire incident involving Canadian troops recently claimed their judgment was impaired by “go pills” they were required to take, a charge the Air Force denies. Perry, the retired Air Force general and a former fighter pilot himself, says the long distances needed to reach the battlefield in Afghanistan may be partly to blame. “That should not be a major issue in Iraq,” he says.
More serious is the Gulf War Syndrome issue. Soon after the war, U.S. and British troops began complaining of debilitating symptoms. There still is no scientific agreement on what causes the illnesses, which range from joint pains to memory loss to partial paralysis. Some blame the bio-warfare vaccinations administered before the war. Others wonder whether destroying stocks of Iraqi chemical or biological agents might have done it, or even exposure to the oil fires that raged. Whatever the cause, reports from the GAO and the Institute of Medicine and a variety of other sources blame the Defense Department for not taking the issue seriously, for attempting to deny the existence of the issue and ultimately for failing to safeguard troops.
Given the uncertain root of the problem, experts say, there is no certainty that a second rash of such illnesses can be avoided. However, the military’s stock of protective chem-bio suits, and its ability to detect such agents, is vastly improved.
Mine warfare
Few now remember, but during operations intended to trick Iraq into believing that U.S. Marines would land in Kuwait, two major Navy vessels - the Aegis cruiser U.S.S. Princeton and the amphibious assault ship U.S.S. Tripoli - very nearly were sunk by Iraqi mines. Since that incident, according to CBSA’s Krepinevich, mine warfare officers have tried without success to get a major modernization of the World War II-vintage minesweeping fleet.
“This is one place where progress is almost nil,” he says. “This is not a glamorous use of funds, obviously, and it is a problem that hasn’t been addressed.”
The sinking of a cruiser or one of the aircraft carrier-sized amphibious assault ships would not have changed the course of the war but might well have changed the public’s perspective of it.

Philosophy Military Training Doctrine and Practice
History of Military Training in the United States, The Post-Vietnam Era
The training of armies as a systematic educational practice has ancient roots. While other trades, crafts, and vocations are often individual pursuits, organized warfare requires the common training of vast numbers to produce synchronized efforts and predictable responses under stress. The evolution of military training doctrine and professional education in the United States provides a model of experimentation, advances, and rediscoveries in pedagogical practices and learning theory. As in the case of research and practical applications in medicine, engineering, technology, management, and organizational leadership, military professional education and training have been a proving ground for innovations. For the sake of brevity, the training doctrine of the U.S. Army will serve here as the primary example.
Doctrinal debates abound in the history of military training. Military educators have assessed the relative efficacy of rote memory and static knowledge, as opposed to creativity and dynamic knowledge. They have struggled with the choice between a single proven solution and situational initiative; that is, between rigid routine and fixed practice and standardized yet flexible techniques. They have appraised lecture/discussion-based learning and, for many skills, found experiential and case-based learning preferable. Simulations (war games), service learning, internships, and apprenticeships are longstanding practices. And in the evolving relationship between teacher and student, military trainers have moved away from an authoritarian, directive mode to a more participative colearner model of shared expertise.
History of Military Training in the United States
Friedrich von Steuben, a Prussian volunteer serving as George Washington's inspector general during the Revolutionary War, composed the first uniquely American training doctrine. Steuben brought his organizational energy and negotiation skills to the struggling Continental army at Valley Forge during the winter of 1777–1778. His ability as a teacher and trainer were anchored in his genuine concern for individuals, his personal integrity and sense of humor, and a keen perception of the character of Americans. He earned the trust of both Washington and the common soldier.
Steuben saw the Continentals as real soldiers, but of a new type–quick learners, likely to respond favorably to participative, practical, caring, and adaptive leadership, and to the discipline of a trained team. He instituted three essential reforms. First, he put commissioned officers in charge of training, insisting that they lead their men in training as they would in battle. He also advised that officers care for their soldiers. In his drill regulations, published in 1779, Steuben wrote: "A captain can not be too careful of the company the State has committed to his charge. He must pay the greatest attention to the health of his men, their discipline, arms, accouterments, clothes and necessaries" (Moss, p. 259). This dual focus enhanced the proficiency of both leader and those being led, while reinforcing the bond between them–a view reflected in the modern principle "mission first, soldiers always."
Second, Steuben prescribed an overhaul of army discipline, supply accountability, and manpower utilization. Soldiers scattered on various fatigue details and serving as officers' servants were returned to tactical units for training–a principle reflected in the current practice of priority training periods. He understood more clearly than Washington that European methods of discipline could not be imposed on the American army. Initiative, self-reliance, and a desire to know the why behind an order or a procedure were foundations of the American character. Steuben believed training for collective action had to be built on these entrepreneurial characteristics, and not designed to eliminate them.
Finally, Steuben standardized and simplified battle formations, tactics, and drills. He developed a manual of arms that reduced the steps in loading and firing muskets, taught the practical use of the bayonet, and trained the army to march in columns of four rather than in long, rambling single file. His teaching methods were insightful. He recruited 100 men of robust constitution for a demonstration guard company. With the assistance of carefully selected sub-inspectors, Steuben personally trained one squad in the new manual of arms and movement techniques, then supervised the drilling of other squads by the sub-inspectors. Once the squads were trained, he drilled them as a company, starting each day with squad drills and ending with company exercises–the beginnings of what now is called multi-echelon, progressive, or integrated training.
Many officers and soldiers came to watch Steuben's "parades" and were impressed. Washington directed that unit commanders adopt Steuben's model and appointed training inspectors coached by Steuben to oversee training throughout the Continental army. In a sense, these inspectors became the master teachers of their day–Steuben's concepts of teaching and learning have much in common with those of the twentieth-century educational philosopher John Dewey.
Steuben's innovations ran counter to a trend all too common in military history. Rigid adherence to outdated concepts of operational doctrine, including tactics and training methods that do not reflect the changing nature of military weapons and of warfare itself, has repeatedly proven costly, both in terms of military objectives and the lives of soldiers. Experience yields valuable lessons to those willing to learn. Unfortunately, many lessons are forgotten, only to be relearned by later generations.
One excellent example is that of Emory Upton, an 1861 graduate of West Point who rose to the rank of brevet major general in the Union army. Upton solved the problem of assaulting entrenchments defended by men with rifled muskets. In contrast to massed formations of soldiers marching shoulder to shoulder in the open, Upton employed four-man assault teams that moved independently, in short rushes, while other teams engaged the enemy–a technique today called fire and movement.
Trained to work together, taking advantage of cover and concealment and relying more on speed, surprise, and teamwork than on firepower, Upton's four-man team was the precursor of the modern infantry squad and an early model of the self-managed learning and production teams of today. European armies ignored Upton's lesson until the last year of World War I, when, in response to lethal battlefield conditions, both German and American assault troops devised innovative infiltration tactics employing interdependent teams.
The Post-Vietnam Era
The post-Vietnam era was a time of deep reflection for military professionals. The persistent threat of the cold war, however, did not allow for near-total demobilization and a return to isolationism, as had repeatedly occurred in the past. In the 1970s, the challenge facing military leaders was to train a force that would be fully prepared to fight in a "come as you are" war–one without a lengthy mobilization period.
A method had to be found to institutionalize experiential learning. The practical classroom of combat repeatedly reveals the strengths and deficiencies of military training. Standardized training schedules and techniques, fixed tactical solutions, and common doctrine–efficient in teaching the "book solution" and easy to evaluate–are often not effective in preparing leaders or soldiers to deal with new missions, unique environmental conditions, and the uncertainties of combat.
To meet this challenge, operational doctrine, recruiting methods, and training techniques required major revisions. The U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) was established in 1973 as the single proponent for training reforms, doctrine revision, leader development, and the modernization of organizational structure, weapons, and equipment. William DePuy, the first Commanding General of TRADOC, recognized that the United States must be able to fight and win the "first battle of the next war." The Arab-Israeli War of 1973 provided a vivid example of modern warfare's speed and lethality, and its sudden onset allowed no time for the shallow seasoning (learning) curve of earlier wars.
DePuy's World War II and Vietnam experiences convinced him that the root cause of first-battle failures was combat training "by the numbers," where "learning and relevance were secondary to scheduling" (Scales, p. 11) and leadership development lacked demands for realistic combined-arms synchronization in the uncertainty of the battlefield. He initiated doctrinal changes that focused on a systems approach of "training to task, not to time" that educated leaders to optimize the advances in weapons and mobility, seeking to steepen the prewar seasoning curve. A parallel civil education reform is the shift from accumulating Carnegie units (number of hours per subject) to block scheduling and interdisciplinary, across-the-curriculum learning.
In the mid-1970s, Army Training and Evaluation Programs (ARTEP) and soldier's manuals replaced earlier training schedules. Each individual and unit task was analyzed, specified, and defined by measurable performance standards and the conditions under which it would be performed. Evaluations stressed actual performance under field conditions. Skills mastered at each level contributed to effectiveness at higher levels. Doctrinal innovations reflecting the realities of modern warfare were integrated into a series of how to fight and training the force manuals used to guide learning and actual operations.
Under the new doctrine, individual and unit training takes full advantage of techniques that are gaining acceptance in civilian schools and organizational settings. Internship experiences are provided to cadets and midshipmen. Initial tours of duty have a strong apprenticeship focus, while service learning (that is, learning from practical experience in an applied setting under the guidance or coaching of a trainer or teacher) is the norm. Theory and principles taught in the classroom are habitually applied and evaluated in field settings under expert supervision. Computer-assisted instruction and simulations, as well as distance learning organized under corresponding studies programs, are used extensively. Annual performance evaluations for leaders are anchored in individually prepared professional development plans. Across disciplines education is mandated by combined arms and joint operations doctrine.
The slogan "train as you will fight" gained credence with the adoption the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) for tactical training. Eye-safe laser projectors were developed to match weapons from rifles to tank cannons; laser sensitive target arrays were rigged to soldiers' field gear and to vehicles; and computers recorded hits and near misses. MILES allowed, for the first time, force-on-force exercises that realistically simulated combat.
Evaluation of Training Methods
Inspired by the Navy's Top Gun program, the Army began tactical unit training evaluations at Fort Irwin's National Training Center (NTC) in the early 1980s. MILES-equipped companies and battalions, linked into a computerized Core Instrumentation System supported by video cameras, radio monitors, and experienced controllers, engaged a numerically superior opposing force (OPFOR) in a "no-holdsbarred battle" that tested individual and unit tactical skills and the real-time decision-making skills of commanders and their staffs.
The learning value of the NTC and other similarly equipped centers results from the direct experience of no-nonsense combat simulations and the cumulative effects of candid and detailed After Action Reviews (AARs). During an AAR, leaders' decisions, and their consequences, are evaluated using automated records of actions, controllers' observations and, significantly, the memories of unit participants. AARs are professional, collective reflections, and can be very humbling experiences. No other army exposes commanders to such a skilled opposing force and then reveals the results of the field exercise to that commander's subordinates and peers. Each NTC experience produces lessons learned that are actively shared.
As a key tool for learning from experience, the AAR technique is also applied to computer-assisted free-play simulations called Battle Command Training Programs (BCTPs), which are used to evaluate commanding generals and their staffs. To deal with the highly sensitive issue of such public assessments of senior officers, each BCTP simulation and its AAR is supervised by three retired four-star generals.
Evaluation and professional reflection are not limited to the NTC and BCTP. Mission-essential tasks, defined in each unit's ARTEP, are evaluated against measurable standards during AARs conducted after each training event. This commitment to honest feedback has instilled an institutional obsession to train realistically for combat and to learn from the experience. As vividly demonstrated by the Persian Gulf war and operations throughout the 1990s, units realistically trained prior to actual combat suffered remarkably low losses compared to first engagements in earlier wars. Well-prepared leaders made the right choices and soldiers performed with confidence grown from their repeated exposure to evaluated training experiences. Realism in training reinforced by professional reflection and shared lessons learned saves lives.
The military forces of the early twenty-first century face complex missions and diverse challenges, demanding training not just for combat but also for operations short of war, such as peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, counter-terrorism, and nation building. Soldiers must be prepared to shift rapidly from one operational mode to another, often with radically different rules of engagement. Current training practices emphasize this adaptability. Self-discipline and initiative, a shared understanding of the mission and the commander's vision, skillful application of technology, battlefield mobility and firepower, and a belief in both individual uniqueness and in skilled teams remain, as in Steuben's day, the foundations of organizational effectiveness. Military service is a calling and a vocation, linked throughout America's history by a remarkable faith in professional education and training.

The Inheritance
America's Military After Two Decades of War
By Mara E. Karlin December 14, 2021
Exploring how the U.S. military can move beyond Iraq and Afghanistan
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. military has been fighting incessantly in conflicts around the globe, often with inconclusive results. The legacies of these conflicts have serious implications for how the United States will wage war in the future. Yet there is a stunning lack of introspection about these conflicts.
Never in modern U.S. history has the military been at war for so long. And never in U.S. history have such long wars demanded so much of so few. The legacy of wars without end include a military that feels the painful effects of war but often feels alone. The public is less connected to the military now than at any point in modern U.S. history. The national security apparatus seeks to pivot away from these engagements and to move on to the next threats—notably those emanating from China and Russia. Many young Americans question whether it even makes sense to invest in the military. At best, there are ad hoc, unstructured debates about Iraq or Afghanistan. Simply put, there has been no serious, organized stock-taking by the public, politicians, opinion leaders, or the military itself of this inheritance.
Despite being at war for the longest continuous period in its history, the military is woefully unprepared for future wars. But the United States cannot simply hit the reset button. This book explores this inheritance by examining how nearly two decades of war have influenced civil-military relations, how the military goes to war, how the military wages war, who leads the military and who serves in it, how the military thinks about war, and above all, the enduring impact of these wars on those who waged them. If the U.S. military seeks to win in the future, it must acknowledge and reconcile with the inheritance of its long and inconclusive wars. This book seeks to help them do so.

About the Author
Mara E. Karlin was director of Strategic Studies and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Karlin previously served in national security roles for five U.S. secretaries of defense. She is the author of Building Militaries in Fragile States: Challenges for the United States.
Praise for The Inheritance
“No person I know can better capture the complex legacy of twenty years of post-9/11 conflict than Mara Karlin and her excellent new effort, The Inheritance. Indeed, as the U.S. prepares itself for an unprecedented array of twenty-first-century national security challenges, this insightful work should be considered required reading for experts, in and out of government, and everyday citizens alike.”
—General John R. Allen, USMC (Ret.); president, the Brookings Institution
“A comprehensive and provocative examination of the effects of decades of war on the U.S. military from one of the preeminent scholar-practitioners in the field of national security affairs. Karlin relates what Defense Department leaders are thinking about the legacy of post-9/11 wars and suggests ways they could think more fruitfully. An essential resource for anyone trying to make sense of the recent past and likely future of U.S. defense policy.”
—Peter D. Feaver, professor of political science and public policy, Duke University; director, Duke Program in American Grand Strategy
“Brilliant. Incisive. A must-read for students of the U.S. military and anyone who wants to understand the lasting impacts of the last twenty years of war. This insightful stock-taking of the lessons we should learn from recent history is critical to understanding how to keep the military’s edge in the future.”
—Michèle Flournoy, chair, Board of Directors, Center for a New American Security; cofounder and managing partner, WestExec Advisors
“This book is an excellent exploration of the struggle by the U.S. national security community to critically examine our failures of the past twenty years. I especially value Karlin’s emphases on inculcating a culture of skepticism and practical ways to reconnect the public with policy about wars.”
—Kori Schake, senior fellow and director of foreign and defense policy studies, American Enterprise Institute

Alright, so I've got this question: "How successful has the U.S. military been at learning from history since 1945?" It's a pretty broad question, so I need to narrow it down a bit. First, I should probably define what it means to "learn from history." I think it involves studying past conflicts, understanding what worked and what didn't, and applying those lessons to future situations to improve decision-making and outcomes.

Since 1945, the U.S. has been involved in several major conflicts: the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the Iraq War, and the war in Afghanistan, among others. Each of these conflicts presents different lessons that the military could learn from.

Let me start by looking at the Vietnam War because it's often cited as a turning point for the U.S. military. I recall that after Vietnam, there was a significant transformation in the military, sometimes referred to as the "Vietnam Syndrome." This led to changes in doctrine, training, and equipment. For example, the Army developed new counterinsurgency strategies and placed greater emphasis on technological superiority.

But I also remember that some argue that the military didn't effectively learn from Vietnam, especially in terms of avoiding similar mistakes in future conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan. So, there seems to be a debate here.

Maybe I should look for scholarly articles or books that discuss this topic. Perhaps there are historians or military analysts who have studied this issue in depth.

I think it would be helpful to see what experts have to say about whether the U.S. military has learned from its past experiences.

Let me consider the Gulf War in 1991. That was often seen as a success, with a quick victory against Iraq. Was that because the military had learned from Vietnam? Or was it due to other factors, like the nature of the opponent?

Then there's the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which initially was also a swift victory, but the occupation and insurgency that followed were problematic. Did the military apply the lessons from Vietnam or the first Gulf War in this case? It seems like there were still challenges in nation-building and dealing with insurgencies.

The war in Afghanistan, which started in 2001, has been the longest war in U.S. history. There have been criticisms that the military didn't learn from past experiences in Afghanistan, such as the Soviet Union's experience there.

So, perhaps I should look at specific areas where the military could have applied lessons from history but didn't, or where they did succeed in applying those lessons.

For instance, in terms of counterinsurgency, the military developed new doctrines and approaches after Vietnam, like the "population-centric" counterinsurgency strategy applied in Iraq in 2007-2008, which is often credited with reducing violence. So, that might be an example of learning from history.

On the other hand, there have been issues with intelligence, as seen in the lead-up to the Iraq War, where misinformation about weapons of mass destruction played a role. Was that a failure to learn from past intelligence mistakes, like those leading up to the Vietnam War?

Another aspect is the treatment of prisoners and adherence to the laws of war. The abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the controversy over Guantanamo Bay have raised questions about whether the military has learned from past instances of mistreatment of prisoners.

Furthermore, there's the issue of military readiness and the strain on troops due to multiple deployments. Has the military learned from past experiences about the need to properly support and rotate troops to prevent burnout?

I also think about the development of technology and whether the military has learned to effectively integrate new technologies into its operations. For example, the use of drones has increased significantly since the 1990s, but there are debates about their effectiveness and ethical implications.

It might be useful to look at specific case studies or examples where the military has either successfully applied historical lessons or failed to do so.

Perhaps I can look at the military's approach to nation-building. In Vietnam, the U.S. tried to build a stable government in South Vietnam, but it didn't succeed. Then in Iraq and Afghanistan, similar attempts were made, with mixed results. Has the military learned from these experiences, or are they repeating the same mistakes?

I recall that General David Petraeus was instrumental in revising the counterinsurgency field manual in 2006, drawing on lessons from Vietnam and other conflicts. So, that seems like an attempt to learn from history.

But despite these efforts, the outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan haven't been entirely positive. So, maybe the military has learned some lessons but not others.

Another angle is the relationship between the military and civilian leadership. Has the military learned to provide better advice to policymakers based on historical experiences? Or are there still communication gaps?

I think it's also important to consider the role of military education and professional development. Does the military adequately train its officers to study and learn from history? Institutions like the Army War College and the Naval War College place a strong emphasis on historical case studies, so in that sense, there is a focus on learning from the past.

However, putting that learning into practice in the heat of conflict is another matter altogether.

Moreover, there's the issue of inter-service cooperation. Has the military learned to work more effectively across different branches, as was sometimes a challenge in the past?

In the context of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been a push towards more joint operations and better interoperability between the services.

Another factor is the military's ability to adapt to changing threats. For example, after 9/11, the focus shifted to counterterrorism and irregular warfare. Has the military been successful in adapting its training and strategies to meet these new challenges, based on lessons from past conflicts?

I think it's also worth considering the impact of public opinion and political constraints on military operations. How has the military's understanding of these external factors evolved over time?

In Vietnam, the military faced significant political constraints, such as the limitations on ground troop numbers and the rules of engagement. Similar constraints were present in the more recent conflicts.

So, perhaps the military has learned to operate within these constraints more effectively, or maybe not.

I should also think about the military's approach to partnered operations, working with local forces and governments. Has the military improved in this area based on historical experiences?

In Afghanistan, for example, there have been challenges in building the capacity of the Afghan security forces. Has the military learned from past nation-building efforts in places like Germany and Japan after World War II?

Another area is the use of force and minimizing collateral damage. Has the military become more precise in its targeting, thereby reducing civilian casualties, compared to past conflicts?

Advances in technology, such as precision-guided munitions, should theoretically allow for more discriminate strikes. But the reality is often more complex.

I should probably look for specific metrics or examples to illustrate whether the military has improved in these areas.

For instance, in terms of minimizing civilian casualties, how do the numbers compare between Vietnam and more recent conflicts? I know that in Vietnam, there were significant civilian casualties, which damaged public support for the war.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, the military has made efforts to minimize civilian deaths, but there have still been incidents that have caused public outcry.

So, perhaps there has been some learning, but it's not perfect.

Another example is the military's approach to insurgency. In Vietnam, the military initially focused on large-scale battles, but later shifted to more population-centric counterinsurgency tactics.

Similarly, in Iraq, the surge in 2007 involved a shift to counterinsurgency strategies that emphasized protecting the population and building local institutions.

So, in that sense, it seems like the military has learned to adapt its approach to insurgency over time.

But at the same time, the outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan haven't been entirely satisfactory, which raises questions about whether the lessons have been fully internalized or applied correctly.

Maybe I need to consider that learning from history is a continuous process, and perfection is unattainable. Every conflict is unique, and what worked in one situation may not work in another.

Therefore, perhaps the question shouldn't be whether the military has been "successful" in learning from history, but rather how it has evolved its approaches over time and what ongoing challenges remain.

Additionally, I should consider the role of military culture and organizational learning. Some organizations are better at learning from their mistakes than others.

Is the U.S. military a learning organization? From what I've read, there is a strong emphasis on after-action reviews and lessons learned, which are intended to capture insights from operations and inform future training and doctrine.

However, implementing those lessons can be challenging, especially if there is resistance within the institution to change.

There might also be a tendency to selectively remember certain aspects of history while forgetting others, which could impact the effectiveness of learning.

Moreover, the military operates within a political context, and sometimes its hands are tied by political considerations, which can complicate the application of historical lessons.

For example, in Vietnam, the military was constrained by the political leadership's desire to limit the scope of the war, which may have hindered its ability to achieve certain objectives.

Similarly, in Iraq and Afghanistan, political pressures may have influenced military strategies and resource allocations.

So, perhaps some of the challenges in applying historical lessons stem from external factors beyond the military's control.

Another dimension is the relationship between the military and the civilian population. Public support is crucial for sustained military operations, especially in long conflicts.

In Vietnam, public opinion turned against the war, which had implications for military operations and ultimately contributed to the withdrawal of troops.

In more recent conflicts, public support has also waned over time, which may have affected military strategies and the allocation of resources.

Has the military learned to better manage public expectations and maintain civilian support during prolonged conflicts?

I'm not sure. It seems like public support remains a challenge in any protracted military engagement.

Perhaps the military has focused more on improving communication with the public and the media to enhance transparency and accountability.

But given the ongoing debates about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's unclear how successful these efforts have been.

Another aspect is the treatment of veterans and the support provided to them after their service. Has the military learned from past mistakes in caring for veterans, such as the handling of Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam veterans?

There have been improvements in veteran support programs over time, but there are still criticisms about the adequacy of healthcare and other benefits for veterans from recent conflicts.

So, while there may be some learning and progress, there are still areas that need improvement.

Looking ahead, with the rise of great-power competition, particularly with China and Russia, the military is shifting its focus towards preparing for high-intensity conflicts involving advanced adversaries.

How does this shift reflect learning from past experiences in lower-intensity conflicts?

Some argue that the military has overemphasized counterinsurgency and nation-building at the expense of preparing for conventional warfare.

Others contend that the military needs to maintain capabilities in both domains, as future conflicts may encompass a range of scenarios.

Therefore, perhaps the learning from history involves recognizing the need for flexibility and readiness across different types of conflicts.

Moreover, with the increasing complexity of modern warfare, including cyber threats, information operations, and the integration of artificial intelligence, the military must continually adapt and learn to stay ahead of potential adversaries.

In conclusion, assessing how successful the U.S. military has been at learning from history since 1945 is a multifaceted task. There are certainly examples of the military adapting and improving based on past experiences, such as advancements in counterinsurgency strategies and technological innovations.

However, there are also instances where similar mistakes have been repeated, suggesting that learning from history is an ongoing process with room for improvement.

Perhaps the key takeaway is that the military, like any organization, must remain vigilant in its efforts to study and apply historical lessons while also being adaptable enough to confront new and evolving challenges.

## Final Answer
