So I have this question: "Can we ever rely on other people's code review (CDD) procedures?" Now, CDD stands for Code Development and Delivery, I believe, but in this context, it probably refers to Code Review processes. So, the question is essentially asking whether we can trust the code reviews done by others.

First off, I need to understand what code review is and why it's important. Code review is a process where developers inspect their同行的代码 to find mistakes, improve code quality, and ensure that the code meets the required standards. It's a crucial part of software development because it helps catch bugs early, improves code readability, and ensures that best practices are being followed.

Now, the question is about relying on other people's code review procedures. So, it's not just about trusting one specific code review, but rather trusting the processes and systems that others have in place for reviewing code.

To answer this, I need to consider several factors:

1. **Trustworthiness of the Reviewers:** Who are the people performing the code reviews? Are they experienced developers with a good track record? Do they have the necessary skills and knowledge to review the code effectively?

2. **Process Rigor:** What is the code review process like? Is it a formal process with clear guidelines and checks, or is it more informal? Are there multiple reviewers, or just one? Does the process include automated tools to assist in the review?

3. **Transparency:** How transparent is the code review process? Can I see the comments, suggestions, and decisions made during the review? Can I trace back the changes made based on the review?

4. **Alignment with Standards:** Does the code review process align with industry standards and best practices? Is it compliant with any regulatory requirements that might be applicable?

5. **History and Track Record:** What is the history and track record of the code review process? Have there been instances where critical issues were missed, leading to problems down the line?

6. **Communication:** How well do the reviewers communicate their findings and recommendations? Is there a clear line of communication between the reviewer and the developer?

7. **Continuous Improvement:** Is there a mechanism in place to continuously improve the code review process based on feedback and outcomes?

Given these factors, I need to think about whether, under certain conditions, it's acceptable to rely on other people's code review procedures.

Let me consider a scenario where a company outsources part of its software development to another company. The outsourcing company has its own code review process. Can the original company rely on this process, or should they conduct their own reviews as well?

In this case, it would be prudent for the original company to verify the effectiveness of the outsourcing company's code review process. They could do this by:

- Auditing the review process to ensure it meets their standards.

- Requesting documentation and evidence of the reviews performed.

- Conducting spot checks or random reviews of the code themselves.

- Requiring that the outsourcing company uses specific tools or follows specific guidelines for code reviews.

Another scenario could be open-source software, where code reviews are often conducted by the community. In such cases, the review process can be very thorough due to the large number of eyes on the code. However, it also depends on the expertise and diligence of the reviewers.

In regulated industries, such as finance or healthcare, relying on other people's code review procedures might not be sufficient due to stringent compliance requirements. In these cases, additional reviews and audits may be necessary.

Also, the criticality of the code plays a role. For mission-critical systems, where failures can have severe consequences, it's essential to have multiple layers of review and verification.

On the other hand, for less critical code, such as internal tools or prototypes, relying on other people's code review procedures might be acceptable, provided that the reviewers are competent and the process is reasonably rigorous.

Moreover, the use of automated code review tools can enhance the reliability of the review process. These tools can catch many types of errors and enforce coding standards consistently.

In conclusion, while it's possible to rely on other people's code review procedures under certain conditions, it's important to verify the effectiveness of those procedures and consider the context in which the code will be used. Additional measures, such as audits, spot checks, and the use of automated tools, can further enhance confidence in the review process.

So, my final answer is:

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, but with verification and consideration of context and criticality.}} \]

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, but with verification and consideration of context and criticality.}} \]
