So I have this question: "Are vaccines 100% effective?" Hmm, that's an interesting query. I think to answer this properly, I need to understand what vaccine effectiveness means and look into some data or studies on vaccines to see how effective they really are.

First off, I know that vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to develop immunity against specific diseases without causing the disease itself. They've been crucial in controlling and even eradicating many infectious diseases. But are they perfect? Do they offer complete protection to everyone who gets vaccinated?

I recall that no vaccine is 100% effective. There's always a chance that a vaccinated person might still get the disease. But I need to find some concrete evidence to support this. Maybe looking up the efficacy rates of some common vaccines would help.

Let me think about which vaccines to look into. Perhaps starting with some well-known ones like the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the influenza vaccine, or the COVID-19 vaccines. Each of these has different effectiveness rates, so comparing them could give a broader picture.

Starting with the MMR vaccine, I believe it's highly effective. From what I remember, two doses are about 97% effective at preventing measles. But I need to confirm that. Maybe I should look up the CDC website or another reliable health source for accurate information.

Wait, maybe I should perform a search to get the most accurate and up-to-date information. Let me try that.

How Effective are the COVID-19 Vaccines?
How does the effectiveness of the new COVID-19 vaccines compare to other common vaccines?
Dec. 28, 2020 • 4 min read
In clinical trials of more than 40,000 participants, the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective against COVID-19. In clinical trials of more than 30,000 participants, the Moderna vaccine was 94% effective against COVID-19. High efficacy rates of vaccines aren’t uncommon, with many common vaccines like measles, polio, tetanus, and hepatitis showing efficacy rates of above 80%. So, how does the effectiveness of the new COVID-19 vaccines compare to other common vaccines?
Dr. Maryrose Laguio-Vila, an infectious disease expert at Rochester Regional Health, provides insight into the effectiveness of some of today’s most common vaccines.
“The COVID-19 vaccines are comparatively highly-effective in preventing infection when you look at the other vaccines we regularly get or provide our children,” she explained.
Here are the efficacy rates of some of today's most common vaccines and how they compare to the 94%-95% effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines:
Flu: 40% – 60%
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) studies the flu vaccine’s effectiveness each year. While results can vary, recent studies show that the flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.
“Even though 40-60% might appear low, the flu vaccine is highly effective in reducing the spread of the flu and the severity of the infection, should you get it,” Dr. Laguio-Vila said.
Polio: 90% – 100%
Children in the United States get four doses of the polio vaccine, and each dose increases the vaccine’s effectiveness. The first dose is given at two months old, then four months, then between six and 18 months, and the fourth between four and six years old.
The CDC says that two doses of the polio vaccine are 90% effective at protecting against polio, and three doses are approximately 100% effective.
Tetanus: 99%
Protection against tetanus is provided with the DTaP vaccine which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The DTaP vaccine is given to infants and provides protection for approximately 10 years. A booster vaccine called TDaP is given after 10 years and then every 10 years to maintain protection.
While similar in name, the DTaP and TDaP vaccines are not to be confused with each another. The DTaP vaccine is the initial vaccine given to children, and the TDaP vaccine is the booster vaccine given several years later and into adulthood to continue providing protection.
The CDC says that “nearly all cases of tetanus today are in people who never got a tetanus vaccine or did not receive a complete course of tetanus vaccines, or adults who didn’t stay up to date on their 10-year booster shots.”
Measles: 93%
Mumps: 78%
Rubella: 97%
The Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is administered as one vaccine to children in two doses. The first dose is typically given at 12 to 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. After the second dose, the effectiveness of protection against measles increases to 97%, and the effectiveness for protection against mumps increases to 88%.
Hepatitis A: 95%
Hepatitis B: 80% – 100%
Hepatitis A and B are serious diseases caused by a virus that attacks the liver. Vaccines with high efficacy rates are given to children and all age groups for long-term protection and prevention.

What is the efficacy rate of each available vaccine?
At this point, only vaccine efficacy (VE) data is available since “effectiveness” depends on many different factors and requires a longer observation period.
1. AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]): 70.4% (95% CI 54.8 to 80.6%) overall VE against symptomatic COVID-19, 14 days after 2nd dose
2. Sinovac CoronaVac: 65 to 91% (based on Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey Trials)
3. Gamaleya Sputnik V: 91.6% (95% CI 85.6 to 95.2%) overall VE against symptomatic COVID-19, 21 days after 1st dose; 100% (96% CI 94.4 to 100.0%) VE against moderate or severe cases, 21 days after the 1st dose
4. Janssen: 66.9% (95% CI 59.0 to 73.4%) against confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19, 14 days after vaccination; 66.1% (95% CI 55.0 to 74.8%) against confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination; ~77% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after vaccination and 85% effective in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination
5. Bharat BioTech: 80.6% (95% CI 78.1 to 82.7%) overall VE against PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, after the 2nd dose
6. Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2): 95% (94.7%, 95% CI 90.3 to 97.6%) against symptomatic COVID-19, 7 days after 2nd dose
7. Moderna (mRNA-1273): 94.1% (95% CI 89.3 to 96.8%%) overall VE against symptomatic COVID-19, at least 14 days after the 2nd dose; 100% VE against severe COVID-19

What are your questions about the coronavirus vaccine?
ideastream's health team is answering as many questions as possible, with help from local experts in a range of fields. You can send us your questions with our online form, through our social media group , or call us at 216-916-6476. We'll keep the answers coming on our website and on the air.
Dave reached out to ideastream's caller line to ask "What does the efficacy rate actually mean? When I hear the efficacy rate of the vaccine, whether it's over 90 percent or over 70 percent. I don't know exactly what that means."
Vaccine efficacy is different than its actual effectiveness, but MetroHealth’s infectious disease specialist Dr. Amy Ray said the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
Vaccine efficacy is the percentage reduction in a disease in a group of people who received a vaccination in a clinical trial.
It is calculated by dividing the number of total COVID-19 cases in a clinical trial by the number of cases from the control group, who didn’t get the vaccine.
“Efficacy means: Does the vaccine result in a measurable response, and if so, how much of a response?” Dr. Ray said. "So it's actually measuring, quantitatively, antibody levels."
Vaccine effectiveness is different. It measures how well the vaccine works in a real-world environment.
When people hear that Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines are 95 percent effective, they might think they are 95 percent protected when they’re vaccinated, Ray said.
The actual rate for the individual may vary, Ray said, because each person is different.
The new variants of the virus may also have an impact on efficacy, she said.
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was less effective in South Africa, where there are variants of the virus, Ray said.
And while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given in one shot, and is about 66 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19, its effectiveness rate goes up to about 85 percent when looking at severe illness due to infection, Ray said.
“If I were unvaccinated ... I might actually even opt for the Johnson & Johnson for a one-and-done approach. But I certainly would not allow the 95 percent efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna dissuade me from getting immunized.”
Health experts say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine appears to be really good at keeping people alive and out of the hospital. And that efficacy of the vaccine for Johnson & Johnson is actually pretty similar to what we see with the flu vaccine.
Dr. Ray strongly recommended getting whichever vaccine you are offered first, regardless of the efficacy rate.
“Decreasing the rate of COVID-19 is the way to stop the virus. So taking the vaccine is the single best way to prevent transmission," Ray said.

Vaccination is the administration of a vaccine to help the immune system develop a means to protect the body from disease. Vaccines contain a weakened microorganism or virus or proteins or toxins from an organism that helps a person build a tolerance to the disease but is not strong enough to infect the person. Vaccines have helped billions of people avoid contracting diseases such as the flu, pneumonia, measles, chickenpox, and more.
It is not only important for an individual to get vaccinated, but for everyone in a community to get vaccinated. While vaccines are effective in preventing diseases, herd immunity is most effective in preventing even highly infectious like measles from spreading within a community. During an outbreak, people who have been vaccinated are still at risk of becoming sick; herd immunity prevents this. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles prevent 2 to 3 million deaths around the world every year.
The world is much further ahead in the fight against infectious diseases than many people think. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 85.8% of the world’s one-year-olds are vaccinated. Additionally, about 80% of infants living in the world’s 73 poorest countries still receive routine immunizations. This is measured by how many children have been given a full course of immunizations for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTP3).
Vaccination rates, however, are not consistent from country to country and there are substantial differences in vaccination coverage within countries. Some countries have rates of 95% or higher, while some fall below 60%. Additionally, the WHO reports that children in the richest 20% of urban households are more likely to receive their vaccines than children from the poorest 20% of households. There are only 5 countries with vaccination rates of less than 60%. They are Equatorial Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan, Chad, and Samoa. Eighty-three countries are under the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) target of 90% or greater vaccination coverage. On the other hand, 112 countries have sustained at least 90% coverage of DTP3.
The differences in vaccination rates between countries and within countries are affected by several factors. People may not get vaccinated or vaccinate their children because of lack of accessibility to or the cost of vaccines, but also because some believe that vaccines are not effective or not safe. Liberia is the most skeptical country, with 28% of people disagreeing that vaccines are effective.
Vaccination rates will continue to grow around the world. At the beginning of 2018, France adopted a new policy that requires all children to receive 11 mandatory vaccines. In the United States and Australia, children must have up-to-date immunizations to attend child-care centers and preschool facilities. Governments will continue to encourage vaccination.
Even with recent outbreaks in regions of the United States and the world, the success of vaccinations has been higher than many other health behaviors. The World Health Organization’s full immunization coverage rate estimates can be found here.

Vaccine Effectiveness
Posted on August 23, 2021
Vaccines are one of the greatest triumphs of medicine and public health. Polio, measles, rubella, and diphtheria, which once caused severe illness and death, have been eliminated in the United States thanks to comprehensive vaccination campaigns and routine childhood immunization programs. The virus that causes smallpox, which was once one of the most contagious and deadly diseases known, was eradicated through a global vaccination campaign and no longer exists in nature today. Vaccines combined with other public health efforts keep diseases like tetanus, yellow fever and rabies from circulating among people in the United States as well.
Highly effective vaccines are the best way to control outbreaks and prevent severe illness and death; however, no vaccine is 100 percent effective. As a result, it is important to study vaccine effectiveness to better understand how a vaccine can be used along with other public health mitigation measures to achieve optimum disease control.
In the early stages of a vaccination campaign, it is convenient to get a “snapshot” of how well a vaccine is working by looking at the number of cases of illness that occur among those who are fully vaccinated. This measure, however, is not a true measure of vaccine effectiveness. As the percentage of the population that is vaccinated (vaccine coverage) increases, the proportion of COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people increases. For example, during a 2006 mumps outbreak on a Virginia college campus, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination was required for school entry and more than 99% of students were vaccinated. The vaccine effectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is about 88%. A very small percentage of students developed mumps but all of the cases were vaccinated. The outbreak was quickly contained on campus and did not spill over to the community.
Vaccine effectiveness is calculated using carefully designed scientific studies that monitor the development of illness in groups of both vaccinated and unvaccinated people who are followed over a defined period of time. It is difficult to conduct a study of this complexity at a state level. However, it is possible to monitor how well the vaccine is working using a slightly different calculation that compares the attack rate (percentage of individuals who become ill) in those who are vaccinated (known as “breakthrough” infections) with the attack rate among the unvaccinated (“natural infections”).
Epidemiologists often use two by two (2×2) tables to make these calculations. The table below demonstrates how the attack rate is calculated for those who are vaccinated and those who are unvaccinated:
Vaccinated
Unvaccinated
Total
Infected
a
b
a+b
Not Infected
c
d
c+d
Total
a+c
b+d
a+b+c+d
The attack rate among those who are vaccinated can be calculated as a/a+c and the attack rate among those who are unvaccinated can be calculated as b/b+d.
In order to determine vaccine effectiveness, epidemiologists make a calculation using the attack rates of both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Vaccine effectiveness can be calculated as follows:
This vaccine effectiveness calculation returns a number that is between 0 and 100 and is interpreted as the proportionate reduction in disease among those who are vaccinated. A larger number indicates that a vaccine is more effective.
What do we know about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States from published studies?
Currently, it appears that COVID-19 vaccines in the United States are highly effective at preventing serious illness and death and moderately to highly effective at preventing COVID-19 infection. A study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on August 18, 2021, which followed fully vaccinated New York residents, found that current vaccines were highly effective (>90%) against hospitalization associated with COVID-19 and almost 80% effective against new infection, even when Delta variant was the prevalent circulating strain. In another study of U.S. nursing home residents, data showed that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against new infection declined from >70% to just over 50% once the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain.
These data, as well as data from studies conducted in other countries, indicate that currently available COVID-19 vaccines in the United States remain highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19, but that protection against COVID-19 infection may be waning. VDH, in partnership with CDC, vaccine manufacturers, and other researchers will continue to monitor the vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine effectiveness, along with other epidemiologic data, can equip public health policymakers with the necessary tools needed to make sound decisions about vaccination and mitigation strategies to help reduce the burden of COVID-19 in the United States and around the world.
One such example is the recent White House’s announcement about plans to provide booster doses to adults who have received the mRNA COVID-19 series if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend them this fall. More information about Virginia’s plan for vaccine booster doses and additional data on vaccine effectiveness will be available in the coming weeks.

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can gather from them.

First, Doc 1 is about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines compared to other common vaccines. It mentions that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of around 95% and 94%, respectively, which are pretty high. It also lists efficacy rates for other vaccines like flu, polio, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, and B. So, it seems that different vaccines have different efficacy rates.

Next, Doc 2 is from the Department of Health in the Philippines, and it provides efficacy rates for various COVID-19 vaccines like AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V, Janssen, Bharat Biotech, Pfizer, and Moderna. Again, efficacy rates range from around 65% to over 90%. This suggests that even within the same type of vaccine, there's variation in how effective they are.

Doc 3 is from ideastream and discusses the difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness. It explains that efficacy is measured in controlled clinical trials, while effectiveness is observed in real-world conditions. The article emphasizes that even if a vaccine has a high efficacy rate, individual protection can vary, and herd immunity is important to prevent disease spread.

Doc 4 is a list of vaccination rates by country for DTP1 and DTP3 vaccinations. It shows that many countries have high vaccination rates, often above 90%, but there are some with lower rates, especially in certain regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. This data seems more related to vaccination coverage rather than vaccine efficacy, but it's still relevant to understanding global vaccination efforts.

Lastly, Doc 5 is from the Virginia Department of Health and delves into how vaccine effectiveness is calculated. It explains the concept using a 2x2 table and provides formulas for calculating attack rates and vaccine effectiveness. It also references a CDC study that found COVID-19 vaccines to be highly effective against hospitalization but somewhat less effective against infection, especially with the Delta variant.

From these documents, I can see that vaccine efficacy varies depending on the vaccine and the disease it's targeting. Some vaccines are highly effective, like the MMR vaccine for measles, while others, like the flu vaccine, have lower efficacy rates. Additionally, vaccine effectiveness can change in real-world settings due to various factors, including the emergence of new virus variants.

Given this information, it's clear that vaccines are not 100% effective. There's always a chance that a vaccinated individual can still get the disease, although the risk is significantly lower compared to unvaccinated individuals. Moreover, vaccines are designed to reduce the severity of the disease, so even if someone who is vaccinated does get sick, they are less likely to experience severe symptoms or require hospitalization.

In conclusion, vaccines are highly effective but not perfectly so. Their efficacy and effectiveness can vary based on several factors, and they play a crucial role in controlling the spread of infectious diseases when used in conjunction with other public health measures.
