I've noticed that used car prices have been rising lately, and I'm curious about why that's happening. I remember that in general, supply and demand play a big role in pricing, but there must be more to it, especially since it's specifically used cars that are getting pricier. Maybe there's something going on with the new car market that's affecting used car prices too. Or perhaps there are external factors like economy or regulations that are playing a part. I need to think this through step by step.

First off, let's consider the basic economics of supply and demand. If there's high demand for used cars and a limited supply, prices will go up. So, is there a surge in demand for used cars? Well, used cars are often more affordable than new ones, so maybe more people are opting for used cars due to economic reasons, like job losses or reduced income from the pandemic. But actually, I've heard that new car sales have also been strong recently, so maybe people have more disposable income now. That seems a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a shortage in the supply of used cars. Could car auctions be selling fewer cars, or are more people hanging onto their used cars instead of selling them? Or perhaps there's an issue with imports of used cars from other countries. I'm not sure about that.

Another factor could be the condition of the used cars. If there are more high-quality used cars available, that might drive up prices because they are in better shape and have lower mileage. But again, I don't know if that's the case currently.

Let me think about the new car market. I know that there have been chip shortages affecting new car production. Many car manufacturers rely on semiconductor chips for various functions in modern cars, and the global chip shortage has led to production delays and fewer new cars being manufactured and sold. So, if there are fewer new cars available, people might be turning to used cars as an alternative, increasing the demand for used cars and thereby driving up their prices.

That makes sense, but I wonder if that's the only reason. Maybe there are other aspects at play here. For example, the economy has been improving, and people have more confidence in spending on big-ticket items like cars. So, both new and used car demand might be high, but if new car supply is constrained, used car prices could be rising more significantly.

Also, interest rates are still relatively low, which makes borrowing money to buy a car more attractive. That could be another factor boosting demand for both new and used cars.

Furthermore, during the pandemic, many people avoided public transportation and opted for private vehicles to minimize exposure to the virus. This could have increased the overall demand for cars, including used ones.

On the supply side, the chip shortage not only affects new car production but might also impact the availability of used cars. For instance, if dealerships are holding onto used cars to repair them with scarce chips, that could reduce the immediate supply of used cars on the market.

Additionally, some used cars might be getting older and requiring more repairs, which could decrease their appeal and potentially affect pricing. But I'm not sure about that.

Maybe I should look into the average age of used cars being sold. If the average age is increasing, that could indicate that newer used cars are in shorter supply, which might drive up their prices.

Another angle to consider is the impact of rental car companies on the used car market. During the pandemic, many rental car companies reduced their fleets, and some of those cars entered the used car market. However, as travel has picked up, rental companies might be buying back used cars to rebuild their fleets, which could be sucking up supply and driving up prices.

Moreover, there's the issue of vehicle depreciation. Normally, used cars depreciate over time, but if there's high demand and low supply, depreciation might slow down or even reverse, leading to increasing used car prices.

I also recall that some states have changed their emissions standards, which could affect the used car market. If certain used cars no longer meet emissions requirements, that could reduce the supply of used cars that can be sold in those areas, thereby driving up prices.

Wait, but that might be more relevant to specific regions rather than a broad trend.

Perhaps I should consider the impact of online marketplaces and used car subscription services. These platforms make it easier for people to buy and sell used cars, which could increase demand by making the process more convenient.

But I'm not sure if that's a significant enough factor to cause notable price increases.

Maybe I need to look at the data on used car sales and pricing to get a better understanding. Are there any recent statistics or reports on this topic that I can refer to?

Hmm, perhaps I can look up industry reports or news articles that discuss used car price trends.

Let me try to search for "used car prices increasing reasons" to see what comes up.

Used-Car Prices Are Surging - Consumer Reports
How to Navigate Surging Used-Car Prices
Used-car price increases are helping to drive the nation's rising inflation rate, according to government data
By Benjamin Preston

Used-car prices have continued their steady upward climb this year as new-car shortages put increased pressure on the used market. The most recent Consumer Price Index report, from August, shows that prices were up almost 32 percent over a year earlier, and a major used-car retailer tells us that prices have crept upward each month this year.
“We continue to see an upward trend in average used listings prices,” says Nick Woolard, an analyst at TrueCar, a Consumer Reports partner that tracks industry trends and provides a platform for auto listings. “In October, our average used list price is $31,676, which is up 29 percent compared to a year earlier.”
Woolard says that current used car prices are 42 percent higher than they were in the first quarter of 2020, before the pandemic caused widespread closures and market disruptions. The price increase has helped drive an overall rise in the nation’s inflation rate.
Lauren Donaldson, senior director of accounts at PureCars, a consultancy that advises dealerships on marketing strategies, says consumer searches for used cars are double what they were a year ago. That means the cars are being sold a lot faster. She advises that shoppers move quickly if they see a car they like.
“The silver lining for consumers is that even though prices are higher, your trade-in will never be worth more than it is today, and that may put you in a better position to purchase a newer car,” Donaldson says.
In good times and bad, Consumer Reports members can search our Used Car Marketplace for vehicles for sale in their area, sorting by the factors that matter most. The listings include CR reliability and owner satisfaction ratings, and there’s a free Carfax report for most of the vehicles. Members can also access ratings and information on used vehicles going as far back as 20 years.

CR's Used Car Marketplace
The relatively high price of used cars was pushing many buyers toward new cars a few months ago, but now that a global semiconductor shortage has prompted many automakers to slow or pause production, new cars are more scarce.
Now even rental car companies—many of which sold off vehicles during the pandemic last year when car rentals and travel in general plummeted—are buying used cars just to bring their fleets back in line with rising demand.
The widely watched Consumer Price Index surged 5.4 percent in June compared with one year ago, the government said Tuesday, resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years. That follows an average inflation rate of just 1.4 percent last year, when the COVID-19 pandemic kept many people at home.
Donaldson says that as demand has surged for SUVs and trucks, dealers are more likely to negotiate over the price of sedan models, which have waned in popularity over the past several years. CR has found that typically, sedans tend to be more fuel-efficient than SUVs of equivalent size.
Check CR’s used-sedan ratings and reviews.
Although used-car prices are rising faster than new car prices, experts say the spike is a double-edged sword. Dealers are trying to snap up as many used cars as they can to satisfy customer demand, and that means you can get top dollar if you’re looking to sell or trade in.
Donaldson says that dealers are most keen on finding cars under 2 years old and that the 3- to 5-year range is the next most sought-after.
CR experts say that regardless of prices, the bottom line is that you should make a deal when the time is right for you. If it’s now, you can leverage your trade-in to get the best deal possible. If you decide to wait, know that future pricing is hard to predict, especially when global supply chain problems plague automakers.
Chip Shortage
The semiconductor shortage has put a pinch on the supply of microchip processors automakers need for new cars—the chips control everything on a car from infotainment screens to window motors. It’s the main culprit behind the current tightness in the new- and used-car markets, multiple experts say.
The chip problem is compounded by a year’s worth of pent-up demand from people who are starting to venture out again as the worst days of the pandemic appear to have passed, says Woolard.
“Experts are expecting this to drag on to the fall, and as far as where consumers can go for alternatives, there aren’t a whole lot of options,” he says. “Anyone who’s waiting for prices to come down might be waiting for a while.”
“If you need a car right now, they’re expensive, and unfortunately, all signs point to prices continuing to increase,” Woolard says. “It’s a great time to trade or sell a used vehicle—used vehicles are going up in value, and that doesn’t happen that often.”
The market will calm down eventually, but it may take some time. So if you want to buy now, do your research on current pricing and deals, and be open to considering several models to increase your chance of scoring significant savings.

Here at Auto Trader, we publish something called the Retail Price Index which tracks changes to car prices. In August, we found that used car prices went up by 17.2%. That’s the third month in a row we’ve seen record price increases, but why exactly are cars getting more expensive?
Global shortages
It’s all about supply and demand. Right now, there's a global shortage of new cars being built, caused by the crises we’ve been through in recent times. Delays in the production of new cars mean that used cars are in higher demand, which is great news if you’re looking to sell your used car, but not so great if you’re looking to buy one.
Car factories have had to slow down production or even stop altogether whilst they wait for the microchips they need for modern cars to be built, and so car companies are prioritising the cars that make the most money and shelving their older models.

Essentially, car companies are being forced to adopt the Ferrari business strategy – sell fewer cars than the market demands, causing customers to pay more with longer wait times.
Cars in production
Other factors increasing car prices
Europe can be a difficult place to do business in. With new technology comes new legislation, so legislation is being updated all the time and it becomes tougher to price cars profitably.
New cars must pass even tougher crash tests, come fitted with on-board sim cards to make emergency calls and from next year they even have to come standard fitted with cameras to read speed limit signs with the aim of slowing you down. The rising costs associated with new automotive legislation leads to a rise throughout the whole industry.

The rise of electric cars has automatically bumped up the price of new cars too. Electric car batteries aren’t cheap and unfortunately at the moment the UK isn’t doing a whole lot to reduce the bill with incentives, unless you’re a company car driver. 

Let’s also not forget that cut-throat competition amongst brands played a huge role in keeping prices incredibly low over the years. Take a brand new Golf R for example – once upon a time you could lease one for £200 a month.
Will car prices drop?
As the lingering side-effects of the Pandemic wear off, we’re expecting the shortage in microchips and other materials to be tackled, so we’re surely going to see an increase in production.
Only time will tell, but as always, AutoTrader is here to help you find the right deal for you. Our price indicator is a quick and easy way to compare prices of cars against similar ones on the market, and our price rating is based on how the seller’s asking price compares to our AutoTrader valuation, so you can be sure you’re getting the most out of your money.

How the Used Car Market is Contributing to Inflation

The increasing prices of used cars and trucks are being blamed in part for a soaring inflation rate, according to The Economist. In fact, figures released earlier this year indicate that American consumer-price inflation hit 4.2% year-on-year in April, which is reportedly the highest rate since 2008.
In May, the annual inflation rate rose even higher, to 5%—and as The Economist reports, about one-third of May’s overall month-to-month increase came from the appreciating value of used cars.
What does this mean and why is it happening this year? Let’s take a closer look at the facts and figures.
The increasing prices of used cars
The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures indicate that the prices of used cars and trucks have increased 30% over the past year, but many in the auto industry reportedly believe that’s an underestimate.
In fact, Manheim, the largest used-car auction business in the U.S., suggests in its latest index of second-hand values that prices have actually increased by 48% over the past year, rising by 5% just between April and May.
Pickup trucks have especially increased in sales, rising by 70% in just a year. Many people in the U.S. are reporting they are selling their used cars for a profit.
The Department of Labor also reported that car and truck rentals increased by 87.7% in one year, according to CNBC.
In addition to price increases in used cars and car rentals, other areas that have seen increased prices include public transportation (including airline fares) and hotels.

There are a few factors contributing to increases in used car and car rental prices.
In the summer of 2020, many Americans stayed home during the pandemic. This year, more people are venturing out of their home for the first time in months, so demand for car and rentals is increasing, meaning prices have skyrocketed, according to CNBC.
There has also been a global shortage in auto parts and components that has contributed to price increases and a soar in demand. As the economist points out, drivers have more to spend with stimulus checks from the government, and for those who don’t, car loans are cheaper than before.
Without increases in used cars, new cars, lodging and transportation services, the core consumer price index would only have increased .18% month over month, which is fairly normal, according to CNBC. It just goes to show the impact car sales and rentals are having on the economy.

CNBC also reports that according to Bank of America economists, we may currently be at the peak of used-car prices. The increase in sticker prices for consumers has now gone beyond the jump in wholesale used car prices—which did start to moderate last month.
MarketWatch points out that as the car computer chip shortage eases and car manufacturers boost production, a lot of the recent upward pressure on U.S. inflation will also go away.
But still, the costs of goods and services are on the rise. The high cost of gas, groceries and planes may still be impacting consumers and household budgets through the end of the year.

Used Car Prices Have Increased 30 Percent
By Matt Posky on June 7, 2021
Tweet
We’ve been covering the staggering increase of automobile pricing all year, starting with the second-hand surge created by rental industries sucking up used models to replace all the vehicles they dumped during the pandemic. A year of suppressed demand and prolonged restrictions absolutely crippled supply chains and placed the automotive sector in an extremely difficult position going into 2021. We wish we could say things were improving but the most heartening news we’ve come across was the possibility that select manufacturers might soon have a line on semiconductor chips — hopefully encouraging new vehicle production.
0 seconds of 1 minute, 4 seconds Volume 0%
But the used market is still heading into uncharted waters. According to data collected by CarGurus , the typical price for a used automobile increased by about 30 percent against this time last year. Though more worrying is how much of that spike is consolidated within the last 90 days.
While no segment or brand has managed to avoid price inflations, used pickup trucks saw the largest increases with today’s average transaction swelling to 44.21 percent larger against 2020 rates. The rest hovered between 15 and 31 percent, with rates depending almost entirely on the popularity of the body style. Electric vehicles also saw an increase in value on the secondhand market, despite having one of the worst deprecation curves imaginable. Still, most data sheets we saw had used EVs trading at prices only a few percentage points higher (e.g. 6 percent for Tesla) than they would have been this time in 2020 while minivans had gone up in value by 22 percent.
While the list has some defunct brands (e.g. Saturn) seeing huge boosts in valuation, it’s likely more useful to keep tabs on existing brands. High-volume companies seemed to see the largest increases in pricing and pickup-centric nameplates tended to be at the top of the curve. Secondhand Ram, Ford, GMC, and Chevrolet products were all trading ownership at rates over 37 percent higher than this period in 2020. So was Aston Martin, which isn’t known for pickups and kind of mucks up the theory. The rest of the pack still saw sizable pricing increases over the same timeframe, with only premium Italian brands and Tesla managing to stay below double digits on the used market.
But not every study was as grim as the one furnished by CarGurus. Though it could be due to most of them not having figures from May and the pricing increase seemingly hitting the hardest over the last two months. In fact, valuations actually dipped slightly at the start of 2021 before commencing their ascension in the middle of March. We’ll be watching to see if outlets like iSeeCars and Cox Automotive paint a similar picture later this month.
Though we doubt they’ll be putting together a report that looks contrastingly sustainable. Pricing is getting out of control and if things don’t turn around soon, the big problem will be about things more immediate than how much money people are willing to spend on their next vehicle.

I bought a 2011 Ford Ranger 4×4 in September for $13,200. It had only 44,000 kilometers on the clock, so I figured I got a good deal. I sold in February for $16500. Now, I find out I could have gotten well over 20k for it so I’m kicking myself. Prices for trucks especially are going through the roof around here.

It isn’t the US consumers that are buying those vehicles and taking them home. It is the Canadian dealers who continue to ship their cars to the US wholesale auctions like they have always done with late model vehicles so some extent or another.

When I was shopping for an unusual pickup truck (2009-2013 Chevy Silverado Hybrid / GMC Sierra Hybrid), I was surprised by how many of the trucks I ran Carfax reports on had been owned by Canadians.
I’m really glad someone owned them, because I greatly prefer the hybrid driving experience in a pickup truck — and the one I bought cost about 25% of what I’d have to pay for a new F-150 Hybrid. Thank you, Canada!

A used car dealer acquaintance told me before COVID that the Americans were keeping his business alive. Another dealer told me that American business had driven prices up 30 percent and that Americans were “lined up to buy cars” at some outlets. Hearsay, I know.
I’m not sure how (or if) this affected prices after COVID, but it sure seemed to set the ball rolling.

Cars with mechanical speedo.
Canada – KPH

Scoutdude
June 7th, 2021 at 6:35 pm
Cars with digital odo have a way to switch between the two, either a dedicated button or in some menu. Most speedos are dual marked if the aren’t digital.
A 2010 Fusion we used to have was one of those lease returns imported from Canada. I did find that when the battery was disconnected it would default to metric upon rebooting but it took all of 10-15 seconds to go into the menu and switch it back.
Now back in the day part of the import process was to convert the speedo and there were shops that did that work. I ran across a couple years ago that had a sticker on the door jamb noting that the speedo had been changed upon importation per what ever federal regulation.

I think my C5 does the kph/mph elegantly. You hit the english/metric button and the backlight changes from mph to kph and the needle adjusts accordingly. No tiny numbers for one or the other and no digital nonsense.

I would think that current energy policy and increasing fuel price would lead to pickup/solid axle SUV prices go down while smaller, more efficient cars go up.

Again you don’t seem to understand how the world works. This isn’t about the price of fuel or energy policy it is about the gap between the haves and have-nots that increased during the pandemic and recovery.
In other words those with money still have money and they aren’t afraid to spend it. Meanwhile those in the middle that still have money are afraid to spend it and those that didn’t have much have less than before and are holding on to it.

@slavuta,
If all other things were equal, an increase in fuel prices would main a decrease in demand for large vehicles.
However, that’s not the case, because several things are changing at once:
* Vehicle supply is constrained due to the chip shortage. Even if demand shrinks, if supply shrinks more, the prices still go up.
* Work-from-home means people like me aren’t as concerned about MPG because commuting is no longer the main source of mileage. I’m an efficiency nerd and Hybrid/EV fan. However, I’m a member of the work-from-home class, and the fact that I don’t need to commute changes my requirements rather dramatically. Buying a GMT900 hybrid, instead of a small commuter car, ticks all of the boxes for me in WFH-world — because I use my vehicle mostly to haul people and stuff, rather than for commuting. I use much less gasoline than I did prior to WFH, even though I have a less efficient (but more capable) vehicle.
Your model would make a useful forecast if you could hold all other things equal. However, all other things are not equal. This stuff is as complicated as real life. Who knew?!?

As opposed to tradesmen and factory workers with physical presence required by job duties, yes, WFH workers are a different social class.
I am on my way to becoming a member of the Lounge Around At Home (LAAH) class – retired. My current work commute is from the bedroom to the living room to use a VPN to access a work computer and some months go by with only a few hundred miles added to car mileage. People like me should retard the price increases somewhat.

I’m not sure how much of this is due to actual price increases and how much is due to the have vs have not.
I’m guess it has a lot to do with the have vs have not increasing the ratio of near new used vehicles vs older used vehicles in the market place. Leases continued to end giving a reasonable supply of late model used cars. Meanwhile those in the middle are more likely to be holding pat and waiting things out. So the supply of the 5-6 year old trade ins is down. The fact that many people reduced the amount of miles driven also factor into this. Not only on the older used side where it helps people feel comfortable with standing pat but also on the lease return market where vehicles are getting turned in with much lower miles than expected giving them a boost in value.
To get the full picture we need to know how the average age, mileage and model/trim level has changed over the past year.
Yes used car prices are definitely up I’m just not so sure that those numbers reflect the increase of specific vehicles.

I’m skeptical. This spike in prices seems too broad, with prices up in every category. My own two newest vehicles—one late-model and low miles, one 5 years old with relatively high miles—have both appreciated substantially in the past three months according to KBB.
My read is that a combination of pent-up post-pandemic demand, rental companies snapping up all the late models they can get their hands on, and the chip shortage has just created a supply problem at the high end that reverberates all across the market.

I agree that in general it is basic supply vs demand economics, but I do think a lot of it is also due to a change in who is buying and selling and who isn’t buying and selling.
I’ve seen that a lot in Seattle area Real Estate. The number of ~$1m homes selling for cash is way up. Meanwhile in many lower price segments the ratio of vacant homes vs occupied homes has swung in favor of vacant homes. Some of it is people cashing out of rental properties. Some of it is due to those people who payed cash selling off their old home. However it is mostly due to people who need to sell to buy staying out of the game due to fear that they won’t be able to find a desirable replacement in a timely manner.

My mental model of this is that the following things are happening:
1) New car production is constrained due to the semiconductor shortage. New car prices go up.
2) Used car supplies are constrained, due to the lack of new cars turning into used cars. Used car prices go up.
The haves vs. have-nots issue is in play (have-nots buy used cars formerly owned by haves) for sure, but I think it’s only part of the story. If it were the whole story, the new car market would be mostly undisturbed.

Point #2 has been going on since 2014, everyone thought the lease glut 2012-15ish would eventually hit the market and bring a balance but it never really happened.
I mostly agree on Point #1 but a percentage of it is a complete lack of oversight on the financing companies. How about, no you can’t sell a 96 month loan on a *vehicle*. If someone is going to sign a note for a 96 month car payment, they are not a qualified buyer; period. Given high demand, its not as if every unit is not going to be sold so by allowing that unqualified buyer to compete is adding to the competition of qualified buyers. Just like FHA 3% notes for 600 FICO in real estate, though they may not be as much of a problem these days.
96 month no joke, as low as 3.99% no less!
72 months back to MY12, which is now nine years old. How is that possible? Gosh I’ll finally have this paid off when its 15 years old, happy days!

The haves vs have nots certainly is not the only factor, the short supply of new is certainly a major influence on increasing new and used car prices.

Rumor keeps having it that the rental companies are also buying up A LOT of available very-late-model used inventory, likely at desperation prices so they can honor a bunch of upcoming full-price reservations. That and the chip shortage alone are almost enough IMO to explain current market conditions.

Interesting. This inspired me to go get a Vroom quote on my Highlander and it is $2000 above KBB. If I didn’t have next month’s road trip scheduled it would honestly be tempting to jump on it and just have the Bolt for a while, then buy another second car when the market gets more reasonable. They are apparently desperate for cars.

We just gave our daughter our C-Max Energi and have our fingers crossed that things will get more reasonable in the not too distant future and we will replace it then. Just makes sense with the daughter back to in person work and driving ~400mi per week vs the ~500mi per month we had been putting on it.

I looked up the private party values of our fleet at kbb.com. The Infiniti and the Focus are up a bit. What surprised me was the seven-year-old AWD Sienna LE. It’s worth nearly $20k!
The best way to help alleviate the shortage is to hang onto what you already own for another year or two. I was thinking about replacing the Infiniti this fall with either a Tesla Model 3 Long Range or a VW Golf R. If I do, it will be fall of 2022, not 2021.

New car dealer lots near me are draining inventory. Seems like the upstream material shortages are starving the factories and the dealers, so people go and buy used, thus driving up used prices.
Can someone say if ATPs are up on new cars? I’d imagine that new car dealers aren’t going to negotiate much with high demand across the board.
All of this is why I’m willing to fix my older cars, and why I might just buy out my lease. I can keep it for less than its trade-in value.

Other factors are also in play in the rising prices for used vehicles. 2020 had a very minimal usage of cars. If you had a 3 year lease thats ending now, in reality you only have 2 years worth of mileage on it, so it’s worth more, and priced accordingly. Also, I have friends whose car leases are coming due, but with so low mileage on the car and an increase in new car prices (plus sometimes unavailability of what you want), they are buying the vehicle. This means fewer lease returns for sale on the lots. Also there was/is a savings in maintenance. I recently had a lot of time related work done on my 17 year old Lexus and the dealer was not very busy and was very willing to haggle over prices.

You’d almost think that abruptly turning off great swaths of the just in time economy in combination with banana republic level money printing had consequences.
I got lunch across the street from the Ford dealership this afternoon. They had three new trucks on the entire lot, two of them were 80 000 dollars and the third a 55000 dollar extended cab. Used is stupid expensive because used is all that’s left.

I’ve never crunched the numbers but there is probably a ratio between different vehicle classes and their new equivalents. My guess is those ratios have all increased by a factor of at least one in part because they track against new car prices. Since I only expect new vehicle prices to increase, these wholesale figure should only increase and even if there is an equilibrium with new car pricing I doubt used wholesale will fall back to the previous ratios. This will be because everyone will be sitting on expensive used inventory and won’t be able to absorb the fall… so they simply won’t be selling them which will perpetuate the used supply shortage.
This is basically what happened later last summer and fall, anyone (dealers) who bought in late May/June/July was really sitting on too highly priced inventory. So what happened? Many didn’t sell and that’s when I first started hearing about dealers not being able to source inventory. This is only going to get worse, the only thing which might pop a hole in this bubble would be for interest rates to rise. I don’t see JPow or Mr. Yellen allowing this to happen. Maybe they could engineer a fail of one of the sub-subprime banks which would spook them and then market rates could rise? Not a silver bullet but could cool the inflation down maybe for a time.
Build back better, comrades! I don’t expect this “chip shortage” to be resolved until the Fall (or perhaps Summer) of 2024. Hopefully the other Biden shortages are a distant memory before then. Oil will be the interesting commodity to see if there is a “shortage” of. I do think if they pull the lever on it, food would follow, and then we’re looking at the scenario many including I feared in early 2020. I really, really hope these psychopaths realize if they go too far it will be not years but decades of recovery.

Not resolved until Summer 2024? Oh, come on. It’s like the same alarmist nonsense when people were saying we wouldn’t have a vaccine for 3-4 years.
Guess what? When business interests are at stake, people come up with some pretty impressive solutions to seemingly intractable problems. I give it another 6-12 months max until we see headlines like “What ever happened to the so-called chip shortage?”
And it’s quaint when people blame shortages on Biden, as if global geopolitical and economic trends suddenly change course when a new American president takes office. By your logic, I guess then it’s fair to call it Trump’s virus and blame those 500k deaths on him, right?

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger:
“Lesley Stahl: I’m wondering, if we’re going to continue to have shortages, not just in cars, but in our phones and for our computers, for everything?
Pat Gelsinger: I think we have a couple of years until we catch up to this surging demand across every aspect of the business.”

“Guess what? When business interests are at stake, people come up with some pretty impressive solutions to seemingly intractable problems. I give it another 6-12 months max until we see headlines like “What ever happened to the so-called chip shortage?””
I said the same thing, and logically in say a 12 month time period it should show signs of progress. So this started in the fall of last year, so Q4 would be approaching a year and maybe we will be saying, “gee, that chip shortage was no big deal”. I’m thinking given who is in power, that won’t be happening but I hope I am wrong.
“And it’s quaint when people blame shortages on Biden, as if global geopolitical and economic trends suddenly change course when a new American president takes office. ”
Really now? So when I had to hear “Trump’s fault” for four years the actors needed to realize global geopolitical and economic trends do not suddenly change course when a new American president takes office? Funny, I don’t recall that occurring. Here’s hoping the Biden shortages will dissipate in a few months, but I must confess I am a tad cynical on that actually occurring.
“I guess then it’s fair to call it Trump’s virus and blame those 500k deaths on him, right?”
Well I would expect as such from the brainwashed masses, despite the fact it originated in the PRC and the PRC *did nothing* to stop the flow of it out of their country. Oh and the true number of direct COVID deaths in 2020 will never be known, so you may as well attribute every death of the year to it because those figures are transitory after all.

Why are used car prices increasing?
Why have used Audi Q7 gone up in price in the last year or so?
Asked on 24 May 2021 by Gordon Maclean
Answered by Andrew Brady
We don't have exact figures but have seen a steady increase in used car prices across the board. Car dealers have been closed during the various lockdowns, which has led to fewer new cars being sold and a decline in the number of used cars being part exchanged. Combine that with an increase in demand for used cars (people are treating themselves to a used car rather than a holiday, or swapping their expensive lease cars for more affordable used models) and prices are up. A car like the Audi Q7 is likely to be popular with staycationers, too – it's a big, comfortable SUV that'll be ideal for driving a family to Scotland or Cornwall.

<|end_search_result|>

Alright, so I've got these search results, and I need to make sense of why used car prices are going up. Let's see what these articles are saying.

First, from Consumer Reports, it mentions that used car prices have been steadily increasing, with an almost 32% increase over a year. They attribute this partly to new car shortages due to the global semiconductor shortage, which has reduced the supply of new cars. Because of this, people are turning to used cars, increasing demand and driving up prices. Also, rental car companies are buying used cars to rebuild their fleets as travel picks up, which further reduces the supply of used cars available to the general public.

The second article from AutoTrader talks about global shortages affecting car production, leading to higher used car prices. It mentions that car companies are prioritizing the production of more profitable models and shelving older ones due to chip shortages. This has created a situation similar to Ferrari's business strategy, where limited supply drives up prices and increases wait times. Additionally, new automotive legislation and the rise of electric cars are increasing production costs, which trickles down to used car prices.

The third article from GetJerry.com connects the increase in used car prices to inflation. It states that used car and truck prices have increased by 30% over the past year, contributing significantly to the overall inflation rate. The article suggests that stimulus checks and cheaper car loans have increased consumers' spending power, while the global shortage of auto parts has restricted supply, leading to higher prices.

The fourth article from The Truth About Cars reports a 30% increase in used car prices year-over-year, with pickup trucks seeing the largest increases at 44.21%. The article attributes this to suppressed demand during the pandemic followed by a surge in demand as restrictions eased, combined with prolonged supply chain issues, particularly the semiconductor shortage. It also mentions that used electric vehicles have seen price increases, despite their typical high depreciation rates.

The fifth article from Honest John is a Q&A where a user asks why used Audi Q7 prices have increased. The response suggests that the closure of car dealers during lockdowns led to fewer new car sales and fewer used cars being traded in. At the same time, there's been an increase in demand for used cars as people are opting for them instead of holidays or swapping expensive leased cars for more affordable used ones. The Audi Q7, being a large, comfortable SUV, is particularly attractive for family trips.

Okay, so synthesizing these sources, several key factors are contributing to the rise in used car prices:

1. **Semiconductor Shortage:** This is a major issue affecting new car production globally. Since new car supply is constrained, more people are turning to used cars, increasing demand and driving up prices.

2. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Beyond just semiconductors, general supply chain issues have impacted the automotive industry, leading to production delays and shortages.

3. **Increased Demand:** With economies reopening and people having more disposable income from stimulus checks, there's higher demand for vehicles, both new and used. Additionally, some people are choosing to buy used cars instead of traveling, as mentioned in the Honest John article.

4. **Rental Car Companies Rebuilding Fleets:** Rental companies sold off many vehicles during the pandemic due to decreased travel, and now they're buying back used cars to rebuild their fleets, which reduces the supply available to individual buyers.

5. **Legislation and Technology Costs:** New automotive regulations and the shift towards electric vehicles are increasing production costs, which affects both new and used car prices.

6. **Limited Supply of Used Cars:** With fewer new cars being sold, there are fewer trade-ins entering the used car market, reducing the supply of used cars.

It's interesting to note that pickup trucks and SUVs are seeing some of the largest price increases, possibly due to their popularity for family trips and their utility.

Looking ahead, some experts suggest that used car prices may have peaked or will start to moderate as the semiconductor shortage eases and new car production increases. However, the timeline for this resolution is uncertain, with estimates ranging from a few months to over a year.

In conclusion, the combination of high demand for used cars and constrained supply due to production issues and reduced trade-ins is primarily driving the increase in used car prices. This situation is expected to persist until the underlying supply chain issues are resolved and new car production returns to normal levels.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Used car prices are increasing due to high demand and limited supply, exacerbated by the global semiconductor shortage affecting new car production, rental companies rebuilding their fleets, and economic factors like stimulus checks and low interest rates.}} \]
