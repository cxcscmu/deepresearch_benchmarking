So I'm trying to figure out when children usually start forming their own views. Like, at what age do kids begin to think for themselves and develop opinions that might differ from their parents or teachers. I'm not really sure about this, so I think I need to look it up.

First, I should probably define what I mean by "form their own views." I guess it means that children start to have their own thoughts, beliefs, and opinions about various things, whether it's about toys, friends, school, or bigger issues. It's not just mimicking what adults tell them but actually processing information and coming to their own conclusions.

I remember something about developmental stages in psychology, like Piaget's stages of cognitive development or maybe Erikson's stages of psychosocial development. Maybe one of these theories can help me understand when children start thinking independently.

Let me think about Piaget's theory. He divided cognitive development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. The formal operational stage is when adolescents start thinking abstractly and can consider hypotheses and think critically. So maybe that's around age 11 and up. But I think children start forming their own views earlier than that.

Wait, maybe I should look into Erikson's stages. He has a stage around adolescence called "identity vs. role confusion," where teens are figuring out their sense of self and personal values. That seems relevant, but again, it's during the teen years, and I feel like kids form their own views earlier.

Perhaps I need to consider social cognition or moral development. Kohlberg's stages of moral development describe how children develop moral reasoning over time. The preconventional stage is early childhood, where morality is based on avoiding punishment. Then the conventional stage in later childhood and adolescence, where morality is based on seeking approval and maintaining social order. Finally, the postconventional stage in adulthood, where morality is based on personal ethics and universal principles.

So, according to Kohlberg, children start to think about right and wrong beyond just obeying authority around the conventional stage, which is roughly ages 10 and up. But again, that seems a bit late for forming basic views on things.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this with these psychological theories. Maybe I should just think about everyday experiences. Like, when do kids start expressing preferences or disagreeing with adults?

I know that even toddlers can say "no" or express defiance, which might be a sign of developing independence in their thoughts. But I don't think that counts as forming their own views in a meaningful way.

Probably around preschool age, say 4 or 5 years old, children start to have more complex thoughts and can articulate their likes and dislikes, their friends, and perhaps simple opinions.

But I feel like there must be some research on this. Maybe I should look for studies on children's decision-making or perspective-taking abilities.

Let me try to search for when children form their own views.

How do children construct views of themselves?

How do children construct views of themselves?

How do children construct views of themselves and their place in the world? Children's social relationships turn out to be critical. For example, children develop higher self-esteem when their parents treat them warmly. But they develop lower self-esteem when their parents lavish them with inflated praise. These and other findings are included in a special section edited by Eddie Brummelman (University of Amsterdam) and Sander Thomaes (Utrecht University) and soon-to-be published in the journal Child Development. In a series of articles, now available online, the researchers share the results of research on the origins of the self-concept in children.
Who am I and what is my place in the world? Children are born without an answer to these pressing questions. As they grow up, though, they start to formulate answers seemingly effortlessly. Within a few years, they recognise themselves in the mirror, refer to themselves by their own name, evaluate themselves through the eyes of others and understand their standing in a social group.
Research by Christina Starmans from the University of Toronto shows that even toddlers have an idea of what it means to have a 'self." Young children see the self as something that is unique to a person, separate from the body, stable over time, and located within the head, behind the eyes. Research by Andrei Cimpian (New York University) and his colleagues shows that even toddlers have the cognitive ability to form self-worth (i.e., how satisfied they are with themselves as individuals).
Social relationships
Over time, pronounced individual differences arise in children's self-concept. Some children like themselves, whereas others feel negatively about themselves. Some children see themselves as superior and deserving special treatment, whereas others consider themselves to be on an equal plane with others. Some children believe they can grow and build their abilities, whereas others believe their abilities are fixed and unchangeable. Where do these individual differences come from? What leads children to see themselves the way they do? "Surprisingly little is known about the origins of children's self-concept," says Brummelman. "It is important that we shed more light on this important subject. With this collection of articles, our aim is to showcase emerging research on this subject."
"What these articles reveal is that children form their self-concept, at least in part, based on their social relationships," Brummelman continues. For example, research by Michelle Harris (University of California) and her team shows that children develop higher self-esteem when they receive warmth from their parents. Warm parents show an interest in their children's activities and share joy with them, which makes children feel noticed and valued. Brummelman's own research shows that children may develop lower self-esteem and sometimes even narcissism when their parents give them lots of extremely positive, inflated praise, such as "Wow, you did incredibly well! Such inflated praise may give children a sense of grandiosity but at the same time also make them worry about falling short of the standards set for them.
Encouragement
Previous research has shown the importance of having a growth mindset – the belief that you can develop your skills through effort and education. Children with a growth mindset are eager to take on challenges, persist when the going gets tough, and see failure as opportunities for growth. In a theoretical article, Kyla Haimovitz and Carol Dweck (Stanford University) describe how parents can foster a growth mindset by praising children for effort instead of ability (for example, "You worked so hard!") and by teaching children that failure isn't harmful but actually benefits learning and growth. Parents can encourage children to ask themselves: why did I get such a low grade, and what can I do differently in future?
All 10 articles in the special section study various dimensions of children's self-concept, including self-esteem, self-compassion, mindsets and self-perceived ability. "What these articles show is that children construct their self-concept based on the social relationships they have, the feedback they receive, the social comparisons they make, and the cultural values they endorse. This underlines the deeply social nature of children 's self-concept," says Brummelman.

I've been reading many things about educating morality into a child.
This question is great but does not deal with the age issue.
My question is, at what age are children generally most active in developing their moral compass? I'm sure helping your child develop in the right way is something that starts at birth and continues every day that you are both alive. However, I suspect that there is some age at which moral development is more pronounced.
Does anyone know what that magical age is?

Just like other developmental milestones, there is no "magic age" where a switch is flipped, and your child can suddenly understand moral issues.
Research on this subject with young children has shown that preschool age (3-5 years) is when children first start to understand the distinction between moral issues and social conventions[1].  However, children may still fail to understand nuanced social/moral issues until their teenage years.  At this young age, children view morality as an absolute set of rules, rather than a fungible concept, which they begin to develop when they learn abstract thinking in their early teen years.
Children learn morality by example from parents and teachers, and through habits those authority figures instill in them[2].  These habits start forming at birth.  A child as young as two may display "moral" behavior, but they likely cannot understand the distinction, and are simply engaging instilled habits.
If your goal is to raise moral children, then, starting from birth, you should model moral behavior around them.  Initially, children will view all your behavior in the same light, but they will come to distinguish between morals and social conventions based on observations and habit.
Importantly, those behaviors that you are casual about will come to be seen as social convention rather than morality.  For example, if you lie to people in front of your child, but expect that your child will always tell you the truth, then your child will learn truth-telling as a social convention to be obeyed in certain social situation (between family members, but not necessarily outside the family), not a moral one.

Morals starts with habits, and a child starts forming habits the moment they are born.
If they cry and get everything they want, it doesn't necessarily give them a particular moral rule, but it will affect how their morals will end up.

I do not know how or when all morals develop, but here is what I know about two.
Empathy:
As soon as you are born you are taught empathy or not to have empathy through your parents.  It is important to note, with regards to environmental adaptation, that a child born into a very dangerous and violent society would have trouble surviving and reproducing if it is taught to empathize.  It would get taken advantage of and be ridiculed as weak.  Likewise, a child with no empathy will have trouble surviving and reproducing in an empathy-based society because it would likely end up removed in one way or another.  The parents are a good evolutionary shortcut to what the child needs to survive in the current environment.
Honesty:
3-5 years old is when kids usually learn that someone can lie, and usually start trying it themselves.
A guideline I have learned: If they hold you to a rule, they are now bound by that rule.  If you are breaking the rules, they will learn to ignore them just as you do.
Ultimately, kids will learn moral and immoral behavior from their parents, peers, and others that spend time with them.  If kids are constantly lying, usually someone is constantly lying to them, or avoiding certain issues in my experience.  Ignoring is, in a sense, a form of lying, in that someone knows something is happening but is pretending that they do not.  In other words, ignoring the truth.  I have experienced this firsthand.  Lying children with parents lying to them.  When I pointed out the truth I was attacked by someone in my "family".  Fun.
Response to Erica's comment under Nelson's answer.  Kids, particularly before the age of 5, will 100% be affected by all choices made by the parents that involve them in any way.  Of course it will shape them.  Parents have full responsibility for their kids' development unless there are extreme circumstances such as full brain dysfunction.  If they hang out around the parents, their mind is imprinted with those interactions.  If they hang out at daycare, their minds will be imprinted by those interactions. It is well known that brains absorb, and that children are 100% dependent on their parents.

Early Childhood Moral Development - Child Development & Parenting: Early (3-7)
Early Childhood Moral Development
Angela Oswalt, MSW
Morality is our ability to learn the difference between right or wrong and understand how to make the right choices. As with other facets of development, morality doesn't form independently from the previous areas we have been discussing. Children's experiences at home, the environment around them, and their physical, cognitive, emotional, and social skills influence their developing sense of right vs. wrong.
Between the ages of 2 and 5, many children start to show morally-based behaviors and beliefs. For example, Tasha may see Juan take the blocks out of Tyler's hands and say, "Juan! You're gonna get in trouble!" At this point, many young children also start to show empathy-based guilt when they break the rules. For example, if Juan from the above example sees Tyler cry because his blocks were stolen, Juan might start feeling somewhat bad that he hurt Tyler's feelings. As a younger child, however, Juan would feel badly only if he was punished for taking the blocks rather than making someone else sad.
According to Piaget, children between the ages of 5 and 10 see the world through a Heteronomous Morality. In other words, children think that authority figures such as parents and teachers have rules that young people must follow absolutely. Rules are thought of as real, unchangeable guidelines rather than evolving, negotiable, or situational. As they grow older, develop more abstract thinking, and become less self-focused, children become capable of forming more flexible rules and applying them selectively for the sake of shared objectives and a desire to co-operate.
Developmental psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg built on Piaget's work to create his theory of the Stages of Moral Understanding. According to Kohlberg, young children at this age base their morality on a punishment and obedience orientation. Much like Piaget, Kohlberg believed that young children behave morally because they fear authority and try to avoid punishment. In other words, little kids follow the rules because they don't want to get in trouble. It's too much to expect preschool-aged children to automatically "do the right thing". However, most young children can understand the difference between "good" and "bad" behavior, and this understanding provides the basis for more complicated moral thinking in the future.
Contemporary research has provided us with additional information about how young children understand morals. Children between the ages 5 and 6 typically think in terms of distributive justice, or the idea that material goods or "stuff" should be fairly shared. In other words, everyone should get his or her exact "fair share." For example, Sally may think that it's only fair if each child gets exactly 2 cookies and the same amount of milk in their glass. Other factors, such as need or effort, are not considered. Sally wouldn't think that Susie should get an additional cookie because her lunch fell on the floor. By age 6 or 7, children begin to consider what people have earned or worked for when thinking about distributive justice. Children can also reason that some people should get more because they worked harder. For example, Jane begins to understand that Jill should earn a bigger prize because she sold more Girl Scout cookies.

Egocentrism Starts in Childhood
Egocentrism Starts in Childhood
Egocentrism is a stage in a child’s development, usually from the ages of four to seven, which is characterized by a lack of awareness of different points of view other than one’s own. It is a self-absorbed stage of development where a child has not yet learned that things can be, and are, different from his own interpretations of them. For example, a child knows what a ball is, and he knows that the ball is round. He sees the round moon in the sky and concludes that it, too, is a ball.
Jean Piaget
Jean Piaget was a developmental biologist, well known for closely observing and recording the intellectual abilities of infants, children and adolescents. According to Piaget, egocentrism in childhood is the belief that everyone thinks alike. During this stage of development, children think that the entire world has the same outlook, feelings and wishes about life that they do. They believe that not only is the world created for them, but that they can control it.
Most egocentric thinking is self-centered. Piaget’s interpretation is that a child in this stage of development has difficulty understanding life from any perspective other than his own. During this phase, a child is very “me” oriented. Piaget also referred to this phase as the pre-operational stage of life.
Me! Me! Me!
By age four a child has enough command of language to carry on a conversation, but the conversation will likely be all about himself and what he is doing. For instance, if a child has a certain toy and is talking with another child while playing, no matter what the other child may say, every answer the first child gives will be about the toy he is playing with. It is as if he does not even hear the other child talking. He is only concerned with what interests him at the moment.
Egocentrism also encompasses additional phases of early childhood development. There is realism, which is the confusion of the objective and the subjective, animism, the confusion of animate and inanimate objects, and artificialism, the confusion of human-generated activities with natural causes. These forms of egocentrism display the inability to differentiate the subjective from the objective. A child will apply subjective ideas onto external objects. They are unable to relate to others except from their own perspective, and they change objective ideas into their own subjective worlds.
Moving On
After age seven, children begin to understand that different people have different points of view from their own. A child who is still exhibiting egocentric behavior may be asked to go out and pick certain flowers of certain colors, but will return with only the flowers that interest him. After age seven, a child who is given the same directions will likely return with the flowers requested; he is beginning to understand that there are different points of view to the same topic.
But though egocentrism is usually considered to be a stage in early cognitive development, such thinking may not entirely disappear, even in later periods of development. Even as an adult, narcissism is somewhat related to egocentrism in that a narcissist wants the whole world to be about him.

The Moral Development of Right & Wrong With Children
Morality is an often studied subject in the field of psychology, and scientists often wonder when and how morality develops in children 1 ⭐. Some aspects of moral development, such as apathy, are present even around birth, while other phases, such as making decisions, happen later in a child’s life 2 ⭐. There are a few key theories that point to moral development of right and wrong in children, which just might explain a child’s behavior 2 ⭐.
Piaget's Theory
Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget’s theory is perhaps the most simple and breaks down moral development into two key stages 2 ⭐. Between the ages of 5 and 10 years, children are directed by a “heteronomous” morality, meaning they see things in black and white, and see rules as absolute. Children often see their parents or teachers as godlike authority figures, and they must obey the rules their elders set forth; breaking the rules often lead to negative consequences. From age 10 through adolescence, children start seeing things through other people’s perspectives and use a more “autonomous” or self-directed form of morality. While children still want to follow rules, they see that they can bend the rules or negotiate with them.
Kohlberg's Stages
Developmental psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg expanded upon Piaget’s theory 1 ⭐. He discerned that children first display “preconventional” moral reasoning, meaning they pick up on rules passed through society; for example, young children learn it is wrong to steal a toy from their friend. While children learn the rules, they often follow them because they want to avoid punishment. During age 10 to 12, children learn “ideal reciprocity,” which is the idea of fairness. They see things from another viewpoint and also realize how some rules are concrete, such as “thou shalt not kill,” while others are flexible, such as the idea that obedience to parents is more important to one culture than another. As a child continues to get older, he continues his realization of fairness; he becomes less selfish and begins to attend to the needs of others in his family or circle of friends.
Brofenbrenner's Theory
While Piaget and Kohlberg focused more on internal concepts like a child’s emotions and cognitive understanding, Brofenbrenner centered more on social constructs and how the environment influences moral development 2 ⭐. Family traditions, religious training, and cultural influences teach children the difference between right and wrong. Children learn how to make decisions or act based on lessons their parents teach them. For example, if a child is taught by her mother that it’s wrong to take something unless it is expressly given or paid for, she will continue to hold this way of thinking throughout her life.
Considerations
Moral development is likely a balance of both internal and external factors, and it progresses throughout life 2 ⭐. Psychology Today suggests that empathy, or the ability to understand another person’s emotions, begins at birth; empathy is one of the first steps towards moral development because it urges people to do the right thing 2 ⭐. Young children then begin to learn rules and comprehend consequences, and the idea of “good” and “bad” is something even toddlers understand. Even as a child gains greater cognitive abilities and can “think for himself,” he will often take on the concepts of morality passed on to him through his family and the other people in his environment.

Alright, so I've got some information from these documents. Let's see what they say about when children form their own views.

From Doc 1, it talks about how children construct views of themselves and their place in the world, and that social relationships are critical in this process. It mentions that even toddlers can have an idea of what it means to have a self and that by preschool age, around 4 or 5, children start to have more complex thoughts and can articulate their likes and dislikes.

Doc 2 is from a parenting stack exchange and discusses the age at which a child's moral compass forms. It says that there isn't a specific age, but that moral development starts from birth and continues every day. It mentions that preschool age, 3-5 years, is when children start to understand the distinction between moral issues and social conventions. So, it seems like around preschool age, children begin to grasp some moral concepts.

Doc 3 talks about early childhood moral development, specifically between ages 2 and 5. It says that children start showing morally-based behaviors and beliefs during this time. For example, a child might scold another for bad behavior, expecting punishment. Around age 5 to 10, children see rules as absolute and set by authority figures, and they try to avoid punishment by following these rules.

Doc 4 discusses egocentrism in childhood, which is a stage where children are self-absorbed and believe everyone thinks like them. This stage typically occurs from ages 4 to 7. It's interesting because it shows that children in this stage have difficulty understanding different perspectives, which might affect how they form their own views.

Doc 5 outlines theories of moral development by Piaget, Kohlberg, and Brofenbrenner. Piaget's theory divides moral development into heteronomous (ages 5-10) and autonomous (age 10 through adolescence) stages. Kohlberg expands on this, detailing stages from preconventional (focusing on avoiding punishment) to more advanced stages involving fairness and societal norms. Brofenbrenner emphasizes the role of the environment and social constructs in shaping moral development.

So, synthesizing this information, it seems that children begin to form their own views and understand moral concepts quite early, possibly as young as preschool age, around 3 to 5 years old. However, their understanding is rudimentary and egocentric, meaning they see things mostly from their own perspective. As they grow older, especially around age 10 and beyond, they start to consider others' perspectives and develop more nuanced moral reasoning.

But I'm still a bit unclear about when exactly children start to truly form their own views independently. Maybe I need to look for more specific information on this.

Let me try another search.

How to Foster Independence
Encouraging increased independence supports your child's social and intellectual development.
By Michelle Anthony, PhD
Ages
7-8
Around first or second grade, children begin seeking more independence. Suddenly, your child thinks his outfits aren’t “cool” enough, and wants to walk home alone and stay home when you bring his sister to dance. He wants to go to bed later, too. While some of these changes are welcome, others require a new way of interacting and a new level of vigilance as your child ventures further into the world.
Most children enter Piaget’s concrete operational stage at around age 7, which is marked by an ability to think abstractly and make rational judgments about concrete or observable phenomena. Children learn how to weigh pros and cons, preview actions, and internalize cause and effect — which are all skills that foster the drive for increased independence. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Education, children perform best when they maintain strong parental connection while simultaneously expressing differing points of view.
Fostering Independence
Children at this age want to — and need to! — make significant decisions. Instead of closely supervising your child’s every action, focus more on guiding decision-making and creating room for reflection and mistakes.  Some low-stakes ways to support independent choices include allowing your child to contribute to the shopping list and decide on family meals or outings. Allot a small budget for your child to purchase desired clothing or games, and encourage them to choose their own extracurricular activities. This increased sense of ownership — even a simple phone call to set up a play date — is vital to developing independence and responsibility.
5 Simple Starter Tips:
Set concrete limits. Your child’s safety trumps any desire for independence.
Present choices. This allows children increased independence, but still maintains parental authority.
Listen actively and ask questions. Let your child know it’s okay to take time to think through or preview potential outcomes. For example, what might happen if he forgets to lock his bike at school?
Your child should show indicators of responsibility and maturity along the way. Gaining independence and maturity is a gradual process. For example, allow your child to ride a bike to a neighbor’s house, then to ride around the neighborhood with buddies, and then to ride a bike to school with friends.
Remain unemotional, showing empathy rather than anger. Your child is not trying to make you angry or drive you crazy. By working together and becoming a team, you can support her natural and healthy developmental drives for independence.

Basil J. Zitelli MD, in Zitelli and Davis' Atlas of Pediatric Physical Diagnosis, 2018
Development of Logical Thinking
The preschool child has well-developed capabilities for mental representation and symbolic thinking. However, the dominance of sensory input, limited life experience, and a lack of formal education lead to a unique and charming logic during this period. Preschoolers often assume that all objects are alive like themselves. A car and a tricycle, for example, may be seen as alive, perhaps because they are capable of movement. Similarly, children claim that the moon follows them on an evening walk.
The logic of the preschooler is in large part influenced by the appearance of objects. Because an airplane appears to become smaller as it takes off, the preschooler may assume that all the people on the plane become smaller as well. Piaget demonstrated that preschoolers seem to think that number and quantity vary with appearance (Fig. 3.26 ). Under certain circumstances a 4-year-old child may show understanding that a quantity remains invariant unless something is added or subtracted. That same child, however, may insist that two rows of pennies are different in number simply because of a compelling visual difference between them.
The immature logic of the preschooler is gradually replaced by conventional logic and wisdom. School-age children follow logic akin to adult reasoning, at least when the stimuli are concrete. Faced with the same question about the pennies, they readily acknowledge that the two rows have the same number regardless of their visual appearance (see Fig. 3.25 ). They also know that the airplane just looks smaller because it has moved farther from the viewer, and they giggle at the suggestion that the people on the plane have shrunk. Their logical limitations become obvious when they must reason about the hypothetical or the abstract.
Adolescents, particularly those with the benefits of formal education, tend to extend logical principles to increasingly diverse problems. They can generate multiple logical possibilities systematically when faced with scientific experiments, and they can also consider hypothetical problems. These principles of reasoning are applied not only to schoolwork but also to social situations.

AUGUST STERN, in Quantum Theoretic Machines, 2000
HEISENBERG'S MATRIX MECHANICS
Matrix foundation of logical thinking is not the first time we rediscover matrix multiplication from empirical results. The same thing happened to Werner Heisenberg, who in the 1920s developed matrix quantum mechanics, apparently without knowing ‘what a matrix is’. It will be instructive to recall the logical steps leading to this. Typically, observable physical quantities are represented by functions on phase space. If one assumes this classical picture, then the set of energies emitted by an atom should form a semigroup inside the real numbers; that is, the sum of two emitted frequencies would also be one. However, that is not the case. Experiments show that the frequencies are confined to a small number of terms v ij where i, j are in some discrete index set, so to conform to the observed quantization of possible energies of an atom. The frequencies comply with the Ritz combination principle:
v ij=v ik+v kj,
where the set of frequencies does not form a group but rather a groupoid. A groupoid is like a group in having associative multiplication, but unlike a group, only for certain pairs of elements the product exists. Studying Ritz's combination principle and the transition elements, Heisenberg arrived at matrix quantum mechanics. He found that if physical quantities such as position and momentum are represented by matrices which obey commutation relations, then experimentally observed values of physical quantities will correspond to the eigenvalues of these matrices. The algebra of observables then follows the usual rule for matrix multiplication. Trying to describe the motion of multiple electrons in atoms, Heisenberg reinvented a system of multiplication using arrangements of numbers called matrices. One is not so much surprised by this fact – history does not repeat itself without reason – than by the fact that Heisenberg was unaware of the theory of matrices.
There is striking similarity between quantum algebra and the syllogism inference. Matrix operations which play a fundamental role in quantum physics are fundamental for logic as well. Both the atomic transitions and logical inferences follow the rule of matrix multiplication. Although this is not yet a guarantee that the brain thinks simply by changing the quantum levels, such a conjecture is compelling and must be thoroughly investigated. Is it plausible that the thought mechanism and quantum mechanics of an atom are particular realizations of one fundamental matrix principle? Could then a general theory unifying the laws of thoughts and the laws of the quantum be developed? The attempt to obtain such a theory requires us to replace geometrical quantities, in the role of the descriptor of a state, by topological quantities, not as explicitly dependent on the spacetime coordinates and therefore more abstract.

Developmental and Behavioral Theories
Robert M. Kliegman MD, in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 2020
Cognitive Theories
Cognitive development is best understood through the work of Piaget. A central tenet of Piaget's work is that cognition changes in quality, not just quantity (see Table 18.2 ). During the sensorimotor stage, an infant's thinking is tied to immediate sensations and a child's ability to manipulate objects. The concept of “in” is embodied in a child's act of putting a block into a cup. With the arrival of language, the nature of thinking changes dramatically; symbols increasingly take the place of objects and actions. Piaget described how children actively construct knowledge for themselves through the linked processes of assimilation (taking in new experiences according to existing schemata) and accommodation (creating new patterns of understanding to adapt to new information). In this way, children are continually and actively reorganizing cognitive processes.
Piaget's basic concepts have held up well. Challenges have included questions about the timing of various stages and the extent to which context may affect conclusions about cognitive stage. Children's understanding of cause and effect may be considerably more advanced in the context of sibling relationships than in the manipulation and perception of inanimate objects. In many children, logical thinking appears well before puberty (even in toddlers), the age postulated by Piaget. Of undeniable importance is Piaget's focus on cognition as a subject of empirical study, the universality of the progression of cognitive stages, and the image of a child as actively and creatively interpreting the world.
Piaget's work is of special importance to pediatricians for 3 reasons: (1) Piaget's observations provide insight into many puzzling behaviors of infancy, such as the common exacerbation of sleep problems at 9 and 18 mo of age; (2) Piaget's observations often lend themselves to quick replication in the office, with little special equipment; and (3) open-ended questioning, based on Piaget's work, can provide insights into children's understanding of illness and hospitalization.
Based on cognitive development, Kohlberg developed a theory of moral development in 6 stages, from early childhood through adulthood. Preschoolers' earliest sense of right and wrong is egocentric, motivated by externally applied controls. In later stages, children perceive equality, fairness, and reciprocity in their understanding of interpersonal interactions through perspective taking. Most youth will reach stage 4, conventional morality, by mid- to late adolescence. The basic theory has been modified to distinguish morality from social conventions. Whereas moral thinking considers interpersonal interactions, justice, and human welfare, social conventions are the agreed-on standards of behavior particular to a social or cultural group. Within each stage of development, children are guided by the basic precepts of moral behavior, but they also may take into account local standards, such as dress code, classroom behavior, and dating expectations. Additional studies have even demonstrated some protomorality in infants.

SEARCH FOR UNIVERSAL LOGIC
AUGUST STERN, in Quantum Theoretic Machines, 2000
TENSE LOGIC
In spite of the fundamental role of time in logical thinking, tense logic is probably one of most poorly developed extensions of logical theory, offering no significant theorems, if any. Dissertations and books have been written on the subject of time in logic, but their intellectual and practical value is almost nil.
The role of time is most evident in noncommuting logical operations. Typically, logical functions are applied to arguments in a certain order. With each function we associate a converse function, in which the order of arguments is reversed. For asymmetric logical functions, like implication, a swap of the arguments can change the value of the function. The arguments do not commute in implication and therefore generally
x  I F  y ≠ y  I F  x.
The ordering of the arguments in the implication conceals within itself a temporal ordering, and if the inference is causal, the logical variables should appear in the expression in a certain order. To prevent the breakdown of causal relations in tense logic a logical expression is specified by stating the materially ordered set of logical connectives and logical variables. With the aid of the time notation, instead of
(x L y)
we must write
(x(t 1)L y(t 2))
where the times indicate the particular order in which logical variables must appear, no matter whether a function is asymmetric or symmetric. We encounter no difficulties with the tense treatment of asymmetric logical functions. The problem truly presents itself when we consider symmetric functions, like AND and OR. Because classical logic does not not concern itself with the meaning of logical variables but only with their truth status, one legitimately writes
x ∧ y=y ∧ x x ∨ y=y ∨ x
where x and y commute under conjunction and disjunction and the time ordering is irrelevant to the resulting truth-value of the expression. Disregard for time, however, can yield truth-functionally valid but meaningless statements. Whereas the AND and OR we are familiar with in language are often based on some connection in meaning between the variables, the logical AND and OR represent only a relationship between their truth statuses. This enables the truth of (x AND y) or (x OR y) to be inferred from the truth of x and y, independently of the order of their appearance in the expression. Since the commutation law is one of the defining features of classical logic, a fundamental contribution to logical theory of tense logic, if only on the conceptual level, is in underlining the fact that one must reasonably expect classical logic to fail in real-world situations whenever the logical variables do not commute. It is important to emphasize that this is more an observation than a technical result of tense logic. Time does not actually appear in the logical expression explicitly but must be brought in by some intelligent agent like ourselves, possessing the faculty of dealing not only with truth but also with meaning.
Another serious shortcoming of tense logic is a lack of negative values, which are nonexistent in classical logic but are necessary if we are to deal with time. An ‘arrow of time’ in logic always points in one direction. The time operator, introduced in matrix logic, changes all that. The antisymmetric commutator products of the major basis set of logical operators universally give rise to a signed time operator, the fundamental cognitive observable.

Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation on Children
Robert M. Kliegman MD, in Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 2020
Biologic Effects of Radiation
Biologic effects of radiation are divided into two types. The first type, tissue reactions (previously deterministic effects ), are characterized by a threshold absorbed dose, and severity is directly related to the magnitude once the threshold is exceeded. No evidence of tissue reactions has been demonstrated from radiation dose levels (<100 mGy) used in diagnostic examinations but invasive procedures (therapeutic and interventional) have on rare occasions led to these effects. Typical tissue reactions present as temporary hair loss (epilation) and skin reddening (erythema) and occur in regions of peak dose >2 Gy (Table 736.5 ). Cataracts have also been reported to occur with an acute exposure to >2.0 Gy or with long-term exposure to >5.0 Gy (international limits have set the threshold at >0.5 Gy).
The second type consists of stochastic (random) effects that are of concern because they may occur at any dose—that is, there is no threshold. The probability of a stochastic effect increases with the rising level of absorbed dose, but the severity of a stochastic effect does not increase with dose. Stochastic effects can be caused by any level of radiation striking vulnerable tissue (most importantly DNA, but cytoplasm also may be at risk) and causing irreversible damage. These effects are represented by the linear no (dose) threshold (LNT) model. This model maintains that no level of radiation exposure is effect free, or does not have a potential effect “(i.e., no threshold), and that the risk of radiation damage”. This concept states that no level of radiation exposure can be considered safe.
Radiation can cause permanent cell injury leading to carcinogenesis, genetic mutations, or cell death. The biologic effects of radiation result primarily from damage to DNA. Direct effect reactions occur mainly through interactions of high linear energy transfer (LET) particles, such as α-particles or neutrons, directly with the DNA structure. Similarly, x-ray or γ-ray photons may interact with, and liberate, an electron from atoms (called a recoil electron) near the DNA structure. The kinetic energy of the recoil electron or high LET particles directly cleaves chemical bonds in the DNA structure. Recoil electrons cause approximately one third of DNA damage.
An indirect effect is caused by the formation of free radicals. Approximately 80% of the cell is water, so most of the energy deposited in a cell results in production of aqueous free radicals. Absorbed x-ray or γ-ray photon energy is converted to recoil electrons that create ion radicals (H 2 O+ and H 2 O − ). The ion radicals promptly decay (10 −18 -10 −3 sec) into free radical species (OH −, H+, H 3 O+). Approximately two thirds of DNA damage is believed to be caused by hydroxyl (OH −) free radicals, which primarily reacts with DNA by attaching to the hydrogen bound to the deoxyribose carbon, resulting in a base release from the DNA structure and strand break of the DNA helix. The biochemical changes that follow take hours or days, whereas the physiologic changes leading to cancer induction may take years to decades.

COLD CASE REVIEW – UK EXPERIENCE
J. Fraser, in Encyclopedia of Forensic and Legal Medicine, 2005
The Concept of Scenelines
Another concept, which is used to prevent anomalies in the logical thinking behind a hypothesis or sequence of events, is the sceneline. This was first developed at NCOF and involves plotting all the actual known significant facts and scientific inferences in relation to the crime against the proposed hypothesis developed by the investigators. This is analogous to a timeline, which is constructed (usually by commercial software such as I2) to test witness statements and express spatial relationships. The investigative hypothesis becomes a sceneline – a physical sequence of events on which every one of the actual events must lie, or be connected to by a provable logical inference. It follows that if factual events lie off the sceneline, then that hypothesis is wrong. This technique has proved particularly powerful in cold cases where there may be a considerable feeling that investigators “know” what happened, based on previous media coverage or work by the force. Often relatively small observations by the pathologist or overlooked laboratory results can completely disprove the initial hypothesis if it is tested in this way.

Thinking methods and consumption practice
Bingxin Wu, in Consumption and Management, 2011
Sun Wu’s maids of honor
From the story of Sun Wu training maids of honor we can see there is great power in logical thinking. Maids of honor enjoyed the special favor of the emperor and wouldn’t follow anyone else’s orders. They ranked only next to the emperor and would not listen to anyone else, which was the objective situation. The emperor required Sun Wu to train those maids to become soldiers capable of fighting, which was his objective. First, Sun Wu lined up the maids into two groups with the emperor’s two favorite concubines serving as group leaders. This is the thinking way of Sun Wu. Before drilling, he announced a discipline. Hearing it, instead of following his requests, the concubines all began to laugh. When told to turn left or right, they all refused to obey him. Sun Wu accounted the discipline for the second time and told them to follow his order, or he would have them killed. But those maids all thought: I am the favorite concubine of the emperor and not afraid of you at all. You are nothing. They still refused to listen to him. Sun Wu then announced the military order for the third time: anyone who refused to follow orders would be punished according to the military law. In drilling, the maids still disobeyed him, so Sun Wu ordered to have the emperor’s two most beloved concubines killed. After that, he chose two maids as group leaders and lined up the groups. When he ordered them to turn left, right, and face about, the maids obediently followed his orders.
This is a logical way of thinking, finding problems from the top to the bottom. When policies of the top are correct, but the bottom refuses to follow, you need to punish them and the problem will be solved. If Sun Wu had chosen not to punish them, and the drilling could not go on, then he, instead of maids, should be responsible. A work unit, objectively speaking, has a certain number of employees, who should be easier to manage than maids. Then it should be leaders rather than employees who should be responsible for bad organization and management, and it is also leaders who are to blame for the situation when orders are disobeyed orders and prohibitions are defied. Only in this way, can the overall and partial thinking and thinking ways be integrated and perfected. If the correct viewpoints are negated by wrong ones, the results would still be wrong, and finally, nothing would be done, and it would fall into a mess. Napoleon once said that a flock of sheep led by a lion can beat a group of lions led by a sheep. A smart leader can train his employees from sheep to little lions and make them dare to charge and struggle without fear of death. If the working methods and thinking ways of leaders are correct, such a group could be created. It could make cadres with low levels and qualities have those of high-level cadies; train those undisciplined and uncontrolled cadres into a united and capable group, which requires logical thinking to solve the problem.

By emphasising the necessity of both generalization and distribution, this passage reflects the impact George's training as a botanist had on his logical thinking. That he would have emphasised both operations and used such an example is not surprising, given his experience as a botanist. Historian of biology Müller-Wille argued that Linnaeus discussed a division of labour in natural history, between the “ ‘collectors (collectores) ‘ who ‘primarily cared for the number of species’ by collecting, describing and drawing plant specimens, and ‘taxonomists (methodici)’, who ‘primarily cared for the classification and denomination of plants’.” 75

3.1.2 Beta Waves
Beta waves are high-frequency, low-amplitude brain waves that are commonly observed in an awaken state. They are involved in conscious thought and logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect. Having the right amount of beta waves allows us to focus. Prominence of this wave causes anxiety, high arousal, an inability to relax, and stress, whereas its suppression can lead to ADHD, daydreaming, depression, and poor cognition. In optimal conditions beta waves help with conscious focus, memory, and problem solving. These waves can be divided into three specific classifications. 5
•
Low beta waves (12–15 Hz): known as “beta one” waves and associated mostly with quiet, focused, introverted concentration.
•
Mid-range beta waves (15–20 Hz): known as “beta two” waves and associated with increases in energy, anxiety, and performance.
•
High beta waves (18–40 Hz): known as “beta three” waves and associated with significant stress, anxiety, paranoia, high energy, and high arousal.

Hippocampus, Overview*
M.J. Meaney, S.J. Lupien, in Encyclopedia of Stress (Second Edition), 2007
Glucocorticoids and Hippocampal Function
Corticosteroid treatment has been known for some time to induce a reversible psychotic condition (so-called steroid psychosis) in certain individuals. This condition also includes logical thinking. A dementia-like syndrome (including attentional deficits and memory impairments) occurs frequently in a group of patients given high doses of corticosteroids for disorders not related to the central nervous system and who did not show evidence of psychosis. These findings are consistent with studies of Cushing's patients, in which cortisol levels are elevated profoundly. Cushing's patients consistently show attentional deficits and memory impairments, and the magnitude of the impairments correlates with plasma cortisol levels. Interestingly, the older subjects (>45 years) were affected more seriously; these subjects showed significantly greater memory impairments than younger subjects. Importantly, these deficits were reversible; surgical intervention to correct the hypercortisolemic state resulted in normalized cortisol levels and improved cognitive performance.
In addition, cognitive impairments, including attentional deficits and verbal and visual memory impairments, are often associated with clinical depression and are correlated with increased cortisol levels. Again, both the increase in plasma cortisol and the magnitude of the cognitive disturbances are more severe in elderly patients, often resulting in a condition of so-called pseudodementia. Importantly, in hypercortisolemic patients (especially dexamethasone-resistant patients) the cognitive disturbances are more pronounced. Results showed that subjects who received hydrocortisone treatment presented an impaired performance in the declarative memory task but not in the nondeclarative memory task, thus suggesting that cortisol interacts with hippocampal neurons to induce cognitive deficits. Another study reported comparable deficits in declarative memory in response to higher cortisol levels associated with major stress.
Depression is also associated with hippocampal atrophy, and is commonly associated with increased cerebrospinal levels of CRF and adrenal hypertrophy, suggesting a degree of glucocorticoid feedback insensitivity. Considering the evidence for hippocampal atrophy in this propulsion, it is tempting to speculate on the potential involvement of the hippocampus dysfunction as a source of this feedback insensitivity and the hypercorticoid state. The problem is that the hippocampus can be seen as both victim and villain in this conspiracy. It is both a source of feedback regulation over HPA activity and a primary target for elevated glucocorticoid levels. It also appears to be a target for therapeutic intervention. Antidepressant drugs increase hippocampal expression of both MR and GR, enhance glucocorticoid negative feedback sensitivity, and reduce hypothalamic CRF expression. Among aged rats, increased hippocampal GR levels are associated with enhanced feedback inhibition of HPA activity and reduced evidence of hippocampal aging.
While the results of the clinical studies have been largely correlative, there is considerable evidence for the idea that the exogenous administration of corticosteroids impairs cognitive function. The oral administration of 10 mg of hydrocortisone leads to a significant decrease in memory performance as tested 60 min after hydrocortisone intake. In this study, declarative and nondeclarative memory performance was measured in order to assess the influence of corticosteroids on the hippocampal formation process. The logic for the inclusion of this amnesic dissociation is due to the fact that studies report that the hippocampus is essential for a specific kind of memory, notably declarative, while it is not essential for nondeclarative memory. Declarative memory refers to the conscious or voluntary recollection of previous information, whereas nondeclarative memory refers to the fact that experience changes the facility for the recollection of previous information without affording conscious access to it (priming). Thus, this somewhat specialized role of the hippocampus serves as the basis for specific hypotheses regarding the effects of acute administration of corticosteroids on human cognition. The results showed that subjects who received hydrocortisone treatment presented an impaired performance in the declarative memory task but not in the nondeclarative memory task, thus suggesting that cortisol interacts with hippocampal neurons to induce cognitive deficits.
Although most of the effects of exogenous administration of glucocorticoids on human psychophysical and cognitive processing have been found using hydrocortisone as a compound, some other studies have used other compounds and reached different conclusions. Poor performance (errors of commission; incorrectly identifying distractors as targets) on verbal memory tasks occurs in normal volunteers following the administration of prednisone (80 mg/day for 5 days). The general cognitive deficit described in this study involved the relative inability to discriminate previously presented relevant information (target) from irrelevant information (distractors) in a test of recognition memory. The authors concluded that exogenous administration of corticosteroids may diminish the encoding of meaningful stimuli and impair selective attention (i.e., reducing the ability to discriminate relevant from irrelevant information).
It appears that medium–high levels of circulating glucocorticoids may first affect the process of selective attention, thus impairing further explicit acquisition of information, whereas high–very high levels of circulating corticosteroids may affect explicit memory. This suggestion has been confirmed by a dose–response hydrocortisone infusion study in normal controls in which a 300 μg/kg/h infusion of hydrocortisone impaired selective attention capacity, whereas a 600 μg/kg/h infusion impaired both selective attention and explicit memory.
The results of these studies suggest that in humans, as in rodents, elevated glucocorticoids serve to compromise hippocampal function and promote cognitive impairments. This hypothesis was tested in a population of elderly, generally healthy human subjects in a study that examined cognitive function in relation to individual differences in HPA activity and hippocampal integrity. Basal cortisol levels were correlated inversely with impairments, including deficits in spatial learning and memory, and were associated with the degree of hippocampal loss. These findings are consistent with those using rodent populations. Prolonged exposure to elevated glucocorticoid levels can serve to compromise hippocampal integrity and certain forms of learning and memory. There is an impressive level of functional equivalence between the rodent and human model of hippocampal aging and the apparent role of corticosteroids in promotion degeneration.

Do you know what critical thinking means for children?
One of the ways educators define this concept is “trying different ways to achieve a goal.” For example, ask a child to make an equation that equals 12. There are many ways to get that answer, and encouraging students to find creative, less obvious ways can motivate them to “think outside the box.” The more advanced (maturity) students are, the more different ways they’re will come up with, right? Typically no. Some parts of the education system actually discourage this, and so educators and adults in general, have to guard against the norm, routine, and predictable. It requires an open curios

What is critical thinking? How can a teacher develop critical thinking skills in students?
Here are five suggestions:
Read meaty passages and use (helpful) frameworks to analyze the texts.
Debates with evidence over issues.
Debates without evidence over the issues, using paraphrase rather than quotes.
It helps to have a thinking tool set (meta-thinking if you will)
One has to understand the underlying philosophy of intellectual inquiry. One needs purpose, context, and shared language. It might help to have shared tools or frameworks. This later is arguable for time efficiency. That is you don’t have to waste time on re-explaining theories as much if everyone understands the theory in the

How can I improve my child's memory power and critical thinking skills at home?
I am a passionate mother to my child, and I am sharing what I do.
Sanskrit is one Language which is magical, the immense amount of Scientific Research and the studies on it is the proof to this. There are many reports and papers on how it affects the brain and its functioning. I use this with my son and other children at our Learning Centre. We chant Sanskrit Shlokas and Stutis every day for about an hour. It has helped them with their diction, pronunciation and of course memory. With my son, I have been doing this right from Pre-conception, all through pregnancy and infancy, and he is 4 now.

What is the youngest age children are capable of effectively learning, understanding, and retaining lessons on logic and critical thinking?
My own (unscientific) view is almost about the same age that they are able to master language, say 3 or 4! But, of course, children vary as much in this as in the development of any other (innate) skill— indeed, some children seem never to fully master it!

Where can I find information on developing my children's critical thinking?
You don't need any kind of information about how you should educate your child. The biggest mistake parents do with kids is that they look for a lot of ways to teach them complicated things in easy ways that they don't think that maybe the kid will understand if it's explain well by the parent.
First, if your child is young, let him be however he wants to be, don't try to "educate" him to gain something you think it's useful. For example, as you may want to develop his critical thinking, someone else, in the other corner of the planed may want to develop the mathematical and programming thinki

What is Cognitive Development?
Cognitive development  means the development of the ability to think and reason.
Children ages 6 to 12, usually think in concrete ways (concrete operations). This can include things like how to combine, separate, order, and transform objects and actions.
Adolescence marks the beginning development of more complex thinking processes (also called formal logical operations). This time can include abstract thinking the ability to form their own new ideas or questions. It can also include the ability to consider many points of view and compare or debate ideas or opinions. It can also include  the ability to consider the process of thinking.
Typical Cognitive Changes During Adolescence
During adolescence (between 12 and 18 years of age), the developing teenager gains the ability to think systematically about all logical relationships within a problem. The transition from concrete thinking to formal logical operations happens over time.
Every adolescent progresses at their own rate in developing their ability to think in more complex ways. Each adolescent develops their own view of the world. Some adolescents may be able to apply logical operations to school work before they are able to apply them to personal problems.
When emotional issues come up, they can add an additional level of complexity for an adolescent's cognitive reasoning. The ability to consider possibilities, emotions, and facts, may impact decision making, in positive or negative ways.
Some common features indicating growth from more simple to more complex cognitive development include:
Early Adolescence
During early adolescence, the use of more complex thinking is focused on personal decision making in school and home environments. This can include:
Begins to demonstrate use of formal logical operations in schoolwork.
Begins to question authority and society standards.
Begins to form and verbalize their own thoughts and views on a variety of topics. These are usually more related to their own life, such as:
Which sports are better to play
Which groups are better to be included in
What personal looks are desirable or attractive
What parental rules should be changed
Middle Adolescence
The focus of middle adolescence often includes more philosophical and futuristic concerns. Examples may include:
Often questions and analyzes more extensively
Thinks about and begins to form their own code of ethics (such as, What do I think is right?)
Thinks about different possibilities and begins to develop own identity (such as, Who am I?)
Thinks about and begins to consider possible future goals (such as, What do I want?)
Thinks about and begins to make their own plans
Begins to think long term
Begins to consider how to influence relationships with others
Late Adolescence
During late adolescence, complex thinking processes are used to focus on less self-centered concepts and personal decision making. Examples may include:
Increased thoughts about more global concepts such as justice, history and politics
Develops idealistic views on specific topics or concerns
Debates and develops intolerance of opposing views
Begins to focus thinking on making career decisions
Begins to focus thinking on emerging role in adult society
Fostering Healthy Adolescent Cognitive Development
To help encourage positive and healthy cognitive development in the adolescent:
Help adolescents in getting adequate sleep, hydration, and nutrition.
Include adolescents in discussions about a variety of topics, issues, and current events.
Encourage adolescents to share ideas and thoughts with adults.
Encourage adolescents to think independently and develop their own ideas.
Help adolescents in setting their own goals.
Encourage adolescents to think about possibilities of the future.
Compliment and praise adolescents for well-thought-out decisions.
Help adolescents in reviewing any poorly made decisions.

Children’s complex thinking skills begin forming before they go to school
Children’s complex thinking skills begin forming before they go to school
New research at the University of Chicago and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill shows that children begin to show signs of higher-level thinking skills as young as age 4 ½. Researchers have previously attributed higher-order thinking development to knowledge acquisition and better schooling, but the new longitudinal study shows that other skills, not always connected with knowledge, play a role in the ability of children to reason analytically.
The findings, reported in January in the journal Psychological Science, show for the first time that children’s executive function has a role in the development of complicated analytical thinking. Executive function includes such complex skills as planning, monitoring, task switching, and controlling attention. High early executive function skills at school entry are related to higher than average reasoning skills in adolescence.
Growing research suggests that executive function may be trainable through pathways, including preschool curriculum, exercise and impulse control training. Parents and teachers may be able to help encourage development of executive function by having youngsters help plan activities, learn to stop, think, and then take action, or engage in pretend play, said lead author of the study, Lindsey Richland, assistant professor of comparative human development at the University of Chicago.
Although important to a child’s education, “little is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying children’s development of the capacity to engage in complex forms of reasoning,” Richland said.
The new research is reported in the paper “Early Executive Function Predicts Reasoning Development” and follows the development of complex reasoning in children from before the time they go to school until they are 15. Richland’s co-author is Margaret Burchinal, senior scientist at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
The two studied the acquisition of analogical thinking, one form of complex reasoning. “The ability to see relationships and similarities between disparate phenomena is fundamental to analytical and inductive reasoning, and is closely related to measurements of general fluid intelligence,” said Richland. Developing complex reasoning ability is particularly fundamental to the innovation and adaptive thinking skills necessary for a modern workforce, she pointed out.
Richland and Burchinal studied a database of 1,364 children who were part of the Early Child Care and Youth Development study from birth through age 15. The group was fairly evenly divided between boys and girls and included families from a diverse cross-section of ethnic and income backgrounds.
The current study examined tests children took when they were 4 ½, when they were in first grade, third grade, and when they were 15.  Because the study was longitudinal, the same children were tested at each interval. Among the tests they took were ones to measure analytical reasoning, executive function, vocabulary knowledge, short-term memory and sustained attention.
Children were tested at 4 ½ on their ability to monitor and control their automatic responses to stimuli. In first grade they worked on a test that judged their ability to move objects in a “Tower of Hanoi” game, in which they had to move disks between pegs in a specific order.
In third grade and at 15 years old, they were tested on their ability to understand analogies, asked in third grade for instance to complete the question “dog is to puppy as cat is to__?” As 15-year-olds they were asked to complete written tests of analogies.
The study found a strong relationship between high scores among children who as preschoolers had strong vocabularies and were good at monitoring and controlling their responses (executive function) to later ability on tests of understanding analogies.
“Overall, these results show that knowledge is necessary for using thinking skills, as shown by the importance of early vocabulary, but also inhibitory control and executive function skills are important contributors to children’s analytical reasoning development,” Richland said.
The National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation, the Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation supported the research.

Okay, so from these documents, it seems like children start forming their own views and engaging in moral reasoning from a very young age, even as young as preschool. However, their understanding is quite simplistic and egocentric, meaning they see things mostly from their own perspective. As they grow older, especially around age 10 and beyond, they start to consider others' perspectives and develop more nuanced moral reasoning.

But I'm still trying to pin down exactly when children start to think independently and form their own views beyond just mimicking adults. It seems like there's a transition from heteronomous morality, where rules are seen as absolute, to autonomous morality, where children start to think more flexibly about rules and consider the intentions behind actions.

I also came across the idea that critical thinking skills can be developed in children from a young age, but it requires guidance and encouragement from parents and teachers. It seems like fostering an environment where children are encouraged to ask questions, explore different perspectives, and think for themselves is crucial.

Moreover, the concept of executive function appears to play a significant role in the development of complex thinking skills. Children with higher executive function skills at an early age tend to have better reasoning abilities later on.

So, to summarize, while children begin to form their own views and engage in moral reasoning from a young age, their abilities develop and mature over time, especially as they grow older and their cognitive abilities expand.

I think the key takeaway is that parents and educators should encourage and nurture these developing skills from an early age, providing opportunities for children to think critically and independently.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Children begin forming their own views and engaging in moral reasoning from a young age, around preschool, but their understanding evolves significantly as they grow older and develop more complex cognitive skills.}} \]
