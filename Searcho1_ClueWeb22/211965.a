Alright, so I need to figure out how litter affects the environment. I know that litter is basically trash or waste that's left in places where it doesn't belong, like on the side of the road or in parks. But I need to understand the broader impact of this on the environment. I think I should start by understanding what kinds of litter there are and then see how each type affects the environment differently.

First, I need to categorize litter. I think litter can be divided into a few main types: plastic, paper, metal cans, glass, and maybe organic waste like food scraps. Each of these probably affects the environment in different ways.

Let me think about plastic first. Plastic is a big problem because it takes a really long time to decompose. I've heard that plastic can take hundreds of years to break down. So, if plastic litter ends up in oceans or lakes, it can harm aquatic life. Animals might mistake plastic for food or get entangled in it, which can lead to injury or death. Also, plastic doesn't biodegrade; it just breaks down into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can enter the food chain. That's worrying because it means that even tiny organisms can ingest plastic, and it can accumulate up the food chain, potentially affecting human health too.

Now, paper litter. Paper is biodegradable, so it breaks down relatively quickly compared to plastic. However, if paper litter ends up in water bodies, it can still harm aquatic life. For example, if animals get entangled in paper or try to eat it, it could cause problems. Also, large amounts of paper litter can clog drainage systems, leading to flooding during rains. Additionally, paper production requires trees, so excessive paper use and littering can contribute to deforestation.

Moving on to metal cans, like aluminum cans or tin cans. These are recyclable, but if they're littered, they don't break down easily. Metal cans can take a long time to decompose—aluminum can take up to 500 years. This means they can persist in the environment for a very long time, taking up space in landfills or lying around in natural areas. Also, if cans have sharp edges, they can injure animals or people who come into contact with them.

Glass is another type of litter. Glass takes even longer to decompose—up to a million years, I've heard. That's an incredibly long time. So, glass litter can remain in the environment practically forever if not disposed of properly. Broken glass can also be a hazard to both animals and humans, as it can cause cuts or injuries.

Organic waste, like food scraps, might seem less harmful because it's biodegradable. However, when organic waste is littered, it can attract pests like rodents and insects, which can spread diseases. Also, in natural areas, organic waste can disrupt the local ecosystem by providing an unnatural food source for certain animals, leading to imbalances.

I should also consider other types of litter, like electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste contains harmful substances like mercury and lead, which can leach into the soil and water if not disposed of properly. This can have serious health impacts on both wildlife and humans.

Another aspect to consider is the aesthetic impact of litter. When areas are littered, they look ugly and neglected. This can lower property values and discourage people from visiting parks or other recreational areas. It also sends a message that no one cares about the environment, which can lead to more littering and a downward spiral in environmental consciousness.

Litter can also have economic impacts. Cleaning up litter costs a lot of money. Local governments have to allocate resources to collect and dispose of litter, which could otherwise be spent on other public services. Additionally, businesses may suffer if their premises are surrounded by litter, as it can deter customers.

I should probably look into some statistics to get a better grasp of the scale of the problem. Maybe find out how much litter is produced annually and what the main sources are. I think conducting a search would be helpful here.

Statistics - Global Littering Issues
Statistics
Global pollution can be compered to many global diseases such as Malaria and HIV affecting over 100 million people a year.
Did you know that most people who deliberately litter are 18-34.
75% of people admit that they have littered in the past 5 years.
9 billion tons of litter ends up in the ocean every year.
Last year, United States taxpayers spent nearly $11 billion cleaning up litter across the U.S., ten times more than the cost of trash disposal.
50% of littered items are cigarette butts.
Litter does cause severe accidents. All that it takes is for some trash in the road and it’s a car accident waiting to happen.
A discarded cigarette butt takes 12 years to break down and leaks cadmium, lead and arsenic into soil and waterways.
Plastic bags can last up to 1,000 years in a landfill and a glass bottle can be around for a million years.
Highway littering the fact composed of 59 percent paper, cans 16 percent, 6 percent bottles, plastic 6 percent and 13 percent others.
The second item is the most common aluminum beer cans, followed very closely by cans of soda.
Litter also damage crops and destroy natural areas. If the garbage disposal, can kill or stop the growth of plants. Few people think about the harm to the nature of the waste.
Despite being a world leader, the United Kingdom is struggling with keeping its cities and neighborhoods clean. An astonishing 62% of England's residents admit to dropping trash in the street from time to time.
Drive along any road in the country and you'll likely see aluminum cans, paper products and other trash. Altogether, it adds up to around 52 billion pieces of litter cluttering up the landscape. That breaks down to more than 6,700 items per mile.
All of the trash found along roadsides needed help to get there. While some of it comes from walkers and cyclists, motorists account for 53% of all litter produced annually.
A day at the beach may not be so pleasant if you're surrounded by litter. In 2012, more than 10 million pounds of trash was collected from beaches and waterways in 97 countries during a global cleanup effort.
Approximately 40% of the lakes in America are too polluted for fishing, aquatic life, or swimming.

23 Littering Statistics That Will Blow Your Mind
March 3, 2015
23 Littering Statistics That Will Blow Your Mind
By Rebecca Lake
In America alone, more than 250 million tons of trash is produced each year, some of which is discarded as litter along roads, on city streets, in parks and across the nation's waterways. Read on for 23 littering statistics that will blow your mind.
Littering not only diminishes the physical beauty of the world we live in, but it also poses some major problems for the people, plants and animals who are affected by it.
If you've ever been guilty of littering, you may not realize just how much of an impact it has, both environmentally and financially. Even if you don't see any immediate consequences, there's still a trickle-down effect, since things like water pollution are often linked to littering and dumping.
The next time you're tempted to just toss that empty drink bottle out of the car window or leave a cigarette butt lying around, keep these astounding littering statistics in mind.

1. The U.K. has the worst reputation for littering
Despite being a world leader, the United Kingdom is struggling with keeping its cities and neighborhoods clean. An astonishing 62% of England's residents admit to dropping trash in the street from time to time.
2. But it's actually on the decline here at home
Although it continues to be a pervasive problem, littering is occurring less frequently than it used to. Over the last 40 years, the litter rate has actually declined by 61% in the U.S.
3. Nearly half of Americans admit to littering
Despite being bombarded with media campaigns that warn about the dangers of littering, may Americans aren't heeding the message. Approximately 43% of people in the U.S. admit to littering at least once.
4. U.S. highways are a prime dumping spot for litter
Drive along any road in the country and you'll likely see aluminum cans, paper products and other trash. Altogether, it adds up to around 52 billion pieces of litter cluttering up the landscape. That breaks down to more than 6,700 items per mile.
5. One item is littered more often than any other
Smokers are major contributors to the littering problem in the U.S. Tobacco waste, including cigarette butts, accounts for 38% of all litter found along roadways and at transition points, such as outside buildings where smoking isn't allowed.
6. Paper products come in a close second
Food wrappers, paper bags, cardboard boxes, newspapers and scrap paper are just some of the things you'll see when you're cruising down the road. Paper products make up 22% of the litter that's currently out there, with plastics landing in third place at 19%.
7. Drivers litter the most
All of the trash found along roadsides needed help to get there. While some of it comes from walkers and cyclists, motorists account for 53% of all litter produced annually.
8. But beach goers aren't helping any either
A day at the beach may not be so pleasant if you're surrounded by litter. In 2012, more than 10 million pounds of trash was collected from beaches and waterways in 97 countries during a global cleanup effort.
9. Tobacco and plastics make up the bulk of beach litter
Over half of the beach trash picked up in 2012 consisted of cigarette butts and filters, food wrappers, plastic bottles and plastic bags. Some of the more oddball things found along the coasts include over 4,000 candles, 236 toothbrushes and 117 mattresses.
10. The world's oceans hide a staggering amount of litter
Pinning down the exact amount of trash that can be found in the world's oceans is difficult. In terms of just plastic litter, conservative estimates put the total amount at roughly 300 billion pounds.
11. More is added each year
Ocean pollution is most often the result of trash being dumped from the land, but marine littering isn't uncommon. An estimated 1.4 billion pounds of litter winds up in the oceans each year.
12. Most of it sinks
The ocean floor is home to a number of sea plants and animals that often find themselves surrounded by trash. Of the billions of pounds of litter that end up in the world's waterways, 70% sinks straight to the bottom.
13. But some of it doesn't
The litter that's swirling around on the surface of the oceans is moved by the currents, which helps to consolidate it into floating trash heaps. One of the largest, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is estimated to be anywhere from 270,000 to 5.8 million square miles in size.
14. And it's not going away any time soon
While paper and wood products biodegrade at a moderately fast pace, plastics and other synthetic materials are notorious for being slow to break down. Just one plastic bottle can take 450 years to decompose, while a fishing line can take up to 600 years to disappear.
15. Marine birds and animals are paying the price
Birds, fish and other ocean-dwelling animals are often unable to distinguish between trash and food. As a result, 1 million sea birds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year after becoming entangled in or ingesting litter.
16. That's not the only cost of littering
Littering doesn't just take a toll on things like water and soil quality; there's also an economic cost. Between clean-up efforts, decreases in property values and medical expenses associated with treating illnesses caused by litter, the cost adds up to $11.5 billion each year.
17. Most littering is done intentionally
While littering can occur accidentally, it's most often a deliberate act. Approximately 81% of littering is done with intent, either by someone dropping, flicking or flinging the piece of trash in question.
18. Younger people are more likely to be litterbugs
Age and maturity seem to play a part in determining whether someone will be a litterer. Those under 19 are the most frequent culprits, while adults aged 21 to 35 are three times more likely to litter than the 50-and-up crowd.
19. Men litter more often than women
In addition to age, gender also appears to have an impact on littering rates. The gap is relatively small, however, with 21% of men in the U.S. guilty of littering, compared to 15% of women.
20. Some states are cleaner than others
Although no state can claim to be 100% litter-free, some fare better than others. In terms of how clean its public spaces are, the state of Washington is the best overall while South Carolina is the worst litter offender.
21. Roadway litter can be deadly
While most of the litter that hits the highway comes from being tossed out of car windows, a small percentage is the result of things falling off the backs of trucks or other vehicles. In 2010, there were 440 fatalities related to this kind of road debris.
Ever seen someone dump their old mattress on the sidewalk? As you might have guessed, there are better ways to get rid of it. Discover the right way to dispose of your mattress in our guide right here.
22. Littering could mean jail time in certain states
In most states, littering can earn you a fine ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, but some places take it a little more seriously. In 23 states, including Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Washington, littering offenses may be punishable by a stint in jail.
23. Recycling could combat the problem
The average person produces about 4.4 pounds of garbage each day. While 75% of the waste we produce is recyclable, only about 30% actually makes it to a recycling center.
If that were increased, it could drastically cut down on the amount of trash that winds up as litter. Alternatively, you can also help cut down on trash by repurposing or even selling your unwanted items.

11 Littering Statistics in America
May 28, 2017 by Brandon Gaille
Did you know that the annual cost of picking up litter is over $11 billion dollars? Littering is something that many people admit to doing when they are in a rush, but the impact of that decision to litter is often not realized. The trash that you could be leaving out in nature could be catching up with you right now!
Littering Facts
Nearly 50% of all littering is from cigarette butts.
Think about all the chemicals that are in a cigarette. Now think about what the purpose of the filter on a cigarette does – it removes the worst of the worst of the cigarette so it doesn’t go into your body. Then this remaining filter is flicked onto the ground where these compounds can leak into the dirt, the ground water, and even our rivers and streams!
How Much Litter Does the World Produce?
1. In the last year alone, 9 billion tons of litter was dumped into the world’s oceans.
2. 75% of people, when surveyed, admitted that they littered at least once within the last 5 years.
3. The average amount of steps it takes for someone to find a piece of litter on the ground is just 12. That’s right – every 12 steps outside, you’ll find a piece of trash.
The Facts on Littering: Be the Street Video Contest
Takeaway: A lot has been said about climate change, but not a lot has been said about littering. If we allow our trash to pile up, we’re going to destroy our local eco-systems just as quickly, if not more quickly than climate change can. That’s what it is so important to pack out what you pack in… or to dispose of some litter when you come across it. Most importantly, however, just don’t litter in the first place!
Other Sobering Litter Statistics
1. Fast food products account for a full third of all litter that is produced around the world. That includes the food itself and the packaging materials.
2. Paper products account for 29% of the world’s litter, a product which quite often is fully recyclable.
3. It takes a cigarette butt 12 years to full decompose. On the other hand, it takes a banana peel just 12 days to do so.
4. 95% of farmers today have at some point had to clear litter off of their farmlands that they themselves did not produce.
5. 98% of the fulmars in the North Sea, a seabird, have plastic within their digestive tracts.
6. It is not uncommon for turtles to eat plastic bags that have been discarded into the water because they look like jellyfish.
7. Nearly 100 billion plastic bags are used in the United States alone and a discarded plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years on estimate to decompose.
8. 75% of people admit to littering in some form last year.
Takeaway: It’s up to us to take care of our planet. The animals, the plants, and yes, even ourselves require our responsible management of nature so that it can be preserved for the generations to come. Without litter management, we may not even have a planet left in a few generations… or if we do, we’ll be spending a vast fortune to clean up the messes we’ve made.

Alright, so from the search results, I've gathered a bunch of statistics and information about littering and its effects on the environment. Let's try to organize this information to answer the question properly.

First, litter affects the environment in numerous ways, ranging from harming wildlife to polluting water bodies and soil. It also has economic implications due to the costs associated with cleaning up litter and the potential loss in property values.

One of the most significant impacts of litter is on wildlife. Many animals can mistake litter for food, leading to ingestion of non-biodegradable materials like plastics, which can cause blockages in their digestive systems and lead to starvation or death. Additionally, animals can get entangled in litter, causing injuries or restricting their movement, which can be fatal.

For instance, the search results mention that 1 million sea birds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year due to litter-related issues like ingestion or entanglement. This is a stark reminder of how littering directly contributes to the decline of wildlife populations.

Moreover, litter, especially plastics, takes a very long time to decompose. Plastics can take hundreds to thousands of years to break down, during which they can photodegrade into microplastics that enter the food chain. This means that even if an animal doesn't directly ingest a piece of plastic, it may consume smaller particles that have been ingested by smaller organisms further down the food chain.

Water bodies are particularly vulnerable to littering. The statistics provided indicate that 9 billion tons of litter are dumped into the world's oceans every year. This not only harms marine life but also contaminates water sources, affecting ecosystems and human health.

Land-based litter also has severe consequences. It can leach chemicals into the soil, contaminating groundwater and affecting plant life. Littered cigarette butts, for example, contain toxic chemicals that can seep into the ground and nearby water sources, posing risks to both flora and fauna.

Furthermore, litter affects the aesthetic value of natural areas and urban spaces, leading to decreased tourism and lower property values. Clean environments are not only more pleasant to be in but also indicate a community's commitment to sustainability and health.

Economically, the cost of cleaning up litter is substantial. The search results mention that in the U.S., taxpayers spend nearly $11.5 billion annually on litter cleanup. This is money that could be allocated to other public services and improvements.

It's also worth noting that certain types of litter are more prevalent than others. Cigarette butts account for about 50% of all litter, followed by fast food products, paper, and aluminum cans. Targeting these specific types of litter in prevention and cleanup efforts could yield significant improvements.

In conclusion, litter has far-reaching negative impacts on the environment, wildlife, human health, and the economy. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach, including public education, stricter enforcement of littering laws, improved waste management infrastructure, and promoting a culture of responsibility and respect for the environment.
