As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and insights on this topic based on existing research and theories in organizational behavior and management.

First, it's important to understand what organizational power is and its role in leadership. Organizational power refers to the ability of individuals or groups to influence others and make decisions that affect the organization. Leaders often possess formal authority and power, which enables them to direct activities, allocate resources, and ensure that goals are met.

Now, considering the question: Can an organization run effectively without leaders having some form of organizational power? To answer this, I need to explore alternative models of leadership and organizational structures where power is distributed differently or even absent.

One approach is to look into flat organizations or holacratic structures, where traditional hierarchical power structures are minimized or eliminated. In these setups, decision-making is often decentralized, and employees have more autonomy and responsibility. For example, companies like Valve and Morning Star have adopted such structures with reportedly successful outcomes.

Another perspective comes from shared leadership models, where leadership responsibilities are distributed among team members based on their expertise and capabilities rather than formal positions. This can lead to more collaborative and innovative environments.

However, it's also crucial to consider potential drawbacks. Without centralized authority, organizations might face challenges in coordination, decision-making efficiency, and maintaining consistency in strategies and policies. Moreover, in times of crisis or rapid change, having a clear leader with the necessary power to make swift decisions can be beneficial.

Additionally, some studies suggest that while decentralized structures can foster creativity and employee engagement, they may not be suitable for all types of organizations or industries, particularly those requiring strict regulations and standardized processes.

In conclusion, while it's possible for organizations to function effectively without traditional forms of organizational power held by leaders, it depends heavily on the specific context, culture, and nature of the organization. Alternative structures require robust systems for communication, decision-making, and accountability to succeed.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, but it depends on the organization's structure, culture, and context.}} \]
