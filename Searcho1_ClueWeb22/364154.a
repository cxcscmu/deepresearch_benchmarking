Alright, so I've got this question: "To what extent do conservatives agree on society?" Hmm, that's pretty broad, but I'll try to tackle it. First off, I need to understand what conservatism is and what conservatives generally believe in when it comes to society.

I think conservatism is a political and social philosophy that values tradition, order, and stability. Conservatives often prefer gradual change over radical transformation and tend to be skeptical of rapid change in society. They usually support institutions and practices that have been established over time, believing that these have stood the test of time for a reason.

But, society is a vast topic, covering everything from cultural norms to economic systems to personal behaviors. So, to answer this question, I need to break it down a bit. Maybe look at key areas where conservatives have common views and see how much agreement there is within conservative thought.

Let me start by considering some core principles of conservatism that might apply to society. One is individual responsibility. Conservatives often emphasize personal accountability and self-reliance. They might argue that individuals should take care of themselves and their families without excessive government intervention.

Another principle is limited government. Conservatives typically believe that government should have a smaller role in people's lives and that fewer regulations and lower taxes encourage personal initiative and economic growth.

Conservatives also often value traditional moral values and may be more likely to support policies that reflect these values, such as opposition to same-sex marriage or abortion rights.

Additionally, national security and law and order are important to many conservatives. They may advocate for strong defense policies and tough stances on crime.

Now, do all conservatives agree on these points? Probably not entirely. There's likely a range of opinions within the conservative spectrum. For example, some conservatives might place more emphasis on fiscal responsibility and less on social issues, while others might prioritize moral values over economic policies.

I think it's also important to consider that conservatism isn't monolithic. There are different strains of conservatism, such as classical conservatism, which focuses on preserving traditional institutions, and neoliberal conservatism, which combines free-market economics with socially conservative values.

Moreover, conservatism can vary significantly across different countries and cultures. What constitutes conservatism in the United States might differ from conservatism in Europe or Asia.

Given that, perhaps I should focus on conservatism in a specific context, say, in the United States, to make this more manageable.

In the U.S., conservatism has been influential through movements like the Republican Party and think tanks like the Heritage Foundation. These organizations have platforms that outline their positions on various social issues.

But even within the Republican Party, there's a diversity of opinions. For instance, there are social conservatives who focus on moral issues, economic conservatives who emphasize free markets, and national security conservatives who prioritize defense and foreign policy.

So, there must be some areas where conservatives agree broadly, but also areas where there's significant disagreement.

Maybe I should look at recent polls or studies that gauge conservative opinions on societal issues.

Let me consider conducting a search to find some data on this.

Conservative Views On:
Conservative Views On:
Human nature: human beings seen as limited in capacity and flawed. No one person knows the absolute truth, so ideologies attempting to explain existence are to be distrusted. Human nature has both positive and negative aspects. Because of the negatives, there is the need for security and law and order to protect and guard. Society is a vulnerable place and strong legal frameworks are needed to protect humans from one another. Human nature leads people to familiar patterns of life and the tried and tested as opposed to the new and novel.
State: there is a need for the state to provide law and order and defence. The state is a unifying force to promote national cohesion and unity. The neoliberal element of the New Right has favoured rolling back the state in the economy to become more laissez faire.
Society: society is organic – a living thing which passes permanent and core values through the ages. As such, society is formed by the principles of tradition, authority and principled morality. Society is a comforting influence for family and group life. In contrast, neoliberals have favoured individual autonomy over the cherishing of society.
Economy: support for free market and individual enterprise. If the economy prospers and wealth is created in terms of property, then property owners develop a stake in society and will not rebel. One Nation conservatives support intervention in the economy to avoid upheaval.
Traditional Conservatism
Conservatism arose as a reaction to political, social, economic change in the late 18 th century. Edmund Burke, and others, regretted the events of the French Revolution, and the (as he saw it) disorder and chaos that had followed it. Traditional conservatism is therefore a defence of the ideas of hierarchy and paternalism, and of the established order. Traditional conservatives support the concept of the organic society, and that humans should not therefore attempt to reform society as those involved in the French Revolution had attempted to do. Reform instead should be pragmatic, not principled or ideological. If it is not, the breakdown of society may follow. Traditional conservatives also support the idea that society is naturally hierarchical, and that people should therefore be rewarded differently (in pay and status) depending on what position they are in in the hierarchy.
Early traditional conservatives saw the aristocracy as the ‘natural’ leaders of society, due to the fact that they had been raised to be leaders and assume positions of authority. This led to the belief in noblesse oblige, that the aristocracy had a duty to care for the less fortunate in society, as they were the only ones who could. This is a form of ‘soft’ paternalism, where those below accept that the natural leaders of society are those best equipped to act in everyone’s best interests.
One Nation Conservatism
This aspect of conservatism is most closely associated with Benjamin Disraeli, a novelist and UK Prime Minster (1804-81). Disraeli was concerned about the effects of early industrialisation and laissez-faire capitalism, chiefly that Britain was at risk of becoming divided into ‘two nations’- the rich and the poor. Unrestrained capitalism could lead to selfish individualism, weakening the sense of responsibility people have to each other. He suggested that conservatism should renew its commitment to those in authority helping those better off. This was partly based on the moral idea of noblesse oblige, that the ‘price of privilege’ was shouldering responsibility for the least well-off in society. However, there were also practical reasons for this view, which were that, by caring for the least well-off and making sure they were provided for, the chance of the ruling elite being overthrown by the discontented masses in revolution was reduced. This therefore could be seen as another example of prudent ‘change in order to conserve’. Ultimately, preventing revolution is in the interests of the most well-off.
This form of conservatism was most influential in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, and was also dominant in the years following the Second World War. This was seen by Conservative Party government’s acceptance of welfarism and support for Keynesian economic intervention. Harold Macmillan further developed these ideas through the ‘middle way’, which tried to balance free-market individualist liberalism against socialist-style collectivism and state planning. One Nation views were largely side-lined during Margaret Thatcher’s premiership- she referred to those who opposed her New Right policies as ‘wets’ (whereas she and her supporters were ‘dries’). David Cameron’s call for ‘compassionate conservatism’ in his early days as Conservative Party leader was also seen as a potential return to One Nation values.
The New Right
This emerged in the 1970s as a rival tradition to One Nation conservatism. It was a response to the end of the long ‘boom’ in economic progress experienced by the western world partly as a result of Keynesian economics. By the 1970’s western economies were struggling with what became known as ‘stag-flation’, a combination of economic stagnation (lack of economic growth) and rising inflation (caused by large amounts of public spending). At the same time, many conservatives believed that liberal individualism had gone too far in the 1960s and 1970s and had created a permissive culture of low morality and instability. This period created a movement within conservatism based around a combination of traditional conservative ideals and classical liberal economics. The New Right has been seen as two ideological theories bound together- the liberal New Right (neo-liberalism) and the conservative New Right (Neo-conservatism).
Neoliberalism
The liberal new right can be seen as a meeting of the conservative and classical liberal ideologies. It developed as a response to what was argued as the failure of Keynesian economics in the 1970s. It is a restated case in support of the free market and therefore rejects the use of the state – it can be summed up in terms of ‘public bad, private good’. The state is regarded as a realm of coercion and of a lack of freedom. This form of libertarian economic thinking states that the free market will work for the good of all.
Liberal new right thinking, based on the ideas of Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman, has built upon the free market ideas of economist Adam Smith. They argued that by the 1970s it was clear that the state could not effectively manage supply and demand efficiently and therefore provide general prosperity. As a result, the state should be minimalized and the economy dominated by free market thinking. This argues that the market acts as a central and organic nervous system that allows resources to be channelled where they are wanted and needed through the powers of supply and demand. This argument suggests that the state is the cause of economic problems due to its intervention in the market, creating inefficiency.
Friedman argued that Keynesian economics was causing problems with the economy. He claimed that by focusing on creating demand and therefore jobs and employment, Keynesianism had created a more dangerous economic problem- inflation.
The idea was that by creating employment and through rising demand prices had risen too sharply and quality had dropped, leading to inflation and economic failure. He argued that there was a natural rate of unemployment in a healthy economy. If the state tried to remove this, the action would create a price rise and lead to a drop in the value of money (inflation).
Therefore, the New Right neoliberal economic policies of the Thatcher and Reagan governments allowed unemployment to rise by cutting public spending and subsidies to businesses. Friedman claimed that inflation was the most dangerous result because if people lost faith in their ability to create wealth (make money) they would not take part in economic activity; this would lessen freedom and undermine society.
New Right liberal economic thinking also opposed the so called ‘mixed economy’ of some state owned industries and businesses. They claimed that if a business is state owned it reduces competition and the need to make profit (profit motive); this therefore makes it less efficient. This led to a policy of privatisation of state owned industries and businesses (for example, British Telecom, British Rail, British Steel).
New Right economic thinking argued that the supply side of the economy was important – this means that they wanted conditions that allowed producers to produce (not necessarily consumers to consume) leading to competition and natural demand levels. The way to achieve this was to lower levels of direct taxation, both personal and business.
The New Right was not opposed to state managed economics on purely economic grounds but also because of their support for classical individual freedom. They claimed to be defending individual freedom against ‘creeping collectivism’ (joint or communal ownership). The state is seen as the main enemy of personal freedom and therefore the only way to increase individual freedom is to ‘roll back the state’. Apart from economic management and ownership by the state this also means a return to ‘self-help’ or ‘social Darwinism’.
They make economic and moral arguments against welfare. Economically they argue that welfare causes greater taxation and public spending which leads to inflation and inefficiency. Morally they argue that welfare creates a culture of dependency, the idea that if there is a safety net there will be no desire to work to achieve and therefore it will create idleness. They claim that this robs people of their motivation and self-respect and they return to the classical liberal idea of the ‘undeserving poor’ who contribute nothing to society and therefore should not be entitled to anything in return.
Thatcher took this idea further when she claimed that ‘there is no such thing as society’. Murray agreed with Thatcher and claimed that welfare relieves a woman of the need to pair with a bread-winning man and therefore results in an underclass of single mothers and fatherless children who have no motivation to work. The final moral justification of the free market is put forward by Robert Nozick. He argues that taxation and redistribution through public spending is a violation of free property rights. He claimed that as long as a person had acquired their wealth legally any attempt to tax it and redistribute it amounted to ‘legalised theft’ against the individual.

Society doesn't need to be heiarchak if it doesn't help that individuals stride for wealth.
Point Two - There is a belief in noblesse oblige in traditional and one nation conservatism and traditional conservatism and the ideas that people's imperfect human nature requires a hierarchical structure in society.
*However , one nation conservatives , unlike traditional conservatives point to the danger of corrupt class conflict as they recognise the importance of order but they recognise the dangers of capitalism upon the fragile bonds that hold society together , unlike traditional conservatives.
*Recognise the fact that there is some role for the state to prevent chaos and anarchy and how the welfare state is a good safety net because it can prevent revolution from the damages of capitalism.
Counter Point - traditional and one nation conservatism have similar views on the organic and structure of society.
*Both believed that society is natural and developed over hundreds if years - not a machine created by individuals.
*Both believe in interdependence that relationships and the necessary obligation of individuals to the community in which they belong is important in ensuring stability - noblesse oblige and the elite looking after the less naturally capable imperfect beings.
Acceptance of hierarchy and authority
point one key thinkers
E.G- Ayn Rand and her key contribution of the objectivism theory in her book 'we the living" and how altraism is charity so therefore she supports a laissez faire approach to society and how individuals should be selfish "because men are not equal in ability and one can't treat them as if they were" .
*She rejects the idea that humans aren't imperfect and that we are rational.
E.G- Robert Nozick also had similar views and his key contribution of libertarianism - paternalistic approach to looking after people feeds a dependency culture and his case of a minimal state was put forward in his book "anarchy , the state and utopia" - it hinders self reliance and that the state should only intervene to enforce contracts and protect against theft.
point two key thinkers
E.G- Disraeli spoke of two nations , the rich and the poor , and to hold the organic society together they should look after eachother.
*He supported paternalism , state paternalism , and how this was needed to ensure that the societal gap between the rich and poor didn't cause revolution.
E.G- Later conservatives came to accept keynesian economics and how you should preserve the organic nature of society and observing the hierarchy by making sure that people stay happy - like Martin Burke who stressed the idea of loving "thy little platoons we belong in" in society and being happy with your class because no one should be struggling.
counter point key thinkers
E.G- Hobbes and his key contributions of social order and authority - "all forms of social order and preferable to an absence of social order" and that a state should be given authority from the people to rule in their best interest - all views shaped by his experiences of the civil war "nasty brutish and short"
E.G- Oakeshott emphasises the importance of routines in daily lives .

Introduction
Most conservatives fundamentally believe in the idea of tradition, community and the prevention of drastic social change
Archaic idea of natural hierarchy rejected by more contemporary conservatives, however neo-conservative quest to reverse social change suggests limited abandonment of ideological traditions
Overall judgement
Conservatives mostly united over society, though diminishing in modern times
Paragraph 1
Natural hierarchy
Paragraph 1 - Traditional & One-nation
Natural aristocracy - those who are wealthiest, most educated and have the most time to govern are best placed to do so (Burke)
Noblesse oblige - the educated intervene in society to help the lives of those below them; 'elevate the conditions of the people' as to avoid the 'two nation' problem and unrest
Paragraph 1 - Libertarians & modern One-nation
Social position should be determined by merit in a free market society - most talented and hard working will rise to the top regardless of social background (Nozick)
Lazy people slither into poverty whilst skillful and energetic rewarded with wealth and social status; 'infinite number of snakes and ladder' (Kieth Joseph)
Paragraph 1 - Conclusion
Little agreement as some conservatives agree there is a natural hierarchy in society though as concerns of democratic legitimacy arisen many take issue with this idea
Paragraph 2
Community vs Atomism
Paragraph 2 - Libertarians
Individuals owe no duty to one another unless contractual (Rand)
Individuals are atomistic and pursue their self-interests; society is a loose collection of independent beings
Thatcher - 'There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families'
Paragraph 2 - Traditional
Society is more important than the individuals that make it up
'Little platoons' are localised communities where individuals identities derive from, giving them a sense of purpose, preventing anomie and enabling integration into wider society (Burke)
CofE an example of such a community; 'one great source of civilisation' (Burke)
Paragraph 2 - One-nation & Christian Democracy
'Two nation' problem a consequence of individualism and neglect of duty to care through noblesse oblige
Without elites connecting with those below, 'the palace is not safe' and society at risk (Disraeli)
Christian Democrats take this idea further, seeking to reduce divisions within the region rather than the nation
Paragraph 2 - Conclusion
Medium agreement as most conservatives agree in the importance of community in providing a sense of belonging and purpose, whilst libertarians argue individuals are selfish and owe no duty to one another
Paragraph 3
Social change
Paragraph 3 - Traditional
Radical change is dangerous and ought to be avoided; the best course of action is to 'stay afloat' in the 'boundless and bottomless sea' (Oakeshott)
Change must occur, though only 'change to conserve' as radical change disrupts delicate social fabrics of society, destroying the traditions which provide belonging and familiarity; hence, change must venerate the past (Burke)
Paragraph 3 - Libertarians
Radical change essential to achieve moral purpose of 'objectivist' self-fulfillment; this is only ensured by a free-market society (Rand)
Paragraph 3 - Neo-conservatives
Change in 1960s led to permissive society and these changes needed to be reversed i.e. Thatcher's Section 28 & Victorian values

Conservatism ideology is based on the “desire to conserve to preserve things as they are” (Romkey, 2016). They want to preserve their society’s traditions and customs; as these traditions and customs are of the dominant groups in society. The preservation of traditions and customs are the most important aspect of this ideology; traditions trumps everything else. Conservatism resist the idea of change as it will disrupt the way of life for the most dominant groups. They believe that every aspect of society serves a purpose and that these purposes are equally important for the stability of society. Conservatism do not want to make any changes that would cause disruptions to their way of life. They believe that changes to society should occur slowly without interference over a long period. “They think that radical change in society or economic systems will shift our human nature, it is foolish and dangerous.” (Romkey, 2016). Conservatism believe in limiting the freedom of others. They want to control human nature with the use of institutions; religion, education and the family. These controls start at an early age in the education systems and in the family.
Early Conservatists is against the endorsement the freedom and equality of opportunity for others; however, todays’ Conservatists often hold to individual freedom and laissez-faire capitalism.

are social conservatives, which is “a version of conservatism that advocates public policies based on traditional morals and religious values.” (Demichele 2017). Likewise, there is social liberalism a version of liberals that belief “of liberty, rights, and egalitarianism with a focus on collective equally” (Demichele 2017). The social liberalism represents more of collectivism and the social conservatives is more individualism. Religion in a society and government is very important because the rules

In man’s ‘natural state’, one is subject to brutish conditions; society provides the protection of life and property, and therefore provides room to enjoy one’s natural freedoms.

How and why do conservatives believe in an organic society? (15 marks)
(1) What is an organic society? - Definition An organic society is the idea that society operates like an organism or a living entity. In this sense, the whole of an organism is seen as more important than a its individual partsIn this sense, an organism is made up of a set of fragile relationships, to which any damage would see the death of the whole organism.This is important to understand when examining conservatism as it has a particular implication on the conservative view of the state.
(2) Change Not Desirable Conservatives believe Humans are dependent and security seeking creatures. Therefore the individual cannot be separated from society.'Anomie', as described by Durkheim, therefore arises, as the individuals values are weakened due to their consequential mismatch between personal and group standards.As humans are security seeking creatures who best work in social order and social groups, change is undesirable.Indeed conservatives would, as Burke argues only "Change in order to Conserve". Similarly Oakeshott argues that "The cure is not worse than the disease": meaning we should aim for continuity wherever possible, and reform is not worth it unless it is significantly better than the status quo.This links back to the organic society - as it explains conservative reasoning for this view of society focuses so heavily on the 'whole'
(3) Society is functionalist & embedded in tradition For Conservatives society is shaped by forces beyond human control, and as it is so delicate society should therefore be respected and preserved.In this sense conservatives have a functionalist perspective, that is that institutions are best understood in the role they carry out in the world.This is seen through conservatives respect of tradition - Tradition is a "democracy of the dead" (Chesterson)The result of this, is that conservatives tend to support policy to protect this functionalist society.They will seek to uphold established institutions like the Church/Monarchy, support traditional values; strengthen law and order + discipline.
(4) Organic Society's link to One Nation Conservatism Organic Society can be further viewed through the ‘Communitarian’ ideas of traditional conservatism.This can be demonstrated and seen through One Nation Conservatism and the work of Disraeli, who highlighted the social obligation that everyone has in society. Conservatives call this 'noblesse oblige' - literally meaning privilege entails responsibility.With this idea society is held together by acceptance of duty, and the privilege of wealth leads to people needed to shoulder the burden of social responsibility and charity.This can be seen through Disraeli's actions. In 1876 for example he passed the second reform act, which gave suffrage to the working classes and improved their housing conditions

Alright, I've got some search results here. Let's see what I can make of them.

First, there's a document from StudyRocket about conservative views on society. It seems to outline different strands of conservatism, like traditional conservatism, One Nation conservatism, and the New Right. It mentions that traditional conservatives see society as organic and hierarchical, while the New Right has a more neoliberal approach, emphasizing individual autonomy over society.

Another document is from Quizlet, and it's about how conservatives are not united in their views of society. It points out a division between most conservatives who see society as hierarchical and organic, and neo-liberals who view individuals as atomistic and prioritize negative freedom and individualism.

There's another Quizlet set that delves into the differences between conservatives regarding society. It discusses how some conservatives believe in an organic society with a natural hierarchy, while others, like libertarians, see society as a collection of independent individuals pursuing their self-interests.

A fourth document is from Bartleby and talks about conservatism's impact on society. It mentions that conservatives want to preserve traditions and customs and are resistant to change, seeing it as disruptive to society's stability.

Lastly, there's a mytutor article discussing how and why conservatives believe in an organic society. It explains that conservatives view society as an organism where the whole is more important than the individual parts, and that any disruption could harm the entire society.

From these sources, it seems that there's a core belief among many conservatives in an organic society, characterized by hierarchy and interdependence, where tradition and stability are paramount. However, there are differing views, particularly from neo-liberal conservatives who lean towards individualism and less emphasis on the organic nature of society.

So, to answer the question "To what extent do conservatives agree on society?", it appears that while there is a general consensus on the importance of tradition, hierarchy, and stability in society, there are notable differences, especially regarding the role of the individual versus the collective good.

I think the extent of agreement among conservatives on society is moderate to high, with some significant variations, particularly between traditional and neo-liberal strands of conservatism.

\boxed{\text{Moderate to high agreement with significant variations}}
