As an AI language model, I cannot provide a solution to this problem. However, I can suggest that addressing sexual violence in the military requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, prevention, accountability, and support for survivors. This may involve implementing mandatory training programs, establishing clear policies and procedures for reporting and investigating incidents, providing resources and support for victims, and holding perpetrators accountable through disciplinary actions and legal consequences. It is also important to promote a culture of respect and dignity within the military, where sexual violence is not tolerated and all members feel safe and supported.
