Alright, I need to figure out what makes a good play-based learning environment. I'm not entirely sure where to start, so maybe I should look up some information on play-based learning first. I think it's important to understand what play-based learning is before I can determine its features.

Let me try to define play-based learning. From what I know, play-based learning is an approach where children learn through playing. It's a hands-on method where kids explore, experiment, and discover things on their own or in groups. It's supposed to be fun and engaging, which motivates children to learn without feeling like they're in a traditional classroom setting.

But I need to make sure that's accurate. Maybe I should do a quick search to confirm.

What is play-based learning?
In your search for the right preschool, you may have come across programs that label themselves as “play-based”. Play-based learning is a common term in the early childhood education world. But what does it really mean?
In this post, we’ll take a look at what play-based learning is, how it compares to academic-based preschools, and how play-based learning prepares children for kindergarten – even if doesn’t seem to.
FIND CHILD CARE NEAR YOU
If you decide play-based learning is right for your family, we will also discuss what to look for in a play-based program and where you can find one near you!
What exactly is play-based learning?
Play-based learning is a type of early childhood education based on child-led and open-ended play. If you’re picturing preschoolers finger painting or ‘playing house’, you’re spot on.
Play itself is a voluntary, enjoyable activity with no purpose or end goal. Believe it or not, activities like this lay the foundation for a child to become a curious and excited learner later in life. Play-based learning helps children develop social skills, motivation to learn, and even language and numeracy skills. Taking initiative, focused attention, and curiosity about the world are all a part of play.
Children are naturally wired to do the very thing that will help them learn and grow. According to the NAEYC, “The impulse to play comes from a natural desire to understand the world.”
What play is NOT
Play is not ‘work’. Play is not directed or prescribed by an adult and there’s no desired outcome in play like in more ‘work-oriented’ activities. While both ‘play’ and ‘work’ can contribute to a child’s development, they are different from each other.
Recently, certain activities have been labeled as “play-based learning” when in fact they’re gamified work. For example, using a song or game to get children to differentiate between “big A” and “little a” is not play-based learning – it’s work disguised as play. (But it’s still a great idea to make learning fun by turning it into a game!)
A good way to differentiate the two is if there’s an agenda for the activity, it’s likely not true play-based learning. Your kid won’t get the same benefits they would from true play-based learning (they may get different benefits though!)
Elements of play-based learning
Play-based learning includes the following elements:
Self chosen: A child voluntary chooses to play, how they’ll play, and for how long. An adult may initiate play insofar as he or she invites or suggests play but the child determines the rest.
Enjoyable: Play is enjoyable for the child. This emotional aspect is important. There may be some frustrations or disagreements during play but overall it’s pleasurable.
Unstructured: A child has ample time to explore and discover during play. They’re directed by their own interests, not by any prescribed rules or plans.
Process-oriented: There is no end or learning goal. Instead, it’s the process of play that’s important.
Make believe: Play often involves imagination, ‘make believe’, or ‘playing pretend’.
Definitions of play-based versus academic learning
Play-based and academic preschools differ in overall learning theory as well as day-to-day activities.
Play-based learning helps a child develop holistically through social-emotional learning, developing confidence and motivation, and practicing cognitive skills. The academic or traditional approach to early childhood education is more focused on teaching young children cognitive skills and knowledge through structure and routine.
In play-based learning, children choose their own activities for the day. The room is often broken up into sections or stations like a block area, dramatic play area, and reading nook, among others. Play-based programs are also sometimes called ‘child-centered’ because the children guide their own learning with their curiosity and interests.
Meanwhile, academic programs are teacher-led and meant to prepare children for kindergarten. The teacher comes up with activities or games to help children learn letters and distinguish shapes, sounds, and colors. Children may spend time practicing handwriting or filling in worksheets. These programs are typically very structured with a daily routine and lots of activity prep from the teacher.
You may encounter a program that incorporates a little bit of both. Different parts of the day may be reserved for different types of learning.
You may also see a program that combines play-based learning with other learning philosophies like Montessori, Waldorf, or Reggio Emilia.
“Play is the work of the child.” – Maria Montessori
Pros and Cons of Play-based vs Academic programs
Both play-based learning and academic learning have their pros and cons. Choosing one or the other for your child will depend on what you’re looking for in an early education program and how your child learns best.
Play-based learning programs: Pros
Children get to choose their own activities and topics and this keeps them interested
Contributes to kindergarten readiness:
Play helps develop social skills and children with social skills are more successful in academics later on
Children in play-based programs score better on measures of self-regulation, cognitive flexibility, and working memory (Diamond et al. 2007 ). Self-regulation and impulse control is predictive of later academic success
Play-based learning programs: Cons
Children may not be exposed directly to learning letters, numbers, or scientific concepts
Children may not score as highly on standardized testing (until after first grade)
Academic programs: Pros
Early attention skills are predictive of academic success later on
Children are more familiar with academic subjects by the time they enter kindergarten
Academic programs: Cons
Can cause children to lose interest because they are being told what to learn and do
Children in academic programs have been shown to score higher on standardized tests than their counterparts but this gap closes by first grade
Children in academic programs often have more behavior problems than those in play-based programs
Teaching academics earlier doesn’t lead to faster cognitive development
One of the most important things children need is self-confidence and judging them and telling them their ideas are ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ instills the opposite. It can make them feel ashamed or embarrassed for trying.
Teacher-led learning can dampen creativity and curiosity (Fuller et al. 2017)
How do play-based environments support children’s development?
You may be wondering, how is my child learning if they’re just playing all day?! What do kids learn through play?
Even if it looks like your kid is just having fun, play has a major impact on their development in every way.
As the Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said, “Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights as a right of every child.”
Studies have conclusively shown play contributes to the following types of child development:
Social-emotional development
According to the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), social-emotional learning is when children “acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions.”
Children develop socially and emotionally through play as they imagine the world from a different perspective, understand the differences between themselves and others, learn how to interact with others, and more.
Trying on different roles during play helps children learn how other people feel and think. When they role play and act out scenarios, they’re exploring the possibilities of their actions in the real world.
The social aspect of play helps children build friendships and learn how to cooperate and work together. It offers opportunities for them to learn to resolve conflict (Blasi & Hurwitz 2012, Erickson 1985, Pellegrini & Smith 1998 ).
Playing with others also helps children establish a sense of self. They can initiate play and make decisions, which empowers them to become confident and motivated learners.
Creating art in a play-based learning environment exposes children to process vs product-focused art. Process-focused art experiences have no rules and no examples to guide the children. There is no right or wrong way to create. Meanwhile, product-focused art is based on instructions and guided by examples the teacher makes. In this type of art, there is a ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ way to create. Process focused art benefits children by allowing them to express their feelings or ideas the way they want to and they feel successful no matter what they make.
Play reduced stress and serves as an outlet for anxiety
Cognitive development
Cognitive development is a child’s growing ability to use their intellect to process information. It includes problem-solving, language learning, and the interpretation of sensations.
Play has been shown to support healthy brain development (Shonkoff & Phillips 2000, Frost 1998 ). It also engages a child’s mind and helps them hone early literacy and language skills, sensation and perception, and even basic science and math.
Doing art like making collages or adding names to drawings helps children learn to represent ideas through images, use letters to convey meaning, and understand the purpose of writing.
When children play, they use their imagination. Imagination is all about symbols: a laundry basket symbolizes a car, a stick symbolizes a fishing rod, and so on. Understanding symbols is key to reading and writing, as letters are symbols. The same goes for mathematical concepts and numbers.
During dramatic play, children use language to talk to each other. They represent and act out stories, practicing their language and storytelling skills.
Children develop an elementary understanding of scientific concepts as they learn how the world around them works. For example, what happens when you stack one block on top of another or what the feathers of a bird feel like.
Physical development
Physical development refers to gross and fine motor skills development and how a child uses their body. Through play, children build muscle mass and coordination, explore different tactile experiences, and get a healthy amount of exercise.
Art and play expose children to different tactile experiences. They learn about the feeling of wooden blocks, soft plushy toys, wet paint, and more.
Play increases physical activity when compared to passive forms of entertainment like watching TV or playing games on an iPad (Burdette & Whitacker 2005 ).
Children build muscle mass and coordination as they jump, climb, swing, run, and move during play.
But will my child be ready for kindergarten?
The short answer is yes.
In a time when children are being pressured to achieve academic success before they even get to kindergarten, it’s important to look at the evidence that play-based learning absolutely prepares children for school.
Play-based learning contributes to kindergarten readiness
According to a study conducted by the Gesell Institute for Human Development, even though kindergarten has become increasingly focused on academic skills, children pass cognitive milestones at the same rate as in the past, before kindergarten became this serious.
In this study, researchers did cognitive assessments with children ages 3-6 in schools across the country and found there was no significant difference in development between these children and children from past studies from 1925, 1940, 1964 and 1979. Ultimately, teaching academic skills earlier does not affect a child’s natural pace of development.
It’s important that when your kid gets to kindergarten, they’re comfortable in a school setting, comfortable engaging with other children, and excited to learn. Emotional learning is as important, if not more, as academic skills learning. This is what they will acquire in a play-based program.
How do I know my child is learning?
A high-quality play-based preschool will help children:
Adjust to a school setting
Be ready to learn
Acquire better problem-solving skills
Have better learning behaviors
“Play is the highest form of research.” – Albert Einstein
Overall, the program will establish a basis for learning as your child gets older. There are certain kindergarten readiness indicators you can look for as your preschooler nears age 5 or 6. Here are just a few examples, drawn from Arkansas’s Department of Human Services Kindergarten Readiness Indicator Checklist:
Physical development: Catches a ball with both hands
Language: Uses 4-6 word sentences
Literacy: Listens and engages in stories
Social-emotional development: Shares and plays with others
Cognitive development: Sorts objects by color, shape, and size
How do I find a good play-based program?
What to look for in a play-based program
A quality play-based program can be hard to find if you don’t know what you’re looking for. Here are some suggestions of what to look for as you compare your options:
A program that incorporates the children’s natural interests into the daily flow
Both indoor and outdoor play
A variety of play spaces available, like dramatic play areas, block building area, and sensory area
Children get to self-select their play experience and materials
Children can play for long periods of time without interruption
Children have the opportunity to play with others and to play alone as well
The adult supervisor’s role is to view the child as confident and a director of his or her own learning experience. The caregiver in a play-based program learns about the individual children and families in the program and makes adjustments accordingly. They should also interact with, offer suggestions, and support children.
Incorporate play-based learning at home
It’s important for children to play with each other, but also for parents to play with their children. You could play outdoors by throwing a ball, digging in the mud, or swinging on a swing set with your little one.
You could play indoors by dancing to music, letting them tell you stories with stuffed animals, or doing puzzles together. First 5 California has some more ideas of ways to play with your children here.

Intro to Play-Based Learning: What is it, why is it important, how to do it
posted by Editor | filed under teaching tips | affiliate disclosure
You may have heard before that play is the work of children. But what does that mean? How can play possibly align with curriculum, meet standards, and help our students learn? The truth is: children learn best through play – it takes fewer repetitions to fully learn a new concept when it is learned through play and exploration. No wonder so many early childhood educators are realigning their focus to Play-Based Learning.
Play isn’t a break from learning. Quite the contrary, it’s a time where your little learners are developing skills that can’t be taught with worksheets. If you have been like Jack, all work and no play, and need some help with play-based learning, you’re in the right place!
Play-Based Learning – What Is It?
Play-based learning means that children are engaging in materials that are interesting to them, allowed to make choices in their environment, and using their own imagination to construct meaning with materials.
With play-based learning, the teacher still uses standards, but sets up an environment in which children have options for learning. Materials are at the child’s eye level, organized simply for easy clean up, and facilitate interactions. The child’s interest and engagement direct the learning.
Why Is Play-Based Learning Important?
We are our students’ first exposure to a school setting. We have a responsibility to create safety and enjoyment in the classroom, to set up a love of learning that will last far beyond early childhood. Play-based learning is step one.
When children are engaged in play, they are constructing meaning from their world. They are practicing new skills in a way that is meaningful to them, and they have the opportunity to experiment with different outcomes. For example, a child might notice, “I put the big block on top and my tower fell down. What if I put it on bottom this time?” That same child could sit through whole lesson on structurally sound towers and never make that connection – but through play (experiment and failure), she is able to come to the conclusion herself.
But How Do I Do It?
The first step of play-based learning is to use the classroom as the third teacher. (Parents are the first teacher; you are the second teacher.) Take a look at your room – is it set up for children to access materials or are your shelves storage for you? Can children move around freely and safely? It is crucial that the students feel some ownership of the space to encourage exploration.
Next, be ready to model play. In the block example above, perhaps the student hasn’t figured out why her tower is toppling. Then a teacher can sit down and build her own tower, putting the bigger block on top and letting the tower fall. The teacher models thinking aloud, “My tower fell down when I put this block on top. This block is big and heavy. I wonder if it’s too heavy for the top? Maybe I could put it on the bottom?” This modeling gives students a guideline for their own thinking about the problem. The teacher does not tell the child what to do or how to solve the problem. The teacher shows the thinking about the problem. The child may or may not “catch it” at first but will begin to think about possibilities on her own.
Finally, set your success criteria. Are you working on one-to-one correspondence? What different play opportunities would encourage that thinking? Maybe the goal for the week is “I can set the table in the home-living center with one plate, one fork, and one spoon for every chair.” Share the goal with the students, and let them practice on their own. What if they don’t? Relax. Notice it when it happens: “You put one plate for each chair. Four plates, four chairs.” But let the children play and build that understanding as they grow.
Play-based learning will change the whole atmosphere of your classroom – your students will be more engaged, they will learn crucial social-emotional skills, and you will feel the joy of helping students explore and learn in a way that is most meaningful for them!

Defining Play-based Learning

Introduction
Since the early 2000s, there has been a shift towards recommending the use of play-based learning in early education curricula across several different countries, including Canada, 1 Sweden, 2 China 3 United Arab Emirates, 4 and New Zealand. 2 This paper introduces some of the key issues surrounding the pedagogy of play-based learning, including defining types of play, perspectives and recent findings regarding the benefits of play, and discussions regarding the role of the educator in play to facilitate learning.
Subject
Play-based learning is, essentially, to learn while at play. Although the exact definition of play continues to be an area of debate in research, including what activities can be counted as play, 5 play-based learning is distinct from the broader concept of play. Learning is not necessary for an activity to be perceived as play but remains fundamental to the definition of play-based learning 6 Within studies that have examined the benefits of play-based learning, two different types of play have been the primary focus: free play, which is directed by the children themselves, 7 and guided play, which is play that has some level of teacher guidance or involvement. 8
Free play is typically described as play that is child-directed, voluntary, internally motivated, and pleasurable. 9,10 One type of free play frequently endorsed is sociodramatic play, where groups of children practice imaginative role-playing through creating and following social rules such as pretending to be different family members. 11 On the other hand, the term guided play refers to play activities with some level of adult involvement to embed or extend additional learning opportunities within the play itself. 12 A range of terminology has been used to refer to types of guided play activities (e.g., centre-based learning, 13 purposefully framed play 14 ); however, one distinction that can be made is who has control over the play activity: Some activities are described as teacher-directed, such as intentionally planned games, 15,16 while others are described as mutually directed, where teachers get involved without taking over or transforming the activity so that both teachers and students exercise some control over the play. 17,18 One example of teacher-directed play is the modification of a children’s board game to include actions that practice numerical thinking and spatial skills, 19 while one example of mutually-directed play is a teacher observing students acting out a popular movie and suggesting that the class make their own movie, which leads to creating and writing a script, researching relevant topics, and practicing different roles in a collaborative manner. 20 This distinction between free play, mutually directed play, and teacher-directed play is useful for examining the growing body of literature on different types of play-based learning.
Although the hypothesis that play fulfills a fundamental role in child development has been contested, 21 there is a growing body of evidence in favour of the use of play-based learning to support multiple areas of development and learning. However, there is also a lack of agreement among both researchers and educators regarding the role and value of different types of play in the classroom.
Research Context and Results
Examinations of play-based learning in early education tend to be approached from two differing viewpoints: one focused on the benefits of play for developmental learning 22 and one focused on the benefits of play for academic learning. 23 Developmental learning includes areas such as social-emotional skills, general cognitive development, and self-regulation abilities. Articles focused on the developmental benefits of play-based learning have frequently endorsed the important role of child-directed free play in the classroom. These researchers have highlighted concerns regarding decreases in free play time due to an increased focus on meeting academic benchmarks through teacher-directed instruction. 24 For example, it has been proposed that children construct knowledge about the world and practice problem solving skills during times of child-led exploration at different play centres. 25
Some studies have found that students engage in more effective problem solving behaviours in child-directed play conditions than in more formal, teacher-directed settings. 26,27 Child-directed play with peers has been highlighted as an important endeavour for children to develop social and emotional competencies, such as leading and following rules, resolving conflicts, and supporting the emotional well-being of others. 22 Providing children with opportunities to negotiate and follow rules during play has also been connected to the development of self-regulation skills. 28 Many developmental learning benefits have been linked to child-directed free play contexts where educators take on an indirect or passive role, such as one who observes or prepares the environment to encourage free play. 29 Alternatively, research focused on play and academic learning has examined how play-based activities impact student learning in academic subject areas such as literacy and mathematics. These researchers tend to promote the use of mutually directed and teacher-directed play activities to support academic learning, where educators take an active role in the play such as leading pre-designed games, collaborating with students, and intervening in child-led play to incorporate learning targets. 15,30,31 Proponents of play-based learning for academic growth have argued that play-based strategies can be used to teach prescribed academic goals in an engaging and developmentally appropriate manner. 31,32 From this perspective, free play alone is often considered to be insufficient to promote academic learning, and so active teacher involvement in play is critical. 15
Recent research has supported this type of play-based learning for academic development. For example, students in classrooms following a play-based kindergarten math curriculum that implemented teacher-directed math games were found to outperform students in control classrooms on general assessments of mathematical skills. 30 Similarly, children following a play-based literacy curriculum centred around mutually-directed play where educators incorporated target vocabulary words into play contexts were observed to utilize these newly taught words more frequently than children taught using direct instruction. 33
Research Gaps
Developmental and academic perspectives on play-based learning have progressed with differing recommendations regarding the types of play endorsed and the optimal role of educators implementing this pedagogy. 34 Researchers focused on the developmental benefits of play-based learning have emphasized the importance of free play and a passive teacher role, while researchers focused on the academic benefits have emphasized the importance of teacher-directed and mutually directed play with an active teacher role. Few studies have addressed the topic of integrating developmental and academic perspectives together. 34
These differing recommendations have resulted in an area of confusion for educators, with recent classroom-based studies finding similar variations among educators regarding perspectives and implementations of play-based learning. Teachers who endorsed the developmental benefits of play were found to primarily facilitate free play in their classrooms, while teachers who endorsed the academic benefits of play facilitated a broader range of play activities with active teacher involvement. 6,35 Furthermore, some common challenges with following play-based learning curricula have been reported by educators, such as struggling to see the academic value of play, a lack of formal training in play-based learning, and pressure to engage in direct instruction to achieve prescribed academic outcomes. 36,37 Both developmental and academic learning are important components addressed in early years curricula to be taught through play-based learning. 38,39 However, guidance regarding how educators can integrate and balance different recommended practices within an academic-focused curriculum remains largely absent.
Conclusions and Implications
Educators implementing play-based learning curricula are currently faced with the challenge of integrating mandated academic standards within play-based pedagogy. While some researchers and educators have endorsed the viewpoint that play should remain a child-directed endeavor, 40,41 educators have reported concern over meeting academic standards without being able to impart some direction during times of play. 6 Considering the evidence, an integrated approach to play-based learning that addresses both developmental and academic benefits is recommended.
In order to integrate developmental and academic approaches, play-based learning can be conceptualized as a continuum that incorporates varying levels of adult involvement in play. Child-directed activities (free play) are situated at one end of the continuum while teacher-directed play (learning through games) falls at the other end, with mutually directed play (collaboratively designed play) falling in the middle. 6 When implementing a continuum of play-based learning, educators negotiate a balance between allocating time for uninterrupted free play and embedding or extending academic content in different ways within playful activities to support children’s learning. 6 By providing a range of play types in the classroom where educators take on a variety of roles, the learning of both developmental and academic skills can be addressed in a child-centred, engaging, and developmentally appropriate manner. It is hoped that this broader definition of play-based learning can help to bridge the gap between developmental and academic perspectives on play, as well as enhance the practice of educators implementing play-based pedagogy in the early years.

What is play based learning | Goodstart
What is play-based learning?
Children learn so much through play. It allows them to explore, discover, negotiate, take risks, create meaning and solve problems – all the important foundations for developing literacy, numeracy and social skills.
It is central to the Australian Government’s Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), and while it may sound simple and easy, play-based learning is a complex form of natural enquiry that requires an experienced educator who knows each child’s overall development, emerging strengths and interests.
Through play-based learning, skilled educators can introduce and reinforce concepts we want children to learn in a way that engages each child’s interests.
Play based learning capitalises on children’s natural sense of inquiry and discovery through hands-on exploration of the world around them. Educators embed elements of teaching and learning within the play experiences that children are interested in and naturally drawn to – and therefore more likely to stay engaged with. This is why the educator has to know each individual child so well, to know what they are interested in and how each child learns best.
Here’s an example: Educators may be intending to explore aspects of early numeracy and literacy with the children in their group. However this learning does not take place in an old fashioned “chalk and talk” type lesson. Rather the educators will embed aspects of numeracy and literacy within the play that children are currently exploring.
So some children in the room, who may be exploring gardening, may be encouraged to chart how their vegie patch has changed over the past month. While another group of children may be supported to write/draw a ‘menu’ for their pretend restaurant, while yet another child who is deeply interested in dinosaurs may be encouraged to discuss and document the similarities and differences between the various dinosaurs he has come across.
These early literacy skills of pre-writing, drawing and mathematical concepts of classifying and charting are explored through play in ways that are authentic to the child.
As an example, when parents give their child a puzzle to do, it’s an opportunity to interact and have fun together. But for an early childhood educator, it’s an opportunity to work with children to explore educational concepts such as pattern-matching, problem-solving, numerical and mathematical concepts such as part/whole and shape, along with language skills too. Plus it’s a great opportunity to help children develop self-confidence and self-esteem at the same time.
You see, play-based learning is purposeful and what we call ‘intentional’. Educators carefully and deliberately plan play based experiences to help children learn about educational concepts involved in literacy, numeracy, technology, social skills and more in a way that’s meaningful and enjoyable to them.

Making children’s learning visible
We record and collect each child’s experiences, observations, ideas and creative expressions to help us build a rich and individual learning program.
Children are active learners and they learn naturally through exploration – by touching, moving, listening, seeing and experiencing. Our educator’s roles are to support and enrich your child’s learning by:
Providing resources and opportunities for children to explore.
Using materials, such as paint, clay, musical instruments and writing implements for children to express themselves.
Questioning and encouraging children to think creatively, investigate and solve problems.
Making learning ‘visible’ – that is, by using cameras, video recorders and written observations to document your child’s thoughts and ideas as they learn. We collect their experiences, comments, ideas, learning stories, photos, and observations. Our educators use this information to develop an individually tailored learning program for all children.
Parents are encouraged to contribute information about what their child is doing and learning outside Goodstart as this continuity between home and early learning can greatly enhance your child’s learning and development.
Individuality
Every child is different. Each one has a special set of qualities and skills, and brings their own blend of experiences and perspectives to their learning. This is why, at Goodstart, there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ program. Our educators create a unique learning program for your child, designed to bring out the best in their emerging competencies, interests and strengths.
Inclusion
The Goodstart family is a rich and vibrant blend of cultures, backgrounds and experiences, and when your family joins us, we want to get to know you. By building strong, meaningful relationships with all our families, we can individualise learning experiences to better suit your child’s culture, interests, needs, abilities, disabilities and learning style.

Play-based Learning
Child-centered, play-based learning is a whole-child educational approach that promotes academic, socio-emotional, and cognitive development through free play, which can also involve guided play by an adult. In guided play, teachers enhance children’s exploration and learning with helpful guidance while being careful not to be invasive in the children’s play. 1 Play-based learning has been described as developmentally appropriate learning for young children, where children learn at their own pace through the natural process of play. 2
A play-based learning environment for children contains many stimulating opportunities for play that include dramatic play props and dress-up clothes, blocks, toys, and loose parts, art materials, musical instruments, books, and writing implements. These play things allow for open-ended play and experimentation and an imaginative expression of ideas that are key to a child’s understanding of his world. 3
In a classroom that supports play-based learning the children are given opportunities to engage in unstructured child-centered free play. As the teacher observes an activity that is holding the children’s interest, she then can plan her teaching by building play experiences that will incorporate her standards-based goals and objectives in a playful and stimulating setting. By taking advantage of the highly engaging nature of the children’s play, the introduction of math, science, language, and literacy concepts can then be taught in a subtle, but meaningful context. 4 The goal of a play-based curriculum is to foster in children a love of discovery and exploration, encourage curiosity, and develop a desire for lifelong learning.
In a play-based classroom, opportunities to learn about reading, writing, and math are introduced through real, meaningful situations rather than traditional classroom instruction. This helps the children think abstractly by experiencing real objects using their senses. A necessary pre-requisite to understanding print and literacy concepts can be achieved through symbolic play with concrete objects seen as symbols. Important math concepts can be internalized by the sorting, categorizing, putting items in a series, and other problem-solving tasks created in play. 5 Make-believe play helps young children “expand vocabulary and link objects with actions, develop object constancy, form event schemas and scripts, learn strategies for problem solving, develop divergent thinking ability, and develop a flexibility in shifting between different types of thought.” 6
Creativity and problem-solving abilities are enhanced by playful learning. Professionals in scientific fields, such as computer science, physics, engineering, mathematics, and others, stress the value of playful learning to promote curiosity, innovation, and thinking outside of the box. 7
Many educators and play theorists have been proponents of play-based learning in classroom settings for years. Maria Montessori observed that children concentrated most effectively when they were interested in the activity and that they are intrinsically motivated to learn. 8 Montessori classrooms and Waldorf Schools both promote stimulating environments that allow for incorporating learning with play.
There has been a shift in early childhood classrooms to adult-directed, instruction-based philosophies to meet the demands for focusing on the achievement of functional skills, such as pre-literacy and mathematics, of young children before they may be developmentally ready. Time for play in kindergartens has been replaced with desk work, and even recess has often been reduced in an effort to meet classroom standards determined by school administrators. 9 Many experts believe that the increased reports of behavior problems with the rise in anger and aggression in young children point to the lack of play opportunities and inappropriate expectations of academic standards. 10
There is concern that the standardized curriculum and high-stakes testing in most elementary schools discourages the opportunities for play-based learning, which in turn could negatively affect the future workforce. Skepticism about the value of play has led to the prevailing thought that children should be taught at earlier ages the basic elements of reading with phonics and letter recognition to promote success in school. However, recent research has shown that the play-based approach produces equally good or better results in reading and other intellectual skills than those denied play and are more likely to result in well-adjusted healthy people. 11

Alright, so I've got these documents about play-based learning. Let's see what they say about features of a good play-based learning environment.

First, Doc 1 from Wonderschool defines play-based learning as a type of early childhood education based on child-led and open-ended play. It mentions that play is voluntary, enjoyable, unstructured, process-oriented, and often involves imagination. It's different from academic-based learning, which is more structured and focused on teaching specific cognitive skills.

So, a key feature seems to be that it's child-led and self-chosen. The child decides what to play and how, and the environment should support that.

Doc 2 from Pre-K Pages talks about setting up the classroom as the "third teacher." It should be organized in a way that children can access materials easily, and the environment facilitates interactions and learning through play.

This suggests that the physical setup is important. Shelves should be at child eye level, materials should be organized simply for easy cleanup, and there should be various play areas like dramatic play, blocks, and sensory areas.

Also, the teacher's role is crucial. Instead of directing play, the teacher observes and maybe models play to show thinking processes, but doesn't tell the child what to do.

Doc 3 from the Child Encyclopedia provides a more academic perspective. It distinguishes between free play, which is child-directed, and guided play, which has some level of teacher involvement.

It seems that both types have their places. Free play allows for social-emotional development and self-regulation, while guided play can embed academic learning goals within play.

So, a good play-based learning environment probably includes both free play and guided play, depending on the learning objectives.

Doc 4 from Goodstart emphasizes that play-based learning is purposeful and intentional. Educators plan play experiences that help children learn educational concepts in a way that's meaningful and enjoyable.

They also mention making learning visible by documenting children's experiences and observations to build individualized learning programs.

This suggests that documentation and assessment are important parts of play-based learning, even though the learning is happening through play.

Lastly, Doc 5 from PGPedia reinforces that play-based learning is child-centered and promotes holistic development. The environment should be rich with stimulating materials that allow for open-ended play and imagination.

It also mentions that in a play-based classroom, learning about reading, writing, and math happens through real, meaningful situations rather than traditional instruction.

So, summarizing these points, features of a good play-based learning environment include:

1. **Child-Led Activities**: Children choose what they want to play and how, with minimal adult intervention.

2. **Accessible Environment**: The classroom is set up to be inviting and easy for children to navigate, with materials placed at their eye level.

3. **Variety of Play Areas**: Different zones for various types of play, such as blocks, dramatic play, sensory play, art, etc.

4. **Teacher's Role**: Observing, modeling, and guiding when necessary, but not directing the play.

5. **Integration of Learning Goals**: Embedding educational concepts into play activities in a natural way.

6. **Documentation and Assessment**: Recording children's play and learning to inform future planning and support their development.

7. **Stimulating Materials**: Providing a range of open-ended materials that encourage exploration and imagination.

8. **Real-World Connections**: Linking play activities to real-life situations to make learning meaningful.

I think these are the main features based on the information I've gathered. It's important to strike a balance between free play and guided play to support both social-emotional development and academic learning.
