Alright, so I need to figure out what effect social media has on people. That's a pretty broad question, right? Social media is everywhere nowadays, and lots of people use it daily. But what exactly are the impacts it has on us? I guess there are both positive and negative aspects to consider.

First, maybe I should think about the positive effects. One thing that comes to mind is connectivity. Social media allows people to connect with others all around the world. You can stay in touch with friends and family who live far away, which is great. Also, it provides platforms for like-minded individuals to form communities and share interests. For example, if someone is passionate about environmental issues, they can join groups and discuss ways to make a difference.

Another positive aspect is access to information. Social media platforms are filled with news and updates from all over the place. People can stay informed about what's happening in the world without having to rely solely on traditional news sources. This can be empowering because it allows for a more diverse range of perspectives.

Moreover, social media can be a tool for self-expression. Many people use it to share their thoughts, creativity, and experiences with others. It can boost confidence and self-esteem when posts receive positive feedback from the community.

Now, moving on to the negative effects. One major concern is mental health. There's a lot of research suggesting that excessive use of social media can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Comparing自己的生活他人在社交媒体上展示的完美生活可能导致不满和不满足感。

此外，社交媒体上的虚假信息和谣言传播也是一个问题。由于信息的传播速度极快，错误或误导性的内容可以迅速扩散，影响公众意见和决策。

隐私也是个大问题。社交媒体公司收集大量用户数据，有时这些数据可能被滥用或泄露，侵犯用户的隐私权。

还有，社交媒体成瘾是一个现实问题。很多人发现自己花在社交媒体上的时间超出了他们的意图，这可能会影响他们的生产力、学业或工作表现。

另外，网络欺凌和 harassment 是社交媒体上常见的问题。匿名性和距离可能导致一些人行为不当，对他人造成伤害。

也许我应该更深入地研究一下这些点。比如，关于心理健康的影响，有哪些具体的统计数据或研究支持这一点？或者，关于虚假信息的传播，有什么有效的对策吗？

也许我可以进行一些搜索来获取更多信息。

10 Interesting Social Media and Mental Health Statistics

Scroll, post, like, comment. Scroll, post, like, comment. Scroll, post, like, comment.
It’s a never-ending circle, that we’ve come to call a daily routine.
With billions of users all around the world,social media giants have, quite literally, taken over our lives.
But how does this all affect our mental health? Could it actually be true, does social media cause depression ?
Shockingly, yes.
Avid users of social media platforms have a 60% higher chance of experiencing depression. According to social media and mental health statistics, teenagers and young adults were identified as those at highest risk. They are experiencing the emotional high and lows of their formative years, making them more susceptible to the effects of social media.
Social Media and Mental Health Statistics (Editor’s Choice)
Of all US teenagers, 95% have been reported to be on social media daily.
Approximately 86% of online teens post on social media consistently (at least six times per day).
A massive 77% of online teens and adults use Facebook.
83% of adult internet users use social media on a consistent basis.
Reports that examine social media effects on mental health show that 32% of all time spent online (adults and teenagers) is spent social networking.
A total of 36% of teens and young adults log into social media platforms ten times or more a day.
Facebook has estimated that their average user spends 20.3 hours a month on their site.
Mental Health And Social Media: The General Facts And Figures
Let’s see what social media and self-esteem statistics we have prepared.
1. Reports show that 12th graders who use social media have 38% more chance of being depressed.
(Psycom)
In 2019, a countrywide analysis was made on children from the 8th to the 12th grade to ascertain how does social media affect teens .
The results revealed that children that used social media for 2 hours a day or more, were 33% more susceptible to developing depression.
No wonder some parents are trying to fight this addiction. But it won’t be an easy fight:
2. Almost 93% of teens own a smartphone and use social media.
(Newport Academy)
Studies from 2019 that were conducted to find out the psychological effects of social media on youth suggest that 93% of teens own a smartphone. This is 11% more than figures showed in 2018.
This jump in smartphone ownership has also brought with it a rise in social media usage. Teens are primarily using their phones for social media.
So what does this mean in terms of social media and depression statistics?
Because of that, 82% of these teens were having symptoms of depression within a month of consistent visits to social media platforms.
3. From 2015 to 2019 there was a 30% spike in teens on social media.
(Child Mind)
According to social media addiction statistics, from 2015 to 2019 there has been a massive surge in teenage social media usage across the entire US.
In 2019 it was revealed that the 30% rise in social media usage had also brought about with it a 82% rise in teens suffering from depressive symptoms. Despite there being positive effects of social media on mental health, these effects were swamped under the more pronounced negative effects.
4. Almost 60% of teens and young adults look at their phones just before sleeping.
(Ed Source)
It has been reported that teens and young adults are using their smartphones more frequently. Mostly during the night.
58% of teens and young adults to be exact, have been found to be using their phones in bed, right before they sleep. Many users have even confirmed falling asleep while being on their phones. While this figure seems harmless at first glance, there is a dark side – the negative effects of social media on mental health.
Phone usage generates a form of unnatural light. This light mimics the effects of daylight. Which in turn results in the receptors of the human brain to be caught in a state of flux. The conscious brain of the individual telling the brain and body to rest. The light from the users phone instructing the body and mind that it is in fact daytime and they should stay awake. As you can see, this all leads to negative health effects, as stated by social media and sleep deprivation statistics.
Studies from 2018 and 2019 confirm that an average of 60% of all young adults and teens scroll social media for at least 60 minutes before sleeping.
They are estimated to experience 38% less sleep time than the rest.
5. Mental health occurrences in teens and young adults have increased by 29% over the last 2 years.
(Science Daily)
The instances of mental health occurrences have soared by 29% from 2017 to 2019.
But how does social media cause depression?
Although playing games on a phone isn’t an ideal use of time, going on social media can be a much more damaging experience for a teen or young adult. Social media exposes an adolescent to a myriad of dangers – from cyberbullying to information that causes distress. According to social media depression study, an adolescent can develop any number of mental health problems.
6. Reports say that 12% of US citizens are addicted to social media.
(Psychology Today)
According to stats from 2019, an average of 12% US citizens are officially addicted to social media platforms.
Social media is defined as a behavioral problem that leads to an individual becoming excessively focussed or concerned with the state of their social media account. That definitely lends weight to the argument about the consequences of social media.
Unfortunately, a total of 12% of US citizens are addicted to social media in this manner at present. Even more concerning is the fact that analysts predict that this percentage is set to rise over the coming years.
7. A total of 39% of students experienced cyberbullying in 2019.
(Comparitech)
In America, cyberbullying is a major problem. Figures from 2019 show that 39% of students have reported having experienced it.
The issue of cyberbullying is starting to become a worldwide epidemic, lending weight to the negative effects of Instagram, and other social media platforms. With more countries showing increasing stats to support the ever-growing scope of the issue, cyberbullying has become a hot topic for debate.
Many experts believe that increased social media usage is to blame for this problem because social media exposes such a large part of our personal lives, the platforms make for a perfect way for bullies to target and victimize on a more personal level.
The 39% figure for students experiencing cyberbullying is worrying, as this 15% higher than the statistics from 2018, which clearly shows that the problem is not only on the rise but is also not being addressed effectively.
Worse still, social media and self-esteem statistics predict an increase in cyberbullying. Government departments have been granted federal assistance in order to conduct research on how to reduce these numbers. Whether these measures work, is yet to be seen.
8. Studies show that kids aged between 12 to 15 that use social media are prone to develop depression.
(Technology Review)
As we’ve discussed so far, social media has a very strong link to the onset of depression. Almost any age demographic is susceptible to the negative psychological effects of Facebook, and social media in general.
However, one group that is truly at risk of developing depression-related symptoms from using social media is that of children aged between 12 to 15 years of age. This age range has been shown to be 5 times as likely to develop depression as any other group.
Experts say that during this age children are making the slow, and often tricky, transition into their teens and beyond. According to social media and mental health issues researchers, this time in an individual’s life is delicate as the psyche has not fully developed. They are in effect seeking their place in the world, and learning to know and understand themselves.
Therefore, being at a vulnerable stage of life like this, the last thing a child needs is to be spending time staring at their phone, not developing their actual social skills. In addition, social media is a very harsh and judgemental place for anyone, even adults. Which means social media health effects that can arise from the criticism or comments that children can possibly receive in an environment such as this, can have damaging effects upon their character.
9. Surveys show the 1 in 5 teenagers has experienced some kind of abuse online.
(Help Guide)
It was revealed that 1 in 5 teenagers in the US experienced some type of abuse online. Reports from social media anxiety statistics show that some of the cases were sporadic, others were consistent. All results showed that a large number of teenagers had experienced some kind of abuse online.
Below is the breakdown of the types of abuse teenagers have experienced online and the percentage of them:
Incidents of name-calling – 42%.
Spreading of false rumors – 32%.
Receiving unsolicited and explicit images – 25%.
Having their activities tracked by a third party other than a parent – 21%.
Physical threats – 16%.
Having explicit images shared without consent – 7%.
10. Almost 95% of American teens believe that online harassment is a problem for them.
(Pew Research)
According to social media cyberbullying statistics, harassment online has become a huge problem in today’s internet-obsessed society.
This problem has become worse since the advent, and rise in popularity of, social media platforms. These platforms have become gateways for online abuse and allow bullies to easily target their victims. In some cases, bullies have become more productive in their victimizations.
When bullies are online it’s easy to multitask and bully multiple people on different platforms, something that contributes adversely to mental health and social media statistics.
An average of 93.9% of teens in the US view online harassment as an issue that they have to contend with. In addition, an average of 63% of all US teens view online harassment as a major problem in their lives. Of these teens, many are already on treatment plans to combat their symptoms of depression.
To Sum It All Up
Social media and mental health statistics show that social media platforms are playing a major role in teenage depression. But demonizing the platforms may not prove to be the answer.
Social media also has some positive aspects that can’t be ignored. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram also host a huge amount of positive content. They can be an outlet or safe place for introverts or those alienated by their peer groups. Social media platforms can also provide channels for teenagers to express their creativity. This gives a positive angle to the statistics on social media and mental health in teens.
So, instead of shutting down, outlawing, or discouraging teens from using social media platforms, a better solution could be to encourage positive uses of the platform. Highlighting constructive uses and activities that pertain to the platforms would help. Making social media a safe environment would go a long way in making social media and mental health facts more optimistic.

9 Stats About Social Media’s Impact On Mental Health That You Need To Know About
Scrolling through Instagram every day may have more of an impact than you think.

You know that iPhone feature that tells you how long you've spent on your phone each day? Pretty much everyone I know hates seeing that notification pop up. Yet somehow, we never make any conscious efforts to help that number go down.
We're well beyond the point of addiction when it comes to our phones. I'm willing to bet that for most of us, that addiction is mostly fueled by social media. FOMO, social acceptance, and just plain boredom all contribute to our desire, or really, our need, to be on Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat almost constantly.
But even if it may not seem like it, this constant engagement with social media is doing damage to our minds. One comparative study found that more time spent on social media can have negative impacts on mental health, and yet other statistics still show that we are growing more and more dependent on our devices. Cell phone dependency is dangerous, and studies have already shown that it can lead to negative mental health outcomes like depressive symptoms and loneliness.
That said, here are some important stats to know about so that you can finally step away from social media and start to focus on your own mental wellbeing.
1. A recent national survey shows that 8-18-year-olds spend an average of 6-7 hours a day on some form of mass media, and another study indicates that those aged 16-24 spend an average of about 3 hours on social media each day.
I wanted to first start out with these statistics, just so we're all aware of how large the following issues can become. According to ScienceDirect, the average teenager spends about six to seven hours on their electronic devices every day. From those six to seven hours, they spend an average amount of three hours on social media. With that much time online, there's bound to be some impact.
2. 97% of US adolescents report using at least 1 of the 7 most popular social media platforms (YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit).
It's important to note how long teens are consuming media, but it's also relevant to understand what exactly they're looking at when they do. According to JAMA Network, most US teens report going on at least one of the seven major social media sites. This has implications for things like social inclusion and indicates that if social media does have a negative effect on mental health, it's going to be impacting an overwhelming majority of adolescents.
3. Those who spend more than 3 hours per day on social media are at heightened risk for mental health problems in general, and teens who spend 5 or more hours a day on their electronic devices are 71% more likely to exhibit suicide risk factors.
Now, at this point, you may be thinking, "Come on, five HOURS?" And you'd be right to think that this number is high — it absolutely does sound like an outrageous amount of time. But I'd gently direct you back to statistic #1, which says that the average amount of time on electronic devices by this age group is about 1-2 hours ABOVE what this statistic says, and the average amount of time on social media is right in line with the time which can cause mental health issues to arise.
4. The rate of suicide among those aged 10-24 increased by 56% from 2007 to 2017.
It's important to note that although social media was first introduced in 1997, it didn't really gain much popularity until around 2009-2010. Knowing this, seeing a 56% increase between 2007 to 2017 among the age group most prominent on social media poses extreme concerns about how the introduction of those platforms impacted mental health.
5. Self-harm emergency department visit rates increased by 18.8% from 2009 to 2015 among young girls ages 10-14 years old. Before 2008, youth self-inflicted injury emergency department rates were relatively constant.
Similar to the above statistic, noting that social media gained popularity right around 2009-2010 is important. There is a clear upward trend of self-harm emergency department visits beginning right around that time, which although doesn't prove causation, is pretty relevant in considering how social media may be affecting young girls.
With the introduction of social media came young girls' ability to compare their looks to others, photoshop their appearances much more, and seek social gratification for their looks in the form of likes and retweets, and comments. It's not unlikely, in my opinion, that all of this access caused more incidents of self-harm in that age group.
6. 20% of people with at least one social media account report feelings of a newly coined term "social media anxiety disorder."
Social media anxiety disorder is not an official clinical diagnosis, but the phrase refers to the need to check your phone every so often in order to avoid feeling anxious. This adds a whole other layer of mental health impacts — not only is social media contributing to negative mental health symptoms, but it is also creating entirely new ones.
7. 44% of all female adolescents think they are overweight, and a suspected 4-22% of college-age females engage in bulimic behavior in an effort to be thin. Trends are consistent with the media's portrayal of women getting slimmer.
As women in media portrayals have gotten slimmer, instances of female adolescents believing they are overweight and engaging in bulimic behavior has gone up. Social media gives us direct access to other women that may often use photoshop before posting, and this can impact how girls view themselves. If we are constantly seeing images of women who look "perfect," how are we going to feel when we encounter what we perceive in ourselves to be flawed?
8. The rate of individuals with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder increased 68% in young adults aged 18-25 between 2006 to 2017, with most (63%) of the increase occurring after 2010.
Going back to the previously mentioned idea that social media really began to pick up speed around 2009-2010, we yet again see an instance of increased mental health issues in line with its rise to fame. According to this study, there was a 63% increase in symptoms of major depressive disorder from 2010 to 2017, which may be indicative of just how heavily social media may be influencing our mental wellbeing.
9. The rate of suicidal thoughts among those aged 20-21 increased by 68% from 2008 to 2017, and the rate of suicidal attempts increased by 87% for the same age group within the same time frame.
Similarly, the rate of suicide thought and attempts all increased significantly within those aged 20-21 right around the time that social media began to gain some traction. This is probably one of the most concerning statistics because it's kind of crazy to think about how social media may be pushing some closer to suicide. But, if we look at the other eight statistics that analyze how long teens are on social media and all of the mental health issues it may cause, reaching a breaking point for most teens is an unfortunate truth.
These are all frightening statistics, and I hope they concern you as much as they do me. If social media has such a drastic effect on our minds to the point of causing an increase in suicide, adding to a rise in depression and anxiety, and contributing to the onset of eating disorders, there must be change. We cannot allow our devices to control our minds any longer, and we need to recognize social media's impact on our lives before it is far too late.

10+ Social Media and Mental Health Statistics Everyone Must Read
Statistics / By Erik / March 1, 2021 / 7 minutes of reading
Social media websites are the most popular thing on the internet right now. Everyone uses them, and the opinions on whether they are good or bad are mixed. Some people experience negative effects of using social media, but what do the statistics say? How does social media affect mental health? Science gives us some very interesting but also very alarming information.
Editor’s picks of social media and mental health statistics:
72% of adults and 97% of teens use social media websites
YouTube is by far the most used platform (85% of teens and 73% of adults)
89% of teens use social media frequently, out of which 45% use it almost constantly
30% of all people, 49% of adolescents believe they are addicted to social media
Those who use social media more frequently have far more mental health issues
Limiting the usage of social media leads to lower depression symptoms
Victims of cyberbullying are more than twice as likely to have suicidal tendencies
General social media statistics
Nearly all teens and most adults use social media
We all use social media. But how many people exactly use it? PEW research center reports that a total of 72% of adults 1 and 97% of teens 2 (aged 13 to 17) use at least one social media platform. The usage is the highest among the youngest population, but is relatively high (40%) even in the eldest category. More detailed statistics can be seen in the graph below.
Women use social media 1.2 times more than men
So, many people use social media, but who uses it more? PEW shows that women use social media more (78%) than men (65%). Furthermore, people with a higher household income (above 50k) also use it more (around 80%), compared to those with a household income of below 50k (69%). It is also used the most by college graduates (79%), compared to college students (74%) and those with no college (64%). The usage is very evenly distributed amongst people that are white (73%), Hispanic (70%), and Afro-American (69%) 1. It turns out that, the most common user of social media is a white woman who graduated college and earns over 50k.
YouTube is the most popular platform, across all ages
Probably not surprising to many, YouTube is the dominant social platform. The most used platforms amongst teens in 2018 were YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter. Adults spend most of their time on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn (according to a report from 2019). The more detailed statistics can be seen in the graph below.
Most of teens use social media very frequently
Okay, so a lot of teens use social media, but how much do they use it? It turns out that nearly a half of teens (45%) report that they use social media “almost constantly”, while 44% report that they use it several times a day, leaving only 11% of teens who use it less than that 2.
A quarter of teens see the effects of social media as dominantly negative
Around a third of teens (31%) indicate that the effect of social media on their health is mostly positive, 24% state that it is mostly negative, while most of them (45%) state that the effect is neutral. A small but significant fraction of teens (4%) reported negative effects to mental health as one of the negative aspects of social media usage 2.
A third of teens have problems with anxiety
Now that we understand how much do people use social media, what can we learn about their mental health? A lot of teens and adults alike have mental health issues. A study indicated that 13% of teens aged 12-17 report having depression, and 32% report having anxiety. Mental health problems are also common amongst young adults, 25% of whom have some sort of mental health issues 8.
30% of participants, nearly half of teens think that they are addicted to social media
We’ve all heard of social media addiction. Not everyone has the same attitude towards what being addicted means, but it is important to know how many people think that they are in fact social media addicts. A study by ThinkNow has shown that 21% of participants indicated that the sentence “I am addicted to social media” describes them somewhat, while 9% claimed that it describes them completely. This total percentage is the highest amongst teens (49%) 3. Female participants are more commonly addicted (23% somewhat, 11% completely) than male (19% somewhat, 7% completely).
Multiple studies link higher social media usage to mental health issues
Science shows a clear relationship between overt social media usage and mental health issues. A recent Chinese study has shown that adults who used social media more during the pandemic had 1.72 the odds of suffering from anxiety and 1.91 the odds of suffering from a combination of depression and anxiety, compared to people who used social media less 4. A British study of nearly 13.000 teens has shown that the adolescents who used social media more were 1.31/1.67 (girls/boys) times as likely to have mental health issues. Girls who use social media very frequently also had 0.86 the life satisfaction, 0.8 the happiness and 1.28 the anxiety of their peers who are infrequent users 7. Another study found that heavy users of social media are three times as likely to experience depression symptoms, in comparison to casual users 9. A fourth study found that the users who spend the most time on social media have 1.66 the odds of being depressed, in comparison to those who use it the least 10. This is best illustrated by a study conducted on students in Ontario, that has demonstrated a clear relationship between social media usage frequency and reported mental health problems, which can be seen on the graph bellow 11.
Limiting social media can lower depression by 37%
All those studies indicate that using social media a lot, but it may be that those with mental health problems just tend to overuse social media, right? Maybe, but probably not. A study conducted by a group of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania has shown that limiting social media websites usage for three weeks to around 150 minutes per week had an effect of lowering depressive symptoms for initially highly depressed individuals (from 23 to 14.5, equaling to a 37% decrease). The control group did not change the level of depression (from 22.8 to 22.83) during the same time interval. Individuals who initially showed low scores on the depression scale also had a slight, but statistically significant drop (from 5.1 to 4.1) which was not present in the control group (from 5 to 4.67) 5.
Cyberbullying is a huge contributor to mental health problems
Another important aspect of the effects of social media on mental health. Reportedly, 72% of teens experience cyberbullying at some point 8. A meta-study from 2018 showed that, compared to nonvictims, those who have experienced cybervictimization were 2.35 times as likely to self-harm, 2.10 times as likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors, 2.57 times more likely to attempt suicide, and 2.15 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts. Cyberbullying perpetrators were 1.21 times more likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors and 1.23 times more likely to experience suicidal ideation than nonperpetrators 6. Conclusion
While everyone uses social media and most don’t think that it affects them negatively, it seems that people who use it the most commonly suffer from mental health issues. This may be due to being addicted, or being a victim of cyberbullying, or something else, but it is clear that the relationship exists. Luckily, there is a solution: science shows that not quitting, but simply limiting social media usage leads to significant decreases in depression. 30 minutes is a recommended duration of using social media each day, in order not to use it too much. So, if you find yourself in the group that uses it all the time, it may be time to reconsider and knock it down a notch.

Age Gap Relationships: How Do They Work And What To Avoid
Statistics / By Angel Rivera Jr., M.D. / March 1, 2021 / 8 minutes of reading
Romantic relationships can be found in all kinds of various shapes and sizes. People from entirely different backgrounds with wildly different upbringings and beliefs can meet and fall in love. This is also true for people of different ages.
Most couples in the United States will be born within three years of each other. This can, at least in part, be attributed to a tendency for couples to meet their partners in school or entry-level jobs.
However, the number of relationships with an age gap of 5-15 years is increasing. It’s currently estimated to be around 8.5 percent of the American population.
The vast majority of these relationships will be between an older man with a younger woman. A Canadian study has shown that age gap relationships are much more prevalent for same-sex couples, with 26 percent of male and 18 percemt of female pairs involving an age gap.
How Do Age Gap Relationships Work?
in addition to the standard issues that will arise in a relationship
For example, a man about to turn 40 will have a much different idea of a fun night out than a woman turning 25. The discussion of having children is a natural conversation that every couple will have at some point and for couples with an age gap, it could be a much harder discussion than their similarly-aged counterparts.
Share your expectations. All relationships have a critical need for this, but an awareness of your partner’s expectation for the relationship can be particularly important in the event of an age gap. As early as possible in the relationship, you and your partner should discuss expectations so as to avoid messy complications down the line. Conversations involving the idea of children and finances should be held early and honestly as these are some of the biggest issues faced by couples of all ages.
Accept your role as a possible caretaker. Sooner or later, the elder spouse will face issues relating to their age and may need long-term health care and lose the ability to do activities that you both enjoy. If you are the younger person in the relationship, then you should prepare for the eventuality of being a caretaker. This could mean you give up certain activities, will need to take on extra duties around the house, and even could end up being celibate as a result. It’s easy to think of how much fun the present is, but consider the potential conflicts in the future.
Maturity is relative. It’s important that you view your partner as a fully grown adult and not someone that can be taught, shaped, or molded into someone else. For older partners, the tendency to feel superior due to age and wisdom may come naturally, but it’s important to be self-aware of this urge and treat your partner as an equal. Younger partners may have a tendency to write off the thoughts and views of their partner for being outdated and flawed. Age alone should not be a measure of maturity or intelligence and it’s important to remember to respect the thoughts of your partner, even if you disagree with them.
Identify mutual interests. One of the best ways to minimize the effects of an age gap is by focusing on mutual interests. Spending time doing what you both love can be a highly effective reminder that the age gap is not the defining characteristic of your relationship. Meeting each other’s friends and socializing with different generations can be a stimulating and empowering event for both parties. Exploring each others’ worlds and trying new things, meeting new people, and being more involved with each others’ lives can go a long way toward building a healthy relationship.
Respect the process. In the event of a series of fights, age could be a factor but is certainly not the only thing causing the trouble. Be confident that your decision to be in a relationship with someone much older or much younger and understand that just like any relationship, things can be rocky and require adjustment periods. Blaming your differences and fights on the age gap is taking the easy way out and won’t get to the real root of the problem.
What To Avoid In an Age Gap Relationship
Having too high of expectations. Some people believe that their relationship will be immune to challenges and as a result will develop a tendency to blame issues on the age difference first. It’s easy to think that because your partner may be several years older than you that they will be emotionally mature enough that the relationship won’t have problems, but this is very flawed thinking. Communication is important and often difficult for couples of all ages, and despite what you may think about your partner, it’s more important to listen to what they say.
Not being sensitive to the particular challenges your partner faces. It may be difficult to put yourself in the shoes of your partner but it’s very important to continue to try and understand where they are going from. For example, if they are contemplating retirement, then it’s important to try to understand what that decision could feel like for them. Another example, if your partner is younger and still hasn’t chosen their career or decided on future events, it’s important to remember what that age was like for you.
Assuming that neither of you will change over time. People can change at any point in their life. There is no cut-off for emotional growth, and it’s a common mistake the people in age gap relationships make. The goal of every relationship should be to grow and change together. Believing your partner is stuck in their ways is an awful way to view them.
Not respecting that your partner had a life before you. The experiences that a person had before they met you are what shaped them into who they are today. Feelings of jealousy or anger are wasted and only cause trouble as nothing can be done about the past. It’s important to remember they may have lived many years without you in their life.
Not respecting different tastes. People that are born in different eras will have grown up with very different cultural preferences. It’s important to keep this in mind and to understand that your partner may have a very different taste in movies, music, and other forms of entertainment. Constantly mocking the things that they like will have a very negative impact on the relationship.
Not being able to handle judgement. Humans are, unfortunately, very judgmental creatures and have a tendency to get involved in things that are not their business. If you are in an age gap relationship then you should expect, and be able to handle, the fact that you will be judged for it by family and friends. It’s a sad reality, but the sooner you can deal with this truth, the less the impact it will have on the relationship.
The Takeaway
Being in an age gap relationship is a perfectly natural and totally acceptable thing for two consenting adults to engage in. There will be unique challenges for sure, but if you and your partner love each other enough and put it in the hard work, being of different ages won’t matter.
Relationships take a lot of hard work and compassion in order to work. No matter the age of the people involved, there will be periods of fighting and adjusting that will take communication and understanding to get through.
A relationship will have its own specific challenges but nothing inherently too difficult to prevent a loving relationship from being possible. Anyone having a hard time getting through these issues would be well served by using the services of a therapist and undergoing couples counseling. Talking through your problems with a licensed professional can be the help needed to get any relationship back on track.

from the stereotypical image of therapy.
Talk Therapy Work?
family member may have a hard time separating the person from their phobias, traumas, or other mental illness or mental disorders. It can be overwhelming for friends and loved ones to offer their ear in unbiased support for someone they care for — possibly even straining the relationship. However, this is not the case for a therapist as it will be a strict doctor-patient relationship, no strings attached!
Talk therapists are trained to help their patients navigate their problems and identify thought and behavior patterns so that they are better equipped to eventually help themselves. There are no set limits on the type of talk therapy you do, but most sessions typically last around an hour or so and meet up once or twice a week.
Some patients may see a therapist for a brief amount of time in order to work through a specific issue, while others will see their therapist on a regular basis for years. These are some of the issues that talk therapy sessions can help a person to deal with:
Anger Management
Anxiety
Bipolar Disorder
Severe Depression or low self-esteem
Eating Disorders
Grief
Phobias
Relationship Issues
Schizophrenia
What Are the Types of Talk Therapy ?
Talk therapy, which is technically called psychotherapy, is an umbrella term that covers many different and specific forms of therapy. While they all genuinely involve a heavy emphasis on talking, the details can really differentiate them from one another. Here are some examples of other forms of talk therapy:
Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT): This therapy style is most effective for treating mental health conditions related to depression and anxiety disorders through a better sense of mindfulness. The focus revolves around what someone thinks rather than what they do. It is dedicated to changing a person’s negative thought patterns in order to address their behavioral responses to situations and stimuli. The idea is that if a patient learns how to identify faulty thought patterns and replace them with healthier and more accurate ways of thinking, then their behavior will improve as a result and thus their quality of life.
This is a more structured version than most other forms of talk therapy as the therapist will direct sessions and guide their patient’s progress along with a specific treatment plan. For the most part, cognitive behavioral therapy will last for a prescribed amount of time, usually around 12 or so sessions. This therapy is best suited for someone searching for solutions to concretely change their behavior.
Dialectical behavior therapy. Similar to cognitive behavior therapy — and based on its methods — this therapy was originally created to treat borderline personality disorder .  Although that is still the best use for this type of therapy, it can be used to treat other issues as well, such as eating disorders, anger management, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
This therapy is rooted in the idea that certain types of people are more likely to react in more intense and extreme manners in highly emotional situations, especially involving their relationships with other people. The focus is placed on helping individuals with extreme negative emotions that can be very difficult to manage and helping them to find and achieve emotional balance. The sessions generally focus on helping the patient to develop an ability to hold multiple perspectives at once and reduce black and white thinking that tends to lead to negative outlooks.
Psychodynamic Therapy: This therapy focuses on exploring the past relationships for an individual in order to get a better idea of current challenges and emotional patterns that may have developed over time as a result of said relationships. A therapist will focus on reviewing the life challenges of their patient, including thoughts, emotions, early life experiences, and deeply held beliefs in order to get to the root cause of their patient’s emotional suffering.
Self-reflection and self-examinations are crucial to this type of therapy and the relationship between a patient and therapist is extremely important. The therapist will work to help their patient recognize recurring emotional patterns, such as defense mechanisms, and use the insight to help change patterns that are ineffective or result in negative outcomes.
Humanistic Therapy: The approaches for this therapy revolve around the belief that every human is born with a unique potential, that coupled with the right nurturing, can be realized. Other core principles include: humans are good and naturally strive to better themselves and their world around them, every person has unique and subjective experiences that should serve as starting points for therapy, and humans best achieve growth when treated with unconditional positive regards and experience positive changes.
There are three different approaches to humanistic therapy. Gestalt therapy focuses on processing the present and what someone is currently dealing with in their life. Client-centered therapy is where the therapist is more of a guide than an authority figure, and the patient will lead the sessions in regards to discussions — which will lead to more self-discovery than other methods. Existential therapy takes a more philosophical approach to treating mental health problems and is based on the tenants of free will, self-determination, and the pursuit of meaning in life.
Does Talk Therapy Work?
The answer to whether or not talk therapy works relies on several factors such as the patient’s willingness to be open to the process, answer honestly, and the dynamic of the patient and therapist’s relationship. However, in most cases, talk therapy works, and mental health experts, alongside studies into the effectiveness, support its use in order to treat various conditions.
In 2015 a review found that cognitive behavior therapy is by far the most consistently supported psychotherapeutic option for treating anxiety disorders. In 2018 a population-based study found that early treatments involving talk therapy can reduce long-term risks of serious mental health conditions for people dealing with bereavement issues. Even the question of whether or not online therapy is less effective has been answered.
One 2014 study found that online treatment was just as effective as face-to-face treatments for depression. Another 2014 study reported that online cognitive behavior therapy was more cost-effective and also led to a reduction in anxiety symptoms.
The Takeaway
Talk therapy is a term that includes several different types of therapy, with each having its own focus and treatments. Overall, talk therapy is one of the most popular and most effective versions of therapy available to people in need of mental and emotional assistance.
While it may seem like an easy task, listening to someone’s problems and offering helpful advice can be quite challenging and overwhelming. The responsibility to help this person in need can be daunting as the words said to them will dramatically impact their lives for years to come. This is why it’s best to leave such issues to the professionals .
Therapists study for years about mental health -related issues and train specifically to help people that are experiencing them. While a long conversation with a friend can help out with minor issues, it’s best to let a therapist tackle the serious ones. Seeking mental health care support can help anyone form coping strategies to better anyones well-being.

NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ON MENTAL HEALTH
  
Health Tips
There’s almost 3.8 billion social media user globally. It allows us to stay connected with friends and family than at other times in history.
Social media can have both a negative and positive effect on the state of mental health. Most people want to find out the impact of platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube on people’s mental health.
Recently, Facebook, which currently has 2.07 billion active users, understands that social media can have a negative impact on a user’s mental health.
According to research, 90% of young people between the ages of 14 and 25 are using social media networks. Besides, rates of insomnia and mental health disorders for the same age group have increased by 70% in the past 25 years. Therefore, social media seems to have a very detrimental effect on the new generation’s mental health. Let’s explore them.
Negative effects of social media on mental health
Social media can cause anxiety and depression.
A recent systematic study by a medical psychologist at Lancaster University in the UK looked at social media’s effects on consumers’ mental health. He revealed that social media use could lead to depression, especially when study participants compare themselves to other users.
Another new study found that the use of social media platforms was associated with anxiety and depression. In particular, the study found that those who used social media platforms the most had a higher risk of depression than those who used social media platforms less.
Interestingly, research has shown that using multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with stress and anxiety than spending time online.
Social media can lead to FOMO.
When you look at pictures of friends laughing at you on social media, it is a form of social anxiety. The form (fear of missing out) becomes more common.
The results of a study by Przybylski and colleagues show that FOMO is associated with a decrease in mood, unsatisfied life, and the need to search social networks and retrieve messages. According to a recent #StatusOfMind survey of around 1,500 adolescents and young adults published by the UK’s Royal Society for Public Health, a photo-based social media platform, Instagram, is sturdily affiliated with FOMO.
Social media can lead to sleep disruption.
According to new research conducted by scientists at the University of Pittsburgh and supported by the National Institute of Health, spending more time on social media with teens increases their risk of developing sleep problems and symptoms of depression. Although the study suggests a link between social media use and sleep problems. However, researchers are concerned about the cause and effects of social media use on sleep quality.
Besides, artificial light sources such as telephone screens have been shown to interfere with the body’s circadian rhythm and interfere with sleep. Blue light naturally promotes sleep and blocks melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep/wake cycle.
Social media can lead to negative body image.
Earlier, magazines and television were accused of presenting false and invincible “ideas,” but now social media is not far behind. However, many social media platforms make it easier for us to gain approval for our appearance or compare ourselves with others. Not much is known about the harmful effects of heavy social media use.
Social Media can be addictive.
Scientists have found that the use of social media, such as liking and commenting on posts, and social interactions with social media platforms, releases dopamine into the brain (this explains we love to receive new notifications new ideas).
Researchers have also found that social media platforms such as Facebook can allow rewards and action on specific brain areas. It allows us to be more active on social media. Our social media does not share all the features of drugs or gambling. Studies show that quitting social media can also lead to a return of people who frequently use social networking sites.
Hopefully, you’re well aware now of the negative impact of social media on our health. Let’s discuss a few tips to overcome the negative aspects of social media on mental health.
Tips to avoid the negative effects of social media on our mental health.
Here are tips you can do on your own, with the help of loved ones, or alongside a counselor to help manage a social media addiction.
Set the timer to use
Facebook and Instagram have timers to monitor usage. They can alert you when you reach certain limits. When connecting to the Internet, it may be helpful to set a timer on your phone or other devices. Try using it for 15 minutes at a time.
Schedule a specific time (or pair) to verify your account
As mentioned earlier, this is very helpful. Plan your day. For example, use social media platforms for 15 minutes after breakfast, 15 minutes in the afternoon, and 15 minutes before 3 hours of sleep.
Install website blockers
These are web-browsing apps and add-ons. It allows you to choose sites and/or apps you can use. You will also find blockers that restrict access to certain times of the day and/or days of the week.
Other Tips and Ideas for Reducing Social Media Addiction and Creating Healthy Habits:
Stop following negative, scary, trolling, or click-byte pages.
Allow them to go online as a reward for completing a particular task.
Remove the application from your mobile phone and access your computer only when someone else is watching it.
Find a responsible partner. This is great for people who have no problems.
Think of social media that fills your life and other ways to fill it.
A journal to express and discover your feelings.
Contact with your friends and families from other sources, such as:
Write a real letter – everyone loves to receive emails
Call someone
Arrange to meet someone for coffee or lunch
Take regular walks with friends
Join a social group
Send a text message
Create a photo album or photo album to post online
Take a walk or exercise.
Conclusion
The correlation between the almost universal use of social media among adolescents and young people and the dramatic increase in mental health disorders in recent years is undeniable. Therefore, it seems appropriate to dedicate efforts to create rules that can further regulate the behavior of social media giants such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat. Equally important, however, is to strive to create educational resources and tools to teach the ever-connected new generation how to use social media healthily and effectively to maximize losses.

The effects of social media on mental health - Medical News Bulletin
The effects of social media on mental health
By
Maor Bernshtein
Social media can have significant effects on various mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, addictions, and insomnia.
Social media has become tremendously common over the past decade. A majority of people report using some type of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, at least once per day. 1
According to recent data, as many as 90% of young adults currently spend time on social media sites. 2 This figure has increased nearly nine-fold since 2005, where only 12.5% reported frequent time spent on social media platforms. 2
With such a rise in the use of social media, many researchers have begun investigating its effects on mental health.
Disorders such as depression and anxiety have been very common in the past several decades. Amongst adults in the United States, approximately 7% of adults are affected by depression each year, while 18% are reported to be affected by anxiety. 3
Among the younger population, reports of mental health problems are particularly disturbing. Some data suggest, for instance, that 30% of college students are affected by depression, while 58% of counselling centers in the United States witnessed an increase in students seeking help for depression. 2
Such mental health disorders have been linked to severely diminished functioning and serious mental anguish, but several studies have shown an increased risk of developing other illnesses and even increased rates of mortality. 4
Anxiety, depression, insomnia, stress and social media use
One study examined the effects of social media on mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress. 1 The study included over 450 adult participants who completed surveys related to social media use and mental health.
The study found that participants who reported problematic social media use (characterized by excessive use of social media platforms) were significantly more likely to have higher anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels. 1 However, the study reported that stress levels did not increase in these participants. In fact, stress was found to mediate the relationship between depression, anxiety, insomnia, and problematic social media use.
The researchers explain that while social media sites allow for more easy and frequent interactions with other people, such interactions are not of the same quality as those found in the real world. Nevertheless, in some circumstances, social media use can increase social support and life satisfaction, as well as enhancing self-expression and identity development. 1 In this way, the researchers suggest that social media may actually become a protective factor against depression. 1
While problematic social media use was found not to be related to increased levels of stress, the study determined that stress fully mediated the relationship between such social media use, depression, and insomnia, while partially mediating its relation with anxiety. The researchers suggested that time spent on social media platforms could be a coping strategy used when experiencing stress. 1
Patterns of social media use and mental health
Another study sought to understand particular patterns of social media use, and how these may be associated with depression and anxiety symptoms. 3 The researchers administered online surveys to over 1,700 young adults in the United States. The study reported that the participants could be classified into one of five different clusters. These clusters were named Unplugged, Concentrated Dabblers, Diffuse Dabblers, Connected, and Wired. 3
Those categorized as Unplugged showed no high levels of any categorized variables and included 18% of the sample. Similarly, 19% were categorized as concentrated dabblers, which reported spending large amounts of time on these sites and a strong emotional connection to a social media platform. Diffuse Dabblers represented 31% of the sample and reported using many different social media platforms without it being considered problematic use. The Connected cluster included 15% of the sample, with participants reporting a combination of using multiple platforms characterized by high intensity and frequency of such social media use. The last cluster, Wired, which contained 13% of the sample, was considered to be demonstrating problematic social media use, which can be thought of as an addiction-like relation to social media. 3
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Wired cluster was found to have the highest association with moderate to severe depressive symptoms. The Connected cluster was also found to be associated with an increased risk of such symptoms, though to a lesser extent. A similar pattern of increased symptoms was found with anxiety, whereby Wired cluster participants were highest followed Connected cluster participants, with no significant relationship determined between any other cluster. 3
Interestingly, the researchers determined that while participants categorized into the Connected cluster were very similar in terms of high frequency, time, and intensity, the same was not the case in the Wired cluster. The researchers determined that the observed negative effects on mental health were more dependent on a particular pattern exhibited by the Wired cluster than simply on increased volume of use. 3
Particular behaviors related to social media and mental health
Another study examined the particular social media use behaviors and their association with symptoms of depression. The researchers administered an online survey to over 500 undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 38, exploring their use of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. 4
Upon examining the results, the researchers discovered three types of behaviors that were particularly related to major depressive disorder: social comparisons, social media addiction, and social interactions. 4
Specifically, people who were more likely to compare themselves to others who are better off, who indicated being more bothered if tagged in an unflattering picture, and those less likely to post pictures of themselves with others, were more likely to meet the criteria for a major depressive disorder. 4 Additionally, higher levels of social interactions, such as following over 300 people on Twitter, were related to lower levels of depression symptoms.
Participants who scored higher on a social media addiction scale were significantly more likely to show symptoms of depression.
Although these results seem to indicate a clear link between some types of social media use and depression, it is not possible to make firm conclusions. It is just as likely that many of these behaviors are an outward display of depressive symptoms. For instance, rumination is a very common symptom in people who experience depression and may explain such behaviors as being bothered when tagged in an unflattering picture. Similarly, social isolation is often very common in people suffering from depression and can explain the finding that following fewer people on Twitter is related to such symptoms. It is also possible, as the researchers point out, that social media use acts as a shield from anxiety-provoking real-life interactions. Social media use can also be an adaptive response by people experiencing emotional difficulties, with such individuals seeking to receive social support. 4
Treatment of problematic social media use
Although not much has been written on this topic, several researchers have examined potential treatment strategies for problematic social media use. For instance, one strategy may be to write down the amount of time a person spends on social media, and how valuable they find the particular social media site. 2 Another possible strategy is for a clinician to work with a patient on setting a specific time of day they can engage in social media use. 2 Some people can even benefit from taking a ‘digital sabbatical’, or a period of time where they discontinue the use of social media or other networking sites, while still maintaining important connections with others. 2
It is important, as is often the case, that if you feel that your use of social media sites is negatively impacting your life, you seek out the help of mental health professional. A healthcare worker can assist with finding the best course of treatment when someone is experiencing distress from problematic social media use. Although the majority of people do not appear to report severe mental health issues related to social media use, some may find that such sites are causing them particularly severe pain and distress.
While problematic social media use is still a newer area of research, it is becoming clearer that this issue is similar in nature to other types of addiction. Therefore, interventions by professional mental health practitioners may be necessary in some cases, and some individuals may benefit greatly from working with a therapist.

Alright, so I've got a bunch of information here about the effects of social media on mental health. It seems like there are both positive and negative aspects, but the negative ones are getting a lot of attention in these articles.

First, looking at the general statistics, it's clear that a huge number of people, especially teens and young adults, are using social media extensively. Like, 97% of teens use at least one social media platform, and they spend around three hours a day on it. That's a lot of time!

Now, regarding the negative effects, several studies suggest that higher social media usage is linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and even suicidal tendencies. For example, one study found that teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media are at a higher risk for mental health problems. Another study showed that the rate of suicide among 10-24-year-olds increased by 56% from 2007 to 2017, which coincides with the rise in social media popularity.

There's also this concept of "social media anxiety disorder," which isn't an official diagnosis but refers to the anxiety people feel when they can't check their phones regularly. Plus, issues like cyberbullying are prevalent, and victims of cyberbullying are more likely to have suicidal thoughts.

On the other hand, some people argue that social media can have positive effects, like providing a platform for self-expression, connecting people who might otherwise be isolated, and offering support groups for various issues.

But overall, it seems like the consensus is that excessive social media use can be harmful, especially for mental health. One study even found that limiting social media use to about 30 minutes a day can lead to significant reductions in depression and loneliness.

So, maybe the key is moderation. Like, it's okay to use social media, but not to the point where it interferes with real-life activities and relationships.

Another interesting point is that social media can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, especially among young people who are still developing their identities. Seeing perfectly curated lives on Instagram or Facebook can make someone feel like their own life isn't measuring up, leading to feelings of depression and anxiety.

Moreover, the constant need for validation through likes and comments can be addictive and detrimental to mental health. It's like people are seeking external validation for their worth, which isn't healthy.

But, at the same time, social media can be a tool for good. It can provide a sense of community and belonging, especially for marginalized groups who might not have local support systems. It can also be a platform for raising awareness about mental health issues and reducing stigma.

I think it's important to recognize that social media isn't inherently bad; it's how we use it that matters. If we're using it to connect with others meaningfully and stay informed, that's great. But if we're using it to compare our lives to others' highlight reels or to escape from real problems, that's when it becomes problematic.

Maybe education is key here. Teaching young people about the potential pitfalls of social media and how to use it in a healthy way could make a big difference. Parents and schools should play a role in guiding kids on how to navigate the digital world responsibly.

Also, social media companies have a responsibility to create platforms that promote positive interactions and protect users from harmful content. Implementing features that encourage healthy usage, like time limits or alerts when usage is excessive, could help.

In conclusion, while social media has its benefits, there are significant negative effects on mental health, particularly among teens and young adults. It's essential to be aware of these risks and take steps to use social media in a way that enhances our lives without sacrificing our mental well-being.
