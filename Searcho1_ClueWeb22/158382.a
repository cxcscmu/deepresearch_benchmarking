Alright, so I need to figure out how the Balfour Declaration contributed to tension between Jews and Arabs. I don't remember a lot about this, so I think I should start by understanding what the Balfour Declaration is.

I recall that it has something to do with Britain and Palestine, but beyond that, my knowledge is a bit fuzzy. Maybe I should look it up to get a clearer picture.

Let me think about how I can search for this. If I just search "Balfour Declaration," I'll probably get a lot of general information, but I need specifics on how it led to tension between Jews and Arabs. Maybe I should search for something like "Balfour Declaration and Jewish-Arab tensions."

Alternatively, perhaps searching for "impact of Balfour Declaration on Palestine" would give me relevant information. Let me try that.

More than a century on: The Balfour Declaration explained
More than 100 years since Britain’s controversial pledge, here is everything you need to know about it.

The Balfour Declaration, which resulted in a significant upheaval in the lives of Palestinians, was issued on November 2, 1917.
The declaration turned the Zionist aim of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine into a reality when Britain publicly pledged to establish “a national home for the Jewish people” there.
The pledge is generally viewed as one of the main catalysts of the Nakba – the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948 – and the conflict that ensued with the Zionist state of Israel.
It is regarded as one of the most controversial and contested documents in the modern history of the Arab world and has puzzled historians for decades.
What is the Balfour Declaration?
The Balfour Declaration (“Balfour’s promise” in Arabic) was a public pledge by Britain in 1917 declaring its aim to establish “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.
The statement came in the form of a letter from Britain’s then-foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, addressed to Lionel Walter Rothschild, a figurehead of the British Jewish community.
It was made during World War I (1914-1918) and was included in the terms of the British Mandate for Palestine after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.
The so-called mandate system, set up by the Allied powers, was a thinly veiled form of colonialism and occupation.
The system transferred rule from the territories that were previously controlled by the powers defeated in the war – Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria – to the victors.
The declared aim of the mandate system was to allow the winners of the war to administer the newly emerging states until they could become independent.
The case of Palestine, however, was unique. Unlike the rest of the post-war mandates, the main goal of the British Mandate there was to create the conditions for the establishment of a Jewish “national home” – where Jews constituted less than 10 percent of the population at the time.
Upon the start of the mandate, the British began to facilitate the immigration of European Jews to Palestine. Between 1922 and 1935, the Jewish population rose from nine percent to nearly 27 percent of the total population.

Though the Balfour Declaration included the caveat that “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine”, the British mandate was set up in a way to equip Jews with the tools to establish self-rule, at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs.
Why was it controversial?
The document was controversial for several reasons.
Firstly, it was, in the words of the late Palestinian-American academic Edward Said, “made by a European power … about a non-European territory … in a flat disregard of both the presence and wishes of the native majority resident in that territory”.
In essence, the Balfour Declaration promised Jews a land where the natives made up more than 90 percent of the population.
Secondly, the declaration was one of three conflicting wartime promises made by the British.
When it was released, Britain had already promised the Arabs independence from the Ottoman Empire in the 1915 Hussein-McMahon correspondence.
The British also promised the French, in a separate treaty known as 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, that the majority of Palestine would be under international administration, while the rest of the region would be split between the two colonial powers after the war.
The declaration, however, meant that Palestine would come under British occupation and that the Palestinian Arabs who lived there would not gain independence.
Finally, the declaration introduced a notion that was reportedly unprecedented in international law – that of a “national home”.
The use of the vague term “national home” for the Jewish people, as opposed to “state”, left the meaning open to interpretation.
Earlier drafts of the document used the phrase “the reconstitution of Palestine as a Jewish State”, but that was later changed.
In a meeting with Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann in 1922, however, Arthur Balfour and then-Prime Minister David Lloyd George reportedly said the Balfour Declaration “always meant an eventual Jewish state”.
Why was it issued?
The question of why the Balfour Declaration was issued has been a subject of debate for decades, with historians using different sources to suggest various explanations.
While some argue that many in the British government at the time were Zionists themselves, others say the declaration was issued out of an anti-Semitic reasoning, that giving Palestine to the Jews would be a solution to the “Jewish problem”.
In mainstream academia, however, there are a set of reasons over which there is a general consensus:
Control over Palestine was a strategic imperial interest to keep Egypt and the Suez Canal within Britain’s sphere of influence
Britain had to side with the Zionists to rally support among Jews in the United States and Russia, hoping they could encourage their governments to stay in the war until victory
Intense Zionist lobbying and strong connections between the Zionist community in Britain and the British government; some of the officials in the government were Zionists themselves
Jews were being persecuted in Europe and the British government was sympathetic to their suffering
How was it received by Palestinians and Arabs?
In 1919, then-US President Woodrow Wilson appointed a commission to look into public opinion on the mandatory system in Syria and Palestine.
The investigation was known as the King-Crane commission. It found that the majority of Palestinians expressed a strong opposition to Zionism, leading the conductors of the commission to advise a modification of the mandate’s goal.
The late Awni Abd al-Hadi, a Palestinian political figure and nationalist, condemned the Balfour Declaration in his memoirs, saying it was made by an English foreigner who had no claim to Palestine, to a foreign Jew who had no right to it.
In 1920, the Third Palestinian Congress in Haifa decried the British government’s plans to support the Zionist project and rejected the declaration as a violation of international law and of the rights of the indigenous population.
However, the other important source for insight into Palestinian opinion on the declaration – the press – was closed down by the Ottomans at the start of the war in 1914 and only began to reappear in 1919, but under British military censorship.
In November 1919, when the al-Istiqlal al-Arabi (Arab independence) newspaper, based in Damascus, was reopened, one article said in response to a public speech by Herbert Samuel, a Jewish cabinet minister, in London on the second anniversary of the Balfour Declaration: “Our country is Arab, Palestine is Arab, and Palestine must remain Arab.”
Even prior to the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate, pan-Arab newspapers warned against the motives of the Zionist movement and its potential outcomes in displacing Palestinians from their land.
Khalil Sakakini, a Jerusalemite writer and teacher, described Palestine in the immediate aftermath of the war as follows: “A nation which has long been in the depths of sleep only awakes if it is rudely shaken by events, and only arises little by little … This was the situation of Palestine, which for many centuries has been in the deepest sleep, until it was shaken by the great war, shocked by the Zionist movement, and violated by the illegal policy [of the British], and it awoke, little by little.”
Increased Jewish immigration under the mandate created tensions and violence between the Palestinian Arabs and the European Jews. One of the first popular responses to British actions was the Nebi Musa revolt in 1920 that led to the killing of four Palestinian Arabs and five immigrant Jews.
Who else was behind it?
While Britain is generally held responsible for the Balfour Declaration, it is important to note that the statement would not have been made without prior approval from the other Allied powers during World War I.
In a War Cabinet meeting in September 1917, British ministers decided that “the views of President Wilson should be obtained before any declaration was made”. Indeed, according to the cabinet’s minutes on October 4, the ministers recalled Arthur Balfour confirming that Wilson was “extremely favourable to the movement”.
France was also involved and announced its support prior to the issuing of the Balfour Declaration.
A May 1917 letter from Jules Cambon, a French diplomat, to Nahum Sokolow, a Polish Zionist, expressed the sympathetic views of the French government towards “Jewish colonisation in Palestine”.
“[I]t would be a deed of justice and of reparation to assist, by the protection of the Allied Powers, in the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago,” stated the letter, which was seen as a precursor to the Balfour Declaration.
What impact did it have on Palestinians?
The Balfour Declaration is widely seen as the precursor to the 1948 Palestinian Nakba when Zionist armed groups, who were trained by the British, forcibly expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homeland.
Despite some opposition within the War Cabinet predicting that such an outcome was probable, the British government still chose to issue the declaration.
While it is difficult to imply that the developments in Palestine today can be traced back to the Balfour Declaration, there is no doubt that the British Mandate created the conditions for the Jewish minority to gain superiority in Palestine and build a state for themselves at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs.
When the British decided to terminate their mandate in 1947 and transfer the question of Palestine to the United Nations, the Jews already had an army that was formed out of the armed paramilitary groups trained and created to fight side by side with the British in World War II.
More importantly, the British allowed the Jews to establish self-governing institutions, such as the Jewish Agency, to prepare themselves for a state when it came to it, while the Palestinians were forbidden from doing so – paving the way for the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine.

The Balfour Declaration
This article is considered accurate for the current version of the game.
The Balfour Declaration.
The Balfour Declaration is a decision in which Israel can appear in the game. Similar decisions include Host the Congo Conference and British South Africa Company .
Historically, The declaration was a red letter from Arthur James Balfour to Walter Rothschild. The declaration made a heavy impact on the Muslim world by eventually creating the Israeli state.
In the game, the declaration can be enacted by any civilized nation with Palestine, the region, owned or sphered. Also, Revolution & Counterrevolution has to be researched to enact it. Egypt owns the province initially, and Ottoman Empire has cores on it.
If The Ottoman Empire owns Palestine, be sure to enact the decision, a few nationalists in Turkey couldn't hurt. If Egypt holds Palestine, enact the decision and free Israel from Muhammad Ali. Do not enact the decision if you're either one of these countries unless you want less infamy.
The AI will never take the decision except for United Kingdom, which will always take the decision if possible.
Perhaps illogically, in the game files it is placed in the txt-file for Turkish decisions.
Ingame description
His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object... Since we exert a significant influence in Judea and the Levant, the ancient birthplaces of the Jewish Nation, we can issue a declaration expressing our favorable attitude toward the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people there.

Balfour Declaration

Jewish Political Studies Review
Volume 28, Numbers 1–2
* Ambassador Dore Gold is the Guest Editor of this special issue of the Jewish Political Studies Review.
The stated purpose of the Balfour Declaration from November 2, 1917 and the circumstances under which it was published are generally known. 1 The most common explanation was that Britain and the Allied Powers were moved by idealism and their interests. At a critical point in the First World War, the British cabinet needed to secure world Jewish support for the Allied cause and hoped at the same time to keep both the United States and Russia on their side. With time, however, the world’s understanding of the Declaration has become the subject of bitter controversy and revisionist interpretation. In fact, the Palestinian Authority of today went so far as to call it a “crime.” 2
It is noteworthy that the declaration was much more than a unilateral act of His Majesty’s government. On June 4, 1917, the French Foreign Minister, Jules Cambon, wrote to Nahum Sokolow that the French government felt sympathy for his cause, which Cambon defined as “the renaissance of the Jewish nationality in that Land from which the people of Israel were exiled so many centuries ago.”
Moreover, before publishing the Declaration, British diplomacy first secured the support of President Woodrow Wilson and the American government. Having done this, the British began to build a wider basis of international support for the idea of the Jewish National Home. On July 24, 1922, the British pledge to help build the Jewish National Home was explicitly incorporated into the text of the League of Nations Mandate, which called for “putting into effect” its terms. The Balfour Declaration thus was transformed into a binding obligation under international law. Moreover, it was approved unanimously by the Council of the League of Nations, made up of fifty-one member states. This broadened consensus of international support would ultimately include Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, Siam, Sweden and The Vatican. 3 Martin Kramer observed that “On the face of it, the declaration was a unilateral British letter of intent. In truth, in expressing a broad consensus of the Allies, it might even be seen as roughly comparable to a UN Security Council resolution today.” 4
Separately, it has become evident that the idea of the Jewish National Home developed its own momentum. Recently, Wolfgang Schwanitz reported a remarkable discovery. He reported in an unpublished manuscript, “The Ottoman Balfour Declaration,” that on August 12, 1918, two and a half months before the war ended, Talaat Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, issued the following declaration, “… We have resolved to do away with all restrictive measures and definitely to abolish the restrictive regulations regarding the immigration and settlement of Jews in Palestine. I assure you of my sympathy for the creation of a Jewish religious center in Palestine by means of well-organized immigration and colonization. It is my desire to place this work under the protection of the Turkish government.” 5 The statement was striking given the Ottomans’ hostility to minorities, in particular their Armenian population.
The Balfour Declaration is important because it recognizes the historical bond of the Jewish People to the Holy Land, a bond which existed long before the declaration. What was significant was its public and formal recognition and its incorporation into international law. In his testimony before the Peel Commission on January 7, 1937, David Ben Gurion drew the distinction between the precedence of the historical facts and their modern recognition:
I say on behalf of the Jews that the Bible is our Mandate, the Bible which was written by us, in our own language, in Hebrew in this very country. That is our Mandate. It is only recognition of this right which was expressed in the Balfour Declaration. 6
The Balfour Declaration is a tremendously important document because it contains world recognition of the historical rights of the Jewish People to a National Home. In the Mandate document, it is stated: “Whereas recognition has thereby been given to the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine and to the grounds for reconstituting their national home in that country.” Thus, the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration, upon which it was based, did not create Jewish historical rights, but rather recognized a pre-existing right.
The Jewish claim to the Holy Land is based on facts, and we may understand from Chaim Weizmann’s language and choice of words when he explained that it was a major historical event. He called the Balfour Declaration an “act of restitution” and emphatically described it as a “unique act of the world moral conscience.” Expressing his deep awareness of historical continuity over millennia, he called it “the righting of a historical wrong” and an “act of justice.” 7
Writing in the 1960s, Sir Isaiah Berlin, stated that, “His [Weizmann’s] name became indissolubly linked with this [the Balfour Declaration], the greatest event in Jewish history since the destruction of Judaea.” 8
Further, Jacob, the fourth Lord Rothschild, now 80, and head of the family’s banking dynasty, told former Israeli UK Ambassador Daniel Taub that the declaration of support for a Jewish homeland in Palestine “was the greatest event in Jewish life for thousands of years, a miracle….” 9
The practical significance of the Balfour Declaration is that in our times it is the modern basis of the legitimacy of the Jewish National Home and the State of Israel. Winning the Balfour Declaration was a major historical accomplishment, and accordingly the enemies of the Jewish national cause have targeted the Declaration and endeavored to negate it, mainly through a campaign of falsification of history.
Efraim Karsh wrote that
… efforts to undermine the Jewish claim to the Land of Israel date from well before 1967, all the way to the 1920s. People claimed, among other things, that today’s Jews were not the real descendants of the Jewish People but the descendants of the Khuzarim [Khazars]. Likewise, the comparison of the Zionists to Nazis goes all the way back to WWII. At the time when the Nazis were busy exterminating European Jewry, British officials were comparing the Zionists to Nazis. 10
The historic Jewish attachment to the Land of Israel is the real claim to statehood. The tendency to justify Zionism on the basis of the Holocaust is totally misconceived. Not only was Zionism a thriving and successful movement prior to this tragedy, but the Holocaust destroyed its largest human reservoir and severely set it back. Moreover, the Arabs have always misrepresented themselves as the Holocaust’s real victims by being supposedly forced to foot the bill for this tragedy. They, moreover, endeavor to undermine Israel’s claim by going back to 1948 and depicting it as a state “born in sin.” The Arabs and their advocates argue that Zionism aspired from its very inception to destroy the Palestinian people, to dispossess them from their patrimony, and took advantage of the opportunity availed by partition and the attendant war. 11
The war against the Balfour Declaration included continuous attacks on its legality and the historical bond which it recognized. This assault on Israel’s legitimacy has included the negation of Jewish history in such international bodies as the UN. Recently, it has included the Palestinian Authority’s launching a year of protest against this “crime” and demanding an apology of the British government.
Today’s assault of the Palestinian Arabs on the Balfour Declaration is not new. It has a shameful precedent. On the twenty-sixth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, November 2, 1943, Hajj Amin-al Husseini, the former Mufti of Jerusalem and Head of the Moslem Institute in Berlin, addressed the world from Luftwaffe Hall. There, he pledged his unqualified support to the Germans, “who have definitely solved the Jewish problem.” 12
On this festive occasion, Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop and the Leader of the S.S., Heinrich Himmler, sent telegrams of support. Himmler wrote,
The National Socialist Party has inscribed on its flag ‘the extermination of world Jewry.’ Our party sympathizes with the fight of the Arabs, especially the Arabs of Palestine, against the foreign Jew. Today, on this memorial day of the Balfour Declaration, I send my greetings and wishes for success in your fight. 13
The Jewish population of Mandatory Palestine contributed large numbers of volunteers and committed its manpower, agriculture, manufacturing and expertise to the Allied cause. Unfortunately, this contribution was soon forgotten. When the State of Israel was born in 1948, it was invaded by a coalition of Arab armies which received their training and weapons from the main colonial powers in the Middle East at that time: Britain and France. Ironically, the rise of Israel was an anti-colonial development accelerating the demise of European colonial empires and the rise of independent states.
Our understanding of the Balfour Declaration today may be viewed as part of a political war to preserve the integrity of the historical record. In the great historical reckoning which still must take place certain historical facts need to be understood. These would include: 1) the significance of the Balfour Declaration and its standing as a commitment assured by international law; 2) The participation of the Yishuv during the Second World War on the side of the Allied Powers; 3) Great Britain’s dishonorable retreat from the obligations of the Balfour Declaration and its failure to reward its faithful ally.
During the centennial of the Balfour Declaration, our discussion has been tainted by the efforts of Israel’s enemies to misrepresent and falsify the historical facts. They try to portray modern Israel as a product of European colonialism, plain and simple, with no roots in the land and no historical rights. It is not possible to accept the myths and falsehoods of a so-called “narrative,” which supposedly can outweigh the historical facts. In simple language, modern Israel is the heir and successor to ancient Israel. The Balfour Declaration recognized this bond and in doing so showed the world “a unique act of world moral conscience.”

The following background information was published by the Rothschild archives, “Beginning in 1916, the British hoped that in exchange for their support of Zionism, ‘the Jews’ would help to finance the growing expenses of the First World War, which was becoming increasingly burdensome. More importantly, policy-makers in the Foreign Office believed that Jews could be prevailed upon to persuade the United States to join the War. At this time, there were very strong pro-Zionist feelings by many of the political elite and establishment. Many of Britain’s leaders, including Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and Balfour himself, felt for the Jews and their history. These men were deeply religious Christian Zionists. They had grown up on the Bible; the Holy Land was their spiritual home. They believed that modern Zionism would fulfil a divine promise, and re-settle the Jews in the land of their ancient fathers.” “Walter Rothschild and the Balfour Declaration,” The Rothschild Archive, https://www.rothschildarchive.org/contact/faqs/walter_rothschild_and_the_balfour_declaration.

Palestinians and the Balfour Declaration at 100: Resisting the Past

The Balfour Declaration in the Times of London, 9 November 1917.
A striking aspect of Palestinian culture is its resistance to the realities of the past.
On September 22, 2016, Palestinian Authority (PA) president Mahmoud Abbas addressed the UN. He said, "100 years have passed since the notorious Balfour Declaration, by which Britain gave, without any right, authority or consent from anyone, the land of Palestine to another people." He went on to demand an apology from Britain. Abbas has had previously threatened to sue London for damages resulting from the declaration and the creation of Israel.
This storm against the past was also on display at a recent conference at University College London that brought together British Islamists and revisionist Israelis to demand that the British government apologize for the Balfour Declaration, with the ultimate aim of exposing "the illegality of the state of Israel while giving practical steps in campaigning towards an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine."
What do such efforts tell us about Palestinian culture and the prospects for peace?
The Balfour Declaration is a singular datum for Israelis and Palestinians alike. After lengthy negotiations between the British government and the Zionist movement, Arthur Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary, issued his famous statement on November 2, 1917. Balfour's letter to Zionist leader Lord Rothschild, in which he stated that the Cabinet viewed "with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," was only one of a series of British wartime communications regarding the fate of the Levant. The correspondence between the British High Commissioner for Egypt, Sir Henry McMahon, and Hussein Ibn Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and the secret Anglo-French agreement between Sir Mark Sykes and Charles Georges-Picot were no less consequential in the shaping of the contemporary Middle East.
The 1915-1916 McMahon-Hussein correspondence (left), and the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement were no less consequential than the Balfour Declaration in shaping the contemporary Middle East.
It took the Arabs some time to voice their opposition to the Declaration. The British report on the 1921 Palestine riots noted that "The Mayor of Tulkarem talks about the Balfour Declaration, and, whether he has or has not a clearer notion of its import than other people, he certainly expresses his opinion about it very definitely." Palestinian objections to Balfour are neatly captured by historian Bayan al-Hut: "This is a promise that was made by someone who had no right to give it to those who had no right to receive it."
The British establishment itself was divided and began to respond negatively to Zionism and Balfour in the early 1920s. This reflected the fusion of the establishment's traditional anti-Semitism with its growing realization that the League of Nations' mandate for the implementation of the Balfour Declaration was an impossible encumbrance on an empire bled white and financially exhausted by war. This attitude was a pronounced undercurrent throughout the Mandate years. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one British official, Acting District Commissioner for the Galilee Blenkinsopp, used to circulate a "refutation" of the Balfour Declaration to his colleagues every year on November 2.
Palestinians have cast the British Mandate as the illegitimate exercise of imperialism.
In the past, Palestinians have cast the Mandate as the illegitimate exercise of British imperialism, where, as al-Hut put it, "One people grant[ed] a second people what belong[ed] to a third people." Nowadays, the opposition to the Balfour Declaration describes it as the beginning of "settler-colonialism."
This innovation neatly saddles Britain's carefully cultivated sense of post-imperial guilt with responsibility for "Israeli crimes," including "complicity" in the supposed "cultural repression" of the Palestinians. At the same time, the approach promises to redeem the long-standing Palestinian sense of besmirched honor at having failed to "resist" Zionism.
But the current effort against Balfour also illustrates other standard Palestinian responses. For one thing, it unironically emphasizes Palestinian powerlessness and Arab weakness in both the past and the present. "Resistance" against the British Empire and the Zionists, both non-violent and violent, failed – and therefore, consistent with historical Palestinian practice, the issue must be internationalized.
The irony, however, is that Balfour's wholly legal commitment, ratified by the League of Nations in 1920, is assailed much the same way the 1947 UN Palestine partition recommendation was condemned: as illegitimate and unfair. For Palestinians, internationalization must produce the result they want, despite the historical record of its rarely doing so.
A British apology would have little direct value in helping to establish a Palestinian state.
There are other traditional elements in the campaign against the Balfour Declaration, not least the mistaking of symbolism for practical action. Presumably an apology would achieve a partial restoration of Palestinian national honor and comprise another step towards the complete eradication of Israel. However, despite vague talk from Palestinian activists demanding "compensation for Balfour" – which would be set against competing claims for compensation by Jewish refugees from Arab countries – it is difficult to see what direct value an apology would have in helping to establish a Palestinian state.
Demands for apologies and compensation have changed little since the UN's Economic Survey Mission reported on a visit to Gaza in 1949: "In one of the camps, the refugees staged quite a demonstration. A large sign had been printed in English on which were the following, numbered as indicated: 1. Send us back home. 2. Compensate us. 3. Maintain us until we are refreshed. Just what they had in mind by 'refreshed' I leave to your imagination."
The current Palestinian leadership's sense of timing, and commitment to symbolism, deserves comment. Whereas from the 1960s onward Yasser Arafat navigated the Palestinian movement through the shifting currents of Third Worldism and the Cold War, today that skill is nowhere evident. Protests over the Balfour Declaration anniversary are emerging just as the Arab state system finds itself at its lowest ebb. Syria, Yemen, and Libya are effectively no more, Iraq is divided between an Iranian rump, a shrinking ISIS entity, and an independent Kurdistan (in all but name), and Lebanon is a Shiite-dominated shell. The Palestinian Authority is a pseudo-state that exists only thanks to foreign aid and Israeli security assistance.
The tone of the Balfour Declaration protests – "What is happening in Palestine is the biggest social injustice of our time," as a conference organizer put it – is therefore not simply a lament for an era when Palestinians were ostensibly at the center of Arab and Muslims politics, but resistance to empirical reality.
The Balfour apology campaign is yet another Palestinian effort to deny and rewrite historical facts.
The Balfour apology campaign is thus another element in the Palestinian wars against inconvenient historical facts that must be denied, attacked, rewritten, or otherwise assailed, rather than debated, conceded, or shared. This approach accounts for such extraordinary Palestinian claims as Arafat's denial that there was ever a Jewish Temple in Jerusalem; Saeb Erekat's statement that the Palestinians are descendants of Epipaleolithic inhabitants, and thus the "real" indigenous population of the land; and the more consequential insistence that Jews are only adherents to a religion and not members of a nation.
Here "resistance" elides into stubborn fabulism. Reality must be made to conform on the basis of both religious ideology and fantastical invented elements. Palestinian examples must be set into broader contexts, from religious claims regarding perfidious and cursed Jews to plaintive historical claims regarding the Muslim discovery of America, the invention of flight, and, more darkly, Zionist attack sharks or the "conspiracy to destroy Islam."
These concepts – redeeming fallen honor, perpetual victimhood, international responsibility, and achieving through guilt what politics and force of arms cannot – are cultural ideas, transmitted endlessly by Palestinian leaders and through their educational system and media. But they are also reflected in Palestinian politics. At every turn, negotiations get to a stage and then stop because compromise would preclude full "restoration" of what never was. Fighting century-old events and hoping to produce another outcome is consistent with this pattern. It is unlikely to build either a stable Palestinian society or peace with Israel.

Alright, so I've got some information here about the Balfour Declaration and its impact on tensions between Jews and Arabs. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First off, the Balfour Declaration was a letter from the British Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, to a Jewish community leader, Lord Rothschild, in 1917. It expressed support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire. This was during World War I, and Britain was trying to gain support from various groups, including Jews in the US and Russia, to help win the war.

Now, the problem is that Palestine was already inhabited by Arabs, who made up the vast majority of the population at that time. So, promising a national home for Jews in their land naturally caused a lot of resentment and tension.

From what I'm reading, the Balfour Declaration is seen as one of the main catalysts for the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It set in motion a series of events that led to the establishment of Israel in 1948 and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba.

One article mentions that the declaration was controversial because it was made by a European power about a non-European territory without considering the wishes of the native majority. That seems pretty problematic now, but back then, European powers often acted with impunity in other parts of the world.

It's also interesting to note that Britain had made other promises during the war, like the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, where they promised Arabs independence from the Ottomans, and the Sykes-Picot Agreement with France, which planned to divide the Middle East into spheres of influence. So, Britain was making conflicting promises to different groups, which obviously led to mistrust and conflict later on.

After the war, the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine, which was supposed to prepare the region for self-rule. But instead, Britain allowed Jewish immigration to increase, which heightened tensions with the Arab population.

The declaration itself was vague about what a "national home" meant. Some interpreted it as a Jewish state, while others saw it as a cultural or religious center. This ambiguity has been a source of contention ever since.

Palestinians and Arabs in general have always rejected the Balfour Declaration, seeing it as an unjust interference in their affairs and a betrayal of earlier British promises. They argue that it ignored their rights and led to their dispossession.

On the other hand, Jews saw the declaration as a major victory for their national aspirations, as it was the first time a major power had officially backed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

So, in summary, the Balfour Declaration contributed to tension between Jews and Arabs by promising a national home for Jews in a land that was predominantly Arab. This set up a zero-sum game where gains for one side were seen as losses for the other, leading to持续的冲突和不和。

I think that captures the essence of the issue. Now, I need to present this in a clear and concise manner for my answer.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The Balfour Declaration contributed to tension between Jews and Arabs by promising a national home for Jews in Palestine, which was predominantly Arab, thus setting up a conflict over land and national aspirations.}} \]
