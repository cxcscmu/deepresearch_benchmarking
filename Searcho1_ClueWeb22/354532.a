As an AI language model, I don't have personal expectations or opinions. However, I can provide you with some insights on how international business might change in a post-COVID-19 landscape based on current trends and analyses.

Firstly, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital technologies across various sectors. Businesses that were slow to embrace e-commerce, remote work, and digital communication tools have had to rapidly adapt. This shift towards digital operations is likely to persist even after the pandemic subsides, making international businesses more reliant on technology for day-to-day operations.

Secondly, supply chain resilience has become a critical concern. Many companies experienced disruptions due to lockdowns and restrictions on movement. As a result, there may be a trend towards diversifying supply chains, reducing dependency on single sources, and possibly reshoring some manufacturing activities to ensure greater control and flexibility.

Thirdly, consumer behavior has changed significantly during the pandemic. There has been an increased demand for healthcare products, home办公 equipment, and online services. These changes may continue to influence purchasing patterns and preferences, requiring international businesses to adjust their product offerings and marketing strategies accordingly.

Fourthly, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation and coordination in应对 crises. International businesses may need to engage more actively in cross-border collaborations and partnerships to address common challenges and seize new opportunities.

Lastly, the economic impact of the pandemic varies across countries and regions. Some economies have been hit harder than others, which could lead to shifts in global trade dynamics and investment patterns. International businesses will need to monitor these developments closely and adjust their strategies accordingly.

In summary, the post-COVID-19 landscape is likely to see continued emphasis on digital transformation, supply chain resilience, adapted consumer-focused strategies, enhanced global collaboration, and careful navigation of evolving economic conditions.
