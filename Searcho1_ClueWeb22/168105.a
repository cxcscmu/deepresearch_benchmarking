Alright, so I need to figure out why people are getting vaccinated. It seems like a pretty broad question, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First off, I know that vaccines are designed to prevent diseases by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens, like viruses or bacteria. So, one obvious reason people get vaccinated is to protect themselves from getting sick with these diseases.

But, there must be more to it than just personal protection. I've heard about something called herd immunity. Maybe that's another reason. Herd immunity happens when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to a disease, which then provides indirect protection to those who are not immune. So, by getting vaccinated, people aren't just protecting themselves, but also helping to protect their communities.

Let me think about this some more. Are there any other reasons why people might choose to get vaccinated? Maybe for travel purposes. I remember that some countries require certain vaccinations before allowing travelers to enter. So, people might get vaccinated to be able to travel abroad.

Also, in some workplaces or schools, vaccinations are mandatory or strongly recommended. For example, healthcare workers often need to show proof of certain vaccinations. So, compliance with institutional policies could be another reason.

Moreover, during outbreaks or pandemics, public health officials strongly recommend vaccinations to control the spread of the disease. People might get vaccinated to follow health recommendations and to do their part in stopping the outbreak.

I should also consider that some people might be getting vaccinated due to peer pressure or influence from family and friends who have gotten vaccinated. Social norms can play a big role in health decisions.

On the other hand, there are people who are hesitant about vaccinations due to various reasons, such as concerns about side effects, distrust in pharmaceutical companies, or misinformation. So, for those who do get vaccinated, it might be despite these hesitations, perhaps after researching and deciding that the benefits outweigh the risks.

I think it's also important to note that vaccinations have been instrumental in eradicating or controlling many deadly diseases throughout history, like smallpox, polio, and measles. Knowing this success story might motivate people to get vaccinated for current and future diseases.

Additionally, vaccinations can have economic benefits. By preventing diseases, vaccinations reduce healthcare costs associated with treating illnesses and missed work or school days. So, people might see vaccination as a wise investment in their overall well-being and that of their families.

I should also consider that some people might get vaccinated out of altruism, wanting to protect vulnerable populations who cannot get vaccinated due to age or medical conditions.

Let me see if there's anything else. Perhaps some people get vaccinated for peace of mind, to alleviate anxiety about getting sick, especially in times of health crises.

I think I've covered most of the reasons why people get vaccinated. Now, I should summarize them.

So, people get vaccinated for several reasons:

1. Personal protection against diseases.

2. Contributing to herd immunity to protect the community.

3. Enabling travel by meeting entry requirements.

4. Compliance with workplace or school mandates.

5. Adhering to public health recommendations during outbreaks.

6. Influenced by social norms and peer pressure.

7. After evaluating the benefits and risks, despite hesitations.

8. As part of a historical success in disease control and prevention.

9. Economic benefits by reducing healthcare costs.

10. Altruistic motives to protect vulnerable populations.

11. Peace of mind and reduction of anxiety about getting sick.

I might want to prioritize these reasons or group them into categories for better understanding.

Perhaps, I can group them into personal benefits, communal benefits, and practical necessities.

Personal benefits:

- Protection against diseases.

- Peace of mind.

- Enable travel.

Communal benefits:

- Herd immunity.

- Altruism to protect vulnerable populations.

Practical necessities:

- Compliance with mandates from workplaces or schools.

- Following public health recommendations during outbreaks.

- Economic benefits by reducing healthcare costs.

Additionally, there are motivational factors like social influence and informed decision-making despite hesitations.

I think this categorization makes sense.

Now, to make sure I haven't missed any important points, maybe I should look up some statistics or studies on vaccination motivations.

Let me consider performing a search to gather more information.

10 Reasons To Get Vaccinated
Vaccine-preventable diseases have not gone away
The viruses and bacteria that cause illness and death still exist and can be passed on to those who are not protected by vaccines. While many diseases are not common in the US, global travel makes it easy for diseases to spread.
Vaccines will help keep you healthy
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccinations throughout your life to protect against many infections. When you skip vaccines, you leave yourself vulnerable to illnesses such as shingles, pneumococcal disease, flu, and HPV and hepatitis B, both leading causes of cancer.
Vaccines are as important to your overall health as diet and exercise
Like eating healthy foods, exercising, and getting regular check-ups, vaccines play a vital role in keeping you healthy. Vaccines are one of the most convenient and safest preventive care measures available.
Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death
Vaccine-preventable infections can be deadly. Every year in the US, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 50,000 adults died from vaccine-preventable diseases.
Vaccines are safe
The US has a robust approval process to ensure that all licensed vaccines are safe. Potential side effects associated with vaccines are uncommon and much less severe than the diseases they prevent.
Vaccines will not cause the diseases they are designed to prevent
Vaccines contain either killed or weakened viruses, making it impossible to get the disease from the vaccine.
Young and healthy people can get very sick, too
Infants and older adults are at increased risk for serious infections and complications, but vaccine-preventable diseases can strike anyone. If you are young and healthy, getting vaccinated can help you stay that way.
Vaccine-preventable diseases are expensive
Diseases not only have a direct impact on individuals and their families, but also carry a high price tag for society as a whole, exceeding $10 billion per year. An average flu illness can last up to 15 days, typically with five or six missed work or school days. Adults who get hepatitis A lose an average of one month of work.
When you get sick, your children, grandchildren, and parents may be at risk, too
Adults are the most common source of pertussis (whooping cough) infection in infants which can be deadly for babies. When you get vaccinated, you are protecting yourself and your family as well as those in your community who may not be able to be vaccinated.
Your family and co-workers need you
In the US each year, millions of adults get sick from vaccine-preventable diseases, causing them to miss work and leaving them unable to care for those who depend on them, including their children and/or aging parents.

We’re at a crucial period in the global fight against COVID-19. Around the world, cases of the coronavirus continue to remain stubbornly high, averaging nearly 600,000 cases a day. In the United States, cases are at an all-time high since last winter, averaging over 140,000 new cases with nearly 2,000 new deaths being reported each day. These numbers coupled with current hospitalization rates in many parts of the country are high enough to strain health care systems.
We have three safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to help to curb transmission levels and protect people from the worst outcomes of this devastating disease. Yet millions of Americans remain unvaccinated by choice.  The best protection from the virus that causes COVID-19 is to get vaccinated.
Here are 16 reasons why you should get vaccinated:
COVID-19 vaccination is the safest way to help the immune system build protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.
Your risk of covid-19 infection is reduced by 5 times by being fully vaccinated.
Your risk of experiencing severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalization is reduced by 10 times by being fully vaccinated.
Your risk of death from COVID-19 is reduced by 10 times by being fully vaccinated.
If you’ve had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, full vaccination provides additional protection against reinfection.
Fully vaccinated people with a vaccine breakthrough infection are less likely to develop serious illness and symptoms tend to be less severe than those who are unvaccinated and get COVID-19.
Fully vaccinated people clear the virus faster from their body compared to the unvaccinated if they experience vaccine breakthrough infection as an army of antibodies are already there to fight off the virus
Fully vaccinated people with breakthrough infections from the delta variant appear to be infectious for a shorter period than compared to those unvaccinated.
Your risk of spreading COVID-19 to friends, family, loved ones and those around you is reduced.
Your risk of experiencing long COVID (also known as long-haul COVID-19) from vaccine breakthrough infection is reduced by nearly half.
If you are pregnant, COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy reduces the risk of infection and hospitalization. Antibodies made after a pregnant person is vaccinated may also help protect newborns against COVID-19
All activities become safer when you’re vaccinated.
You help prevent straining hospitals by not requiring supplemental oxygen or ICU level care for COVID-19.
By being fully vaccinated, you help protect the most vulnerable like those immunocompromised as well as persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and even kids who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated.
Vaccination helps with community immunity, or herd immunity, which will reduce the spread of the virus and prevent further variants from emerging.
You help end the pandemic sooner for all of us.

The 6 reasons Americans aren’t getting vaccinated
The 6 reasons Americans aren’t getting vaccinated

It’s the most important question in America today: Why aren’t people getting vaccinated?

America’s vaccine campaign has collapsed from its previous highs. While at one point in mid-April more than 3 million people received the shot each day, now only around 1.2 million are now — a rate that’s less than half of what it was at the peak. So the US might not make President Joe Biden’s goal to vaccinate 70 percent of adults by July Fourth: At the current rates, roughly 175 million adults will get at least their first shots by Independence Day, falling short of the nearly 180 million needed.
If the vaccination campaign continues to stall out, it leaves the US vulnerable to a range of risks, from summer outbreaks in the South to continued resurgences of the coronavirus this fall to the possibility of new and dangerous variants. While the vaccinated are protected, the virus is still spreading among the unvaccinated as quickly as it was during the massive outbreaks of the recent fall and winter. That continued spread is particularly dangerous for those who can’t get vaccinated or don’t receive sufficient protection from the vaccines (if they’re immunocompromised).
So it’s crucial to understand why a segment of the population, even a minority, isn’t getting vaccinated — as a first step to figuring out what will make a difference.
According to experts, there are a variety of reasons: lack of access to vaccines, a refusal to see Covid-19 as a threat, concern about the vaccines’ side effects, little trust in the vaccines or the institutions behind them, and belief in at least one of several different conspiracy theories. Some of these reasons overlap and compound; for example, if someone doesn’t see Covid-19 as a big threat, they might decide the vaccine isn’t worth the side effects.
People in some of these categories might be persuadable while others may not. The most resistant are likely going to be really hard to move over at this point, staying at around 15 to 20 percent of the population from poll to poll. But between these hard noes and the already vaccinated are a lot of people who have shown signs of movement before — enough to put a real dent in the fight against Covid-19.
So understanding why people aren’t getting vaccinated and how to overcome those reasons is now crucial to beating back the coronavirus — to really put it in the past and guarantee it no longer threatens to warp all our lives once again.
Reason 1: Lack of access, real or perceived
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s surveys, about 4 percent of Americans intend to get the vaccine as soon as possible but haven’t yet and another 12 percent are in wait-and-see mode. Particularly among these segments of the population, access is still likely a major barrier.
It’s true that access to the vaccine has dramatically expanded in recent months, with the federal government now ordering and delivering far more doses than states actually use. A shot that once required an appointment potentially weeks in advance is now so abundant that it’s available to walk-ins at many pharmacies and other locales.
But there are still hurdles. People may not have the transportation to get to a pharmacy. A busy, inflexible family or work schedule may prevent them from taking time off work to get the shot and take a day or two off to recover from the side effects. Some people believe — incorrectly — that getting the vaccine isn’t free for everyone or just may not know that the vaccine is actually available to them.
“Access doesn’t just mean we’ve opened up eligibility to everyone,” Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at Kaiser, told me. “Access also means that I can find a way to get the vaccine without putting my livelihood at risk, or I can get it in a place I feel safe getting it.”
To combat this, vaccines could be deployed in more places, such as workplaces or entertainment venues. To reach a greater diversity of people, a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests Dollar General, finding that adding the stores to federal vaccine distribution programs “would substantially decrease the distance to vaccine sites for low-income and minority US households.”
Employers could also offer paid time off for workers to get the shot and recover from any side effects — something that the Biden administration has already subsidized. And public officials and agencies could do more to make it clear that the vaccine will come at no cost to anyone who gets it, and that it’s now widely available for Americans 12 and older.
Reason 2: Covid-19 isn’t seen as a threat
Even after the past year, some Americans still don’t see the coronavirus as a serious threat. Maybe they’re young, seeing that the virus isn’t as deadly for them as it is for older groups. They could be Republicans, who bought into particularly former President Donald Trump’s claims that the coronavirus wasn’t a big deal and that Democrats, experts, and journalists have exaggerated its risk. Polls show both of these groups tend to be less likely to want to get vaccinated.
Not seeing Covid-19 as a threat remains one of the biggest predictors for those who are most resistant to getting vaccinated — the hard noes. These are many of the same people who spent much of the past year rejecting lockdowns and mask mandates as unnecessary and violations of their civil liberties.

“They are far more willing to believe that, basically, it’s okay — you’re fine, you’re not going to get the virus, and so you can behave normally,” Kathy Frankovic, a public opinion polling expert at YouGov, told me.
Unfortunately, these are also some of the same people for whom views about the vaccines seem most entrenched. Whether it’s a survey from Kaiser, YouGov, or Civiqs, around 1 in 5 Americans have consistently remained in this group over the past few months.
Still, there are possibly some ways to overcome this. Based on Kaiser’s polling, about a third of the hard noes would get vaccinated if it was required (by, say, an employer). Some would be persuaded by incentives, whether hard cash or free tickets for sporting events.
To put it another way: They may not be motivated by the risk of Covid-19 to get the shot, but some could get vaccinated if there’s another reason for them to do so.
Reason 3: Vaccine side effects
For some, the concern is the vaccine itself — and particularly the side effects that can come with it. These concerns can be about something the vaccine really causes, like a day or two of aches, fever, and fatigue or, in extremely rare cases, potentially blood clots. But they can also be about things that aren’t real or proven, like other long-term health risks or unproven claims about, for example, infertility.
Some of this comes down to getting the right information to the vaccine hesitant. Officials, media, and experts can continue to communicate that the side effects are almost all mild and don’t last very long — and are, in fact, a sign the vaccines are working and getting the immune system going. And while wilder ideas spread on social media, there’s no evidence that the vaccines have worse side effects in all but very rare circumstances. Blood clots, for example, were found in only 28 of 8.7 million people who got the Johnson & Johnson shot at the time of reporting, and they haven’t been found in anyone who got the Moderna or Pfizer shots.
But there are more practical considerations as well. Some people focused on side effects may worry, for example, that a day or two of fatigue and fever will keep them out of work — putting their job at risk or, at the very least, costing them pay that’s needed to pay the bills. Fixing that will simply require getting more employers to offer paid time off or a pay bonus not just for getting the shot but the recovery period too.
Reason 4: Lack of trust in the vaccines
Beyond concerns about side effects, many of the hesitant just don’t have much trust in the vaccines. They may believe that the process for the vaccines was too fast — it was, after all, a record time from conception to mass production. They may note that the vaccines aren’t even technically approved by the Food and Drug Administration, since the agency has only authorized them for emergency use.
And some are traditional anti-vaxxers, distrusting vaccines in general.
There are messages that can break through this group, like explaining the clinical trials and the many safety and efficacy checks that went into them. Some of these people may simply change their minds as they see others around them getting vaccinated and doing well — that’s likely one reason, Frankovic said, that older demographics, who’ve been eligible for the vaccines for longer, are more likely to get the shot.
One thing that could help: the FDA’s full approval of the vaccines. Kaiser’s survey found that about one-third of unvaccinated Americans say they would be more likely to get vaccinated if the vaccines got full approval. (Moderna and Pfizer have applied, but it’s unclear what the timeline is for full approval just yet.)
Reason 5: Lack of trust in institutions
For some of the hesitant, the concerns may not be about Covid-19 and the vaccines but the institutions that surround both. They may not trust the government agencies or companies that helped develop the vaccines. Or they may not trust the health care system in general.
These feelings could be newly developed. Over the past year, especially, polling has found much of the public but especially Trump voters lost trust in major government institutions, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People in this category are less likely to listen to the agency and other government officials’ calls to get vaccinated.
Some views could be more entrenched. Black Americans, for example, report lower levels of trust in the health care system — a result of outright abuses, like the Tuskegee study (in which Black people were literally experimented on without their consent), but also day-to-day discrimination they experience when they go to doctors and hospitals. This distrust can then extend to vaccines.
Restoring trust in institutions is a long-term, difficult job. But in the meantime, approaches like incentives and education campaigns can at least get people to think that, regardless of what these organizations are doing, it’s in their interest to get vaccinated.
Reason 6: A variety of conspiracy theories
At least half of people who say they won’t get vaccinated believe at least one conspiracy theory about the Covid-19 vaccines or vaccines in general, based on a YouGov poll from May.
The best hope for refuting such disinformation, based on political science research, is for public officials and the media to stop spreading it and, when it does pop up, correct it. But the spread of disinformation is a much thornier problem that society at large is still coming to terms with as the internet and social media have made it so easy for people to proliferate lies and myths — and it will take a while to really get a handle on this.
Thankfully, the conspiracy theorists are still a minority of Americans overall.
A common theme
All of the reasons people provide for not getting vaccinated, from lack of access to conspiracy theories, share a common theme: A significant portion of Americans don’t believe that the vaccines are worth the potential downsides.
Everything officials and experts are now doing to vaccinate more Americans is in effect meant to beat back this one common theme. Better access would make a big downside less bad. Incentives could push the vaccine over the top, making it worth the downsides. Mandates could, too.
If all of this is successful, the country could truly defeat Covid-19. But if enough people believe the downsides are still too bad, the threat of the virus could lurk for years to come.

All of the reasons people provide for not getting vaccinated, from lack of access to conspiracy theories, share a common theme: A significant portion of Americans don’t believe the vaccines are worth the potential downsides.
Everything officials and experts are now doing to vaccinate more Americans is in effect meant to beat back this theme. Better access would mitigate a major downside. Incentives could push the vaccine over the top, making it worth the downsides. Mandates could too.
If all of this is successful, the country could truly defeat Covid-19. But if enough people believe the downsides are still too bad, the threat of the virus could lurk for years to come.

The REAL Reason Why So Many People Won’t Get Vaccinated

There are lots of people who aren’t going to get the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a Carnegie Mellon report released in March 2021, about 23% of respondents are still hesitant to be vaccinated against coronavirus. The rate is highest among African Americans, people of color in general, and young people. Concern about side effects was the top reason cited in the report. Another Kaiser study identified evangelicals, Republicans, and those without college degrees to be less likely to be vaccinated.
The affirmative scientific case in favor of getting vaccinated is clear. And for what it’s worth — I am in the “get vaccinated” camp. I was working as a dialysis nurse in Chicago hospitals when the vaccine became available, so I was fully vaccinated by the end of January. On behalf of all healthcare workers who are sick of wearing N95’s and plastic gowns that double as sweat suits, please get vaccinated.
The problem of misinformation about the vaccine and vaccine-related deaths is real and bears some responsibility for people choosing to skip the vaccine. It’s also true that the larger anti-vax movement has been heavily influenced by social media.
However, blaming misinformation misses a very important question that needs to be considered:
Why are so many people trusting a random social media post or piece(s) of misinformation over the public health officials, local and state government, the federal government, the mainstream news, and the World Health Organization?
To answer that question, we first need to acknowledge the status quo bias. Getting vaccinated is a break from the status quo (being unvaccinated) and requires action that cannot be reversed. Skipping the vaccine is easy; especially when the decision can be punted for another day, week, month, or year.
So in order to get someone to take the vaccine, you have to not only convince them that the benefit outweighs the risk, but convince them strongly enough that they decide to take action. Winning that argument would be easy in a vacuum just by using data and common sense. The vaccines are effective (so far), rarely elicit severe adverse reactions, and haven’t been shown to have any long-term effects.
The biggest problem facing the U.S. vaccination effort isn’t the misinformation nor the strength of the arguments in favor of vaccination. It’s the lack of trust in the institutions that are presenting the case.
Below, I’ve listed the groups and institutions from which a person is most likely to receive COVID vaccine-related information and discussed some of the reasons why people find them untrustworthy — both in general, and in relation to the pandemic.
The suggestion here that large portions of the population don’t trust any of these entities. Nor is it that most people are well-informed enough to even make a coherent case to discredit them. The argument is that the aggregate distrust toward these institutions in general has created an environment in which it’s much harder for any of them to overcome the status quo bias.
A (very) brief history
It’s important to “set the stage” by reminding everyone about just a few of the awful things that American healthcare institutions have done to various groups — many of whom are the same groups that exhibit the most hesitancy to be vaccinated against COVID:
Forced sterilization (early/mid1900's)- After a 1927 Supreme Court ruling upheld states’ right to sterilize people deemed “unfit to procreate,” about 70,000 people throughout the 20th century were sterilized in order to “breed out” certain traits. People of color, those with disabilities, the homeless, and “sexually promiscuous” women were especially targeted.
Tuskegee Experiment (1932)- U.S. Public Health Service experiment in which a group of mostly African American sharecroppers, promised free medical care in an attempt to study and treat syphilis, were given a placebo instead of penicillin and watched as they (and their spouses, in many cases) suffered horrible consequences for years.
Birth control trials in Puerto Rico (1955)- one of the earliest oral contraceptives was tested on impoverished and uneducated women, sometimes without informing them that they were part of a clinical trial. The side effects were severe, and three women died during that time (Puerto Rico was also a site for mass sterilization, often under false pretenses as well).
Cornelius Rhoads’ entire medical career (1930’s-50's)- If you haven’t read or heard much about him, I’d suggest taking the time to do so. He did a bunch of awful experiments on Puerto Ricans and was exposed after writing a letter discussing his hatred and ill-will toward them. He came back to the states and was eventually promoted to Vice President of the New York Academy of medicine. Rhoads later directed chemical weapons trials that used thousands of U.S. soldiers as guinea pigs, and ultimately became a pioneer in chemotherapy treatments — and even had awards named after him until recently.
Systemic racism in healthcare continues to be an issue for various groups whose access to care is diminished, and whose healthcare quality is inferior due to prevailing biases in institutions and providers.
Public health organizations
From the first confirmed coronavirus cases back in late January 2020, the United States’ CDC was slow to respond compared to many other countries. One of the starkest contrasts was with South Korea, whose initial response in testing, contact tracing, and subsequent infection data were significantly favorable to that of the U.S. It’s also important to remember that we already knew from the early experiences of China and Italy the potential for a massive health event, and still failed to respond quickly.
The lackluster response extended through the end of 2020, with the U.S. performing very poorly in most categories. It botched the testing process process, leading to an early spike in cases and deaths that overwhelmed many hospitals — and very well might have been otherwise avoidable. Its messaging on virus spread and recommendations was often inconsistent, and sometimes flat-out wrong.
And remember when the CDC told us not to wear masks?
When the CDC wasn’t busy getting things wrong, they were dealing with with meddling from the Trump administration, which actively tried to downplay the severity of the pandemic.
The result was deep damage to the credibility of the institution. A Harris poll from August 2020 found that only 73% of Americans saw the CDC as “very” or “somewhat” trustworthy. That number is way too low for an institution that is perhaps most representative of “the science” that we’re all supposed to follow.
The World Health Organization (WHO) did better than the CDC, but has had a few issues of its own. To its credit, the organization issued its “public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)” declaration on January 30, 2020 and started making recommendations at that time — which were ignored by most countries.
The damage to WHO’s reputation seems to be much less severe than most other groups discussed here, and for reasons largely out of its control. For one, it simply didn’t have enough power to do much of anything to slow the spread of COVID besides making recommendations. There may be a good argument in support of giving the organization some teeth going forward, but that’s another conversation.
The more serious transgression was the rhetoric around restrictive policies (lockdowns, curfews, stay-at-home orders, etc.). As more data around these types of policies become available, it’s getting clearer that they were often over-utilized, causing additional distress that may have otherwise been avoided — particularly in the areas of mental health and substance abuse, as well as economically.
Again to WHO’s credit, lockdowns are actually useful in certain situations. And WHO was never explicitly in favor of lockdowns as a primary means of preventing the spread of the coronavirus, but instead as a short-term measure while a better plan could be developed. But the fact that it did recommend lockdowns so frequently in the early stages, combined with our country’s struggle with nuance in the national discourse, have led many to conclude that “lockdowns are useless and the WHO was wrong.”
Also, the organization has been scrutinized over its lack of criticism toward China for its obfuscation of knowledge and data and lack of cooperation with the global community— particularly in the beginning of the pandemic. It can be sometimes be hard to differentiate between jingoistic, bad faith anti-China sentiment and legitimate criticism, but in this case it seems to be warranted.
The inconsistencies in guidance from the CDC and WHO had the unfortunate effect of hindering the coordination between federal and state governments as well. For example, there was a brief time in August when a poorly-worded softening of guidelines caused some states to stop testing asymptomatic people, even if they had contact with someone with COVID (Classic CDC, am I right?). Even when the CDC clarified its new guidelines to say that anyone in close contact with an infected person should get tested, its website was still unclear in the following weeks and many states lagged in adjusting their policies.
All the inconsistency and, in some cases, incompetence from the most influential public health organizations not only damaged their own credibility, but made decision-making and discourse that much more difficult for other institutions and people.
Politicians
Our elected officials at the federal level are probably the lowest-hanging fruit when discussing trustworthiness or lack thereof. Pre-pandemic, the public trust in Washington was already at an all-time low and has been steadily declining since 2001, when there was a sharp increase in the aftermath of 9/11. As of early 2019, the percentage of people who always or usually trust the government in Washington was at 17% per Pew Research. The split between Democrats and Republicans tends to fluctuate depending which party holds the White House.
It’s not necessary to wade much deeper into the cesspool of our current national politics; the evidence of its untrustworthiness is clear enough on its own. I’m also going to go out on a limb and assume that most of my readers already have a basic understanding of negative impact that the Trump administration has had, both in terms of COVID response and on the discourse. If not, here you go.
State and local governments, however, have been shown to have more public trust. A 2018 Gallup poll reported that 63% of respondents had at least “a fair amount of trust” in their state government, along with 72% for local government. That’s certainly better, but keep in mind that these numbers represent opinions from before COVID. It’s also questionable whether that’s enough trust to carry water for other less-trustworthy federal institutions in the fight to reach herd immunity.
Of course, state and local governments’ responses have varied greatly, but most jurisdictions have either been following the CDC’s indecisive lead or have been picking and choosing which guidelines to follow — often incorrectly. Since pretty much all states have had their share of spikes in COVID cases and deaths and about 80% states falling between 8,000 and 12,000 cases per 100,000 people, not many states can boast a particularly impressive response in a country that still has nearly the most cases per capita in the world.
Lastly, I want to at least touch on one of the biggest detriments to real debate and change in our country. The binary nature of our politics — the tendency to frame all debates as “yes or no” or “pro- or anti-” — has been polarizing the country and hurting the national conversation for a while now. This problem is deeply rooted and multifaceted, but many state and federal elected officials have accelerated it in the last fifty years or so.
This framing problem inserted itself into both the country’s COVID response and the discourse surrounding it, making common sense mitigation measures like masks into a culture war issue. And I think that many, if not most people do have some instinctive understanding that our elected officials are largely to blame for that phenomenon.
The mainstream news media
News media, like politicians, have suffered greatly in terms of public trust in recent years. A big part of that erosion has been the result of coordinated attacks from Republican officials and conservative voices from Nixon and Goldwater to Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Carlson, and Trump. And to be fair to the mainstream outlets, much of that criticism was either political strategy (that has proven to be quite successful over the years) or a way to fight back against changing cultural dynamics, especially in the years following the civil rights movement.
That being said — mainstream news media has also been truly terrible for a long time, and in many ways.
Traditional news outlets have historically and continue to provide cover for foreign policy atrocities from Vietnam and Southeast Asia in general to Central America in the 70’s and 80’s to Iraq more recently. I really want to emphasize this point because not only because of the countless lives lost due to aggressive and unnecessary U.S. foreign policy interventions, but also because it’s quite possible that we wouldn’t still be losing American lives in multi-decade wars in Iraq and Afghanistan if these outlets were more adversarial. Noam Chomsky and Edward Hermann’s Manufacturing Consent is a great place to start if you want to learn about the media’s role in U.S. foreign policy.
Aside from being propagandistic at times, the mainstream media — arguably beginning with Fox in the 90’s — has increasingly become entertainment more than news, relying on tapping into the emotion centers of the brain to increase viewer engagement. Matt Taibbi’s Hate Inc. discusses this point in much more depth.
Trump was able to take advantage of the media’s sensationalism, using spectacle to attract nearly $2 billion in free media throughout the campaign and propel him to the presidency. That pattern continued throughout his presidency, with coverage on both sides revolving around him since he was great for ratings. Fox was almost always pro-Trump, and pretty much every other major player was predictably anti-Trump. Many people, especially younger people, saw that trend for what it was and abandoned mainstream news outlets altogether.
Newspaper and cable has also become much more consolidated and financialized in recent years. I’m sure that many have seen this spooky video of the right-leaning Sinclair Broadcast Group’s media acquisitions by now:
How America's Largest Local TV Owner Turned Its News Anchors Into Soldiers In Trump's War On The…
Earlier this month, CNN's Brian Stelter broke the news that Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner or operator of nearly 200…
theconcourse.deadspin.com
This consolidation, as well as the other factors listed above, has resulted in a severely narrowed the range of substantive discourse in favor of stories that can keep eyeballs and increase ad revenue.
That’s why, for a lot of people, when Trump started identifying these outlets as ‘fake news,’ it stuck — because it’s kind of true.
Traditional news media outlets, with record-low levels of trustworthiness, were always going to have an uphill battle to be taken seriously by large enough numbers of people on COVID-related issues that they could make a real difference in the push for vaccination when the time came.
In the early stages of the pandemic, Fox News was absolutely terrible — often downplaying the virus and working hard to make COVID fit into the money-making culture war framework. The other mainstream outlets fell victim to their existing sensationalist flaws, focusing too heavily on Trump and fearmongering with up-to-the-minute case and death trackers and anecdotal personal tragedies to pull at the heartstrings. One study even found a correlation of the viewing of mainstream news’ coronavirus coverage and depressive symptoms.
Local healthcare workers
If we can’t rely on public health officials, government on any level, or the mainstream press to get us to herd immunity, then on whom can we rely?
According to the same Carnegie Mellon University report mentioned earlier, local healthcare workers — followed by friends and family — have the best shot.
The data from the report found that among those who hesitant to be vaccinated against COVID, almost 20% state that they would be more likely to be vaccinated if recommended by local healthcare workers. That number has been increasing since January when the vaccine became more widely available, and is more than double the percentage for government health officials, WHO, and politicians.
It makes intuitive sense — healthcare teams are generally viewed as authoritative sources for health information and will likely have the opportunity to build trust through repeat interactions. They are also much more accountable to their patients than any of the other sources previously discussed are to their audiences. In many smaller communities, there may be a connection outside the medical facility (friend of a friend, went to high school together, coworker’s niece, etc.). And a specific healthcare worker talking to a specific patient about their specific vaccine concern will be much more likely to change that person’s mind than a generic news report.
Plus, it helps that nurses — who do the bulk of patient education in many settings — have been the “most trusted profession” for almost twenty years running.
Unfortunately, large swaths of the populations that need convincing don’t have access to the types of healthcare that would likely yield a productive conversation about the COVID vaccine. Virtually everyone has access to an emergency department and hospital when necessary, but there’s a significant body of evidence to suggest that hospitalizations and ER visits are not very effective times for education. There’s just too much going on — added stress, financial worries, tests and procedures, changes in health condition, and need for more important types of education make it much harder for any extra information to stick.
Discussions with the healthcare team need to happen in an outpatient setting such as with a primary care doctor’s office, ideally when the person isn’t dealing with an acute illness or concern. But of course, this is the exact type of care to which many people don’t have access. As of 2019, about 1 in 4 adults didn’t have a primary care provider and that number was significantly higher in young people, people of color, and those living in southern states — a.k.a. the demographics that are most likely to express vaccine hesitancy.
So while local healthcare workers show the most promise as trusted individuals to make the case for COVID vaccination, they’re also the group that is hardest for an individual to access.
Again, the idea is not that most individuals can spout off all the facts that I discussed here. But if one group is skeptical of the CDC and WHO, one group is skeptical of the news media, etc. — and they’re all making the same arguments — the result is a “united front” of institutions that very few people can trust enough to take the (perceived) risk of getting vaccinated.
I wish that there were more that we could do to help in convincing people to get vaccinated. If you want to make an impact, here are a few simple suggestions:
Figure out who are the best resources for information in your community, and point people to them. Changing minds will happen best at the local level.
If you already got vaccinated, talk about it. You don’t have to be a salesperson; just be honest about your experience.
Don’t be condescending. It doesn’t matter how good an argument is if you rub people the wrong way while making it.
Meet people where they’re at. You probably can’t change a “hard-no” to a “hard-yes” in one conversation, but you might be able to change them to a “soft-no” and open the door for someone else to finish the job.

Alright, so I've got this task to figure out why people are getting vaccinated. I think the best way to approach this is to consider both the individual and societal benefits of vaccination. Let me start by thinking about the personal reasons someone might have for getting vaccinated.

First off, protection against diseases is probably the most obvious reason. Vaccines help your body build immunity to specific diseases without having to go through the actual illness. So, by getting vaccinated, people can protect themselves from getting sick with diseases that can be serious or even life-threatening.

Another personal benefit might be peace of mind. Knowing that you're less likely to get a particular disease can reduce anxiety, especially during times when there are outbreaks or pandemics. It also means you're less likely to pass the disease on to others, which could be particularly important if you have family members or friends who are more vulnerable to certain illnesses.

Now, moving on to societal reasons. One key concept here is herd immunity. When a large portion of the population is vaccinated, it becomes harder for diseases to spread because there are fewer susceptible hosts. This protects even those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons, like newborns or people with certain allergies or immune system disorders.

Vaccination also reduces the burden on healthcare systems. When fewer people get sick with preventable diseases, hospitals and clinics can focus on other health issues. This is especially important during outbreaks when resources can be stretched thin.

Moreover, vaccinations have played a crucial role in eradicating or controlling many deadly diseases throughout history, like smallpox, polio, and measles. So, by getting vaccinated, people are contributing to the ongoing effort to eliminate these diseases worldwide.

There are also practical reasons why people get vaccinated. For instance, some jobs or schools require certain vaccinations as a condition of employment or enrollment. So, people might get vaccinated to comply with these requirements.

Additionally, in some countries, vaccinations are provided for free or at a low cost, making them an accessible way to maintain health without incurring significant expenses.

I should also consider that for some people, getting vaccinated is a way to demonstrate their commitment to public health and to follow the advice of medical professionals and public health organizations.

On the other hand, it's important to acknowledge that not everyone chooses to get vaccinated. There are individuals who are hesitant or refuse vaccinations due to various reasons, including concerns about side effects, distrust in pharmaceutical companies, or beliefs that vaccines are unnecessary or ineffective.

To better understand this, maybe I should look into some statistics or studies on vaccination motivations. Let me think about how to approach this. Perhaps I can search for reasons why people choose to get vaccinated and see what the most common factors are.

Let me consider performing a search to gather more information.
