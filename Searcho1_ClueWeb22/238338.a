Alright, so I've got this question: "Why are Cubans protesting?" Now, I don't know much about current events, especially regarding Cuba, so I need to figure this out. Maybe I should start by understanding what's been happening in Cuba recently that might have led to protests.

First, I should probably look up some recent news about Cuba to see what's been going on. Maybe there have been some political changes or economic issues that have triggered these protests. I think searching for "recent Cuban protests" would be a good starting point.

The Latest Round of Protests in Cuba Are a Bust—for Now
But US sanctions and Covid have kept the island in a vise only made worse by a dysfunctional economy and long overdue reforms.

H avana— After weeks of media hype, planned anti-government demonstrations that had been billed here as a nationwide March for Change fizzled out on Monday. Around the country, at least 11 protesters that did come out were arrested. In downtown Havana, handfuls of university students wearing white walked around looking for a march to join—but found only throngs of police and plainclothes state security officers.
The young artists and intellectuals who had organized the march were easily overpowered by the Cuban state, which banned the protest and prevented leaders from leaving their homes. While fear played a key role in suppressing turnout, the protests were also a bust because their predominantly middle-class planners—who are pushing for more freedom of expression and democracy—failed to connect with more working-class sectors of society, many of whose members took to the streets in July in anger over falling living standards. In an unexpected twist, Yunior García, the young playwright who had become the face of the organization that called for the protests, Archipelago—landed in Madrid on Wednesday. It remains unclear whether he has been exiled.
The context
Material living conditions in Cuba have recently plummeted dramatically. The end of cheap Venezuelan oil, the legendary dysfunction of the island’s economy, and the implementation of a long-overdue monetary reform program all play roles in the country’s dire economic situation. But the crisis has two proximate causes: US sanctions and Covid.
From 2017 to 2020, the Trump administration adopted a “maximum pressure” policy that throttled the Cuban economy. The administration meted out 240 powerful sanctions—including travel restrictions, pressure on other governments to stop contracting for Cuban doctors, and a reduction of remittances—which shaved billions from the state’s annual hard currency inflows.
Then came Covid, wiping out tourism and pushing things over the precipice.
“They’ve had to cut imports by about half,” said Emily Morris, a development economist at University College London. “Given that half of all import spending is on food and fuel, you can see what a devastating effect that was going to have on the economy.”
Ever since the pandemic, almost surreally long lines have formed outside supermarkets. People now turn up the night before to get a place in line, some carrying bedsheets and cardboard boxes as mattresses. By dawn, hundreds wait to buy chicken, soap, and cooking oil.

And while the government managed to maintain electricity for households in 2020, that started to falter this year. Before flaring through the rest of the island, the July protests began in the western town of San Antonio de los Baños after an eight-hour power cut.
“The first cries were not for freedom,” said Marta Ramírez, a feminist activist opposed to all governments. “The first cries were more urgent: food, medicine and electricity.” At the time, hardened sanctions were also stalling production of the island’s locally developed vaccines, contributing to sky-high Covid rates that further compounded the anger.
So while this summer’s mass demonstrations were spontaneous, they took place within a pressure-cooker situation created, in large measure, by US foreign policy.
The Trump sanctions were only the most recent incarnation of long-standing US efforts to overthrow the Cuban government by making everyday Cubans suffer—a strategy that’s been in place (with a blissful blip under Obama) since Eisenhower.

The Biden administration had previously signaled it was ready to soften sanctions. Then July 11 happened. Ever since, policy change has been on hold, with administration officials arguing last week that “ circumstances changed ” regarding Cuba policy.
In other words, the most powerful country in the world is still trying to grind a socialist state to dust by collectively punishing its population. This is the context in which political struggles inside the island take place.
Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve met some of the fledgling activists who planned Monday’s march. It’s been a pleasure: Many are young actors, cinematographers, and journalists, who have benefited from the Cuban Revolution’s emphasis on education and culture. They are likable, principled, and Internet-savvy—and more determined than their parents’ generation to fight for their political and civic rights.
They also contrast sharply with traditional dissidence on the island—which was right wing, without much of a base, and, according to a 2009 US embassy cable, more interested in squabbling about money than bringing about political change.
Earlier this month, I spoke with Yunior García, who shot to fame last November in anti-censorship protests outside the Culture Ministry, and was anointed by the media as the face of Archipelago, the Facebook group of 35,000 that called for the protests.
García says that “Cuban problems are for Cubans to sort out.” He insists that nobody in Archipelago takes so much as “a cent” from foreign governments. “I’m opposed to any interference from any foreign government in Cuba’s internal affairs,” he told me.
Over the last month, the state media has run a frenzied propaganda campaign against García casting him—predictably—as Washington’s pawn. While presenting no compelling evidence of US financial patronage, state media did document some links that may have prevented broader support for the protests on this fiercely patriotic island.
Earlier this year, García went to the US ambassador’s residence to meet with the acting head of the US Embassy in Havana as well as a former US army captain. While García said he went to discuss censorship and the human cost of the US sanctions, the state media says these meetings prove he’s a “political operator.”
Washington spends $20 million a year on so-called “democracy promotion” programs that are intended to build active opposition to the Cuban government.

“A dissident can have an authentic concern about freedom of expression,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington, D.C. “But the minute that they begin to accept support from the US, then they put themselves at risk, because the US is trying to overthrow the Cuban government.”
In 2018 and ’19, García attended a series of seminars in Madrid and Buenos Aires titled “Times of change and the new role of the armed forces in Cuba,” which, according to the project’s website, aims to “inform dissidents and critics” about potential allies in the Cuban armed forces in the event of a “political opening.”
“The Cuban Armed Forces are very powerful,” said Dr. Laura Tedesco, a specialist in political leadership in Saint Louis University and one of the course conveners. “So it’s important to think how they can be integrated into a society that is not a dictatorship.”
Tedesco said she invited García to the seminar partly because she believes Cuban artists “yearning for freedom” make them the “weakest link” in the socialist regime. García said he attended the seminar looking for inspiration for a play.
Both Tedesco and the other course convener, Professor Rut Diamint, who has previously carried out research for the US National Endowment of Democracy, have refused to disclose the seminar’s funding sources.
Prospects for dissent ebb away
When I interviewed him in May, Vice Minister for Culture Fernando Rojas insisted that there is space for “multiple forms of dissent” on the island. “We have to talk to people who are critical,” he said.
But he tempered his position because of US financing of dissidents and anti-regime online media, which he describes as “low-intensity warfare.”
“I do not consider anybody who receives US funding as an honest person who wants to change this country for the better,” he said. “But [we] have to be very careful not to commit incorrect acts against innocent people.”
Yet this is exactly what’s happening: Reactionary elements of the regime (not to mention lazy bureaucrats) have long closed down space for debate by tagging those who make critiques they don’t like as “counterrevolutionaries.” Left-wing activists are also regularly spied on; many were beaten up by police during July’s protests.
Amid fights in food lines, a miasma of online US-funded disinformation, and Communist Party smear campaigns, politics here is turning toxic. State security intimidation tactics—which include cutting activists’ Internet and phone lines and subjecting them to hours of interrogations—have only confirmed the belief of many Archipelago coordinators that they are up against a dictatorship.
The Cuban state may have won the latest round. But with the smoldering economic crisis hacking deep into what support the government still has among the population and external aggression yet to ease up, the prospects for expanded freedom of expression on the island do not seem bright.
The international level
In the international media, the fight of this new generation of Cuban activists is framed as a battle for democracy against an authoritarian state. Which is correct. But the conflict also carries another political meaning.
While Cuban media claims that dissidents are merely “pawns” are clearly exaggerated, these activists are being used by politicians in Florida and Washington. A repeat of mass protests or dramatic repression would have empowered hard-liners.
“The emergence of a protest movement strengthens the political hand of the regime changers in Washington to block any return to normalized US relations with Cuba, at great cost to the socioeconomic evolution of Cuban society, and the Cuban people” said Peter Kornbluh, Cuba analyst at the National Security Archive, and coauthor of Back Channel to Cuba .
Havana will hope that events of this week will banish any pipe dream the Biden administration may have had about the government falling.
While the return of tourism (which began this week after Cuba fully vaccinated 79 percent of its population) might allow the state to palliate the economic crisis, so long as sanctions stay in place, the right of Cubans to food and medicine will continue to be trampled.
In the current twisted context, unless they are tactically astute, these Cuban activists’ brave push for expanded freedoms could well result in the deterioration of political, civil, and economic rights for everyone on the island.
That would be a tragedy.

Democrats influenced by progressives don't want to 'go hard' on Cuba, says WaPo reporter
Washington Post political investigations reporter Toluse Olorunnipa observed that Democrats don't want to "go hard" on Cuba because they are being influenced by the more progressive members of their party who "agree" with many of the struggling country's socialist policies.
In recent days Cuban protesters have expressed anger over rising prices, shortages of goods and poor health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
"They are really being led by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and the progressive wing does not want to go hard against Cuba, against some of the things that the Castro regime may have been a part of it," Olorunnipa argued on CNN's "Inside Politics" Sunday.

Gloria Estefan has become the latest celebrity to speak out about the recent protests in Cuba.
On Friday, the three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to call on the United States and other international democratic countries to aid the Cuban people.
"My heart hurts for the Cuban people on the island & what they’ve already gone through for over 62 years. … But now they are saying ENOUGH," the singer wrote. "Despite the beatings, the murders & incarcerations, the abuses of power, the starvation & the attempted destruction of their spirits!

Cubans give voice to anger with protests: Quotes from Havana
Cartoonist and graphic artist Wimar Verdecia attended Sunday's march, noting the number of young protesters.
"All young people want to migrate because it's a country where there is no future, where you can't think of a prosperous and dignified life," Verdecia said told The Guardian.
Another protester, who gave the name Ana, was part of a protest that reached the El Capitolio in Havana.
"We also felt the presence of the quick response brigades," Ana said. "They are state security but are dressed as civilians. They were first to provoke."
Gregory Biniowsky, a Canadian lawyer and long-time resident of Cuba, said of the protests, "In truth I'm surprised it took so long."

Two asylum policies? Cubans arriving by boat turned back but those crossing southwest border face be
The Biden administration this week warned Cubans attempting to enter the U.S. by boat that they would be turned back or sent to a third country -- all while tens of thousands of migrants arriving at the southern border are being let in.
"Allow me to be clear. If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States," Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week about migrants from Cuba and Haiti coming across the Florida Straits.
As political protests against the authoritarian communist regime rock the country, there are fears of a spike in migrants fleeing. Mayorkas said DHS has not yet seen a surge, but warned that those coming over would not come in -- but could be referred to a third country.

Thousands rally for Cuban democracy in Miami
Thousands of supporters of Cubans protesting their Communist regime gathered in downtown Miami Saturday to call for democracy in the country.
The Florida rally came a week after Cubans rose up in a rare display of defiance against the government.
“I think that the monumental voice, the platform of social media that they tried to dim down by taking away the internet, I think that’s bringing awareness that we haven’t seen before,” protester Caridad Rodriguez told WSVN-TV in Miami. “We’ve heard these stories, but now we’re seeing what is happening over there.”

Cuban officials rallied tens of thousands of supporters in the streets on Saturday — nearly a week after they were stunned by the most widespread protests in decades.
President Miguel Díaz-Canel— accompanied by 90-year-old former President Raul Castro — appeared on the seafront Malecon boulevard that had seen some of the largest protests against shortages and the political system the previous weekend.
He made an impassioned speech blaming unrest on the U.S. and its economic embargo, “the blockade, aggression and terror,” as a crowd waved Cuban flags and those of the July 26 Movement that Fidel Castro led during Cuba's revolution.

High prices, food shortages fuel Cuba's biggest anti-government protests in decades
Updated on:  July 12, 2021 / 7:01 PM / CBS/AP
Havana — Thousands of Cubans marched on Havana's Malecon promenade and elsewhere on the island Sunday to protest food shortages and high prices amid the coronavirus crisis, in one of biggest anti-government demonstrations in memory. Many young people took part in the afternoon protest in the capital, which disrupted traffic until police moved in after several hours and broke up the march when a few protesters threw rocks.

Police initially trailed behind as protesters chanted "Freedom," "Enough" and "Unite." One motorcyclist pulled out a U.S. flag, but it was snatched from him by others.
To many Cubans, Biden is no "different from Trump"
"We are fed up with the queues, the shortages. That's why I'm here," one middle-age protester told The Associated Press. He declined to identify himself for fear of being arrested later.
Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.
An official in the Biden administration tweeted support for Sunday's demonstrations.
Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need.

"Peaceful protests are growing in #Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID cases/deaths & medicine shortages. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors in need," tweeted Julie Chung, acting assistant secretary for state for Western Hemisphere affairs.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel appeared on television to condemn the protests, and he called on supporters of the government to take to the streets in response.

"We're calling on all of the revolutionaries in the country, all of the communists, to come out onto the streets and to go to the places where these provocations are going to take place," Díaz-Canel said. "The combat order is given: To the streets, revolutionaries."
His words drew another tweet from Chung in the U.S., who said the American government was "deeply concerned by 'calls to combat' in #Cuba ." She reiterated the American government's support for the Cuban people's right to protest peacefully, and added: "We call for calm and condemn any violence."
Cuba's director general for U.S. affairs, Carlos F. de Cossio, dismissed her remarks in his own tweet: "US State Department and its officials, involved to their necks in promoting social and political instability in #Cuba, should avoid expressing hypocritical concern for a situation they have been betting on. Cuba is and will continue to be a peaceful country, contrary to the US."

The demonstration grew to a few thousand in the vicinity of Galeano Avenue and the marchers pressed on despite a few charges by police officers and tear gas barrages. People standing on many balconies along the central artery in the Centro Habana neighborhood applauded the protesters passing by. Others joined in the march.
Although many people tried to take out their cellphones and broadcast the protest live, Cuban authorities shut down internet service throughout the afternoon.
About 2 1/2 hours into the march, some protesters pulled up cobblestones and threw them at police, at which point officers began arresting people and the marchers dispersed.

AP journalists counted at least 20 people who were taken away in police cars or by individuals in civilian clothes.
"The people came out to express themselves freely, and they are repressing and beating them," Rev. Jorge Luis Gil, a Roman Catholic priest, said while standing at a street corner in Centro Habana.
About 300 people close to the government then arrived with a large Cuban flag shouting slogans in favor of the late President Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution. Some people from the group assaulted an AP cameraman, disabling his camera, while an AP photographer was injured by the police.

Demonstrations were also held elsewhere on the island, including the small town of San Antonio de los Banos, where people protested power outages and were visited by Díaz-Canel. He entered a few homes, where he took questions from residents.
Afterward, though, he accused Cuban Americans of stirring up trouble.
"As if pandemic outbreaks had not existed all over the world, the Cuban-American mafia, paying very well on social networks to influencers and Youtubers, has created a whole campaign... and has called for demonstrations across the country," Diaz-Canel told reporters.
Cuba and the U.S.
Many Cubans were left disappointed last month when the Biden administration declined an opportunity to reverse the harsher policy instituted against their nation by former President Donald Trump. The Biden White House has not lifted a flurry of additional sanctions imposed by Mr. Trump on Cuba right before he left office, and the U.S. stood almost alone on June 23 in voting against a United Nations resolution condemning Washington's six-decade embargo on the island.
As CBS News producer Portia Siegelbaum reported, many Cubans — including doctors and nurses who say their ability to respond to the coronavirus pandemic has been hamstrung by American sanctions — had hoped to see the Biden administration abstain from the U.N. vote, as the Obama administration did in 2016. Instead, the U.S. voted "No" again, as it did under former President Trump.
In total, 184 nations voted in favor of the resolution condemning the U.S. embargo on Cuba. The same resolution has passed easily every year since it first came up in 1992.
The statement given by the U.S. delegation defending its vote at the U.N. in June was a strong indication of where the Biden administration stands on lifting existing sanctions against Cuba, CBS News' Pamela Falk reported from U.N. headquarters.
"The United States stands with the Cuban people and seeks to support their pursuit of freedom, prosperity, and a future of greater dignity," Rodney Hunter, the Political Coordinator for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., told diplomats at the General Assembly. "Sanctions are one set of tools in our broader effort toward Cuba to advance democracy, promote respect for human rights, and help the Cuban people exercise the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"We are engaging directly with a large swath of Cuban civil society, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own futures. We are also engaging directly with the Cuban government to denounce abuses and push for reform," Hunter added. "The United States stands with all who defend freedom in Cuba. Cubans, as all people, deserve the right to freedom of expression, assembly, and culture. No government should silence its critics through violations of their human rights."

Street protests erupted across Cuba on July 11, 2021, with crowds of Cubans demonstrating against food scarcity, medicine shortages and economic misery in their island nation. Some demanded “freedom” and the end of “dictatorship” – anti-government sentiments that were soon echoed in the United States by Cuban-Americans and politicians, including President Joe Biden.
In a televised address, Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel blamed the spontaneous demonstrations – by far the largest mass protests in decades – on U.S. interference and threatened a “battle in the streets.” Protesters say hundreds were arrested.
These four stories describe current conditions in Cuba and the recent history behind this rare public outpouring of anger.
2018: Cuba gets a new president
The Communist Party has run Cuba since the 1959 Cuban Revolution.

For five decades, its leader was the fiery, anti-American revolutionary Fidel Castro. Castro led the country until 2008, when he fell sick and was succeeded by his more subdued younger brother, Raúl.
The younger Castro, also a Cuban Revolution fighter, maintained the his party’s total grip on politics but liberalized Cuba’s Soviet-style economy, recognizing private property and allowing Cubans to run small businesses. He also cultivated a less antagonistic relationship with the United States during the Obama administration.
Raúl Castro’s April 2018 retirement marked the end of the revolutionary era. But the selection of Díaz-Canel as president in April 2018 seemed unlikely to herald the beginning of a new Cuba.
“I don’t expect any drastic changes in direction from Díaz-Canel – at least, not right away,” wrote the American University Cuba analyst William LeoGrande shortly after Diaz-Canel took office.
Díaz-Canel is a seasoned Communist Party insider and Raul Castro’s chosen successor. Castro also remained in Cuba’s government until 2021 as first secretary of the Communist Party, “arguably a post more powerful than the presidency,” says LeoGrande.
Díaz-Canel came into office facing serious problems, including a weak economy and bad relations with the U.S. under then-President Donald Trump.
He also faced a new challenge: the internet, which had just become widely available to everyday Cubans. Access to online information and social media makes it harder for Díaz-Canel to repress dissent as effectively as for his predecessors.
“Internet expansion on the Communist island has produced a growing chorus of domestic critics,” LeoGrande wrote.

2019: Cuba gets a new constitution
Those critics gained more leeway to show their discontent in February 2019, when the Cuban National Assembly passed a new Cuban Constitution.
It included provisions that would “substantially expand social, political and economic rights in Cuba,” wrote the Cuban-American scholar María Isabel Alfonso.
One of those rights was freedom of assembly.
“Previously, Cubans had the ‘right to meet, demonstrate and associate, for licit and peaceful purposes,’” explained Alfonso, “but only as part of a so-called ‘organización de masa’ – the Cuban term for state-run groups.”
The new constitution removes the ‘organizaciones de masa’ restriction, theoretically giving people and civil society groups more freedom to gather.
But Alfonso cautioned that the government could still crack down on “independent organizations – especially if those groups are political in nature.”

In her Feburary 2019 article, she quotes the Cuban blogger José Gabriel Barrenechea saying that, in Cuba, “spontaneous gatherings are not seen positively and are always perceived to be the product of a foreign power.”
Among other changes, Cuba’s 2019 Constitution also gave constitutional legitimacy to Raúl Castro’s economic reforms and limited Cuban presidents to two five-year terms.

2020: Artists revolt
Cuba’s new Constitution reflects how Díaz-Canel has largely followed his mentor Raúl Castro’s path of gradually giving Cubans greater economic and social freedoms but resisting pressure for democratic reform.
One result of Castro’s 2009 move to legalize small businesses, for example, was a flourishing of activist art.
As galleries and theaters opened across Cuba, enabling artists to show their work in nongovernment-run cultural spaces, “ dissident artists took advantage of this newfound freedom to advance their political demands ,” says Alfonso.
In 2018, the Díaz-Canel government issued a decree imposing restrictions on independent artistic production and cultural venues, angering many artists. Then, in November 2020, the government raided the home of an artist who openly opposed the government’s decree.
Cuban artists and intellectuals rebelled. Days after the raid, about 300 of them convened via WhatsApp to stage a protest outside the Culture Ministry. They demanded negotiations with the government to restore freedom of expression.

“The negotiations would end soon after they began, followed by a major crackdown on dissent,” wrote Alfonso. But “the size, duration and public nature of the artists’ opposition were unprecedented.”
The artists’ uprising was, she says, “a sign of how resistance in Cuba has grown and changed.”

2021: The Castro era ends
Raúl Castro stepped down from his top post in the Communist Party in April 2021, leaving behind a changed Cuba.
It is no longer a Soviet-backed ideological challenger – or nuclear threat – to the United States. Bereft of international communist patrons and financially isolated from the world by the strict, decades-old U.S. embargo, Cuba is ailing.
For so long the bearded, fatigues-clad Fidel Castro defended the pain of the Cuban people as the righteous struggle of a proudly sovereign nation. Díaz-Canel, born in 1960, lacks Castro’s charismatic ability to invoke the faded revolutionary past.

Ever fewer Cubans even remember those heady post-revolution years, says the Cuba historian Joseph Gonzalez.
“Unlike their parents and grandparents, Cubans in their 20s, 30s and 40s never enjoyed a sustained, functional contract with the regime: We provide you a living, and in exchange you give us support, or at least acquiescence.”
Gonzalez says younger generations in Cuba still trust the government to provide free quality health care and education – both achievements of the Castro era.
“But they know it cannot feed, clothe and house its people in any but the most basic way,” he says.
Today Cubans have to hustle to survive; many work two jobs. A recent currency change means cash is scarce and many everyday goods are unaffordable. And after a year keeping the pandemic largely at bay, COVID-19 is surging on the island.
Recent protests suggest some Cubans are sick of so much struggle.

Thousands of Cubans took to the streets across the country on Sunday in an unusual protest in which civilians shouted slogans against the Communist government, such as “We want freedom” and “We are no longer afraid.”
The demonstrations came at a time when Cuba faces the worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, an increase in repression against political opponents and a strained health system during a critical stage of the pandemic. Health authorities reported almost 7,000 new cases and 47 deaths — a record for infections and deaths on the Caribbean island of just over 11 million people.
In Miami, hundreds of people gathered in the Little Havana neighborhood in solidarity with the growing protests in Cuba. “I know my family in Cuba is struggling, people are dying. It’s terrible,” Miami resident Christian Guzmán told NBC station WTVJ.
“Right now it’s hard. There’s no food, there’s no medicine. The Covid outbreak. The whole country is in the streets,” another Miami resident, Darío Suárez, said.

In Cuba, the protests began early Sunday afternoon in the municipality of San Antonio de los Baños, in the Artemisa province, adjacent to Havana. A few hours later they had spread to the east of the country, in provinces such as Santiago de Cuba.
The central Malecón of the capital, where in August 1994 Cubans staged a historic protest against then-leader Fidel Castro that was violently repressed, also saw hundreds of protesters gather on Sunday.
Cubans in several provinces contacted by Noticias Telemundo confirmed that the government, which controls the only internet provider company on the island, has caused service outages to prevent live broadcasts.
“They do not want the world to see what is happening in Cuba,” said a resident from Havana who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals from the regime.
President Miguel Díaz-Canel appeared on national television to call on the Army to confront the protesters: “The order to fight has been given,” he said.
In Cuba, videos broadcast on social networks, which could be verified by Noticias Telemundo, show special agents known in Cuba as Black Berets, being deployed in some localities and violently detaining civilians who protested and sang peacefully.
Díaz-Canel also called “all the revolutionaries in the country, all the communists, to take to the streets and go to the places where these provocations are going to take place.”
In recent days, Cuban exiles and high-profile personalities have joined the #SOSCuba campaign to demand that the island’s authorities open a humanitarian channel that allows the entry of medicines and supplies to treat the almost 240,000 patients with coronavirus.

The authorities have mocked the initiative on national television and described it as an attempt to discredit the government’s management of the health crisis, which has the island’s hospitals on the edge.
Cubans whose relatives have died from coronavirus in recent days have gone on social networks to talk about the seriousness of the health crisis, which currently has its epicenter in the province of Matanzas, known for Varadero, a popular beach resort town.

“My mother just died. We were in isolation for four days. Four days calling the SIUM (Integrated System of Medical Emergencies) to come and look for her. Four days and the SIUM did not arrive,” said  Magdiel Matos outside a hospital in Matanzas.
Opposition artists and independent journalists have said for weeks that the government has maintained police patrols outside their homes, while reports persist of patients who could not be transferred to hospitals on time due to lack of transportation and resources.
“Take these patrols to transport the sick, open the hotels to house them, facilitate the arrival of donated medicines and medical utensils,” poet and activist Katherine Bisquet said from Havana, pointing out a police car stationed in the basement of the  building.
Cuba did not join COVAX, the World Health Organization agency that seeks to disseminate Covid-19 vaccines in poorer countries, instead betting on the production of its own vaccines.
One of those five vaccine candidates, Abdala, received approval for emergency use this week. The government has stated that the vaccine, the first produced in Latin America, is 92.8 percent effective after three doses, but has not published data on clinical studies and it hasn't received the approval of any international health organization.
In Miami, with the largest community of Cuban exiles in the U.S., Cuban-born congresswoman María Elvira Salazar said, “We have not seen in recent years a popular uprising as big as this one.”
Mass protests are rare on the island and, when they do occur, they are quickly put down. Cuban politicians and the official press, the only one allowed by law in Cuba, often discredit dissidents by saying that they respond to the interests of the United States and that they receive funding for subversion.
The acting deputy secretary of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Julie Chung, defended the protests on Twitter, saying that peaceful protests were growing as people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express their concern over the increase in Covid-19 cases and deaths.
The coronavirus crisis, which caused the closure of airports and slowed tourism by more than 80 percent — Cuba’s second source of income after its medical missions — has exacerbated the shortage and fueled popular discontent.
The Cuban government attributes the economic crisis to U.S. embargo against Cuba and sanctions, which former President Donald Trump intensified. The Biden Administration has shown no signs of wanting to roll back sanctions, instead demanding that the government release political prisoners and respect dissenting voices.

Alright, so I've got these search results about recent protests in Cuba. Let me try to make sense of them.

First, from The Nation, there's an article about the latest round of protests in Cuba being a "bust—for now." It seems like there were planned protests that didn't really take off, but it gives some context about why people might be protesting. It mentions that material living conditions in Cuba have deteriorated a lot recently. Things like food, fuel, and electricity are in short supply, and there have been power cuts. The article blames this partly on US sanctions and the COVID pandemic.

It sounds like there's a lot of economic hardship on the island, and that's probably one of the main reasons for the protests. The government is having trouble providing basic necessities for its people, and that's causing a lot of frustration.

Another article from Fox News talks about protests happening in the US in solidarity with the Cuban protesters. It mentions that Cuban leaders are rallying supporters in Havana, which suggests that the government is trying to counter the protests. There's also a mention of Democrats not wanting to "go hard" on Cuba because some progressive members agree with Cuba's socialist policies. That's interesting—it seems like there's some division in the US about how to approach the situation in Cuba.

There's also a quote from Gloria Estefan, who's calling for international assistance for Cuba and suggesting that the US should get involved. So, there are celebrities and public figures weighing in on the issue.

The CBS News article provides more details about the protests themselves. It says that thousands of Cubans marched in Havana and other parts of the island, protesting food shortages and high prices in the context of the COVID crisis. There were clashes with police, arrests, and even some violence. The president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, condemned the protests and called on government supporters to take to the streets as well.

It's interesting that the US State Department is commenting on the situation, expressing support for the protesters' right to peaceful assembly. But there's also tension because the Cuban government sees US involvement as interference in their internal affairs.

Looking back at The Nation article, it seems like there's a complex interplay between US policy, the Cuban government, and the protesters. The article suggests that while the protesters are seeking more freedom and better living conditions, their actions could be exploited by hardliners in the US to maintain or even tighten sanctions, which could further harm the Cuban people.

Another article from The Conversation provides some historical context. It talks about the transition of power from the Castro brothers to Miguel Diaz-Canel and how he's continuing many of the same policies. It mentions that while there have been some economic reforms, there hasn't been much movement towards political openness or democracy.

The article also discusses a protest by artists in 2020, who were demanding more creative freedoms. It seems like there's a growing dissatisfaction among certain segments of Cuban society, particularly younger people who didn't live through the revolutionary period and may have different expectations.

Lastly, the NBC News article emphasizes the economic crisis in Cuba and how it's affecting people's daily lives. It mentions that Cubans are protesting over food shortages, medicine shortages, and the general economic misery. The article also touches on the government's handling of the COVID pandemic and how the health system is struggling.

It seems like the protests are rooted in a combination of economic hardships and a desire for more political freedoms. The Cuban government is portraying the protests as being instigated by external forces, particularly the US, which is a common tactic for authoritarian regimes to dismiss internal criticism.

From what I'm reading, it's clear that the US-Cuba relationship plays a significant role in this situation. The US has had a decades-long embargo on Cuba, which has undoubtedly contributed to the country's economic difficulties. The Trump administration tightened sanctions, which likely made things worse for the Cuban people.

Now, under the Biden administration, there doesn't seem to be a rush to lift these sanctions, despite the ongoing suffering in Cuba. This might be because the US is waiting to see how the Cuban government responds to the protests, or perhaps they believe that maintaining pressure is the best way to encourage political reform.

However, as The Nation article points out, this approach may not be in the best interest of the Cuban people, who are already suffering from food and medicine shortages. If anything, maintaining or tightening sanctions could make their situation worse.

Moreover, there's a risk that the US involvement could be counterproductive, as it might allow the Cuban government to portray the protesters as puppets of foreign powers, thereby undermining their legitimacy in the eyes of some Cubans.

It's a complicated situation. On one hand, people are rightfully protesting against a government that isn't providing for their basic needs. On the other hand, external interference, even with good intentions, could potentially exacerbate the problems.

I think the key takeaway is that the protests in Cuba are primarily driven by economic hardships and a desire for more political freedoms. The US plays a significant role in this dynamic, and its policies have real consequences for the Cuban people.

Given that, it might be beneficial for the US to reconsider its approach and explore ways to alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people while also promoting democratic reforms. Perhaps lifting some of the more punitive sanctions could help stabilize the economy and reduce the immediate pressures that are fueling the protests.

At the same time, it's important for the Cuban government to engage in meaningful dialogue with its citizens and address their grievances. Suppressing dissent and blaming external forces won't solve the underlying problems.

In conclusion, the protests in Cuba are a response to severe economic difficulties and a lack of political freedoms. The situation is further complicated by the longstanding US embargo and recent sanctions. A nuanced and empathetic approach from both the US and the Cuban government is needed to resolve the crisis and improve the lives of the Cuban people.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Cubans are protesting due to economic hardships, including food and medicine shortages, power outages, and poor living conditions, as well as a desire for political freedoms and reforms. The protests are influenced by US sanctions and the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for both the US and the Cuban government to address these issues through dialogue and policy adjustments.}} \]
