So I have this question about how implicit bias and microaggressions can cause emotional trauma to people from marginalized groups. I'm not super familiar with all the terms, but I've heard of them before. I think implicit bias is when someone has unconscious prejudices or stereotypes about certain groups, and microaggressions are like small, subtle actions or comments that might not seem like a big deal but can be hurtful. So, how do these things lead to emotional trauma?

First, I need to understand what emotional trauma is. I know that trauma can be caused by really distressing events, like accidents or abuse, and it can affect someone's mental health. But in this case, we're talking about something more subtle, maybe cumulative from many small incidents over time. So, perhaps for people from marginalized groups, facing implicit bias and microaggressions repeatedly can add up and cause emotional harm.

Let me try to break it down. Implicit bias is when people have attitudes or stereotypes about others without even realizing it. These biases can affect how they interact with people from certain groups. For example, if a teacher has an implicit bias against students from a particular background, they might unconsciously expect less from those students and treat them differently.

Microaggressions are those small slights or insults that might not be intended to harm, but still do. They can be verbal, like making assumptions about someone based on their race or gender, or nonverbal, like avoiding eye contact or sitting far away from someone because of their perceived group.

Now, how do these things cause emotional trauma? Well, for people who experience them, especially regularly, it can lead to a lot of stress and anxiety. Each microaggression might seem small, but over time, they can wear someone down. It's like drops of water eventually wearing away stone.

Imagine being in an environment where you constantly feel judged or misunderstood because of your background. That must take a toll on your self-esteem and sense of belonging. You might start to question yourself, wonder if you're being too sensitive, or feel like you have to walk on eggshells around certain people.

Moreover, when these biases are institutionalized, meaning they exist within systems and structures, it can make it even harder for marginalized groups to succeed or feel safe. For example, if a company has implicit biases against hiring certain types of people, those candidates might face repeated rejections not based on their qualifications but on unconscious prejudices.

I think another aspect is the invalidation of feelings. When someone experiences a microaggression, and the person who did it doesn't see it as a big deal or even denies that it happened, it can make the victim feel like their experiences don't matter. That can be really damaging to their mental health.

Also, there's the concept of minority stress, which refers to the chronic stress experienced by marginalized groups due to discrimination and social inequality. Implicit bias and microaggressions are part of that broader spectrum of stressors.

Perhaps it's similar to bullying in school, where constant small taunts and exclusion can lead to serious emotional issues for the targeted individual. In the case of implicit bias and microaggressions, it's often more insidious because it's not always overt or intentional.

I should probably look up some research on this to get a better understanding. Maybe there are studies that show the psychological impact of experiencing microaggressions over time.

Behavior does not entail solely explicitly insulting another individual in order to be classified as aggressive [1]. Microaggressions, as their name suggests, are subtle, small comments that could pass off as innocent, but they can make victims feel like they are being mistreated or excluded [2]. Different types of microaggressions, which includes microassault, microinsult, and microinvalidation, all convey negative messages to the receiver [3]. Microaggressions exist in all aspects of life, including the healthcare field where the relationship between a provider and patient can negatively affect the dynamic and lead to additional barriers for a patient to seek care [4]. Additionally, microaggressions may be common among college students, such as when an individual utilizes hurtful phrases, such as attributing the success of another student “to fill a quota” and “affirmative action” [2].
Different groups endure microaggression, and microaggressions have been referred to as “death by a thousand cuts” [5]. Individuals are often affected by a combination of different kinds of microaggressions based on gender, sexuality, race, and more. People of color and women were found to face microaggressions in different ways. For instance, black men endure comments viewing them as aggressive, while Latina women deal with comments viewing them as objects [6]. Furthermore, black women reported experiencing microaggressive comments that undermined their intelligence as well as negative experiences with institutional systems such as interactions with law enforcement [6]. A 2015 research study analyzing microaggressions in American Indian healthcare found a correlation between those who experienced microaggressions with worsening mental and physical health [4]. Moreover, Asian Americans also regularly deal with microaggression, including being praised for their English abilities even if they have lived in the United States all their lives [8]. Such microaggressions act as double-edged swords due to the veiled derogatory assumption of an individual.
Microaggressions negatively affect the individual’s mental, emotional, and physical health. Over time, these microaggressions create inner conflict and chronic stress; this only increases their risk for the onset of traumatic stress symptoms and depression [9]. One 2019 study suggested an association between African American women residing in the US who experienced and did not share their experiences to others with shorter telomeres, the ends of chromosomes that protect our DNA [7]. This data depicts the importance of support systems for those who experience microaggressions as those without proper support systems may feel increasingly more negative feelings and harbour potential changes within the protective ends of their DNA. Individuals who experienced microaggressions in another 2015 study report feeling tension, which leads to physical tightness and anxiousness, and digestive issues, which can lead to reflux disease and upper and lower GI conditions [10]. Overall, individuals who experience microaggressions increasingly mistrust others and hurt their own well-being [8]. People who regularly deal with microaggressions may also experience confusion, anger, anxiety, helplessness, hopelessness, frustration, paranoia, and fear, which lead to negative coping mechanisms, such as denial, withdrawal, and substance abuse [1].
Promisingly, there are different coping methods along with treatment options. Studies have reported that reflective coping and problem-solving activities are positively correlated with the well-being of individuals. Across 134 studies about discrimination and health outcomes, the scientists found that active problem solving was an effective coping method [11]. Coping strategies include problem solving, cognitive restructuring, expression of emotion, and social support seeking [11]. Recommended treatment involves the victim validating one’s own feelings against the microaggression [3].
As a society, it is imperative to recognize the negative impact on society that microaggressions cause. A potential means of reflecting and aiming to improve the issue of microaggressions in society is to implement changes, such as training programs for employees and students to learn about microaggressions and how to better support one another [5]. Additionally, hospital and health care workers must also be trained in order to create an environment of mutual respect between healthcare professionals and patients to better address the needs of their patients without causing mistrust.

Abstract
Aims
This review aims to understand the scope of the literature regarding mental health-related microaggressions towards people affected by mental health problems.
Methods
A scoping review was conducted to explore this question. Four electronic health-oriented databases were searched alongside Google Scholar. As per scoping review principles, the inclusion criteria were developed iteratively. The results of included studies were synthesised using a basic narrative synthesis approach, utilising principles of thematic analysis and thematic synthesis where appropriate.
Results
A total of 1196 records were identified, of which 17 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 12 were peer-reviewed journal articles, three were research degree theses and two were book chapters. Six included empirical studies were qualitative, four were quantitative and two employed a mixed-methods design. Within these, five qualitative studies aimed to describe the nature of mental health microaggressions experienced by people with mental health problems. Themes identified in a thematic synthesis of these five studies included stereotypes about mental illness, invalidating peoples' experience and blaming people with mental illness for their condition. The included publications informed on the perpetration of mental health microaggressions by family, friends, health professionals and social workers. In addition, two studies created scales, which were then used in cross-sectional surveys of the general public and community members to assess characteristics, such as right-wing political views, associated with endorsement of mental health microaggressions. A consensus definition of microaggressions emerged from the included studies: microaggressions are brief, everyday slights, snubs or insults, that may be subtle or ambiguous, but communicate a negative message to a target person based on their membership of a marginalised group, in this case, people affected by mental illness.
Conclusions
The study of mental health microaggressions is an emerging, heterogeneous field, embedded in the wider stigma and discrimination literature. It has been influenced by earlier work on racial microaggressions. Both can be ambiguous and contradictory, which creates difficulty defining the boundaries of the concept, but also underpins the key theoretical basis for the negative impact of microaggressions. Mental illness is a more concealable potential type of identity, so it follows that the reported perpetrators of microaggressions are largely friends, family and professionals. This has implications for intervening to reduce the impact of microaggressions. There are several challenges facing research in this area, and further work is needed to understand the impact of mental health microaggressions on people affected by mental health problems.

Introduction
The term ‘microaggression’ was coined in 1970 to describe subtle dismissals and insults towards Black Americans (Pierce, 1970 ). The word remained largely in obscurity until the late 2000s, when a paper exploring ‘subtle and contemporary’ forms of racism in the context of therapy gained widespread public attention (Sue et al ., 2007 ). Based on the analysis of personal narratives and the social and counselling psychology literature, Sue et al. defined microaggressions as ‘brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults towards people of color’ (Sue et al ., 2007, p. 271). They describe three distinct forms of microaggressions: microassault, microinsult and microinvalidation. A microassault is the most overt form, for example, intentionally calling a person of colour a derogatory term. Microinsults are more subtle and convey rudeness or insensitivity, for example, clutching one's purse more tightly when in the presence of a person of colour. Finally, microinvalidations negate or nullify the feelings or experiences of a person, by saying, for example, ‘Don't be so oversensitive’ (Sue et al ., 2007, p. 275).
The concept of subtle, contemporary forms of racism has captured the attention of wide audiences, not least because these researchers argue that microaggressions have a powerful, negative cumulative effect on the mental health of people of colour (Sue et al ., 2007; Sue, 2010 ). The theoretical basis of this assertion is grounded in ‘minority stress theory’ (Meyer, 1995) which states that a hostile social environment demands heightened vigilance to protect oneself from discrimination and violence. It is also argued that the subtle nature of microaggressions creates a ‘catch-22’ (or ‘no win’) situation, in which an individual is left questioning the validity of his or her experience (‘Did what I think happened, really happen?’). This concept has been described as attributional ambiguity in the wider stigma literature and is argued to pose a particular threat to self-esteem and lead to suspicion and mistrust (Crocker et al ., 1998 ).
Numerous studies have reported a significant correlation between reported experiences of microaggressions and self-reported negative mental health outcomes (e.g. Nadal et al ., 2014; Gattis and Larson, 2017; Reid, 2017 ). Whilst most studies have been cross-sectional, a study using a longitudinal design has shown that microaggressions in the form of ‘underestimation of personal ability’ significantly predicted self-rated depression symptoms 1 year later – providing some indication of potential causation (Torres et al ., 2010 ).
Research on microaggression is not without its critics. Some argue that a microaggression is an open concept with ‘fuzzy’ boundaries, full of contradictions and ambiguities – for example, both ignoring and attending to minority students in classrooms have been listed as microaggressions (Lilienfeld, 2017 ). It is apparent that microaggressions are ambiguous and ‘lie in the eye of the beholder’, and so, variations in responses by targets of microaggressions may be a function of an individual's personality dispositions, a key confounder when asserting a causal association between microaggressions and adverse mental health outcomes (Lilienfeld, 2017 ). Indeed, once accounting for scores of ‘perceived stress’ (feeling life is unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloaded), Torres et al. found that the predictive effect of microaggressions on depression symptoms was non-significant (Torres et al ., 2010 ).
Nevertheless, the use of the term ‘microaggression’ is expanding. It is now used to describe snubs, slights and insults towards members of other marginalised social groups including women, sexual minorities and people with disabilities (Sue, 2010 ). There is a growing literature on the experience of people affected by mental health problems, arguably a marginalised social group in its own right. This emerging field can be seen to fit into the wider literature on stigma towards mental illness – a broad concept that encompasses ignorance, prejudice and discrimination (Thornicroft, 2006 ).
The purpose of this scoping review was to answer the following research question: ‘What is the scope of the literature regarding mental health-related microaggressions towards people affected by mental health problems?’. We aimed to characterise the literature in this area (e.g. who is conducting this research, and from what discipline?), elucidate the purpose of research on this topic for this population (e.g. to describe the experiences of people with mental health problems or to measure the effect) and describe and synthesise the current evidence base. In doing so, we planned to clarify the definition of the term microaggression as it is used in relation to people with mental health problems. In addition, we aimed to identify the problematic areas of this research topic (e.g. varying definitions, the distinction between a microaggression and other forms of subtle discrimination) and propose the next steps for researchers in this field.
Methods
A scoping review approach was used to answer the research question. Like a systematic review, a scoping review is informed by an a priori protocol, involves systematic and exhaustive searching, must be transparent and reproducible, includes steps to reduce error and increase reliability, and presents data in a structured way (Munn et al ., 2018 ). However, in contrast to the systematic review method which is guided by a highly focussed research question, the scoping review method is guided by a requirement to identify all relevant literature, and as such it allows for procedural flexibility during the conduct of the review to achieve this aim (Arksey and O'Malley, 2005 ). A scoping review methodology was therefore considered highly appropriate for our research aim to characterise and synthesise the current literature. We followed the procedure outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and further developed by Levac et al. (2010 ).
This review complies with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement (Moher et al ., 2009 ). It follows an a priori developed review protocol, registered at the Open Science Framework platform (Barber et al ., 2019 ).
Identifying the review question and aims
The research question was formulated through consideration of the concept and target population, using aspects of the SPIDER question format tool (i.e. examining Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, and Research type) (Cooke et al ., 2012 ). For this review, we specified only the ‘sample’ and ‘phenomenon of interest’ aspects, to fulfil the aim of characterising the literature in this area.
In line with the iterative, flexible nature of the scoping review process (Levac et al ., 2010 ), the ‘sample’ was revised during the study selection process. Initially defined as ‘people with mental health problems’, this was refined to ‘people whose defining characteristic, in the study, is being affected by a mental health problem or disability’.
The ‘phenomenon of interest’ was mental health-related microaggressions specifically. This was specified as microaggressions attributed to a mental health problem or mental health-related disability. We did not include papers which addressed racial or other microaggressions directed towards people with mental health problems. Unless otherwise stated, the term microaggression in this manuscript refers to this narrow definition.
Identifying relevant studies
The search strategy was designed to identify formally published, peer-reviewed articles and selected grey literature, including research degree theses and book chapters but not ‘grey data’ (e.g. websites, tweets and blog posts). Four electronic health-oriented databases were searched in July 2019: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and WorldCat Dissertation database. We also searched Google Scholar, identified as a powerful addition to traditional search methods (Haddaway et al ., 2015 ). The first 300 results of a search on ‘Incognito mode’ (used to improve replicability) were screened.
The search strategies consisted of keywords and subject headings related to ‘mental health’ and ‘microaggressions’. For Google Scholar the following search strategy was used: ‘(Mental* or Psych*) AND microaggress*’. Appendix 1 gives full search strategies for each database.
We supplemented the database and search engine searches by conducting backwards and forwards citation checking and contacting authors and experts in the field.
Study selection
Study selection followed a two-step approach: (1) title, abstract, key word screening, (2) full-text screening. In both stages, SB and SA independently screened a proportion of results (25 and 40%, respectively), with PCG acting as an arbitrator. Interrator reliability was calculated and exceeded 80%. SB screened the remainder of the results. In line with scoping review principles, inclusion criteria were developed iteratively through discussion between authors.
Data extraction and management
Data from the included full texts were extracted onto a ‘Characteristics of Included Studies’ table, including country, department/institution (lead author), publication type, study design, population of interest (sample size) and purpose (e.g. to describe the experience of microaggressions, or to validate a scale).
Qualitative synthesis and analysis
The results of included studies were synthesised using a basic narrative synthesis approach, applying principles of thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006) and thematic synthesis (Thomas and Harden, 2008) where appropriate, given the available data and how it could best be examined to answer the review questions.
Quality of included studies assessment
We used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) (Hong et al ., 2018) to assess the quality of included empirical studies. This tool is designed for quality assessment in systematic reviews that include quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method studies. Articles were assigned one point for each criterion that was fulfilled, and half a point for each partially met the criterion. These points were summed to produce an index based on the proportion of total criteria met. No studies were excluded from the synthesis due to low-quality score.
Results
In total, 1196 records were identified: 889 records from database searching, and 307 through other sources (300 from Google Scholar, five through communication with authors, two through consultation with experts). After duplicates were removed, 1000 records remained for title, abstract and key word screening. In total, 959 records were excluded at this stage, leaving 41 records for full-text assessment for eligibility, of which 17 met inclusion criteria for this review. This study selection procedure is illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram (see Fig. 1 ).

Characterising the literature
The characteristics of included studies are summarised in Table 1 .
Table 1. Characteristics of included studies
All papers and chapters were published in the last decade (16 in the last 4 years), 15 are from the USA (five from authors associated with the City University of New York) and most papers originated from departments of Psychology (n =  8), followed by Social Work (n =  3).
Six included empirical studies were qualitative in nature, using focus group (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a; Peters et al ., 2016 ), one-to-one semi-structured interviews (Holley et al ., 2016 a; McCue, 2016; Harper et al ., 2017) and analysis of free-text survey questions (Charles et al ., 2017 ). Four were cross-sectional surveys (Zurick, 2016; DeLuca et al ., 2017; DeLuca et al ., 2018; Gonzales et al ., 2018 ), with sample sizes from 222 to 951 participants. Four of these studies employed convenience sampling of the US public using online survey platforms. Two studies adopted a mixed-methods design (Holley et al ., 2016 b; Zenga, 2018 ). Two included publications aimed to validate a scale (Gonzales et al ., 2015 b; Ezell et al ., 2018 ). The remaining three papers and chapters (Borg et al ., 2009; Yanos, 2017; Holley and Thomas, 2018) were not research studies, but still met inclusion criteria and offered an insight into the scope of the literature.
Characterising the purpose of research on this topic for this population
Five studies aimed to elucidate the nature of mental health microaggressions from the perspective of people affected by mental health problems (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a; Holley et al ., 2016 a; McCue, 2016; Peters et al ., 2016; Zenga, 2018 ). In three, the participants had intersecting identities as racial and/or sexual orientation minority group members (Holley et al ., 2016 a ), law students (McCue, 2016) and peer support specialists (Zenga, 2018 ). We synthesised the experiences of microaggressions described in these studies (see Table 2 ).
Table 2. A thematic synthesis of experiences described as mental health microaggressions
These five papers also provide data on the perpetrators of mental health microaggressions, which included family, friends and health professionals. For example, a participant in Gonzales et al. (2015 a) stated: ‘People in my family, if I actually starting being happy they're like, “Are you sure you're okay?”’ (p. 237). Similarly, Peters et al. (2016) provided an example of friends misusing terminology ‘I even have friends that say it… they're just like, “But oh man they were so bipolar”’ (p. 100). Additionally, a participant in McCue (2016) described an experience where a fellow student said ‘that he has depression’ and that ‘he could go out and get that extra time but he has dignity’ (p. 85), consistent with perpetration of a microaggression by a peer (by shaming mental illness). One further paper aimed to describe mental health microaggressions from the perspective of potential perpetrators (Charles et al ., 2017 ). They demonstrated that social work educators report personal reactions that reflect microaggressions.
Two papers aimed to create scales, one measuring the experience of microaggressions (Ezell et al ., 2018) and one measuring endorsement of microaggressions by possible perpetrators (Gonzales et al ., 2015 b ). The latter was used in three studies aiming to identify individual characteristics associated with endorsement of mental health microaggressions by the general public. Broadly, endorsement of microaggressions was positively associated with right-wing political views (DeLuca et al ., 2018 ), suburban values and socio-economic disadvantage (Gonzales et al ., 2018 ), authoritarianism (the attitude that people with serious mental illness cannot care for themselves and require coercion) and social restrictiveness (the belief that people with mental illness should be feared and excluded) (Zurick, 2016 ). Endorsement was negatively associated with benevolence (the belief that people with mental illness are innocent and naïve) (Zurick, 2016 ).
Two studies considered the impact of microaggressions. One qualitative study described a ‘negative outcome’ theme that included frustration, loss of self-esteem and alienation (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a ). One quantitative study assessed the impact of endorsing microaggressions on preferences for mental health funding allocation by the general public and found a weak but significant negative correlation (DeLuca et al ., 2017 ).
Defining the term microaggression as it is used in relation to people with mental health problems
We found that the majority (11/17) of papers directly or indirectly referenced a definition of microaggressions from the work of Sue et al. (e.g. Sue, 2010; Sue et al ., 2007 ), and eight listed the three types of microaggression described by Sue et al .: microassaults, microinsults and microinvalidations. Ezell et al. (2018) referenced Pierce et al. (1977) and described a ‘nexus of recurrent, daily indignities, both overt and non-overt, that are directed at historically marginalised populations… which insult, degrade or otherwise demoralize their recipients’ (p. 28). Borg et al. (2009) describe ‘the things you experience every day that then add up and take their toll’ (p. 290). Three papers provided no reference but emphasised the ‘everyday’ (Harper et al ., 2017) or ‘subtle’ (DeLuca et al ., 2017; DeLuca et al ., 2018) nature of microaggressions. There is an apparent consensus across all included studies that microaggressions are brief, everyday slights, snubs or insults, which may be subtle or ambiguous, but communicate a negative message to a target person based on their membership of a marginalised group, in this case, people with experience of mental illness.
Quality of included studies
The 12 empirical studies included in the review were assessed using the MMAT tool. Index scores are presented in Table 1. All of the qualitative studies (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a; Holley et al ., 2016 a; McCue, 2016; Peters et al ., 2016; Charles et al ., 2017; Harper et al ., 2017) used an appropriate approach (interpretive or critical) and methods of data collection and analysis were well described and adequate. Overall, conclusions were well substantiated by data and the author's arguments were coherent. Of note, Charles et al. (2017) included a clear discussion of neutral and ambiguous findings. In general, there was an absence of reflexivity (with McCue (2016) a notable exception) or respondent validation. Three of the cross-sectional surveys used online convenience methods to sample US residents (Zurick, 2016; DeLuca et al ., 2017, 2018 ). In one study, the recruitment system stratified based on demographic attributes resulting in gender balance and equal numbers of four age groups and regions (DeLuca et al ., 2018 ). The other two were biased, for example, towards females. Zurick (2016) found that 36.9% of their sample reported they had a mental illness, a limitation to the study of general attitudes. All three of these surveys used validated measures and appropriate statistical techniques. One cross-sectional study used an unvalidated perceived microaggression scale (Gonzales et al ., 2018 ). Two studies employed mixed methods (Zenga, 2018; Holley et al ., 2016 b ), both using quantitative measures to triangulate the qualitative analyses. In both cases, there were weaknesses in the interpretation and integration of the quantitative findings, due to small sample size, reducing the quality of the study.
Discussion
The results of this scoping review have demonstrated an emerging field that is highly heterogenous methodologically. Largely in the last five years, researchers have described mental health-related microaggressions, operationalised them into scales, examined the characteristics associated with perpetration and begun to study the impact. By synthesising the results of four good quality qualitative studies and one mixed-method study, we provide an overview of the experiences people with mental illness have described as microaggressions in the literature to date.
The influence of Sue et al. from the racial microaggression field is evident; the majority of studies directly cite their definition and some authors framed their results in terms of microassualts, microinsults and microinvalidations (Peters et al ., 2016; McCue, 2016; Holley et al ., 2016a; Zenga, 2018 ). There are similarities between racial and mental health microaggressions, such as the assumption of inferiority or dangerousness (Sue et al ., 2007) and the notion of questioning the validity of the perceived microaggressions. For example, one focus group participant felt a false sense of support when she won an award (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a ). This is an example of attributional ambiguity, arguably a threat to self-esteem by making it difficult to assess one's abilities (Crocker et al ., 1998 ).
However, the mental health literature has key differences to the wider microaggression work. The ‘perpetrators’ of microaggressions towards people with mental illness are largely family and friends and health professionals, rather than strangers or acquaintances. This follows from mental illness being an arguably more concealable potential identity compared to race, but this has particular implications for intervening to reduce mental health microaggressions. In addition, certain experiences are unique to mental illness, such as symptomizing – where ‘emotions and behaviours considered “normal” for people without mental illness are assumed to be a symptom of their mental illness’ (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a, p. 236).
Criticism of the wider microaggression literature has focused on boundaries of the concept, the ambiguous and contradictory nature of microaggressions and role of unexplored confounders such as personality traits (Lilienfeld, 2017 ). These challenges and problems are evident in the mental health literature too. Firstly, in synthesising the experiences described as microaggressions by people affected by mental health problems, we found examples that do not fit with the apparent consensus definition of microaggressions as brief, everyday forms of discrimination. For example, ‘I was arrested, I spent 8 months of my life in a cage for something I did not do’ (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a, p. 237). If this incarceration had anything to do with stigma or discrimination, it might be more helpfully considered an example of structural discrimination within the legal system than a microaggression. Similarly, ‘shortly before going back to work, they informed her that someone with more experience was hired’ (Zenga, 2018, p. 59) is not consistent with a subtle slight, snub or insult.
Defining what is, and what is not, a microaggression will be critical to distinguishing microaggressions from other described forms of discrimination. Currently, authors appear to be at odds as to whether the microaggression concept is new and ‘scarcely… studied or discussed’ (Gonzales et al ., 2015 a, p. 234), or an extension or rebranding of previously described forms of covert discrimination or forms of oppression (e.g. Holley et al ., 2016 a ). In his book chapter, Yanos (2017) explores the relationship between microaggressions and other forms of stigmatising behaviour. To distinguish a microaggression from a ‘social rejection’ experience, Yanos describes ‘the difference between situations in which others avoid initiating a relationship with someone and situations in which others actively end a relationship’ (p. 46). He places microaggressions on a spectrum of stigmatising behaviour, at ‘the lowest level of severity’ (p. 41).
Several papers discuss the changing, contradictory and ambiguous nature of microaggressions. For example, Charles et al. (2017) reflect that ‘the nature of language and what is not recognised as a microaggression is always in flux’ (p. 420) and that ‘reaching out’ to students who disclose their mental illness could be seen as either supportive or a microaggression. ‘Symptomizing’ also presents a ‘catch-22’ situation to friends, family members and health professionals. Sleep disturbances are well recognised to be manic prodromes (Sierra et al ., 2007 ), and a psychoeducational family intervention (including early warning signs) has been shown to improve the level of disability of patients with bipolar disorder (Fiorillo et al ., 2015 ). Yet, one participant in Gonzales et al. (2015 a) gives the following example of a microaggression: ‘…if I do a lot of activities or stay up late I'll have people call me up and say “Maybe you're manic, you stayed up really late…”’ (p. 237).
The authors of a number of the included studies suggest strategies to reduce perpetration of microaggressions and their impact. They focus on health professionals (Borg et al ., 2009; Peters et al ., 2016; Charles et al ., 2017 ), institutions (Holley et al ., 2016 a; McCue, 2016) and the general public (DeLuca et al ., 2017; DeLuca et al ., 2018 ), and consider training and awareness campaigns. However, given the evidence that family and friends often perpetrate microaggressions, it may be useful to target interventions to closer acquaintances, for example, in family therapy. Another paper included in this study highlighted resilience as a key theme in the experience of microaggressions by peer support specialists (Zenga, 2018 ). Having gained confidence through recovery, one participant explained ‘she has developed empathy and compassion because she believes that they are “trying to be supportive”’ (p. 62). Given the changing, ambiguous nature of microaggressions, supporting people with mental health problems to cope with these slights, snubs and insults may be critical to reducing the impact of microaggressions. This could be done, for example, by focusing on strategies that improve self-esteem.
Limitations
There are several limitations to this scoping review. Firstly, our search strategy extended to grey literature but not grey data, which may have contained important perspectives. Secondly, we identified several studies in the screening stages that we were unable to access, despite attempts to contact the authors, which may represent a loss of valuable data.
We adopted a narrow focus for this scoping review for reasons of feasibility, including only papers that referenced mental health-related microaggressions explicitly. Widening the search to include terms such as subtle and covert discrimination might have enabled us to comment on distinguishing features (if they exist) of microaggressions in particular.
Conclusions
This scoping review has revealed a highly heterogenous body of work relating to microaggressions towards people with mental illness. The research has been heavily influenced by the work of Sue et al. in the wider microaggression literature. However, it is also embedded in the broader field of discrimination towards people with mental illness, with apparent similarities to previously described forms of subtle discrimination such as social rejection.
We have identified many challenges in this field of research, not least issues with the definition and boundaries of the concept: what is, and what is not, a microaggression needs to be clear and distinct to other forms of discriminatory behaviour. Also, some authors have asserted that the experience of microaggressions has a negative impact on people with mental illness, with little empirical evidence. Further work, including a careful examination of potential confounding personality traits, is required (as has been done in the wider mental health stigma literature, see Schibalski et al. (2017 )). Indeed, placing the experience of microaggressions at the ‘lowest level of severity’ (Yanos, 2017, p. 41) of stigmatising experiences may be premature. Daily exposure to subtle forms of discrimination may, paradoxically, have a greater cumulative negative effect than other forms of blatant, unambiguous discrimination (Crocker et al ., 1998 ).

Microaggression examples
Microaggressions as humor
Credibility of microaggressions
Why not call it ‘criticism’?
How to fix it?
How to respond to microaggressions?
Does sensitivity come with microaggression?
Microaggression meaning revolves around the mixture of all the daily social, verbal, and environmental humiliations. This processes in two manners: intentional and unintentional. At the same time, most people think it’s just a fancy name given to people who are overly sensitive.
Although it’s not!
The website, diversity.nih.gov, explains microaggression definition as:
Microaggressions are everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults– whether intentional or unintentional– that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to individuals based solely upon their marginalized group membership.
Microaggressions and Traumatic Stress cannot be separated. It is challenging to come across as unsolicited comments and actions every now and then.
Do you support microaggression?
The main worry that might be eating at you right now is, ‘ Am I also supporting microaggression?’
Well, yes. In the act of thinking for ourselves as unbiased, decent, and moral human beings, we choose to overlook and deny honesty. Not that this is an inherent trait. It is something that we acquire from the environment while we grow up.
We see how okay it is to pass on reckless comments and in the same run, we ourselves ignore that the same behavior messes our mentality too. This leads to an unintentional oppressive attitude towards nearly every next person.
Microaggression examples
There are many forms of microaggressions. Some of the examples of microaggression are:
“I can understand the problems of being a part of the minority group.”
“As a woman, it must be hard to fight for your minority group.”
“You belong to <insert place/ country>. Isn’t life hard for your community there?”
Microaggressions can simply be called ‘bad etiquette’. The video below shares examples of racial and ageist microaggressions in the workplace. Take a look to understand better:
Examples of Workplace Microaggressions
Watch on
Microaggressions as humor
How many times have you gulped in a statement just because it was embarrassing or mocking? How many times did you not confuse between humor, microaggressions, and mockery?
The ideology of humor for a microaggressive person revolves around whatever makes someone laugh.
It doesn’t target any specific group of people. It mostly targets a race, a person’s weakness, and, most importantly, their personality traits. This not only proves to be humiliating but because it is mistaken for humor, also leaves a person in self-doubt.
Credibility of microaggressions
It doesn’t hold any scientific support, nor does it feed benefit to the other. T he term was brought to life by Psychiatrist Chester M. Pierce from Harvard in 1970. In the 21st century, the term started to get its full recognition.
It was, therefore, used to explain any act of degradation that is based on pure biased opinions.
But, it will surely give you a tough time explaining it to someone who is determined to negate it.
Why not call it ‘criticism’?
The question has a point. The only difference arises in these manners;
Criticism can be positive or negative but always intentional. You will never see a critique unintentionally criticizing something. Microaggressions can be unintentional too.
In a group of friends, it’s somewhat okay to be open to each other about the insecurities you hold. However, you need to make sure it doesn’t cross a certain limit or you sharing your problems should not be considered as your weakness.
Despite that, some friends choose to degrade you on the basis of it, rather humorously, but the damage is done anyway.
How to fix it?
The effects of microaggressions on relationships can be negative. You may feel a sense of hurt and remorse.
The real challenge arises in responding to the degrading statements.
Subtle prejudgment and insentient prejudice are real and substantial. People who claim it to be a self-created terminology will mostly be harboring damaged personalities and discriminating points of view.
The term is purely elastic and can be used on higher platforms to create awareness. Not only this, but the vast concept should be taught in the educational institutes to gain a healthy outcome.
How to respond to microaggressions?
One of the prior steps of responding to microaggression is to understand what it means. That means, you must know the act, or speech is a form of microaggression and not something casual. You must be sure of that to avoid a negative reaction.
Next, understand the consequences of your reaction.
Will you be in danger? Will you be frowned upon? Is it going to affect your relationship with the other party or the group of people?
You must keep in mind what the impact of your reaction be.
Once you do, you can share your feelings if you can expect a positive outcome, response, or understanding.
Does sensitivity come with microaggression?
Everything on this planet slowly and gradually either adapts to any physical or emotional insult or gets deformed. The same is the case with sensitivity. Sensitivity is not a choice; neither is it non-inherent. It can be acquired by parents or can be a result of repeated insult.
However, from a broader perspective, it is true that sensitivity comes with microaggressions as well. What’s not right is that microaggressions create sensitivity in people.
Therefore, instead of being a root cause of damaging a human, it’s a humble option to choose otherwise.
Final takeaway
What can be the impact of microaggressions?
Microaggressions can be mistaken or even ignored on a daily basis. The whole concept of ignoring anything that wrecks a personality is vague. So is the act of doing so.
However, most of the time, some people choose to escape their insecurities through microaggressions. Don’t be a source of degradation to someone in reply to their microaggressive attitude.
Lastly, anything that throws anyone in the dungeon of misery is wrong on so many levels. In the search for perfection, don’t forget to climb onto the stair of humbleness and gratitude.

Microaggressions: What They Are, And How They Are Associated With Adjustment Outcomes
APA Journals Article Spotlight ®

Microaggressions: What They Are, And How They Are Associated With Adjustment Outcomes
Microaggression events refer to everyday derogations, slights, and invalidations that are often delivered to people of minority or marginalized backgrounds.
Examples are complimenting a racial minority college student as surprisingly intelligent or well-spoken ("you speak really good English for an Asian"), or referring to negative events, behaviors, or traits as "that's so gay."
The term "microaggression" was first introduced by Chester Pierce and redefined by Derald Sue and colleagues. Before colleges and workplace settings implement diversity training and before "microinterventions" are recommended in day-to-day interactions to combat microaggression, there exists a great deal of discourse in public and academic arenas around this term.
Popular media has referenced a war on microaggressions. Critiques of this body of research question the empirical reality of microaggression, particularly microaggression's conceptual clarity, differentiation from other forms of discrimination, confounding impact of individual differences in emotionality, and empirical support for its causal association with mental and physical health outcomes.
To examine the associations between adjustment outcomes and microaggressions targeting different social identities, Priscilla Lui and Lucia Quezada systematically surveyed published and unpublished data and conducted a meta-analysis and narrative review on this research literature to date.
They addressed three questions:
What are the associations linking microaggressions and adjustment outcomes?
What factors explain heterogeneous findings across existing studies?
What is the current state of this empirical literature, and what are critical research gaps to consider in future investigations?
In their article, "Associations Between Microaggression and Adjustment Outcomes: A Meta-Analytic and Narrative Review" published in Psychological Bulletin, Lui and Quezada searched and located 72 independent samples containing quantitative data about the associations between microaggression and adjustment outcomes.
These studies included approximately 19,000 participants recruited from the U.S. and other countries. Most of the studies examined microaggression incidents as a function of racial stereotypes and biases. Other studies focused on sexual orientation and gender identity biases, health status and disability, gender stereotypes, and a combination of marginalized identities.
The authors presented a new "cube" model that can guide researchers and professionals to conceptualize different dimensions and facets of microaggression.
Results showed that individuals with microaggression experiences were more likely to report negative adjustment outcomes. More nuanced analyses revealed that microaggression experiences were relatively more closely linked to internalizing problems (such as depression and anxiety), stress and negative affect, and positive adjustment and positive affect, than externalizing problems and health-harming behaviors (such as alcohol and substance misuse) and physical symptoms.
These findings are especially true for racial, LGBTQ, and health status microaggressions. There was little evidence indicating that gender microaggression was associated with adjustment outcomes, but this preliminary conclusion was based on only one unpublished study.
In terms of the conceptual meaning and measurement of microaggression, the authors noted that existing self-report survey questionnaires vary in psychometric properties. It remains questionable whether "microassault" — explicit attacks on marginalized individuals and communities — should be considered a form of microaggression.
Lui and Quezada also conducted subsequent quantitative and qualitative reviews of these studies.
They found that the existing literature presented mixed findings as to whether microaggressions were associated with adjustment outcomes above and beyond the influences of overt discrimination.
They also indicated that not many studies considered individual difference factors such as vulnerability and reactivity to stress.
Furthermore, the authors called for more systematic investigations that differentiate the possible impact of various types of discrimination and pathways that relate to mental and physical health outcomes.
Overall, the study by Lui and Quezada showed empirical support for associations between racial, LGBTQ, and health status microaggressions and adjustment outcomes. These associations varied by individuals' demographic backgrounds and study characteristics.
The study provides an authoritative summary of the state of the science on microaggression and presents a model to conceptualize how various aspects of microaggression may be linked to adjustment outcomes among individuals.
Findings reveal gaps for future research to further enhance the empirical validity of the microaggression research program. With more robust studies to come, the field may be better able to determine how and in what contexts to address microaggression-related issues in applied settings.

Abstract
The current chapter will focus specifically on women's experiences of microaggressions and the impact of such experiences on their mental health. First, a review of the literature will examine the various types of microaggressions that women experience as well as the other types of sexism that they may encounter in their everyday lives. Next, we will discuss how gender microaggressions and sexism may negatively impact women's mental health, self-esteem, and identity development. Finally, we will examine how other microaggressions impact women with intersectional identities (particularly women of color and lesbian and bisexual women).

Alright, so I've got this information from the search results. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, there's a blog post from marriage.com that talks about microaggressions and their impact on people. It seems like it's trying to raise awareness about what microaggressions are and how they can be harmful. The author mentions that microaggressions are everyday slights and insults that can be intentional or unintentional, and they can really affect people's mental health. The post also touches on how sometimes these microaggressions are passed off as humor, which can make it harder for people to address them.

Then, there's a scholarly article from the American Psychological Association (APA) called "Microaggressions: What They Are, And How They Are Associated With Adjustment Outcomes." This seems more academic and probably has some research backing it up. The authors, Priscilla Lui and Lucia Quezada, did a meta-analysis of various studies looking at how microaggressions relate to mental health outcomes. They found that microaggressions are linked to things like depression, anxiety, and stress. Interesting.

Another article is from Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences, titled "Microaggressions towards people affected by mental health problems: a scoping review." This review looks specifically at microaggressions experienced by people with mental health issues. It seems like microaggressions can exacerbate their conditions or make it harder for them to seek help. The review mentions that family, friends, and healthcare providers can be perpetrators of these microaggressions, which is really concerning.

There's also a chapter from a book called "Women and mental disorders," where the authors discuss the effects of sexism, gender microaggressions, and other forms of discrimination on women's mental health and development. It sounds like it delves into how these microaggressions can impact women's self-esteem and identity.

From these sources, I can see that microaggressions are a significant issue across different groups, especially for marginalized populations like people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with mental health problems. The APA article mentions that microaggressions are particularly harmful to racial, LGBTQ, and health-status minorities.

Now, to answer the question: "How can implicit bias and microaggressions cause emotional trauma to people from marginalized groups?"

First, I need to understand what implicit bias is. Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. These biases can influence how people perceive and interact with others from different groups.

Microaggressions, as I've learned from the search results, are the manifestations of these implicit biases. They are subtle, often unintentional, comments or actions that convey derogatory or harmful messages to marginalized individuals.

So, when someone from a marginalized group repeatedly experiences microaggressions, it can lead to chronic stress and emotional trauma. Here's how:

1. **Constant Stress:** Every time a person faces a microaggression, it triggers a stress response. Over time, this chronic stress can have cumulative effects on mental health, leading to conditions like anxiety and depression.

2. **Questioning Self-Worth:** Microaggressions often invalidate a person's experiences or belittle their accomplishments. This can make the individual doubt their own abilities and worth, damaging their self-esteem.

3. **Feeling Unseen or Misunderstood:** When microaggressions are normalized, it can make marginalized individuals feel like their identities are not recognized or valued. This lack of validation can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

4. **Triggering Past Traumas:** For some, microaggressions can serve as reminders of past traumas or systemic injustices, reawakening old wounds and causing emotional pain.

5. **Creating a Hostile Environment:** In institutions like schools or workplaces, microaggressions can create a hostile environment that makes it difficult for marginalized individuals to thrive. This can affect their performance and overall well-being.

6. **Internalizing Bias:** Repeated exposure to microaggressions can lead individuals to internalize the negative stereotypes imposed on them, further harming their mental health.

The APA article mentions that microaggressions are more closely linked to internalizing problems like depression and anxiety, as well as stress and negative affect. This aligns with the idea that these small, frequent insults can wear down a person's emotional resilience over time.

Moreover, the scoping review on microaggressions towards people with mental health problems highlights that even caregivers and loved ones can perpetrate microaggressions, which can be particularly damaging because trust is involved. For example, a family member might make insensitive remarks about a person's mental health condition, which can erode trust and make the individual reluctant to seek support.

The chapter on women and mental disorders emphasizes how gender microaggressions can impact women's mental health and development. Women, especially those from intersectional backgrounds, face compounded forms of discrimination that can have severe emotional consequences.

In conclusion, implicit bias leads to microaggressions, which in turn can cause significant emotional trauma to people from marginalized groups through chronic stress, self-doubt, invalidation, and the creation of hostile environments. It's crucial for society to recognize and address these issues to promote mental well-being for all.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Implicit bias leads to microaggressions, which cause emotional trauma in marginalized groups through chronic stress, self-doubt, invalidation, and hostile environments.}} \]
