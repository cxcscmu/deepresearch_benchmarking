So I've got this question: "What are the factors that create these differences in perceptions from person to person?" It's about understanding why people see things differently. I think this is related to psychology and how individual experiences shape our views. But I'm not entirely sure, so I should probably look into it more deeply.

First off, I know that perception is how we interpret the world around us. It's not just about what's out there, but also about how our brains process that information. So, differences in perception must come from variations in how individuals process and interpret sensory information.

I recall that there are several factors that can influence perception, like personality traits, cultural background, past experiences, and even mood or emotional state. For example, someone who grew up in a different culture might perceive a social situation differently than someone from my own culture. Similarly, a person's personality can affect how they interpret others' actions—like whether they tend to see intentions as positive or negative.

But I need to be more specific. Maybe I should list out some key factors:

1. **Cultural Background**: Culture shapes our values, beliefs, and norms, which in turn influence how we interpret situations and behaviors.

2. **Personal Experiences**: Our past experiences can color our perceptions. For instance, if someone had a bad experience with dogs, they might perceive dogs differently than someone who has only had positive interactions.

3. **Educational Level**: The amount and type of education someone has can affect their understanding and interpretation of complex issues.

4. **Age and Developmental Stage**: Perceptions can change as we age and develop cognitively and emotionally.

5. **Personality Traits**: Traits like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism can influence how we perceive and interpret information.

6. **Emotional State**: Our current emotions can bias our perceptions. For example, when we're happy, we might interpret neutral messages as positive.

7. **Biological Factors**: Things like genetics, brain structure, and even hormonal levels can affect perception.

8. **Social Environment**: The people around us and the social groups we belong to can influence our perceptions through shared beliefs and peer pressure.

9. **Media and Information Exposure**: The media we consume and the information we're exposed to can shape our perceptions of reality.

10. **Language**: The language we speak can affect how we categorize and think about concepts.

I think these are some major factors, but I'm not sure if I've covered everything. Maybe I should look for more information online to confirm and perhaps find additional factors.

Let me try searching for "factors affecting individual perception" to see what comes up.

What are the Factors that Influence the Individual Perception?

What are the Factors that Influence the Individual Perception?

What influences the perception of people is again difficult for us to categorize. An individual perceiver attaches meaning to an object or target, a situation with his/her frame of reference. Hence we can say, perception depends on the personal characteristics of the individual perceiver.
Such personal characteristics can be the aggregation of attitudes, personality, motives, interests and so also the past experiences. Again the characteristics of the object or target and so also the situation can affect the perception. Finally, the context in which the object or target and the situation are being perceived is also important.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Based on the above, we can broadly categorize perception into the three areas as under:
1. Attitude, personality, values, motive, interests, experience and expectations of the perceiver.
2. Time, work situation and social setting of the situation.
3. Shape, size, shape, sound, movement, background and profile of the object or the target.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Perceiver is the individual who perceives the object, target or the situation. Attitude develops a frame of reference, which helps the individual to perceive. Thus, attitude is a stable way of thinking, perceiving and acting towards a situation or object. Personality is the set of traits and characteristics, which forms the habit strength and a static response pattern to a certain stimuli. Values are basic convictions which depict an individual’s moral structure.
It helps to determine what is right and what is wrong. Motives are unsatisfied needs, which exert influence on perception. Interest is the likings and disliking of the people. Past experience narrows down the perception, i.e., it nullifies the interest on objects or targets or situation.
In contrast, however, objects, targets and situation which have not been experienced earlier, evoke more interests. Finally, from the perceiver’s point of view, expectations also distort perception, when the gap between what we see and what we expect widens.
Individual’s perception is often situation specific. Time, work and social settings are the three constructs of a situation. A boss in office is perceived differently by his/her subordinates. However, the same boss when becomes informal with all his/her subordinates in a party, is perceived differently.
ADVERTISEMENTS:
Similarly, objects or targets in relation to its shape, size, shade, sound, silhouette, movement and background influence one’s perception. A police officer in uniform may be perceived as ruthless and tough, while in the core of his/her heart; she/he may be soft and delicate.

Factors Influencing Perception
Perception is a process by which individuals organize and interpret their sensory perceives in order to give meaning to their environment. However, what one perceives can be substantially different from objective reality. There need be, but there is often, disagreement. For example, it’s possible that all employees in a firm may view it as great place to work – favorable working conditions, interesting job alignments, good pay, excellent benefits, an understanding and responsible management but, as most of us known, it’s very unusual to find such agreement.
Why is perception important in the study of OB? Simply because people’s behavior is based on their perception of what reality is, not on reality it self. The world as it is perceived is the world that is behaviorally important.
Perception is the process by which an individual selects, organizes, and interprets information inputs to create a meaningful picture the world. Perception depends not only on the physical stimuli, but also on the stimuli’s relation to the surrounding field and on conditions within the individual. The key point is that perception can vary widely among individuals exposed to the same reality. One person might perceive a fast-talking salesperson an aggressive and insincere another, as intelligent and helpful. Each will respond differently to the salesperson.
Factors Influencing Perception:
How do we explain that individuals may look at the same thing, yet perceive it differently? A number of factors operate to shape and sometimes distort perception. These factors can reside in the perceiver in the object or target being perceived, or in the context of the situation in which the perception is made (See Below):
Factors that influence perception:
Perception
Factors in the perceiver
Attitudes
Motives
Interests
Experience
Expectations
Factors in the situation
Time
Work setting
Social setting
Factors in the target
Novelty
Motion
Sounds
Size
Background
Proximity
Similarity
When an individual looks at a target and attempts to interpret what he or she sees, that interpretation is heavily influenced by the personal characteristics of the individual perceiver. Personal characteristics that affect perception included a person’s attitudes, personality    motives interest, past experiences, and expectations. For instance if you expect police officers to be authoritative, young people to be lazy, or individuals holding office to be unscrupulous, you may peeve them as such regardless of their cultural traits.
Characteristics of the target being observed affect what is perceived. Loud people are more likely to be noticed in a group than quiet ones. So, too, are extremely attractive or unattractive individuals. Because targets are not looked at in isolation, the relationship of a target to its background also influences perception, as does our tendency to group close things and similar things together. For instance, women people of color or members of any other group that has clearly distinguishable characteristics in terms of features or color are often perceived as alike in other, unrelated characteristics as well.
A shrill voice is never perceived to be one of authority. Practice some vocal exercises to lower the pitch of your voice. Here is one to start: Sing – but do it an octave lower on all your favorite songs. Practice this regularly and after a period of time, your voice will lower. People will perceive you as nervous and unsure if you talk too fast. Also, be careful not to slow down to the point where people feel tempted to finish your sentences.
The context in which we see objects or events is also important. The time at which an object or event is seen can influence attention, as can location, light, heat, or any number of situational factors. For example, at a nightclub on Saturday night, you may not notice a 22 year old female dressed to the nines. Yet that same woman so attired for your Monday morning management class would certainly catch your attention (and that of the rest of the class). Neither the perceiver nor the target changed between Saturday night and Monday morning, but the situation is different.
Frequently used short cuts is judging others

Definition of Perception and the factors that Influence the Process of Perception. Perception is a process in which individuals organize and interpret their sensory impressions in order to give meaning to their environment. However, what one perceives can be substantially different from objective reality. People’s behavior is based on their perception of what reality is, not on reality itself. Perceptions have implications for the following in an organization: employment interview, performance expectations, performance evaluation, and employee effort.
A number of factors operate to shape and sometimes distort perception. The factors can reside in the perceiver, in the object or target being perceived, or in the context in which the perception is made. The details are given below:
Factors in the Perceiver: Attitudes, Motives, Interests, Experience, Expectations.
Factors in the situation: Time, Work Setting, Social Setting.
Factors in the Target: Novelty, Motion, Sounds, Size, Background, Proximity, Similarity.
Attribution Theory
When we observe an individual’s behavior, we attempt to determine whether it was internally or externally caused. That determination, however, depends largely on three factors: distinctiveness, consensus, and consistency.
Internally caused behaviors are those that are believed to be under the personal control of the individual. Externally caused behavior is seen as resulting from outside cause, that is, the person is seen as having been forced into the behavior by the situation.
Distinctiveness refers to whether an individual displays different behaviors in different situations. If everyone who is faced with a similar situation responds in the same way, we can say the behavior shows consensus.
Finally, an observer looks for consistency in a person’s actions. Does the person respond the same way over time? The more consistent the behavior, the more the observer is inclined to attribute it to internal causes.
When we make judgments about the behavior of other people, we have a tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and over estimate the influence of internal or personal factors. This is called the fundamental attribution error. There is also a tendency for individuals to attribute their own success to internal factors such as ability or effort while putting the blame for failure on external factors such as bad luck or unproductive co-workers. This is called the self-serving bias.
The Shortcuts Used in Judging Others
An understanding of the following shortcuts used in judging others can be helpful in recognizing when they result in significant distortions.
Selective Perception: Any characteristic that makes a person, object, or event standout will increase the probability that it will be perceived. Because we cannot observe everything going on around us, we engage in selective perception. Because we cannot assimilate all that we observe, we take in bits and pieces.
Halo Effect: When we draw a general impression about an individual on the basis of a single characteristic, such as intelligence, sociability, or appearance, a halo effect is operating.
Contrast Effect: We do not evaluate a person in isolation. Our reaction to one person is influenced by other person we have recently encountered. This is called contrast effect.
Projection: The tendency to attribute one’s own characteristics to other people-called projection-can distort perception made about others. People who engage in projection tend to perceive others according to what they themselves are like rather than according to what the person being observed is really like.
Stereotyping: When we judge someone on the basis of our perception of the group he belongs, we are using the shortcut called stereotyping.
The Decision Making Models
Individuals think and reason before they act. It is because of this that an understanding of how people make decisions can be helpful in explaining and predicting their behavior. There are three decision making models. These are: rational decision making model, bounded rationality model, and intuitive decision making model.
Under some decision situations, people follow the rational decision making model (a decision making model that describes how individuals should behave in order to maximize some outcome). But for most people, this is probably more the exception than the rule. Few important decisions are simple enough for the rational model’s assumptions to apply.
Individuals make decisions by constructing simplified models that extract the essential features from problems without capturing all the complexity. This is called the bounded rationality model, which is characterized by the following biases and prejudices.
Anchoring bias: A tendency for fixate on initial information as a starting point.
Confirming bias: A specific case of selective perception; we seek out information that reaffirms our past choices, and we discount information that contradicts past judgment.
Availability bias: The tendency for people to base their judgments on information that is readily available to them.
Representative bias: Assessing the likelihood of an occurrence by trying to match it with a pre-existing category.
Escalation of commitment: An increased commitment to a previous decision in spite of negative information.
Hindsight bias: The tendency for us to believe falsely that we would have accurately predicted the outcome of an event, after that outcome is actually known.
The intuitive decision making model is an unconscious process created out of distilled experience. It does not necessarily operate independently of rational analysis; rather, the two complement each other.
We offer the following five suggestions for the managers to improve their decision making:
First, analyze the situation
Second, be aware of biases
Third, combine rational analyses with intuition
Fourth, do not assume that your specific decision style is appropriate for your job
Finally, try to enhance your creativity (the ability to produce novel and useful ideas)
A–Foundations of Group Behavior
Classification of Groups
A group is defined as two or more individuals, interacting and interdependent, who have come together to achieve particular objectives.
Groups differ in their cohesiveness, that is, the degree to which members are attracted to each other and are motivated to stay in the group.
Groups can be either formal or informal. By formal groups, we mean those defined by the organization structure, with designated assignments establishing tasks. In contrast, informal groups are alliances that are neither formally structured nor organizationally determined. These groups are natural formation in the work environment that appear in response to the need for social contact.
It is further possible to sub classify groups as command, task, interest, and friendship groups.
Command and task groups are dictated by the formal organization while interest and friendship groups are informal alliances.
A command group: is determined by the organization chart. It is composed of the individuals who report directly to a given manger.
A task group: represents those working together to complete a job task. However, a task group’s boundaries are not limited to its immediate hierarchical superior; it can cross command relationships.
People who may or may not be aligned into common command or task group may affiliate to a specific objective with which each is concerned. This is an interest group.
Groups often develop because the individual members have one or more common characteristics. We call these social formation friendship groups. Social formations can be based on similar age or ethnic heritage, or holding of similar political views. Social groups provide a very important service by satisfying their members’ social needs.
The Five Stage Model of Group Development
The five Stage group- development model characterizes groups as proceeding through five distinct stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjoining.
The first stage, forming, is characterized by a great deal of uncertainty about the group’s purpose, structure, and leadership. This stage completes when members have begun to think of themselves a part of a group.
The storming stage is one of intra-group conflict. Members accept the existence of the group, but there is resistance to the constraints that the group imposes on individuals. When this stage is complete, there will be relatively clear hierarchy of leadership within the group. The third stage is one in which close relationships develop and the group demonstrates cohesiveness.
This norming stage is complete when the group structure solidifies and the group has assimilated a common set of expectation of what defines correct member behavior.
The fourth stage is performing. The structure at this point is fully functional and accepted. Group energy has moved from getting to know and understand each other to performing the task at hand.
For permanent work groups, performing is the last stage in their development. However, for temporary committees, teams, task forces, and similar groups, there is an adjoining stage. In this stage the group prepares for its disbandment.
Different Techniques of Group Decision Making
The most common form of group decision making takes place in interacting groups. In these groups, members meet face to face and rely on both verbal and non verbal interactions to communicate with each other. But interacting groups often censor themselves and pressure individual members towards conformity of opinion. Brainstorming, the nominal group technique, and electronic meetings have been proposed as ways to reduce many of the problems inherent in the traditional interacting groups.
Brainstorming is meant to overcome pressure for conformity in the interacting group that retard the development of creative alternatives. It does this by utilizing an idea generation process that specifically encourages any and all alternatives, while withholding any criticism of those alternatives.
The nominal group technique restricts discussion or interpersonal communication during the decision making process. The chief advantage of the nominal group technique is that it permits the group to meet formally but does not restrict independent thinking as does the interacting group.
In electronic meeting issues are presented to participants and they type their responses onto their computer screen. Individual comments as well as aggregate votes are displayed on projection screen. The proposed advantages of electronic meeting are anonymity, honesty and speed.
Each of these four group decision techniques has its own set of strengths and weaknesses. The interacting group is good for achieving a commitment to a solution, brainstorming develops good cohesiveness, the nominal group techniques is an inexpensive means for generating a large number of ideas, and electronic meetings minimize social pressures and conflicts.
E–CONFLICT AND NEGOTIATIONS
1) Definition of Conflict: We can define conflict as a process that begins when one party perceives that another party has negatively affected, or is about to negatively affect, something that the first party cares about.
2) Three Schools of Thought on Conflict:
i) One school of thought has argued that conflict must be avoided. We call this the Traditional view.
ii) Another school of thought, the human relations view, argues that conflict is a natural and inevitable outcome in any group and that it need not be evil but rather has the potential to be a positive force in determining group performance.
iii) The third, and most recent perspective, proposes not only that conflict can be a positive force in group but explicitly argues that some conflict is absolutely necessary to perform effectively. We label this third school the interactionist approach. The interactionist view does not propose that all conflicts are good. Rather, some conflicts support the goals of the group and improve its performance; these are functional, constructive form of conflict. In addition, there are conflicts that hinder group performance; these are dysfunctional or destructive forms of conflict.
3) The stages involved in the process of conflict
i) Stage 1- Potential Opposition or Incompatibility: The first step is the conflict process is the presence of conditions that create opportunities for conflict to arise. These conditions have been condensed into three general categories: communications, structure, and personal variables.
ii) Stage II- Cognition and Personalization: If the conditions cited in Stage-I, negatively affect something that one party cares about, then the potential for opposition or incompatibility becomes actualized in the second stage. The antecedent conditions can lead to conflict only when one party or more is affected by, and aware of, the conflict. One or more of the parties must be aware of the existence of the antecedent conditions. However, because a conflict is perceived does not mean that it is personalized.
iii) Stage III- Intentions: Intentions intervene between people’s perceptions and emotions and their overt behavior. These intentions are decisions to act in a given way. The following are the primary conflict handling intentions
Competing: When one person seeks to satisfy his interests, regardless of the impact on the other parties to the conflict, he is competing.
Collaborating: When the parties to conflict each desire to fully satisfy the concerns of all parties, we have cooperation and the search for mutually beneficial outcomes.
Avoiding: A person may recognize that a conflict exists and want to withdraw from it or suppress it.
Accommodating: When one party seeks to appease an opponent, that party may be willing to place the opponent’s interests above his or her own. In other words, in order for the relationship to be maintained, one party is willing to be self-sacrificing. We refer to this intention as accommodating.
Compromising: When each party to the conflict seeks to give up something, sharing occurs, resulting in a compromised outcome. In compromising, there is no clear winner or loser.
Stage IV-Behavior:
The behavior stage includes the statements, actions, and reactions made by the conflicting parties. It helps to think of stage-IV, as a dynamic process of interaction. For example, you make a demand on me; I respond by arguing; you threaten me; I threaten you back; and so on.
Stage V- Outcome:
The action-reaction interplay between the conflicting parties result in consequences. These outcomes may be functional in that the conflict results in an improvement in the group’s performance, or dysfunctional in that it hinders group performance.
4) Definition of “Negotiation” and the different bargaining strategies
We define negotiation as a process in which two or more parties exchange goods or services and attempt to agree on the exchange rate for them.
Bargaining Strategies: There are two general approaches to negotiation-distributive bargaining and integrative bargaining.
Distributive Bargaining: The most identifying feature of distributive bargaining is that it operates under zero-sum conditions. That is, any gain I make is at your expense; and vice versa.
Integrative Bargaining: In contrast to distributive bargaining, integrative problem solving operates under the assumption that there exist one or more settlements that can create a win-win solution.
All things being equal, integrative bargaining is preferable to distributive bargaining, because the former builds long-term relationships and facilitates working together in the future.

1) Definition of Conflict: We can define conflict as a process that begins when one party perceives that another party has negatively affected, or is about to negatively affect, something that the first party cares about.
2) Three Schools of Thought on Conflict:
i) One school of thought has argued that conflict must be avoided. We call this the Traditional view.
ii) Another school of thought, the human relations view, argues that conflict is a natural and inevitable outcome in any group and that it need not be evil but rather has the potential to be a positive force in determining group performance.
iii) The third, and most recent perspective, proposes not only that conflict can be a positive force in group but explicitly argues that some conflict is absolutely necessary to perform effectively. We label this third school the interactionist approach. The interactionist view does not propose that all conflicts are good. Rather, some conflicts support the goals of the group and improve its performance; these are functional, constructive form of conflict. In addition, there are conflicts that hinder group performance; these are dysfunctional or destructive forms of conflict.
3) The stages involved in the process of conflict
i) Stage 1- Potential Opposition or Incompatibility: The first step is the conflict process is the presence of conditions that create opportunities for conflict to arise. These conditions have been condensed into three general categories: communications, structure, and personal variables.
ii) Stage II- Cognition and Personalization: If the conditions cited in Stage-I, negatively affect something that one party cares about, then the potential for opposition or incompatibility becomes actualized in the second stage. The antecedent conditions can lead to conflict only when one party or more is affected by, and aware of, the conflict. One or more of the parties must be aware of the existence of the antecedent conditions. However, because a conflict is perceived does not mean that it is personalized.
iii) Stage III- Intentions: Intentions intervene between people’s perceptions and emotions and their overt behavior. These intentions are decisions to act in a given way. The following are the primary conflict handling intentions
Competing: When one person seeks to satisfy his interests, regardless of the impact on the other parties to the conflict, he is competing.
Collaborating: When the parties to conflict each desire to fully satisfy the concerns of all parties, we have cooperation and the search for mutually beneficial outcomes.
Avoiding: A person may recognize that a conflict exists and want to withdraw from it or suppress it.
Accommodating: When one party seeks to appease an opponent, that party may be willing to place the opponent’s interests above his or her own. In other words, in order for the relationship to be maintained, one party is willing to be self-sacrificing. We refer to this intention as accommodating.
Compromising: When each party to the conflict seeks to give up something, sharing occurs, resulting in a compromised outcome. In compromising, there is no clear winner or loser.
Stage IV-Behavior:
The behavior stage includes the statements, actions, and reactions made by the conflicting parties. It helps to think of stage-IV, as a dynamic process of interaction. For example, you make a demand on me; I respond by arguing; you threaten me; I threaten you back; and so on.
Stage V- Outcome:
The action-reaction interplay between the conflicting parties result in consequences. These outcomes may be functional in that the conflict results in an improvement in the group’s performance, or dysfunctional in that it hinders group performance.
4) Definition of “Negotiation” and the different bargaining strategies
We define negotiation as a process in which two or more parties exchange goods or services and attempt to agree on the exchange rate for them.
Bargaining Strategies: There are two general approaches to negotiation-distributive bargaining and integrative bargaining.
Distributive Bargaining: The most identifying feature of distributive bargaining is that it operates under zero-sum conditions. That is, any gain I make is at your expense; and vice versa.
Integrative Bargaining: In contrast to distributive bargaining, integrative problem solving operates under the assumption that there exist one or more settlements that can create a win-win solution.
All things being equal, integrative bargaining is preferable to distributive bargaining, because the former builds long-term relationships and facilitates working together in the future.

SHORT DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
105
20. 148. Contrast the fundamental attribution error and the self-serving bias.
When we make judgments about the behavior of other people, we have a tendency to
underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal
or personal factors. This is called the fundamental attribution error. There is also a
tendency for individuals to attribute their own successes to internal factors such as
ability or effort while putting the blame for failure on external factors such as bad luck or
unproductive coworkers. This is called the self-serving bias. (Page 149)
149. Discuss some of the errors in perceptual judgment made by interviewers in job interviews.
Interviewers make perceptual judgments that are often inaccurate. In addition, agreement
among interviewers is often poor; that is, different interviewers see different things in the
same candidate and thus arrive at different conclusions about the applicant. Interviewers
generally draw early impressions that become very quickly entrenched. If negative
information is exposed early in the interview, it tends to be more heavily weighted than if
that same information comes out later. Studies indicate that most interviewers’ decisions
change very little after the first four or five minutes of the interview. As a result,
information elicited early in the interview carries greater weight than does information
elicited later, and a “good applicant” is probably characterized more by the absence of
unfavorable characteristics than by the presence of favorable characteristics. Perceptual
factors influence who is hired and eventually the quality of an organization’s labor force.
(Pages 153-154)
150. What is the self-fulfilling prophecy?
The self-fulfilling prophecy is also called the Pygmalion effect. It characterizes the fact
that what is expected of people helps determine their behavior. In other words, if a
manager expects big things from his people, they’re not likely to let him down. Similarly,
if a manager expects people to perform minimally, they’ll tend to behave so as to meet
those low expectations. The result then is that the expectations become reality. (Page
154)
151. What assumptions are made by the rational decision-making model?
There are six assumptions of the rational decision-making model:
a. The problem is clear and unambiguous. The decision maker is assumed to have
complete information regarding the decision situation.
b. It is assumed the decision maker can identify all the relevant criteria and can list all the
viable alternatives. Furthermore, the decision maker is aware of all the possible
consequences of each alternative.
c. Rationality assumes that the criteria and alternatives can be ranked and weighted to
reflect their importance.
d. It is assumed that the specific decision criteria are constant and that the weights
assigned to them are stable over time.
e. The rational decision maker can obtain full information about criteria and alternatives
because it is assumed that there are no time or cost constraints.
f. The rational decision maker will choose the alternative that yields the highest
perceived value.
(Pages 157)
152. How is bounded rationality related to decision making?
Since the capacity of the human mind for formulating and solving complex problems is
far too small to meet the requirements for full rationality, individuals operate within the
confines of bounded rationality. They construct simplified models that extract the
essential features from problems without capturing all their complexity. Individuals can
106
21. then behave rationally within the limits of the simple model. Once the limited set of
alternatives is identified, the decision maker will begin reviewing it. But the review will
not be comprehensive. Instead, the decision maker will begin with alternatives that differ
only in a relatively small degree from the choice currently in effect. Following along
familiar and well-worn paths, the decision maker proceeds to review alternatives only
until he or she identifies an alternative that is “good enough.” The first alternative that
meets the “good enough” criterion ends the search. So the final solution represents a
satisficing choice rather than an optimum one. (Pages 161-162)
153. Define the term escalation of commitment.
A bias that creeps into decisions is a tendency to escalate commitment when a decision
stream represents a series of decisions. Escalation of commitment refers to staying with
a decision even when there is clear evidence that it is wrong. Individuals tend to escalate
commitment to a failing course of action when they view themselves as responsible for
the failure. (Pages 164)
MEDIUM LENGTH DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
154. Discuss five shortcuts used in judging others.
Because it is impossible for us to assimilate everything we see, only certain stimuli can
be taken in. Since we cannot observe everything going on about us, we engage in
selective perception. This allows us to “speed-read” others. When we draw a general
impression about an individual on the basis of a single characteristic, a halo effect is
operating. The contrast effect occurs when we don’t evaluate a person in isolation; our
reaction to one person is influenced by other people we have recently encountered. The
tendency to attribute one’s own characteristics to other people is projection. This occurs
when we perceive others according to what we ourselves are like rather than according to
what the person being observed is really like. When we judge someone on the basis of
our perception of the group to which he or she belongs, we are using the shortcut called
stereotyping. (Pages 150-152)
155. Outline the six steps in the rational decision-making model.
The rational decision-making model begins by defining the problem. Once a decision
maker has defined the problem, he or she needs to identify the decision criteria that will
be important in solving the problem. That is, the decision maker determines what is
relevant in making the decision. The third step requires the decision maker to weight the
previously identified criteria in order to give them the correct priority in the decision. The
fourth step requires the decision maker to generate possible alternatives that could
succeed in resolving the problem. Once the alternatives have been generated, the
decision maker must critically analyze and evaluate each one. This is done by rating
each alternative on each criterion. The final step requires computing the optimal
decision. This is done by evaluating each alternative against the weighted criteria and
selecting the alternative with the highest total score. (Page 157)
156. Discuss three different criteria for ethical decision making.
There are three different criteria in making ethical choices. The first is the utilitarian
criterion, in which decisions are made solely on the basis of their outcomes or
consequences. The goal of utilitarianism is to provide the greatest good for the greatest
number. This is the view that tends to dominate business decision making. Another
criterion is to focus on rights. This calls on individuals to make decisions consistent
with fundamental liberties and privileges as set forth in documents like the Bill of Rights.
An emphasis on rights in decision making means respecting and protecting the basic
rights of individuals. A third criterion is to focus on justice. This requires individuals to
107
22. impose and enforce rules fairly and impartially so there is an equitable distribution of
benefits and costs. (Pages 172-173)
COMPREHENSIVE ESSAYS
157. What factors that operate to shape and sometimes distort perception reside in the perceiver,
what factors reside in the target being perceived, and what factors reside in the context of the
situation?
A number of factors operate to shape and sometimes distort perception. These factors
can reside in the perceiver, in the object or target being perceived, or in the context of the
situation in which the perception is made. When an individual looks at a target and
attempts to interpret what he or she sees, that interpretation is heavily influenced by
personal characteristics of the individual perceiver. Personal characteristics affecting
perception include his or her attitudes, personality, motives, interests, past experiences,
and expectations. Characteristics of the target being observed can affect what is
perceived. The relationship of a target to its background influences perception, as does
our tendency to group close things and similar things together. The context in which we
see objects or events is also important. The time at which an object or event is seen can
influence attention, as can location, light, heat, or any number of other factors. (Page
147)
158. Discuss the three-component model of creativity.
The three-component model of creativity proposes that individual creativity essentially
requires expertise, creative-thinking skills, and intrinsic task motivation. Expertise is the
foundation for all creative work. The potential for creativity is enhanced when individuals
have abilities, knowledge, proficiencies, and similar expertise in their field of endeavor.
The second component is creative-thinking skills. This encompasses personality
characteristics associated with creativity, the ability to use analogies, as well as the talent
to see the familiar in a different light. The final component is intrinsic task motivation.
This is the desire to work on something because it is interesting, involving, exciting,
satisfying, or personally challenging. This motivational component is what turns
creativity potential into actual creative ideas. It determines the extent to which
individuals fully engage their expertise and creative skills. (Pages 159)
159. Discuss some of the ways in which an organization constrains decision makers.
Managers are strongly influenced in their decision making by the criteria by which they
are evaluated. The organization’s reward system influences decision makers by
suggesting to them what choices are preferable in terms of personal payoff. Rules,
policies, procedures, and other formalized regulations standardize behavior of
organizational members. By programming decisions, organizations are able to get
individuals to achieve high levels of performance without paying for the years of
experience that would be necessary in the absence of regulations. Organizations impose
deadlines on decisions. These conditions create time pressures on decision makers and
often make it difficult, if not impossible, to gather all the information they might like to
have before making a final choice. Decisions have a context. Decisions made in the past
are ghosts which continually haunt current choices. Choices made today, therefore, are
largely a result of choices made over the years. (Pages 169-170)
160. List and explain eight common decision biases or errors.
Overconfidence Bias. When we’re given factual questions and asked to judge the
probability that our answers are correct, we tend to be far too optimistic.
Anchoring Bias. The anchoring bias is a tendency to fixate on initial information as a
starting point. Once set, we then fail to adequately adjust for subsequent information.
108
23. The anchoring bias occurs because our mind appears to give a disproportionate amount
of emphasis to the first information it receives. So initial impressions, ideas, prices, and
estimates carry undue weight relative to information received later.
Confirmation Bias. The rational decision-making process assumes that we objectively
gather information. But we don’t. We selectively gather information. The confirmation
bias represents a specific case of selective perception. We seek out information that
reaffirms our past choices, and we discount information that contradicts past judgments.
Availability Bias. This is the tendency for people to base their judgments on information
that is readily available to them. Events that evoke emotions, that are particularly vivid,
or that have occurred more recently tend to be more available in our memory. As a result,
we tend to be prone to overestimating unlikely events like an airplane crash. The
availability bias can also explain why managers, when doing annual performance
appraisals, tend to give more weight to recent behaviors of an employee than those
behaviors of six or nine months ago.
Representative Bias. We are all guilty of falling into the representative bias at times.
Managers, for example, frequently predict the performance of a new product by relating it
to a previous product’s success. Or if three graduates from the same college were hired
and turned out to be poor performers, managers may predict that a current job applicant
from the same college will not be a good employee.
Escalation of Commitment Error. This refers to staying with a decision even when there
is clear evidence that it’s wrong. Individuals escalate commitment to a failing course of
action when they view themselves as responsible for the failure. Escalation of
commitment is also congruent with evidence that people try to appear consistent in what
they say and do. Increasing commitment to previous actions conveys consistency.
Randomness Error. Human beings have a lot of difficulty dealing with chance. Most of us
like to believe we have some control over our world and destiny. Although we
undoubtedly can control a good part of our future by rational decision making, the truth
is that the world will always contain random events. Decision making becomes impaired
when we try to create meaning out of random events.
Hindsight bias. The hindsight bias is the tendency for us to believe falsely that we’d have
accurately predicted the outcome of an event, after that outcome is actually known.
When something happens and we have accurate feedback on the outcome, we seem to be
pretty good at concluding that this outcome was relatively obvious.

Alright, I have this question: "What are the factors that create these differences in perceptions from person to person?" So, I need to figure out why people perceive things differently. I think it has something to do with how our brains process information and how our experiences shape our views. But I need to dig deeper and find concrete factors that contribute to these differences.

First, I should understand what perception is. Perception is how we interpret the world around us based on our sensory inputs. It's not just about what's out there, but also about how our brains make sense of that information. So, differences in perception must come from variations in how individuals process and interpret sensory information.

I recall that there are several factors that can influence perception, such as personality traits, cultural background, past experiences, and even mood or emotional state. For example, someone who grew up in a different culture might perceive a social situation differently than someone from my own culture. Similarly, a person's personality can affect how they interpret others' actions—like whether they tend to see intentions as positive or negative.

But I need to be more specific. Maybe I should list out some key factors:

1. **Cultural Background:** Culture shapes our values, beliefs, and norms, which in turn influence how we interpret situations and behaviors.

2. **Personal Experiences:** Our past experiences can color our perceptions. For instance, if someone had a bad experience with dogs, they might perceive dogs differently than someone who has only had positive interactions.

3. **Educational Level:** The amount and type of education someone has can affect their understanding and interpretation of complex issues.

4. **Age and Developmental Stage:** Perceptions can change as we age and develop cognitively and emotionally.

5. **Personality Traits:** Traits like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism can influence how we perceive and interpret information.

6. **Emotional State:** Our current emotions can bias our perceptions. For example, when we're happy, we might interpret neutral messages as positive.

7. **Biological Factors:** Things like genetics, brain structure, and even hormonal levels can affect perception.

8. **Social Environment:** The people around us and the social groups we belong to can influence our perceptions through shared beliefs and peer pressure.

9. **Media and Information Exposure:** The media we consume and the information we're exposed to can shape our perceptions of reality.

10. **Language:** The language we speak can affect how we categorize and think about concepts.

I think these are some major factors, but I'm not sure if I've covered everything. Maybe I should look for more information online to confirm and perhaps find additional factors.

Let me try searching for "factors affecting individual perception" to see what comes up.
