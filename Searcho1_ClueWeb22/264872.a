So I have this question: "Are standardized tests effective?" Hmm, that's a pretty broad topic. I guess I need to break it down and think about what makes a test effective and then see if standardized tests meet those criteria.

First off, what is a standardized test? From what I know, it's a test that's uniformly administered to all test takers, meaning that everyone gets the same questions and the same time limits, and they're scored in a consistent manner. Examples include the SAT, ACT, GRE, and plenty of others.

Now, effectiveness—what does that mean in this context? I suppose it depends on what the purpose of the test is. If the goal is to assess a student's knowledge or skills in a particular area, then effectiveness would relate to how well the test measures that knowledge or those skills. Alternatively, if the test is used for admissions decisions, then effectiveness might be tied to how well it predicts success in the program or institution.

So, I need to consider the purposes of standardized tests and evaluate whether they achieve those purposes effectively.

Let me start by considering the positive aspects of standardized tests.

One advantage is that they provide a common measure. Since everyone takes the same test under the same conditions, it's easier to compare students against each other. This can be useful for admissions committees trying to decide between candidates from different schools or backgrounds.

Another potential benefit is that they can be objective. The scoring is typically done mechanically or by evaluators who don't know the identities of the test takers, which can reduce bias.

Standardized tests can also motivate students to study and prepare, which might lead to better learning outcomes.

But, of course, there are criticisms and potential drawbacks to consider.

One major issue is that these tests may not accurately reflect a student's true abilities or knowledge. Some students might be good at taking tests, while others may perform poorly due to test anxiety or lack of test-taking skills, even if they understand the material.

There's also the problem of teaching to the test. If the curriculum becomes focused solely on preparing for the standardized test, it might narrow the educational experience and neglect other important areas of learning.

Additionally, standardized tests don't account for differences in background, resources, or circumstances. For example, students from wealthier families might have access to test preparation courses and materials that others don't, giving them an unfair advantage.

I'm also aware that some people argue that standardized tests don't measure important qualities like creativity, critical thinking, or practical skills. They might be better at assessing memorization and basic comprehension.

Moreover, there's evidence to suggest that standardized test scores can be influenced by factors unrelated to ability, such as socioeconomic status, race, and gender. This raises questions about fairness and equity.

I think it's important to consider these points and see if there's any research or data that can support or challenge these ideas.

Maybe I should look up some studies on the validity and reliability of standardized tests. Validity refers to whether the test measures what it's intended to measure, and reliability refers to the consistency of the test results.

I recall that there are different types of validity, like content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. For standardized tests, especially in educational settings, it's crucial that they have high validity and reliability to be considered effective.

Perhaps I should search for some resources that discuss the effectiveness of standardized testing.

Standardized Testing Among U.S. Students: Is It Really Effective?

Introduction
For years, standardized testing has been a preferred method among our education system to measure and compare student knowledge. Whether it be for college admission purposes or the determination of a student passing their grade, standardized testing indeed plays a prominent role in a student’s school career. However, are these tests really effective? Are they really reliable indicators of a student’s overall knowledge? Especially considering that information recall, which is the main focus in a standardized test, is not the only factor in a student’s intelligence?
Despite standardized testing being a preferred method of measuring student knowledge, it is not effective as it does not take other aspects of student intelligence into account and is prioritized over other activities and skills.
What Is Standardized Testing?
A standardized test consists of questions, mainly multiple-choice and true-or-false, that are scored in a standard way. Resultantly, multiple tests can be scored in a consistent, non-biased manner by artificial intelligence. This produces a set of test performance data that can easily be compared and measured with other regions, allowing educators to get an idea of overall student achievement. Standardized testing is commonly used in an educational setting for college admission purposes, to measure student achievement over a school year or to determine what a student may be good at in the future. Colleges can use these test scores to get an idea of how qualified a prospective applicant may be, and educators can use student test scores to determine areas of achievement and areas where improvement is needed. Therefore, standardized testing is a preferred method when measuring student knowledge as it is easy to measure, compare, and utilize.
Flaws Of Standardized Testing
However, b ecause of its unbiased nature, standardized testing mainly focuses on a student’s ability to retain learned information. It does not necessarily pick up on other aspects of student intelligence, such as critical thinking or creativity. These two traits go hand in hand and are much more complex than simple information recall because they require a much deeper thought process. These skills can also benefit students in the real world because they are relevant in multiple disciplines.
Although some argue that the unbiased nature of standardized tests helps them to be consistently scored and compared by artificial intelligence, bias is needed to pick up on aspects of intelligence that don’t have much to do with information recall that a computer, devoid of emotions, cannot identify. The unbiased nature of standardized testing is undoubtedly one of its flaws.
Standardized Testing Preparation
Along with its inaccuracies in measuring knowledge, students are also encouraged and even pressured to study hard and to actively prepare for standardized tests. Educators must spend a decent amount of time preparing their students as well. With so much time set aside for learning the content and system of an anticipated standardized test, there is not much time for students to focus on other skills apart of their intelligence, such as art, literature, and creative and critical thinking.
Furthermore, many educators end up “teaching to the test”, meaning that the majority of their instruction focuses solely on preparation for an upcoming standardized test. While this may improve students’ test performances, teaching to the test instruction leaves children with less time to focus on other skills and activities. They are preparing for the test, but they are not preparing or learning anything outside of it that may be important for them to know in the real world.
This could also leave students with a narrow scope of the world—knowing enough to pass the test, but not enough to truly benefit them in the long run. According to Professor Hani Morgan of the University of Southern Mississippi, “learning based on memorization and recall may improve student performance on tests, but fails to develop higher-level thinking skills”. This proves that active standardized testing preparation can negatively affect a student’s quality of education.
What Can We Do To Create Change?
Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many students have had to take the SAT and ACT tests in a non-traditional setting—online and at home. This has caused some colleges and universities to change their SAT/ACT score requirement to optional. Some even acknowledged that statistically, standardized testing is not an accurate source to determine how well a student will perform in college.
While the altering of the SAT/ACT testing requirement is a good start in improving our education system, we should also redirect our focus on other indicators of student intelligence, such as creativity and critical thinking. To do this, students should be encouraged to find and follow their passions and to work to become exemplary in their desired fields. Schools should set aside more time for students to hone their skills and explore other passions outside of the structured curriculum. This will surely create more devoted, talented, and passionate leaders for generations to come.
While standardized testing can be used at times for measuring achievement in certain areas, it should not be the main focus in determining student intelligence. Rather, it should just be a part of it.

do standardized tests improve education?
*Updated 2021
From Terra Novas and New York Regents to the more overwhelming SATs and GREs, standardized tests are the bane of many school-age students’ existence. First implemented in the 1800’s, standardized tests have now become the measure by which many elementary, middle and high school students are accepted or rejected from schools, eligible for scholarships, etc. Their use jumped in 2002 for students in grades K-12, after the No Child Left Behind act mandated that all 50 states implement standardized tests. But are these tests helping to bolster education, or are they a flawed tool?
Here are three reasons supporting the claim that standardized tests negatively impact education, and three more reasons supporting it.
Standardized tests negatively impact education
Creativity crash
A long-standing trend of “ teaching to the test ” has become widespread in the US, which narrows teachers’ focus on only teaching subjects that will help students perform well on standardized tests. Yet, studies have shown that students are more successful when focused on learning rather than on exam performance. According to the National Council of Teachers of English, subjects such as art, social studies, foreign languages and music have been sidelined, as they are generally not tested on. In this vein, tests like the SATs – which only test for math and reading – don’t account for students’ strengths in other areas of learning, and only encourage a narrowing of the high school curriculum. These tests should be an evaluation tool for students’ overall intellect instead of only evaluating their test-taking abilities.
Not worth the cost
Standardized tests are astronomically expensive, using taxpayer dollars that could be put towards better use. A study found that standardized tests cost some states over $1.7 billion a year. America’s school system suffers from severe inequality. There are schools all over America that are in dire need of updated materials, funding for teachers, school psychologists, more after-school programming, etc., which a Rutgers University study shows as having a positive impact on student achievement. Instead, this money is currently going towards student assessments, and taking away essential resources from which students would highly benefit. Additionally, tests like the SATs may be biased towards those students who come from money; if they can afford to go to an expensive school or prep course, and if they have more time to study because they don’t have to work, then they will most likely perform better on such tests.
Taking it out on the teachers
Teachers’ success is partially measured by their students’ scores on standardized tests. However, these scores are dependent on all of the students’ teachers combined – not just on a singular teacher’s performance. Studies have long shown that standardized test scores are not a good predictor for teacher effectiveness, yet most states use them as an evaluative tool for teachers. In fact, before the pandemic, states like New York proposed to increase the weight of this tool on evaluating teacher performance to 50%. Such a system that punishes and rewards teachers based on test scores won’t contribute to better education for students.
Standardized tests improve education
Equal opportunity
Standardized tests ensure the education level in America is up to par – for everyone. The US’s Every Student Succeeds Act, which began in 2016, requires states to use proficiency on standardized exams as a method of holding elementary, middle and high schools accountable for their students’ success. This was intended to close the gap between minority and poverty-stricken students with those from higher-income families. Not only do standardized tests give every student the opportunity to learn the same material as their peers in other schools, but state funding laws incentivize schools to ensure every student does well on these exams. As Washington State’s Senator Patty Murray once said about education laws, “We know that if we don’t have ways to measure students’ progress, and if we don’t hold states accountable, the victims will invariably be the kids from poor neighborhoods, children of color, and students with disabilities.”
Objective measure
Regarding university admissions, it’s important to have an objective measure by which to evaluate applicants, especially regarding scholarship applications and determining academic placement. This is where standardized tests are beneficial, given that personal interviews and demographic information automatically subject evaluations to bias and human error.Colleges and universities need some sort of unbiased tools with which to screen applicants. These tests help place students in the appropriate place of learning by removing bias from the equation. The SATs are not perfect, but they provide a good service in that vein. The SATs (and other standardized tests) are largely comprised of multiple-choice questions and scored by machines, and thus provide an objective, statistically reliable criteria through which to compare student success. The SATs also show students’ proficiencies in a narrow focus instead of having their entire academic career come under the microscope.
Helps students succeed?
Standardized tests didn’t appear out of nowhere; there is evidence that they teach students important skills. In his book “ Defending Standardized Testing ,” Dr. Richard Phelps presents his findings after analyzing 100+ years of research on standardized tests, and concludes that 93% of studies have shown standardized tests as having a positive influence on student achievement. Additionally, cognitive studies have found that test-taking in general actually helps students retain information long-term.
The Bottom Line: While standardized tests even the playing field between students of all circumstances, their use may negatively impact student creativity and teacher evaluations unfairly. Do you think standardized tests should be part of the education system?

I nervously bounce my knee as I focus all of my energy on the Scantron form and test booklet laying on the desk in front of me. These next four hours could determine the rest of my life. I glance around the room at the thirty other students who are in the same position as I am. I realize that some of them will do poorly and get denied from their dream college, and some of them won’t be able to finish in time and score poorly as a result of their learning disorder, causing them to believe that they aren’t smart.

After countless hours of studying, these students take the test that will be one of the major factors in their admission to colleges. This test puts a great deal of stress on students, but it isn’t the only standardized test that students encounter. In fact, students are required to take several standardized tests every year. Standardized testing has been deeply integrated in our education system for a long time, and it time that we reevaluate its effectiveness.

The way in which we educate the youth of today has a huge impact on the future of our society and therefore the education system should be heavily valued and carefully designed. If we want to raise a generation of great leaders and innovators, we must give children a quality education.
However, many aspects of the American education system are outdated and in need of improvement, including the standardized testing system. The American education system has been heavily dependent on standardized testing since the early 1900’s with little changes. Meanwhile, the world has changed drastically and so the system should be changed accordingly. This issue has caused much controversy in recent decades as people begin to realize the ineffectiveness of the current system and fight for change. Supporters of the system argue that it is a great method of evaluating and comparing students while the opposing viewpoint argues that its many flaws make it impractical.
However, despite the large and constantly increasing opposition to standardized testing, little change has been made. In this essay, I will discuss the arguments for and against the use of standardized testing in the education system and provide evidence that it should not be used. I will begin with the arguments against standardized testing, explaining that it is outdated, evaluates test-taking skills rather than intelligence, is unfair to some students, has too much impact on college admissions, puts excess pressure on students, and causes teachers to teach to the tests. Following my arguments against standardized testing, I will include arguments from the other side of the controversy, including the claims that standardized tests are an objective evaluation of students, evaluate the effectiveness of teaching methods, compare the quality of schools, compare students for college admissions, and finally the claim that there is simply no better option. I will then refute these claims with support to show their falsity.
Throughout the essay, I will show that although standardized testing provides benefits such as the objective comparison of students and evaluation of teaching methods, its unfair evaluation of students and negative effect on teaching styles prove it is not the best method of student evaluation. In the TED Talk, entitled “None of the Above-Why Standardized Testing Fails”, Bob Sternberg argues that standardized testing isn’t effective because it was created in the early 1900’s and since then, society has changed greatly. He says that at the time when these tests were introduced, the knowledge base required to be successful in society was much simpler than it is today so the tests were an adequate measurement of a person’s potential.
However, now it is necessary to possess many more skills in order to be successful and so the tests have become an outdated measurement. While the tests only measure memory and analytical skills, it is now necessary to possess creativity, flexibility, wisdom, and practical skills in order to succeed in the modern world. Sternberg makes a strong point as he explains that “we’ve been using standardized testing for a hundred years, so people have gotten used to it and don’t want to change. But imagine how many people would be dead if we used the same medical tests of a hundred years ago” (Sternberg). It is illogical to expect a one hundred year old system to continue to work effectively in a rapidly changing society and therefore standardized testing is an outdated system in need of improvement. Another issue with using standardized testing as an evaluation of students is that it is more of a measurement of a student’s test-taking skills rather than their intelligence. There are many intelligent students who have difficulty taking tests and therefore score poorly on standardized tests.
James Alvino and Jerome Wieler discuss this issue in their article from The Phi Delta Kappan, explaining that “students who do well on standardized tests –and many of them are very bright-have been able to conform their thinking to the dictates of psychometrically determined systems of relevance” (Alvino, Wieler 107). Only those who can conform to what test makers are looking for can be successful on the tests. This makes standardized testing an unfair and inaccurate measurement of a student’s worth because students that have learning disorders or simply have trouble with test-taking are at an extreme disadvantage. Related to this issue, there are many great students who are convinced that they are not smart due to poor scores on standardized tests. No matter how talented a student is, the education system places so much importance on standardized testing that low-scoring students get the impression that they are unintelligent.
Students with unbelievable potential are told they are not good enough and give up on their dreams. These students could be great leaders and innovators when they grow up, yet they are told that they don’t have what it takes to succeed simply because they didn’t score well on standardized tests. The pressure placed on students to do well on standardized tests forces them to conform to the way of thinking that the test-making corporations base their tests on. This conformity creates an education system that does not foster creativity or individuality as students are all expected to learn in the way and share the same skills. As a result, many students who struggle with standardized testing become frustrated to the point of dropping out of school. In fact, among high school dropouts, a high percentage are gifted students due to the “alienating modes of testing, for students may come to perceive them as the ultimate measure of conformity of thought” (Alvino, Wieler 107).
Every person has their own unique strengths and talents and therefore should not be judged on the same standards as everyone else. The education system only celebrates students which are talented in terms of the standards that are put in place by educators. The result is a large number of greatly talented children that are deemed unintelligent by the education system because their talent lies elsewhere. In order to adapt to the unique learning styles and talents of different students, the education system must not use a standardized method of evaluating its students. Standardized testing is a huge factor for college admissions as colleges look for students with the highest SAT or ACT scores and often have minimum score cutoffs for acceptance. This puts a lot of faith into the effectiveness of standardized tests as colleges are using scores as one of the main criteria for judging a student. Many people are highly critical of the amount that test scores affect admissions because it is an unfair evaluation of a student’s worth and students should be admitted based on the possession of a more wide range of skills than those tested by the SAT.
While other factors such as GPA, recommendations, extracurricular activities, and essays are also important in the admissions process, the fact that so many schools have a strict minimum SAT score for acceptance causes the system to be flawed. Because of this, “standardized tests have been attacked for distorting educational priorities and for being the basis on which students with lower scores are excluded from educational opportunities or falsely tracked within their own institutions” (Fruehling 7). Students who are incredibly talented but have trouble with taking tests have no chance at getting accepted into top universities due solely to their low test scores. This is extremely unfair to these students as well as harmful to society since these kids might make a great impact on the world if they had the opportunities that come with attending a prestigious university.
On the bright side, due to the negative feedback on the current system, many colleges are putting less weight on test scores and increasing the importance of other factors for admissions. However, there is still much more room for improvement as many colleges still have minimum score cutoffs that should be discontinued to make college admissions a fair process. This high value of test scores for college admissions puts an immense amount of pressure on high school students to do well on the SATs and ACTs. Every student has a dream school that they want to be accepted into, but these dreams are often crushed by insufficient test scores. As a result of this as well as pressure from parents to score well and receive scholarships, students often are extremely nervous about the SATs to the point where it causes an unhealthy level of stress.
Most psychologists agree that a small amount of stress is healthy, but high levels of stress can cause many negative effects on the human body and brain. The amount of pressure put on students by standardized tests is often enough to cause this unhealthy stress. While it is important to keep kids motivated and push them to succeed, children should not have to feel overly stressed about school because this is unfair and will detract from the education of the students. An overly stressed student is not able to function properly as stress can cause memory problems, depression, and anxiety. Without the stress caused by standardized testing, students would be healthier and capable of learning more effectively. By this logic, standardized tests are hindering the education of students and to improve the education system, the amount of standardized tests given and the amount of weight they carry should be decreased.
A final argument against the use of standardized testing is the fact that it results in negative change to curriculums as teachers “teach to the test”. The meaning of this phrase is that the curriculum is altered in order to focus on preparing students for standardized tests. This is a common occurrence because teachers are evaluated based on the test scores of their students so they want to ensure that they receive high scores. Although teaching to the test is effective at improving test scores, it has a negative impact on education as a whole. This is because the knowledge and skills that students are taught in preparation for a standardized test are not very helpful in any other aspects of life, and all of the time that is spent preparing students for tests is time that should have been spent on teaching academic content. In addition to the time lost due to teaching to the test, the corporations that create the tests are given too much power over the curriculum.
In Oscar Hough’s journal, “The Standardized Test: To Be or Not to Be” he makes a good point that “if teachers are to be judged by the scores their students make on standardized tests, it is inevitable that many will concentrate on teaching the content of a test. In this way a standardized test dictates the material to be taught” (Haeugh 53). As long as test scores are used to evaluate teachers, curriculum will be influenced by standardized tests. Allowing the corporations that make and distribute standardized tests to control what is taught to students across the country is not beneficial to our education system. Standardized testing has too large of an influence on the way that teachers design their lessons and has a negative effect in schools due to the time lost that could have been spent teaching actual content and the amount of power given to the corporations that make the tests. While there are many people who believe that standardized testing is ineffective and should not be so heavily used, there are also many supporters of the tests.
One common argument of those in favor of standardized tests is that they provide an objective evaluation of students and provide parents and teachers with numerical data regarding the success of students. They argue that standardized tests provide a level playing field for all students since the grading system is set in stone and is the same for every student. They also argue that the results are very helpful for parents and teachers to track the progress of students. While this is a valid point and test results can definitely be helpful, they are based on a system that, despite being objective, is unfair to students who are not good at test taking. The brain is very complex and there are many different ways in which a person can be intelligent. However, standardized tests “measure only about eight mental operations. The Guilford Structure of the Intellect Model suggests over 120 mental operations not tested by current instruments” (Alvino, Wieler 107).
As a result, standardized tests are unfair to those students who are gifted at any of the 112 mental operations that were not measured by tests. In addition to evaluating the success of students, supporters of standardized testing argue that it is a good method of evaluating the effectiveness of teachers and their methods. They argue that by observing the change in test scores of a class, the teacher’s effectiveness can be evaluated based on whether the scores increased or decreased. This is partly true in the sense that test results show how well a teacher can prepare their students for the test. However, this information is not insightful to a teacher’s effectiveness in teaching actual course material and judging teachers based on the test scores of their students furthers the problem of teaching to the test.
Evaluation of teachers based on test scores will always result in teaching to the test because “teachers who are held accountable then feel the need to resort to devices of collecting, organizing, and teaching previous examination questions and their answers” (Hough 53-54). This is an issue because teachers are spending time preparing students for standardized tests instead of teaching course material. Another argument in favor of standardized tests is that they can be used in order to objectively compare the quality of different schools. The quality of a school is very important to students when deciding which college to attend and to parents of younger children when here to move.
Supporters argue that without test scores, there would be little basis for comparing schools accurately. While this is a valid point and test scores are truly helpful in comparing schools, scores should not be the main factor for determining the quality of schools as there are many other very important aspects that are overlooked such as the teaching staff, facilities, location, and success of students after graduation. For example, the salaries of graduated students from a university is a much better indicator of the quality of education than standardized test scores because test scores only show how many good test takers attend a university while the salaries of alumni shows how well the school prepared its students for their careers.
For this reason, standardized test scores should not be such a large factor in comparing the quality of schools. While supporters of standardized testing argue that test scores help students choose colleges, they are also arguing that test scores help colleges chose students. It is in the best interest of colleges to accept only the best students, therefore many factors impact which students will be most successful. Due to many factors such as teacher recommendations not being objective, some people believe that an admissions system based on standardized testing is the best solution. The problem with this is that admissions should not be so heavily impacted by how well a student scored on one test. The other factors such as extracurricular activities and GPA are things that the student worked on for years while the SAT only captures the success of a student during a four hour period.
For example, I witnessed this issue as one of my good friends from high school was negatively affected by his SAT score. He is one of the smartest people I know; he earned straight A’s all throughout school, was the top of his class, had great extracurricular activities, and was on track to get accepted into an amazing university. However, despite his intelligence and academic success, he was not a good test taker. After copious amounts of studying and multiple attempts, he still only got an average score on the SAT. His scores significantly hurt his chances of getting into prestigious universities and he ended up getting denied from his dream school. Students should not be denied from colleges simply because they do not test well as this is of little importance in the real world if the student is intelligent.
Aside from those that argue that standardized testing is effective, there are also supporters who believe that it is a flawed system, but it is necessary for it to remain in use because there are no good alternatives and its benefits are important in the education system. This is not a valid argument because there are surely better options for evaluating the intelligence of students. A great example of an effective alternative is the education system of Finland. The unique thing about the system is that there are no standardized tests or ranking of students. Instead, teachers are simply instructed to prepare students for life as effectively as possible. While it may come as a surprise to some, the fact is that this system is extremely effective, as “Ninety-three percent of Finns graduate from academic or vocational high schools, 17.5 percentage points higher than the United States, and 66 percent go on to higher education, the highest rate in the European Union” (Hancock 2). This proves that quality alternatives to standardized testing can be created that can evaluate students more effectively than the current tests.
In conclusion, standardized testing has a predominantly negative impact on the education of our youth. It is an outdated system that evaluates test-taking skills rather than intelligence and is unfair to students with disabilities or difficulty with test taking. It causes many problems with teachers changing the curriculum to prepare for tests as well as with putting too much stress on students due to its superfluous influence on college admissions. Although supporters of the tests make some valid claims, the benefits are outweighed by the problems and it is clear that standardized testing is a negative influence on the education system and therefore is not the ideal method of student evaluation.

Like many issues in public education, standardized testing can be a controversial topic among parents, teachers, and voters. Many people say standardized testing provides an accurate measurement of student performance and teacher effectiveness. Others say such a one-size-fits-all approach to assessing academic achievement can be inflexible or even biased. Regardless of the diversity of opinion, there are some common arguments for and against standardized testing in the classroom .
Standardized Testing Pros
Proponents of standardized testing say that it is the best means of comparing data from a diverse population, allowing educators to digest large amounts of information quickly. They argue that:
It's accountable. Probably the greatest benefit of standardized testing is that educators and schools are responsible for teaching students what they are required to know for these standardized tests. This is mostly because these scores become public record, and teachers and schools that don’t perform up to par can come under intense examination. This scrutiny can lead to the loss of jobs. In some cases, a school can be closed or taken over by the state.
It's analytical. Without standardized testing, this comparison would not be possible. Public school students in Texas, for example, are required to take standardized tests, allowing test data from Amarillo to be compared to scores in Dallas. Being able to accurately analyze data is a primary reason that many states have adopted the Common Core state standards .
It's structured. Standardized testing is accompanied by a set of established standards or an instructional framework to guide classroom learning and test preparation. This incremental approach creates benchmarks to measure student progress over time.
It's objective. Standardized tests are often scored by computers or by people who do not directly know the student to remove the chance that bias would affect the scoring. Tests are also developed by experts, and each question undergoes an intense process to ensure its validity—that it properly assesses the content—and its reliability, which means that the question tests consistently over time.
It's granular. The data generated by testing can be organized according to established criteria or factors, such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and special needs. This approach provides schools with data to develop targeted programs and services for improving student performance.
Standardized Testing Cons
Opponents of standardized testing say educators have become too fixated on scores and preparing for these exams. Some of the most common arguments against testing are:
It's inflexible. Some students may excel in the classroom yet not perform well on a standardized test because they're unfamiliar with the format or develop test anxiety. Family strife, mental and physical health issues, and language barriers can all affect a student's test score. But standardized tests don't allow personal factors to be taken into consideration.
It's a waste of time. Standardized testing causes many teachers to teach to the tests, meaning they only spend instructional time on material that will appear on the test. Opponents say this practice lacks creativity and can hinder a student’s overall learning potential.
It can't measure true progress. Standardized testing only evaluates one-time performance instead of a student's progress and proficiency over time. Many would argue that teacher and student performance should be evaluated for growth over the course of the year instead of one single test.
It's stressful. Teachers and students alike feel test stress. For educators, poor student performance may result in a loss of funding and teachers being fired. For students, a bad test score may mean missing out on admission to the college of their choice or even being held back. In Oklahoma, for example, high school students must pass four standardized tests in order to graduate, regardless of their GPA. (The state gives seven standardized end-of-instruction (EOI) exams in Algebra I, Algebra II, English II, English III, Biology I, geometry and U.S. history. Students who fail to pass at least four of these exams can’t get a high school diploma.)
It's political. With public and charter schools both competing for the same public funds, politicians and educators have come to rely even more on standardized test scores. Some opponents of testing argue that low-performing schools are unfairly targeted by politicians who use academic performance as an excuse to further their own agendas.

The Standardized Testing Debate
Instructor: Derek Hughes
Derek has a Masters of Science degree in Teaching, Learning & Curriculum.
A contentious debate has arisen around the increased use of standardized tests to gauge student achievement and teacher effectiveness. This lesson will give a brief overview of both sides of this debate.
Standardized Testing Defined
With the introduction of 'No Child Left Behind' in 2001, standardized tests have become more prevalent and important in the classroom. Standardized tests are exams that are written, administered, and scored in the same way in every school and classroom. These tests are used in the classroom to measure student achievement and judge teacher effectiveness.
However, not all is rosy in the world of standardized testing. A contentious debate has arisen about the use of these tests, their effectiveness, and the unintended negative effects they have on education. This lesson will detail some of the broad arguments of both sides of the debate.

Proponents of Standardized Testing
Mrs. Jones is always happiest when the time comes to do the yearly round of standardized testing in her classroom. She is a firm supporter of the efficacy of these tests and will gladly debate anyone who opposes the tests. Like the many proponents of standardized testing, Mrs. Jones believes the tests are very good at several things.
First, she believes that these tests are excellent at objectively measuring student achievement. Experts, who don't know any of the students personally, write these tests. Therefore, she can be sure that they are evaluating student knowledge objectively. The results of the tests help Mrs. Jones see quantitatively what her students have learned.
Mrs. Jones believes that the results of the test can also show her how effective her instruction is. The tests are meant to test students on the skills and information they should have learned throughout the year. Mrs. Jones feels that if her students do well on the tests, her teaching has been effective. If students do poorly, especially in a particular area, Mrs. Jones is able to go back and reflect on what she could have done differently or better.
Mrs. Jones also thinks that it is helpful that the accountability that the tests provide extends beyond the classroom. Not only do the tests help her see whether or not her teaching was effective, they can help whole schools remain accountable for student achievement. In fact, if schools don't achieve at a certain level, there is a chance they could be restructured or taken over.
Finally, Mrs. Jones and other proponents of standardized testing feel that the tests are a good tool for comparing student achievement across the country. Because the tests are standardized and the same for every single student, you can easily compare a student's achievement from New York City with another student's from San Diego. Mrs. Jones feels that this is a good way to help improve achievement across the whole country.
Opponents of Standardized Testing
Mr. Jones, husband of Mrs. Jones and an elementary school teacher, is on the opposite side of the debate than his wife. He believes that, while the tests were meant initially to be useful tools for measuring and improving student achievement, the disadvantages of standardized tests outweigh the benefits.
The weeks leading up to standardized testing time is filled with heated debates in the Jones household. While Mrs. Jones believes that the tests are useful tools for objectively measuring student achievement, her husband is more skeptical. He argues that the tests only measure achievement at one point in time and don't take into account any external influences on the students.
For example, Mr. Jones says, one student may have slept poorly the night before the test. Though this student is the model learner, she may score lower on the test because she was tired or not feeling well. How can a test objectively measure achievement if something as small as a poor night's sleep can skew the results?
Mrs. Jones argues that she likes the tests because they help her see how effective her instruction is. Her husband doesn't quite agree. He feels that the tests have fundamentally changed teaching from focusing on critical thinking in reading, math, science, and social studies to focusing on just the skills necessary to help students do well on the standardized tests.
In this way, Mr. Jones feels that the increased use of standardized tests has led many schools and teachers to change their curriculum to 'teach to the test'. He believes that 'teaching to the test' is hurting the education system because students aren't given the opportunity to explore subject areas that won't appear on the test.

Alright, so I've read through these articles, and there are some strong points on both sides of the debate. Let's try to summarize the main arguments for and against standardized testing.

Starting with the pros:

1. **Accountability:** Standardized tests hold teachers and schools accountable for student performance. If students aren't performing well, it reflects poorly on the educators, which can lead to improvements in teaching methods or even job losses. This pressure can motivate teachers to perform better.

2. **Comparability:** These tests allow for easy comparison of student performance across different regions and schools. This is because the tests are standardized, meaning they're the same everywhere. So, a score from a school in Texas can be directly compared to one from a school in New York.

3. **Objectivity:** The tests are scored objectively, usually by computers or evaluators who don't know the students. This reduces the chance of bias influencing the scores.

4. **Identifying Gaps:** Standardized tests can help identify gaps in student knowledge or areas where certain groups of students are struggling. This can lead to targeted interventions or changes in curriculum to address those issues.

Now, moving on to the cons:

1. **Teaching to the Test:** One of the biggest criticisms is that teachers spend too much time preparing students for the tests, sometimes at the expense of a broader, more enriching education. This "teaching to the test" can make the curriculum feel narrow and uninspiring.

2. **Stress and Anxiety:** Both students and teachers feel a lot of stress around these tests. For students, poor performance can affect their future educational opportunities. For teachers, it can lead to job insecurity or loss.

3. **Limited Scope:** Standardized tests often focus narrowly on subjects like math and reading, ignoring other important areas like arts, physical education, and social-emotional learning.

4. **Unfairness:** Some argue that these tests aren't fair to all students. Factors like socioeconomic status, language barriers, and individual learning differences can affect test performance, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments of a student's true abilities.

5. **Overemphasis on Scores:** There's a risk that schools and educators become too focused on test scores, losing sight of the bigger picture of education, which should be about fostering well-rounded individuals.

Looking back at the articles, one of them mentioned the example of Finland's education system, which doesn't use standardized testing and still manages to have high graduation rates and a high percentage of students going on to higher education. That seems like a compelling counterpoint to the idea that standardized tests are necessary for a successful education system.

Also, the TED Talk by Bob Sternberg highlights how standardized tests are outdated and don't measure the kinds of skills that are important in today's world, such as creativity and practical skills. This suggests that even if standardized tests were good at measuring what they were designed to measure, they might not be measuring what's truly important for success in the 21st century.

On the other hand, supporters argue that standardized tests provide an objective way to measure student achievement and teacher effectiveness. They also point out that without such tests, it would be difficult to compare schools and hold them accountable for their performance.

But I'm starting to think that maybe there are better ways to assess student learning and teacher performance that don't rely so heavily on standardized tests. For example, portfolios of student work, project-based assessments, and teacher evaluations that consider multiple factors, not just test scores.

Moreover, the reliance on standardized tests can lead to a narrowing of the curriculum, as teachers focus primarily on testable subjects and ignore others. This might not be in the best interests of the students' overall development.

Another point to consider is that standardized tests can perpetuate inequalities. Students from wealthier backgrounds may have more access to test-prep resources, giving them an advantage over their less privileged peers. This can reinforce existing social disparities rather than helping to mitigate them.

In the context of college admissions, while standardized tests like the SAT and ACT are intended to provide a common measure for comparing applicants, there's growing recognition that they may not be the best predictors of college success. Many colleges are now test-optional, recognizing that GPA, extracurricular activities, and other factors can be more indicative of a student's potential.

So, overall, while standardized tests have some benefits, such as providing a comparable measure of student achievement and holding schools accountable, their drawbacks—like teaching to the test, stress on students and teachers, and potential biases—may outweigh these advantages. It might be time to explore alternative assessment methods that can provide a more comprehensive and equitable evaluation of student learning and teacher effectiveness.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Standardized tests have both advantages and disadvantages in education. While they offer objectivity and comparability, they can lead to teaching to the test, increased stress, and may not accurately reflect a student's true abilities or potential. Alternative assessment methods should be considered to create a more balanced and effective evaluation system.}} \]
