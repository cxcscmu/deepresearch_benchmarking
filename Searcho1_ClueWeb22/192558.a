I'm trying to understand why people voted to leave the EU. It's a complex issue with many factors at play. I need to consider both the political and social aspects that might have influenced their decision.

First, I should probably look into what the EU is and what benefits or drawbacks it might have for member countries. Maybe some people felt that being part of the EU wasn't beneficial for their country anymore.

Let me think about the economy. The EU is an economic union, so trade and financial policies are shared among member states. Perhaps some voters thought that leaving the EU would allow their country more control over its economy and finances.

Another aspect could be immigration. The EU has open borders, meaning that citizens from one member country can move to another freely. This might have led to concerns about immigration and job security for some people.

I also recall hearing about sovereignty issues. Some voters might have felt that being part of the EU meant giving up too much control to Brussels, the de facto capital of the EU, and they wanted their country to make its own decisions without interference from EU regulations.

Maybe there were also nationalist sentiments at play. People wanting to reclaim their national identity and reduce influence from other countries.

It's also possible that the way the EU handles certain issues, like the refugee crisis or Brexit itself, contributed to public dissatisfaction.

I should probably look for some statistics or polls to see what the main reasons were for people voting to leave the EU. Maybe there were specific issues that resonated more with certain groups of voters.

Let me try to structure this better. I'll list potential reasons why people might vote to leave the EU:

1. Economic concerns: Belief that leaving the EU would improve the economy.

2. Immigration: Concerns about unrestricted immigration from other EU countries.

3. Sovereignty: Desire for the country to have full control over its laws and policies.

4. Bureaucracy: Dissatisfaction with EU bureaucracy and regulations.

5. National identity: Desire to assert national independence and sovereignty.

6. Specific political issues: Disagreement with how the EU handles certain crises or policies.

Now, I need to find evidence or data that supports these points. Perhaps looking at exit poll data from referendums or surveys conducted among voters.

I should also consider the political rhetoric leading up to the vote. What arguments did the leave campaigns use to persuade voters? Those arguments likely resonated with certain segments of the population.

Additionally, it's important to note that different countries may have different reasons for voting to leave the EU. For example, Brexit in the UK might have had different underlying reasons compared to, say, Greece's potential exit, often referred to as "Grexit."

Wait, actually, Greece remained in the EU, but there were discussions about leaving due to economic crises. So perhaps focusing on Brexit would be more appropriate since it's a concrete example of a country choosing to leave the EU.

Let me narrow it down to the UK's decision to leave the EU, also known as Brexit.

First, I need to understand the context leading up to the referendum in 2016. What were the main issues that were being debated?

I remember that immigration was a big topic. The UK had seen an increase in immigrants from other EU countries, particularly Eastern Europe, and some people were concerned about the impact on jobs and public services.

There were also concerns about sovereignty. The UK has a long history of independent decision-making, and some Britons felt that being part of the EU meant giving up too much control to EU institutions.

Moreover, there was criticism of EU bureaucracy and regulations, with some arguing that they were burdensome and unnecessary.

Economic arguments were also prevalent. Some believed that leaving the EU would allow the UK to negotiate its own trade deals and have more control over its economy.

On the other side, there were those who argued that staying in the EU was beneficial for the economy and that leaving would have negative consequences.

It's interesting to note that during the referendum campaign, both sides made various claims, some of which may have been exaggerated or misinformed.

To get a better understanding, I should look at some data from the referendum and any post-referendum studies that analyzed voter motivations.

Perhaps looking at exit polls from the 2016 Brexit referendum would provide some insights.

Let me consider performing a search to find more specific information.

Share of people who think Brexit was the right or wrong decision 2020-2022
Published by Statista Research Department , Apr 8, 2022
As of March 2022, 49 percent of people in Great Britain thought that it was wrong to leave the European Union, compared with 39 percent who thought it was the right decision. During this time period, the share of people who regret Brexit has been slightly higher than those who support it, except for some polls in Spring 2021, which showed higher levels of support for Brexit. The share of people who don’t know whether Brexit was the right or wrong decision has generally been consistent and usually ranged between 11 and 13 percent.
Brexit boost wanes in late 2021
The surge in support for Brexit that occurred in Spring 2021 may have been related to the United Kingdom’s fast rollout of vaccinations for COVID-19. Compared to other major European countries, the UK had managed to vaccinate a far higher share of its population by Spring 2021, although other countries did catch up in the summer. The relatively fast procurement process of the UK was contrasted with a more cautious bureaucratic EU, supporting some of the key sentiments that drove the Brexit vote. Since that point, the fall in support in support of Brexit mirrors the government’s sinking approval ratings, especially since the Prime Minister Boris Johnson is heavily associated with Brexit and the Leave vote.
Leave victory in 2016 defied the polls
In the actual referendum, which took place on June 23, 2016, Leave won 51.9 percent of the votes and Remain 48.1 percent, after several polls in the run-up to the referendum put Remain slightly ahead. Remain was anticipated to win until early results from North East England showed that Leave had performed far better than expected, with this pattern replicated throughout the country. This event was repeated somewhat in the U.S. election of that year which saw Donald Trump win several key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, despite predictions that these states would vote for Hilary Clinton.
In hindsight, do you think Britain was right or wrong to vote to leave the European Union? (January 2020 to March 2022)

Exit polls: How accurate are they? - BBC News
Exit polls: How accurate are they?
12 December 2019
Ipsos Mori
Undeterred by bad weather, exit pollsters are stopping voters at designated polling stations across the country
As the polls closed at 22:00 GMT on Thursday night, the UK had its first real indication of the general election result with an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky News.
The survey taken at UK polling stations suggested that the Conservatives would get 368 MPs - 50 more than at the 2017 election - when all the results were counted.
What is the exit poll?
The exit poll is a survey of thousands of voters just after they have cast their ballot. It covers England, Scotland and Wales but not Northern Ireland, where a different set of parties dominate politics.
How does it work?
The exit poll is based on 144 constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales. The constituencies are chosen to be demographically representative of the country, balanced between rural and urban seats, and weighted slightly in favour of marginal areas.
The same constituencies are surveyed from one election to the next, for consistency. But there are a number of exceptions to this rule: if a seat disappears from the electoral map because of boundary changes, for example, or if the seat is held by the Speaker, whose election is traditionally not contested by other parties.
Exit pollsters base themselves at a selected polling station in a chosen constituency. Voters emerging from the polling station are waylaid at regular intervals - every 10th voter, for example - by these fieldworkers, employed by polling specialists Ipsos Mori. They are given a replica ballot paper and asked to fill it in without anyone watching. They then drop the replica paper into a box that will be opened later.
Crucially, they do not have to say out loud how they voted - the idea is this increases the accuracy of the results, says Stephen Fisher, associate professor of political sociology at the University of Oxford.
The results are then analysed by a team of experts at a secret location in London.

Election translator: Key words explained
How accurate is the exit poll?
It has been becoming more accurate as the methodology improves. The rough rule of thumb is an exit poll that comes within 15 seats of the final outcome is considered accurate, Prof Fisher says.
The 2015 exit poll was more accurate than the opinion polls during the campaign but did not predict a Conservative majority.
In 2017, the first take of the exit poll correctly predicted the Conservatives would be the largest party, but stopped short of saying there would be a hung Parliament.
One of the worst misfires was in 1992, when two separate exit polls, for the BBC and ITN, both predicted a hung Parliament. Instead, John Major's Conservative government held its position, albeit with a significantly reduced majority.
The first result from the 2019 exit poll will not cover the last half hour or so of voting. If there's a late rush of voters that could change the result, the exit poll could be updated with a new headline after about 23:00 GMT.
What about postal votes?
They are not included directly but the analysts do consider any evidence the changes among postal voters in the polls are different from those among in-person voters, Prof Fisher says.
How quickly will we know if the exit poll was right?
It may take some time for the full picture to emerge but if there's a strong trend, the first seats to declare, traditionally in the north-east of England, will confirm the exit poll's prediction - or not.
The only way to find out is to be watching on Thursday night.

Brexit votes by nation in the United Kingdom 2016
Published by Statista Research Department , Jun 24, 2016
In the Brexit referendum of 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave by 52 percent to 48 percent, although two of the UK's four countries voted to remain. This was most pronounced in Scotland where 62 percent of Scottish people voted to remain, while in Northern Ireland remain won 56 percent of the votes. The leave vote won in both England and Wales at 53 and 52.5 percent of votes respectively.

Brexit votes in the United Kingdom by age 2016
Published by Statista Research Department , Jun 24, 2016
In the Brexit referendum of 2016, 73 percent of people aged between 18 and 24 voted to remain in the European Union, compared with just 40 percent of people aged over 65. In fact, the propensity to vote leave increases with age, with the three oldest age groups here voting leave and the three youngest voting to remain.

Alright, so I've got some information here from the search results. Let's see what I can make of it.

First, there's a document from Statista about Brexit opinion polls from 2020 to 2022. It shows that around 49% of people in Great Britain thought it was wrong to leave the EU, while 39% thought it was the right decision. This suggests that even after the Brexit vote in 2016, a significant portion of the population regretted the decision to leave the EU.

Another document is from the BBC, discussing the accuracy of exit polls in general elections. It explains how exit polls work and mentions that they have become more accurate over time. However, it also notes that in the 2017 general election, the exit poll correctly predicted that the Conservatives would be the largest party but didn't predict a hung parliament. This might indicate that exit polls can sometimes miss certain nuances in voter behavior.

The third document is another Statista report on Brexit votes by nation in the UK in 2016. It shows that Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, while England and Wales voted to leave. This highlights the regional differences in voting preferences during the Brexit referendum.

The fourth document is from The Independent and is a collection of articles related to exit polls, mostly focusing on general elections rather than the Brexit referendum. It doesn't provide direct information on why people voted to leave the EU, but it does give some context on how exit polls work and their reliability in predicting election outcomes.

The fifth document is another Statista report detailing Brexit votes by age in 2016. It shows that younger age groups were more likely to vote remain, while older age groups were more likely to vote leave. For example, 73% of 18-24-year-olds voted to remain, whereas 60% of those aged 65 and over voted to leave.

From these documents, I can gather that there's ongoing debate and differing opinions about Brexit even years after the initial vote. There are regional and generational divides in voting preferences, with younger people and certain regions like Scotland and Northern Ireland favoring remaining in the EU, while older people and England and Wales favored leaving.

But to understand why people voted to leave the EU, I need to dig deeper. Maybe I should look for surveys or studies that explore the motivations behind the leave vote.

Let me consider performing another search to find more specific information on the reasons people voted to leave the EU.

Abstract
The outcome of the 2016 UK EU membership referendum was rather shocking as many polls preceding the referendum pointed towards a majority for the continued participation of the UK in the EU. In this research report we try to understand the underlying reasons which may have led a majority of Britons to vote to leave in 2016. Overall, the factors that may have played some role in the UK’s decision are rather complex and broad ranging. While migration fears were repeatedly cited as a key factor, official migration data don’t adequately explain the intensity of opinions this issue attracted in the UK. That said, job growth for EU nationals has remained positive for over a decade despite significant job losses for UK nationals during the Great Recession. The most recent employment and wage data show that increases in jobs for UK nationals have coincided with the fastest pay growth seen in over a decade at a time when the pace of jobs growth for EU nationals has fallen back. (False) perceptions and an exaggerated fear of migration in the context of the European refugee crisis, seem to have played a major role in the UK voters’ general stance towards migration. Demographic and socioeconomic factors were important as well. The breakdown of those who voted Leave in the EU membership referendum shows that the Leave voters tend to be older, have a lower educational attainment and live in poorer and underserved communities.

1. Introduction
Brexit continues to throw up surprises in terms of the United Kingdom’s ability (or rather, inability) to complete the European Union (EU) withdrawal agreement. In many respects, this is a continuation of a sequence of surprises and unexpected developments following the shocking outcome of the 2016 UK EU membership referendum. Many polls preceding the referendum pointed towards a majority for the continued participation of the UK in the EU. From a purely macroeconomic point of view, as a wide range of studies from the IMF and the UK Treasury have suggested, the loss of welfare gains that EU integration provides to British society would be very hard to compensate for in case of Brexit. However, it has become clear that reasons behind voting behaviour often extend past conventional macroeconomic metrics and give more weight to other broader socioeconomic considerations than standard economic analysis might imply.
While it is still not entirely clear exactly how, when or even if the UK will leave the EU, it is important to try to understand the underlying reasons which may have led a majority of Britons to vote to leave, both in terms of what they might suggest for the UK’s future relationship with the EU and as an indication of what the outcome of a second referendum might be if it were to be organised. Moreover and more generally, the underlying reasons for the UK referendum outcome could help to understand what sort of forces may act against further European integration and could even threaten an unravelling of the EU project. A clearer picture of the economic, social and political circumstances which led to a Leave campaign victory may help predict if there will be further serious secessionist movements in Europe and could suggest pathways to avoid increased divisions. A deeper understanding of why a majority of Britons believed a divorce from the EU would yield more benefits than disadvantages may also tell us whether the forthcoming Brexit deal will ameliorate the grievances given by those who voted Leave.
2. Voting results of the EU membership referendum
The UK referendum on EU membership in June 2016 resulted in a 51.9% share for the Leave side against a 48.1% share for Remain. However, these aggregate figures hide large differences in voting patterns across geographical areas, between age groups and between groups with different backgrounds and educational levels.
2.1 Geographical differences
Differences in voting patterns across regions within the UK were large. London voters, for example, chose overwhelmingly to remain within the EU - almost 72% in Inner London. On the other hand, more than 65% of voters in Lincolnshire, an area dominated by agriculture, wanted the UK to leave the EU. In terms of national voting, England had the largest margin of victory for Leave, with those voting to leave coming to 53% versus Remain’s vote share of 47% (figure 1). Wales also had a majority of Leave voters, however its population is much smaller compared to England. Northern Ireland and Scotland, in contrast, had large Remain majorities. The decision to leave the EU was, hence, made in the regions of England outside of London. Except for four regions (e.g. Sussex), Leave won in every English district outside London (24 out of 28, with an average majority of 56.29% for Leave).
Some of these regional voting patterns were not very surprising. Northern Ireland’s proximity and close social and economic relationship with the Republic of Ireland, which will remain a member of the EU after Brexit, meant that the fallout of Brexit would be harmful in nearly all aspects. Past actions taken by Scotland to have more independence from the UK, as evidenced by the devolved Scottish Parliament established in 1999 and the 2014 Scottish independence referendum (which failed, but still signalled growing popularity in Scottish independence), also made a Remain majority in that region most likely. Other regional referendum outcomes had a less obvious underlying reason, which we will discuss later in the report.

2.2 Demographic evidence
Older voters
In general, post-referendum polls found that older voters were more likely to have voted Leave, while younger voters were more likely to have voted Remain. Based on data from the Lord Ashcroft Poll taken on June 23rd after voters had cast their vote, nearly three-quarters of 18 to 24 year-olds voted Remain, with this figure dropping to around two-thirds for those in the 25-34 age group (figure 2). Conversely, a majority of those 45 or older voted to leave, and 60% of those aged 65+ voted Leave. Interestingly, the survey also found that persons with children aged ten or under voted Remain, while persons with children aged 11 or older voted Leave, suggesting those with younger children (who are likely to be of younger age themselves) may be considering their children’s future as well as their own.

The fact that older people are more likely to turnout for elections compared to younger people weighted the referendum results towards Leave as well. For the UK-EU referendum, voter turnout skewed largely in favour of older voters. According to work done by the London School of Economics and Opinium, 90% of those over 65 turned out to vote. This is much higher than the turnout of 64% for 18-24 year-olds, 65% for 25-39 year-olds, 66% for 40-54 year-olds and 74% for the 55-64 bracket.
To compound matters, those aged 65 or older make up nearly a quarter of the population, while those aged 55 or older account for nearly 40% of the population (figure 3). The large proportion of older voters was also augmented by concerns surrounding health care and social security, as older people are the biggest recipients of these benefits. This likely motivated them to turnout for the UK EU referendum. For example, one of the main promises that the Leave campaign made was that voting to leave the EU would allow for increased spending on the NHS of £350mn a week. Despite the fact this figure was a misleading one that used a gross contribution figure rather than a net figure (i.e. after the UK rebate is deducted), these claims were widely believed by older Leave voters.
Remainers have often claimed that older people voted nostalgically, rather than logically, for a Britain prior to 1973; one that existed before the UK joined the European Economic Community (EEC). However, analysis by Campos and Coricelli (2015) posited that, among other political reasons, the UK joined the EEC as a way to avoid its economic decline. The authors found that UK’s per capita GDP relative to the EU founding members’ declined steadily from 1945 to 1972, but from 1973 onwards it has remained relatively stable.

Lower educational attainment and working class voters
Drawing again from Lord Ashcroft Polls data, a majority of those with a university degree (57%) and a higher degree (64%) voted to Remain, along with 81% of persons currently enrolled in full time education. Conversely, a majority of those whose formal education ended at secondary school or earlier, voted to Leave. YouGov polling found similar figures, with its data stating that 68% of voters with a university degree wanted to remain in the EU, while 70% of voters with only a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) or lower voted to leave (figure 4). The BBC also reported that of the 30 areas with the fewest graduates in the UK, 28 backed Brexit, while 29 out of the 30 areas with the most graduates voted Remain.
In terms of socioeconomic class, which is correlated with educational attainment, polling data show that the AB social group (e.g. the upper middle and middle class, comprised of managerial, administrative or professional workers) were the only social group among whom a majority voted to Remain (57%), while nearly two thirds of C2DEs (64%), which contains skilled and unskilled manual workers, pensioners and the unemployed, voted to Leave. YouGov survey results give similar breakdowns.

Voters in underserved communities
Economists at the University of Warwick produced a comprehensive analysis on who voted for Brexit at the district level and consider a range of socioeconomic factors. Becker et al (2017) found that the share of the population in rented council housing, which the authors use as a measure of those potentially under increased pressure from migration of largely low-skilled Eastern European migrants, has a strong positive correlation with the Leave share of votes.
They also found that local authorities experiencing more fiscal cuts were more likely to vote in favour of leaving the EU. The paper used the share of the workforce in public employment as a measure of availability of public services and found that where this share is lower, the Leave vote share is higher. The paper also used cancer patients’ waiting times as a proxy for the responsiveness of the public health system. The researchers found that in regions where the share of suspected cancer patients waiting for treatment for more than 62 days is larger, the Leave vote share is larger. Overall, this research suggests that communities that were underserved in terms of access to public services were more likely to vote Leave.
The link between a range of socioeconomic factors and the propensity to vote leave in the referendum can also be related to some longer-term structural changes in the UK economy. The share of Leave voters was strongest in some of the regions that prospered during the industrial revolution and afterwards weakened again due to de-industrialisation and globalisation such as Lincolnshire and Yorkshire (figure 5). The regions voting Remain have generally prospered in recent decades. The swift expansion of the services sector, and in particular financial and IT services, has supported their economic ascendance. The de-industrialisation trend and the move towards a service economy together with the increased power of capital via deregulations have benefitted some regions, while others lagged behind. This is reflected in the clear negative correlation between the share of Leave voters and income per inhabitant.

White and English identity voters
As with many of the populist movements over the last several years, identity, particularly white identity, seems to have played a role. Lord Ashcroft Polls show that white voters voted to leave the EU by 53% to 47%, while 67% of those describing themselves as Asian and 73% of black voters voted to remain.
3. Survey results: people’s motivation behind their vote
In the period leading up to the Brexit referendum, a wide range of polls asked voters why they were planning to vote for either Remain or Leave. The findings of these polls reached roughly the same results. In the Leave camp, several surveys point to immigration - and its impact on jobs and pay levels of UK nationals - and UK sovereignty as main factors that motivated people’s ‘Leave’ vote (table 1). In a study by the Centre for Social Investigation (2018), more than 70% of survey responders that voted Leave, stated that ‘I wanted the UK to regain control over EU migration’ was the most or second most important reason for their referendum choice. Besides migration, health care and social security, were also issues that were mentioned by voters as important factors that influenced their vote.
Remain voters, on the other hand, were mainly concerned about the negative impact of Brexit on the UK economy and about the uncertainty and potential instability it could cause. Concerns about the UK’s foreign policy position were also stated as supportive for the Remain voters. The large importance of the potential adverse economic consequences of Brexit as an argument to vote for Remain has probably been supported by the multitude of studies and publications on the topic, especially in case of a Brexit without a deal with the EU. Despite all evidence-based research by academic institutions and think thanks, potential economic damage was not a convincing argument for those who voted ‘Leave’ - a fact which remains in place to this day. As an example, a recent YouGov poll asking respondents whether they believe that a no deal Brexit would lead to very high debt in the UK, as was found by a study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The survey found that 56% of respondents aged over 65 - i.e. the same age group that mainly voted Leave in the Brexit referendum - said they didn’t believe a no-deal Brexit would probably lead to this outcome.
Hence, those who voted ‘Leave’, did so despite evidence-based research on the negative impact of leaving on conventional macroeconomic measures of economic performance such as GDP. However, as the paragraphs above illustrate, it might be argued that those voting leave came significantly from groups who already felt marginalised from the fruits of strong economic performance, such as those experiencing less access to public services or further education and this might render potential economic losses from Brexit less important to them. Instead, for these groups, “pure” Brexit arguments centred on ‘taking back control’ lost in the existing UK-EU relationship and highlighted issues such as sovereignty, avoiding EU bureaucracy and stopping UK financial flows towards the EU. These drivers were amplified by a more general sense of displacement and a loss of identity that emphasised considerations such as migration, dissatisfaction with and disconnect from political institutions and the ‘establishment’ These are often related to the context in which the referendum took place. More on the latter in part 4.3.
4. The underlying factors: were fears fact or fiction?
In this section, we evaluate whether the reasons to vote Leave, as put forth by the Leave campaign, are born out by the data.
4.1 Migration
One of the main issues for the EU membership referendum as stated by the Leave campaign was migration and freedom of movement. Freedom of movement for workers is one of four economic freedoms in the European Single Market. It gives EU citizens the right to move and reside freely between member states. Aside from some “asylum seeker” fears (also see part 4.3 on contextual factors), campaigners on the Leave side also believed that reducing inward migration from EU citizens would ease pressure in public services such as schools and hospitals, as well as free up jobs for British workers and allow for higher wages as labour supply decreased. This idea was also readily believed by many Leave voters.
Was the Leave campaign right on migration?
It is worth setting out the context in which migration and ‘taking control of our borders’ emerged as a factor in the referendum. In the mid-2000s, persons from the European Union and largely from the new accession States comprised the majority of new immigrants into the UK. In the years following the Great Recession, the declines in inward migration were due largely to a drop off in this group. Inward migration flows from the newer EU States picked up again in 2013, though over the course of 2013 and 2014 inward migration from all parts of the world increased. Following the result of the UK’s EU membership referendum in 2016, there have been consistent decreases from EU immigrants, but this has been somewhat offset by increased immigration from the rest of the world.
Outward migration data mirror this and show a sizable uptick in EU-27 citizens leaving the UK during the Great Recession, a large proportion of which were EU-27 less EU-15 citizens, and a decrease in outward migration as the economy improved. Overall, net migration over the time period available suggests that EU-27 citizens, particularly those from the newer accession countries, responded flexibly to economic conditions in the UK. Figure 6 shows that there were positive net flows of EU citizens into the country prior to the Great Recession, but this reversed when the economy crashed and only picked up as the UK economy recovered.

Have more jobs for EU citizens meant fewer jobs for UK nationals?
Jobs for EU-27 citizens have increased annually for nearly every quarter since these data were first collected in 2006. This was not the case for UK nationals, who shed jobs quickly during the Great Recession and in 2009 alone saw an average loss of 446k jobs.
In order to assess the impact of the Brexit vote, it is helpful to look at data in the period before and after the EU membership referendum. The most recent annual data show that jobs growth of UK nationals aged 15 and older peaked at an average of about 491k jobs in 2014. Over the three years following that, the UK added on average around 223k jobs for UK nationals per annum. This compares with a peak in jobs growth for EU-27 nationals of about 279k in 2015, with an average increase in jobs for this group of about 167k per annum in the following two years. As shown in figure 7, jobs growth for UK nationals remained strong in 2018, with about an additional 392k jobs. This has slowed somewhat, with the first two quarters of 2019 showing average jobs growth for UK nationals of about 225k. Conversely, over the course of 2018 there was a decrease in EU-27 employment of about 73k, though this has rebounded to an additional 100k jobs on average in the first two quarters of 2019.
While a simple view of these data suggests that voting Leave in 2016 seems to have created more jobs for UK citizens, it is not necessarily the case that this is due to EU workers leaving the UK. Rather it could be due to strong consumption growth, which increased in 2016 at its fastest rate since 2005, but has recently eased over the last year or so likely due to Brexit uncertainty.

Has EU migration impacted UK pay?
Assessing the impact of EU migration on wage growth in the UK is made almost impossible by the absence of a clear counterfactual. We can’t definitively say how wage growth would have developed if there had not been migration. What we can say is that migration flows largely reflect the strength or otherwise of economic conditions in the UK. If there had not been a flexible pool of workers from the EU, it is possible that wages would have risen faster during UK cyclical upturns but it is also possible that they would have fallen further in downturns in the absence of the safety valve of outward migration. In this context, annual growth in average weekly earnings (which is based on whole economy regular pay and excludes the volatile bonus component) stood at 3.7% yoy in 2008 (figure 8) - a year where the increase in employment by EU-27 nationals was nearly twice that of UK nationals. From 2009 to 2014 weekly earnings growth slowed considerably to 1.4%, but incomes began to pick up, with average weekly earnings growing by 2.3% in 2015. This trend has continued and in the second quarter of 2019, average weekly earnings grew by 4.0% yoy - the strongest rate of growth since 2008.
These figures suggest that pay in the UK was growing before the EU membership referendum, and has strengthened further since 2016. Additionally, average weekly earnings posted a more than 10-year high in the second quarter of 2019, which coincides with a pick-up in UK national workers of about 279k and EU-27 national workers of about 99k. These figures muddy the waters in terms of assessing the scale of the impact that EU workers had on wages.

4.2 Income inequality and living conditions
Living conditions are another important factor that likely influenced the way people voted at the referendum. In general, living conditions of the UK population are relatively good. GDP per capita in the UK has grown faster than in comparable EU economies since the European single market began in 1992 (also see the Economic Research Report of 20 March 2019 ). The unemployment rate has been trending down since 2011 and was already around historical lows in June 2016. In terms of poverty, measured by the percentage share of the population aged 18-64y at risk of poverty or social exclusion 1, the UK is below the EU-average and showing a declining trend in recent years after the post-financial crisis rise.
While on average UK living conditions have improved, the gains were not equally spread across society and between geographical regions. Income inequality in the UK is relatively high. As measured by the Gini coefficient, which compares cumulative proportions of the population against cumulative proportions of the income they receive, income distribution in the UK is more unequal than the EU average (figure 9). When ranking all EU countries in an ascending order of income inequality, the UK is ranked 7th highest among countries such as Italy, Romania, Greece and Portugal. Wealth is also unequally distributed in the UK. According to data from the ONS, in the period between July 2014 and June 2016, 43.8% of total wealth was owned by the top 10% of the population. In comparison, the bottom 10% owned only 0.1% of total wealth. While the UK has relatively high income and wealth inequality in comparison to other EU countries, this is not a recent development. Since income inequality data have been collected, the UK has always been less equal when compared to most other EU countries. In the years preceding the referendum, there wasn’t a clear uptrend either.
The government’s policy might have also been a determining factor. The Coalition Government’s Austerity programme that was first implemented in 2010, focused on deficit reduction. Studies from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (2016) have, however, shown that the introduced tax and benefit reforms under the Programme resulted in significant income losses for those of working age in the bottom half of the income distribution. Moreover, cuts to net service spending have tended to be larger in those areas that were initially more reliant on central government grants (IFS, 2015). It’s therefore likely that as a consequence of the austerity measures’ impact, the Leave campaign’s messages struck a more sympathetic note.

4.3 Other contextual factors
It is important to note the general context in which the Brexit referendum took place. The UK population tends to have a rather low level of trust in the European Union as an institution and is in general relatively reluctant towards more centralised EU power compared to the other EU member states. Those feelings, however, are often based on misperceptions and false assumptions. Research done by ‘UK in a Changing Europe’ and Ipsos MORI (2016) in the weeks before the referendum pointed to significant misperceptions about the EU and its impact on life in the UK among the British population. For example, the study shows that the UK population massively overestimated how many EU-born people lived in the UK (EU citizens were estimated to make up 15% of UK population by survey respondents, while this was only 5% in reality). This was even more the case for people who intended to vote Leave. Moreover, a majority overestimated the amount the UK contributes to the EU budget. Meanwhile, the importance of inward investment from EU countries into the UK was underestimated. These research results indicate that there was a lack of accurate information provided to the public at the time of the referendum. However, exaggerations, scaremongering and even false facts during the referendum campaigns, peddled mainly by the Leave Campaign, led to ill-founded decisions.
The high stated importance of migration in the UK voters’ decision was likely also influenced by the challenges the EU was facing at the time of the referendum. In 2016, the European refugee crisis reached its peak with millions of refugees mainly from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan reaching EU shores. However, despite the fact that there wasn’t a spike in asylum applicants in the UK, as seen in Germany and Italy, these events likely played a role in the UK voters’ general stance towards migration.
In the public debate there was likely also an exaggerated fear of migration in general. The Migration Fear Index constructed by Economic Policy Uncertainty illustrates this very well. The index is based on the number of newspaper articles that mention terms related to migration - such as border control, migration, asylum, etc. - and fear - such as anxiety, concern, violent, etc. This index reached peak levels in the period around the UK referendum, not only in the UK, but also in other European countries (figure 10). Since then, it has come down but the index is still at elevated levels compared to historical trends.

5. Conclusion
The factors considered in this report underscore the complex and broad ranging set of influences that may have played some role in the UK’s decision to vote Leave in 2016. While migration fears were repeatedly cited as a key factor, official migration data don’t adequately explain the intensity of opinions this issue attracted in the UK. That said, job growth for EU nationals has remained positive for over a decade despite significant job losses for UK nationals during the Great Recession. The most recent employment and wage data for 2018 and 2019 show that increases in jobs for UK nationals have coincided with the fastest pay growth seen in over a decade at a time when the pace of jobs growth for EU nationals has fallen back.
Perhaps the one area where there is some clear evidence is demographic factors. Referred to as “The Left Behind” by Professors Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford, these Leave voters tend to be “older, white, socially conservative voters in more economically marginal neighbourhoods”. The demographic breakdown of those who voted Leave in the EU membership referendum supports this theory. This trend has been seen not only in the UK, but in the US and across Europe over the last several years. This factor can be summarised by a quote from Inglehart and Norris’s 2016 paper on the economic have-nots and cultural backlash: “Less educated and older citizens, especially white men, who were once the privileged majority culture in Western societies, resent being told that traditional values are ‘politically incorrect’ if they have come to feel that they are being marginalized within their own countries.”

1 At risk of poverty or social exclusion corresponds to the sum of persons who are (Eurostat definition):
- at risk of poverty: an equivalised disposable income (after social transfer) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers
- or severely materially deprived: a state of economic strain and durables, defined as the enforced inability (rather than the choice not to do so) to pay unexpected expenses, afford a one-week annual holiday away from home, a meal involving meat, chicken or fish every second day, the adequate heating of a dwelling, durable goods like a washing machine, colour television, telephone or car, being confronted with payment arrears (mortgage or rent, utility bills, hire purchase instalments or other loan payments)
- or living in a household with a very low work intensity: living in a household where the members of working age worked less than 20 % of their total potential during the previous 12 months.

Comments Share
We’re closing 2016 by republishing our ten most-read articles of the year. Here’s No. 8: Daniel Hannan's piece from June, in which he argues why voting 'Leave' is the right decision
For me, as for so many people, it’s a heart versus head issue. I’m emotionally drawn to Europe. I speak French and Spanish and have lived and worked all over the Continent. I’ve made many friends among the Brussels functionaries. Lots of them, naturally, are committed Euro-federalists. Yet they are also decent neighbours, loyal companions and generous hosts. I feel twinges of unease about disappointing them, especially the anglophiles. But, in the end, the head must rule the heart.
Remainers often tell us to think of our children, and I’m doing precisely that. I am thinking, not just about the EU as it is now, but about the diminished role that a surly, introverted Europe will have in their lifetime. And that makes my decision very easy.
1. ‘We need to co-operate with our neighbours,’ say Remainers, as if someone somewhere were objecting to the idea. Were the EU simply a common market, a regional bloc like Nafta or Asean, no one would have a problem with it. What makes the EU different from every other international association is that it legislates for its members. In any conflict between a parliamentary statute and the ruling of a Brussels institution, the latter takes precedence. This legal supremacy, which was not challenged during the renegotiation, is the basis for the political merger of the member states. The EU has acquired, one by one, the attributes and trappings of nationhood: a president and a foreign minister, citizenship and a passport, treaty-making powers, a criminal justice system, a written constitution, a flag and a national anthem. It is these things that Leavers object to, not the commerce and co-operation that we would continue to enjoy, as every neighbouring country does.
2. The EU is not a free-trade area; it is a customs union. The difference may seem technical, but it goes to the heart of the decision we face. Free-trade areas remove barriers between members and, economists agree, tend to make participants wealthier. Customs unions, by contrast, erect a common tariff wall around their members, who surrender the right to strike individual trade deals. From the start, the EEC prioritised politics over economics and opted for a customs union as the means to a political union.
Fraser Nelson and Nick Cohen discuss The Spectator's decision to back Brexit:
Britain is one of only two of 28 member states that sell more to the rest of the world than to the EU. We have always been especially badly penalised by the EU’s Common External Tariff. Unlike Switzerland, which enjoys free trade with the EU at the same time as striking agreements with China and other growing economies, we must contract out our trade policy to a European commissioner — at present, as it happens, a former sociology lecturer from Sweden.
We have (because the EU has) no trade agreements with China, India or most other Commonwealth countries. EU--Australia talks are being held up by a dispute over Italian tomatoes. Even the EU-Canada deal, which everyone thought was agreed, now risks being vetoed by Romania because of an unrelated row about visas for Romanians wishing to enter Canada. It’s a costly failure. In 2006, the EU was taking 55 per cent of our exports; last year, it was down to 45 per cent. What will it be in 2030 — or 2050?
3. We can hardly accuse Eurocrats of being shy about their plans. The Five Presidents’ Report sets out a plan for the amalgamation of fiscal and economic policies — a process that can only take place among the 28 states as a whole, since there is no legal mechanism for eurozone-only integration. The Belgian commissioner Marianne Thyssen has a plan for what she calls ‘social union’ — i.e. harmonisation of welfare systems. Jean-Claude Juncker wants a European army, which the Commission describes as ‘a strategic necessity’. These are not the musings of outlandish federalist think tanks: they are formal policy statements by the people who run Brussels.
The EU, in short, is responding to the euro and migration crises in the way it responds to everything: with deeper integration. Because Britain kept its currency and its passport checks, we have other options.
4. When Britain joined in 1973, the states that now make up the EU accounted for 36 per cent of the world economy. Last year, it was 17 per cent. Obviously, developing economies grow faster than advanced ones, but the EU has also been comprehensively outperformed by the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It’s not hard to see why: Brussels is more concerned with keeping the euro together as a means to political integration than in the welfare of the poor wretches who have to use it.
Back in the 1970s, western Europe seemed more modern and prosperous than Britain. Does it seem that way now? In an age of Skype and cheap flights, why should we allow accident of geography to trump ties of language and law, custom and kinship? Why tie ourselves to the world’s slowest-growing continent?
5. ‘Ooh, so you want us to be like Switzerland or Norway, do you?’ say Remainers. No: we can get a better deal than either. We are 65 million people to Switzerland’s eight million and Norway’s five million; on the day we left, we’d become the EU’s single biggest export market.
Still, it’s worth noting that Norway and Switzerland come first and second in the Legatum Prosperity Index and that their voters oppose EU membership by, respectively, 79 per cent and 82 per cent. They trade freely with the EU, while being exempt from (in Norway’s case) most or (in Switzerland’s) all its legal acts. They do pay Brussels, but less than we do per capita — far less, in Switzerland’s case. And, as well as the freedom to sign trade deals with overseas markets (they signed one with the Philippines last month, after just ten months of talks), they are self-governing democracies. The fact that they all have their own particular deals with Brussels shows how silly it is to expect us precisely to mimic someone else’s: we’d get our own deal, tailored to our own conditions. And thrive with a trade-based relationship with the EU.
6. A Remain vote will be seen in Brussels as a capitulation. Look at it from the point of view of a Euro-federalist. Britain would have demanded trivial reforms, failed to secure even those, and then voted to stay in on unchanged terms. After decades of growling and snarling, the bulldog would have rolled over and whimpered.
A number of plans have been postponed in Brussels pending our vote: the ban on powerful electrical appliances; licensing rules that will decimate London’s art market; the Ports Services Directive, which was opposed by every commercial port in Britain, every trade union and (for what it’s worth) every British MEP. But that secured a majority anyway, only to be deferred at the last moment until after our referendum.
But that’s just the start. With the possibility of Brexit off the table, there will be a renewed push to integration, on everything from migrant quotas to a higher EU budget.
There are some British voters who are happy with the idea of a federal Europe. Fair enough: if you’re in that category, vote Remain. But don’t imagine that you can cast a qualified Remain vote: your ballot will be taken in Brussels as a mandate for full-on integration. As I say, if you like that idea, fine. But, please, don’t be bullied out of following your conscience. We’re the fifth largest economy in the world, the second disseminator of soft power, one of five permanent seat-holders on the UN Security Council. We export tea to China, naan bread to India, kayaks to the Inuit. We have created more jobs in the past five years than the other 27 states put together. How much bigger do we have to be, for heaven’s sake, before we can prosper under our own laws?
Matthew Parris responds
If you believe that the EU is a vast conspiracy to turn itself into a federal superstate, then you will hear in every passing breeze the whisper of an advancing imperium. I don’t. And I simply don’t share the Leave side’s confidence that there is a world outside waiting to strike trading deals with Britain more generous than they’ve accorded the EU. As for the social union and the new army, all kinds of individuals within the EU have all kinds of hopes and dreams. It is not true that these are ‘formal policy statements by the people who run Brussels’. They are getting nowhere with most of this, and could not anyway force us to join in.
On trade, I’m no economist, but I think the remark ‘the EU’s economy is in relative collapse’ is explained by the remark that ‘the Chinese and Indian economies have doubled in size’. It is true that North America is doing better, but not much. It’s little help going on about New Zealand (a tiny economy) and Australia (whose wealth is hugely dependent on mining). The old (white) Commonwealth has a place in all our hearts, I think, but the head counsels caution. The wealth of Norway and Switzerland may have something to do with (in one case) vast reserves of oil, and, in the other, a borderline-gangster banking system.
As for trading with the world, nobody is stopping us exporting kayaks to the Inuit. Britain’s jobs expansion has been achieved from inside the EU. And as for following our ‘consciences’, please don’t appropriate such language to your own side alone. There are consciences on both sides.

What mattered most to you when deciding how to vote in the EU referendum? By Chris Prosser, Jon Mellon, and Jane Green - The British Election Study
What mattered most to you when deciding how to vote in the EU referendum? By Chris Prosser, Jon Mellon, and Jane Green
The British Election Study Team
11/07/2016
We expect election campaigns to follow the major concerns of voters. We also expect campaigns to focus on those issues considered strongest for each respective side. But what did voters think were the most important things when deciding how to vote in the EU referendum? The stark differences in concerns we show here are guides to the divided nature of the British electorate in terms of what they thought mattered in the referendum, and how they subsequently voted.
Wave 7 of British Election Study Internet panel (conducted prior to the formal campaign period) lets us look into the reasons for people voting in the EU referendum in more detail. We asked an open-ended question to let respondents tell us what mattered to them: “What matters most to you when deciding how to vote in the EU referendum?”. Respondents gave a wide variety of responses. Some typical ones included:
Ability to manage our own affairs
Britain influence and trade in the world
Economic stability
Keeping Europe together and no wars
Open ended data is always tricky to work with because respondents give so many different responses. In wave 7, respondents gave a total of 15,070 unique answers to the question. We show a few different ways of analyzing these unique data in this post, and the insights into the British public that arise.
Word clouds
An easy way to get an initial idea of what respondents are saying is to use word clouds – a visual display of all the text in our respondents answers. These scale the size of the text according to how frequently a word was used. Here we break down the responses into people who, between 14th April and 4th May 2016 (fieldwork dates) said they had decided they would vote leave, vote remain and those who had not yet made up their minds.
The first word cloud shows very clearly that a key concern for leave voters was immigration. The issue dominates the leave voter word cloud and other words like ‘borders’ also feature. Other words that feature prominently concern issues surrounding sovereignty, including the word ‘sovereignty’ itself and ‘control’, and ‘laws’.
Leave voters word cloud
The remain word cloud illustrates clearly that the primary concern of remain voters was the economy, which again dominates the word cloud along with related words like ‘trade’ and ‘jobs’. Other words that feature prominently for remainers are ‘rights’, ‘security’, ‘stability’ and ‘future’.
Remain voters word cloud
These very stark differences display how voters of the respective sides were not just divided in terms of geography and demographic characteristics. They were fundamentally divided in what they considered important and relevant to how they were intending to cast their vote.
In some ways undecided voters were a mix of leave and remain voters – ‘economy’ and ‘immigration’ both feature prominently in the undecided word cloud, along with other words that pop up in the other clouds like ‘future’, ‘security’, ‘rights, and ‘control’. Neither side had an obvious advantage among these respondents if we examine only those issues respondents thought would be important in deciding how to vote. However, something that characterises the responses of the undecided voters is the number of words relating to uncertainty about the effect of Brexit, like ‘facts’, ‘information’ ‘affect’, and ‘impact’.
Undecided voters word cloud
Future analysis will allow us to determine the relevance of these issues in deciding how undecided voters decided how to vote, and indeed whether to vote at all.
Coded responses
We also code the open-ended responses into a series of 54 categories covering the key topics that respondents mentioned. We did this coding using the codething platform that combines machine learning with manual coding. Any coding scheme will not be able to cover every possible answer that respondents can think up. Some of the more difficult responses to code included:
Keeping friends close and enemies even closer
if businessmen say it’s good to stay in it must be bad for everyone else
These unusual examples aside, most responses were able to be coded into a clear category. The following plot shows the main reason given by respondents in their answer, again categorised by their wave 7 pre-referendum vote intention:
These results show that while the single largest word that leavers say is “immigration”, they were actually more likely to mention sovereignty related issues overall. The clear picture we get from this analysis is that leavers are concerned primarily about sovereignty and immigration. In fact reading responses shows that many respondents mention both sovereignty and immigration together, showing that these two issues were closely linked in the minds of British voters.
On the remain side, economic reasons are by far the largest single category, with other respondents split fairly evenly across other categories. These included people who felt European and didn’t want to be “little Englanders”, and people who worried that Britain’s influence in the world would decline.
Overall, our results suggest that the referendum campaign was not a fight about which side had the best argument on the issues: very few people voted leave to improve the economy and very few voted remain to reduce immigration. Instead, the fight was about which of these issues was more important.
Using the EU Most important Issue data
All the data used in this post are available in the wave 7 data release. You can look at the raw text data by using the variable MIIEU_text.  You can look at the 15 category coding using euMIISmall or the larger 54 category version using EUMIICategory.

Would be really useful to have these images available as versions that can be scaled up. Some of the words are hard to read!
John Barker • 5 years ago
It seems even at this stage there is no attempt to differentiate between immigration and migration ? I see this failure to be a massive flaw in the data and the presentation.
Justin Benn • 5 years ago
No attempt on behalf of whom and/or for whom? If this data represents what people actually say, rather than what you want them to say, how can it be a "failure"? At first glance, the premise of your criticism seems faulty.
John Barker • 4 years ago
The most obvious answer to your criticism would be that those preparing the data don't understand the difference, that is the whole point of my comment. Those that use the term immigration when they refer to EU migrants do so because it suits their agenda.
Justin Benn • 4 years ago
If you say so. Or perhaps their point is that those canvassed for views don't sufficiently either understand the difference themselves, nor see any of significance (to them) as it pertains to them or their fellow countrymen and women. Perhaps quiz the authors?

YouGov uncovers the reasons both sides of the EU debate suspect motivated their opponents
Brexit has exposed what may be the defining political divide of the next few decades. The issues surrounding the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union are drastically altering the political landscape. The Remain and Leave camps could well end up being the spiritual parents of Britain’s future political parties or groupings.
Work has already been done to discover what motivated both sides to vote the way they did, most notably by the British Election Study. But given that the two camps are already at war, new YouGov research has now looked at what Leave and Remain voters think motivates their rivals.
Leave voters on Remain voters
One of the key strands of the Remain campaign was the so-called ‘Project Fear’, the Remainers’ attempt to encourage people to stay by highlighting the negative effects that Brexit would have on jobs, the economy and national security.
The extent to which Project Fear influenced the public’s voting decision will never be known, but it is clear that Leave voters believe fear was the main motivation for Remain voters. As many as 43% of Leave voters believe that Remain voters wanted to stay in the EU because of a fear of change and uncertainty – a far greater number than any other factor.
Just 10% of Leave voters said that they thought economic considerations were a key reason why people voted to Remain in the EU. (It is possible that when some Leave voters said “fear” they meant fear of economic consequences – only a few were completely specific that the fear was connected to the economy).
Remain voters on Leave voters
When it comes to Remain voters, they are equally clear on Leave voters’ main voting motivation: immigration. Mirroring the Leave voters’ results, 43% of Remain voters said they thought that immigration was one of the main reasons people voted for Brexit, and again this was overwhelmingly the number one reason given. By contrast, just 8% said that they thought sovereignty ­– taking back control – was a key motivator.
Whilst the two studies use different wording and methodologies and are therefore not directly comparable, it is interesting to see how far the answers given by voters in the British Election Study are at odds with their opponent’s perceptions in our research.
The BES study suggests that Leave voters were relatively evenly split between sovereignty and immigration in their June vote (a Lord Ashcroft poll also suggested sovereignty was the top motivation). Likewise Remain voters suggested in the BES study that they voted to stay on the basis of economic considerations.
(We should, however, warn that experience shows people are not necessarily particularly good judges of their own motivations for doing something, and there is no reason to suggest they are any better at judging other peoples’ motivations).
When two tribes go to war
The survey also reveals the extent of the enmity the two referendum tribes have for one another. About 9% of Remain voters believe that Leave voters are stupid or ignorant – 7% of Leave voters return the favour.
Additionally, 11% of Remain voters think that Leave voters made their decision based on racist or xenophobic intentions, making it their second most commonly suspected voting motivation. Young Remainers are especially likely to consider this to be the case, with 23% giving this answer.
Remain voters are also more likely to question the basis on which their opponents made their decision to vote. About 10% of Remainers thought that Leave voters were misinformed (i.e. that they had bought the Leave campaign’s ‘lies’, or were somehow otherwise wrong in their grasp of the facts). By contrast, just 2% of Leave voters said the same of Remain voters.
On top of this, 6% of Remain voters speculated that Leave voters were poorly informed, and that this was a key factor in their decision to vote for Brexit.

Some Leavers claim the referendum result was not primarily about immigration, but anxiety about Britain’s perceived loss of sovereignty to the EU. In their new book, Harold D. Clarke, Matthew Goodwin (left) and Paul Whiteley draw on data about more than 150,000 voters to analyse the factors and concerns that led people to vote Leave. The mix of calculations, emotions and cues were complex, but immigration – and the personal appeal of Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson to different groups of voters – were key.
Britain is approaching the one-year anniversary of the vote for Brexit. Yet the question of why a majority of people voted to leave the European Union (EU) remains contested. Since nearly 52 per cent of the country opted for Brexit, some have argued that the vote was motivated mainly by concerns over national sovereignty, while others have pointed to an economically ‘left behind’ group of voters, or to intense concerns over immigration. In a new book published this month we contribute to this debate.
The book, Brexit: Why Britain Voted to Leave the EU, draws on twelve years’ worth of data from representative national surveys, conducted each month from April 2004 until June 2016. They probed the backgrounds and concerns of more than 150,000 voters and in June 2016 included a panel design, whereby voters were contacted a few days before the vote and right after. These data provide unprecedented insight into the Brexit vote.

Our starting point is an established literature on what shapes public attitudes toward the EU, which stresses the importance of calculations about perceived costs and benefits of being in the EU, the role of risk, emotion, leaders, and public concerns over domestic and ‘identity-related’ issues, such immigration. In short, our argument is that Brexit was not driven by ‘one factor’. The vote to leave the EU reflected what we refer to as a complex and cross-cutting mix of calculations, emotions and cues. Within this, immigration was key.
By tracking public attitudes toward EU membership over the long-term, we show how the ‘fundamentals’ of the Brexit vote did not suddenly appear in 2016 but were ‘baked in’ long ago. By examining what shaped volatility in these attitudes since 2004, we show how people’s views of the EU were strongly shaped by their assessments of how the main parties had performed on key ‘valence’ issues, but mainly immigration and the economy. If people felt anxious over migration, ‘left behind’ economically, and worried about the control of Brussels, they were significantly more likely to oppose EU membership long before David Cameron even called the referendum.
Then, as Britain trundled toward the 2016 referendum people began to assess the costs and benefits of EU membership. Crucially, a plurality accepted that Brexit would harm the economy, and probably their own finances as well. But most voters also felt that remaining in the EU would increase the risk of terrorism, harm Britain’s cultural life and erode sovereignty, while leaving the EU would mean less immigration. Identity concerns were already trumping economic self-interest. It is likely that Angela Merkel’s decision only a few months before the vote to allow large numbers of refugees into the EU sharpened this concern and entrenched a view that politicians (and the EU) were not in control of an issue that a large section of the electorate cared deeply about. For reasons that we set out in the book, Cameron’s renegotiation with the EU failed to quell these concerns.
It is worth underlining the point that people accepted Brexit was a risk, a belief Cameron and Remainers sought to amplify through their elite-focused campaign. They recognised that many voters were risk averse and carpet-bombed them with dire warnings and prophecies. When asked ahead of the vote to indicate how risky they thought leaving would be (on a scale of 0-10 where ‘0’ is ‘no risk’ and ‘10’ is ‘very risky’), 54 percent of voters assigned scores of six of greater. Playing on this notion of risk was not necessarily a ‘bad’ strategy –believing Brexit was risky was the strongest predictor of whether or not somebody voted to Remain.
But on its own the risk-based strategy was not enough, especially when set alongside the powerful and emotionally resonant case over immigration. Our findings reveal how perceptions of risk were not distributed evenly, which meant Remain were unable to cut through to key groups who would go on to vote for Brexit in large numbers. Our statistical analysis reveals people who felt negatively toward immigration, worried about a loss of control to Brussels, and had been left behind economically were much more likely to minimise the risk of Brexit. These voters felt they had nothing to lose, or were determined to force their identity concerns onto the agenda regardless.
By examining emotions, too, our book points to another problem for Remainers, who spent too much time trying to amplify the problems of Brexit at the expense of making the positive case for EU membership. After worries about the risks of Brexit, the second strongest predictor of the Remain vote were positive feelings about the EU –a driver that was not maximised by Remainers. Might things have been different if Cameron, George Osborne and Barack Obama had consistently made the positive case for Europe?
On June 23 2016 all of these dynamics came together to deliver the vote for Brexit—a choice that reflected a complex mix of calculations, emotions and cues. Immigration was key to the vote for Brexit and ran through this decision. Not only were those who felt negatively about immigration more likely to minimise the risks of Brexit but they were also significantly more likely to turnout, and then vote for Brexit in the polling booth. Immigration exerted powerful direct and indirect effects on the vote. The idea that this issue, which gave Leavers an emotional appeal that Remain’s economic pessimism could not match, was not central is misleading. Indeed, weeks before the balloting we argued that Leavers were more likely to show up at the polls because of this ‘enthusiasm gap’ –and they did.
Though Leavers were divided on how to deal with immigration, our findings also point to the important role of ‘cues’ from leaders, specifically Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. Johnson had a particularly important effect –if you liked Boris then even after controlling for a host of other factors you were significantly more likely to vote for Brexit. Farage was less popular among the professional middle-classes but he was more popular among blue-collar workers and left behind voters, underlining how these rival messengers were able to reach into different groups of voters. When, from June 1 2016, the rival Leave camps all put the pedal down on immigration they were firmly in tune with the core driver of their vote. Neither Cameron nor Corbyn were nearly as effective for Remain. Leader cues were much stronger on the Leave side.
In conclusion, the story of why Britain voted for Brexit is straightforward. Propagated by an unlikely pair of messengers, Leave’s ‘Take Back Control’ message harnessed the emotive power of immigration, amplifying public concerns over identity and a feeling of being left behind that had been baked in long before the vote was called. These immigration fears, hitherto confined to the politically incorrect margins, not abstract concerns about a ‘democratic deficit’ or rescuing UK sovereignty from Brussels bureaucrats, do much to explain why Britain voted for Brexit.

Alright, so I have some more information now. The first document is from KBC Economics, which is a research report trying to understand why the UK voted to leave the EU. It discusses various factors such as migration fears, demographic and socioeconomic factors, and contextual factors like the European refugee crisis.

From this report, I learn that while migration was a key issue cited by Leave voters, the actual migration data doesn't fully explain the intensity of the opinions. The report also mentions that older voters, those with lower educational attainment, and people living in poorer communities were more likely to vote Leave.

The second document is from The Spectator, featuring an article by Daniel Hannan arguing for Brexit. He presents six reasons why he thinks voting Leave is the right decision. His points include the EU being a customs union rather than a free-trade area, the EU's plans for further integration, and the belief that the UK can thrive outside the EU.

This article gives me insight into the Leave campaign's perspective and the arguments they used to persuade voters. It's interesting to see the emphasis on the EU's supranational ambitions and the desire for the UK to have more control over its own affairs.

The third document is from the British Election Study, which analyzed open-ended responses from voters about what mattered most to them when deciding how to vote in the EU referendum. They used word clouds and coded responses to categorize the main concerns of Leave and Remain voters.

According to their analysis, Leave voters were primarily concerned with immigration and sovereignty, while Remain voters were mainly worried about the economy and issues like security and stability. This aligns with what I've read in other sources.

The fourth document is from YouGov, presenting what Leave and Remain voters think motivated their opponents. It shows that Leave voters believe Remain voters were motivated by fear of change and uncertainty, while Remain voters think Leave voters were motivated by immigration concerns.

This is interesting because it highlights the perception gap between the two sides. It suggests that each side may not fully understand or appreciate the motivations of the other.

The fifth document is from the LSE Brexit blog, summarizing findings from a book by Harold D. Clarke, Matthew Goodwin, and Paul Whiteley. They argue that immigration was a key driver of the Brexit vote, and that the Leave campaign effectively harnessed public concerns over immigration and identity.

The authors also mention the role of leaders like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in mobilizing different segments of the electorate. They suggest that the Remain campaign's focus on economic risks wasn't sufficient to counter the emotional appeal of the Leave campaign's messages.

From all these sources, a few key themes emerge:

1. **Migration:** This appears to be a central issue for many Leave voters. There's a perception that the EU's open borders policy led to uncontrolled immigration, putting pressure on public services and jobs.

2. **Sovereignty:** Many Leave voters expressed a desire to "take back control" from the EU, suggesting frustration with the amount of power ceded to EU institutions.

3. **Economic Concerns:** Remain voters were more focused on the economic risks of leaving the EU, such as potential damage to the economy and job losses.

4. **Leadership and Messaging:** The effectiveness of the Leave campaign's messaging, particularly around immigration and national identity, seems to have resonated with a significant portion of the electorate.

5. **Demographic Factors:** Older voters, those with lower educational attainment, and people from economically disadvantaged areas were more likely to vote Leave.

It's important to note that these are general trends, and individual motivations can vary widely. Also, some sources suggest that there may have been misperceptions or misinformation influencing voters' decisions, but that's a separate issue.

Given all this, I can summarize that people voted to leave the EU primarily due to concerns over immigration, a desire for greater national sovereignty, and a belief that the UK would be better off governing itself without EU interference. Additionally, there was a perception that the EU was not effectively addressing issues like immigration, which fueled the Brexit movement.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People voted to leave the EU primarily due to concerns over immigration, a desire for greater national sovereignty, and a belief that the UK would be better off governing itself without EU interference.}} \]
