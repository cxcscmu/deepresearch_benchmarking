Alright, so I need to figure out how online shopping has grown. That's a pretty broad question, but I'll try to break it down. First, I should probably understand what online shopping is. Online shopping is when people buy goods or services over the internet, usually through websites or mobile apps. It's become really popular in recent years, but I'm not sure exactly how much it has grown.

I think the best way to approach this is to look at some key metrics over time. For example, I could look at the total sales volume, the number of online shoppers, or the growth of e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales. Maybe I can find statistics on these things.

Let me start by trying to find out when online shopping really began to take off. I have a vague idea that it started becoming mainstream in the late 1990s with companies like Amazon and eBay. But I need more specific information.

Perhaps I should search for something like "history of online shopping" or "growth of e-commerce over time." That might give me a timeline of how it has developed.

eCommerce sales for 2021 are expected to exceed $4.9trillion USD!
The ability to go online and purchase what we want or need within a minutes is something that the world has become strangely acustom to, and is certainly something that over time will become even more integrated.
Check out these important steps taken to drive the e-commerce world we know today, the ability for instant access has been a long time in the making…
The History of Online Shopping Infographic
1979 – It all began when Michael Aldrich ‘invented’ online shopping.  Using videotex, a two way message service, it revolutionised businesses. We now know this as e-commerce.
1981 – Saw the first business to business transaction by UK based Thomson holidays.
1982 – Mintel, a videotex online service accessible by telephone lines, could be used to make online purchases, train reservations, check stock prices, chat and search a telephone directory. It is considered the most successful pre WWW online service.
1984 – The first ever shopper buys online at a Tesco store.
1985 – Nissan carries out the first online credit check.
1987 – SWREG was founded. This offered businesses a chance to sell products online.  As it is today, SWREG offers many payment options, as well as customization and distribution into international markets.

1989 – In the USA the first online grocery store starts trading.  Peapod.com
1990 – Tim Berners-Lee created the first WWW server and browser.  This started a whole new revolution. Nearly 25 years on, he is today still working hard at guiding the development and spread of the web, using the mantra ‘If it isn’t on the web then it isn’t happening’.
1991 – The internet is commercialised and we saw the birth of e-commerce.

The History of Online Shopping - From the 1960's to the 1990's

The History of Online Shopping – From the 1960’s to the 1990’s
March 16, 2016   | Editorial Team
The wonderland called eCommerce. Today, some countries are busy doing most of their shopping online while others are starting to experiment with their online market. In either case eCommerce is here to stay.
This article won’t shed any light on the future of eCommerce. No! Rather, I will be trying my best to collect in-depth data in order to help you understand how eCommerce has evolved. The journey has been more than just majestic. So what is the history of online shopping?
You might also like to read about the history of Adobe Photoshop, Apple, Web Forms, Google Doodles, or Social Networking.
1960
EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) permits companies to carry out electronic transactions. Although the concept of eCommerce did not touch the daily Internet user till the era of 1990s yet some big players had started to use EDI as early as 1960.
The railroad industry was among the first to understand the importance of EDI and start using the same. Other players in the transportation industry followed.
1979
There is always a hero. Someone who comes out of nowhere and does something unusual. eCommerce has its own hero. Michael Aldrich is the man. It was the year 1979 when Aldrich was on a stroll in a supermarket with his wife.
Suddenly, he was hit by an idea which changed it all for eCommerce. Aldrich connected a domestic TV and a computer with telephone lines so as to start selling groceries online via this model. How they were able to tackle various situations is a different story altogether, but at the end of the day they did come up with a model that helped them launch the business of online shopping.
1981
Have a look at this rare PDF and then read along. It was the year 1981 when Thomson Holidays picked up 66 travel agents from around England and connected them in order to come up with what has been tagged as first B2B (Business to Business) online shopping.
These agents were able to extract data online and understand what was available from the Thomson Brochure so as to serve customers instantly.
1982
This was the year for France to jot down her name in the history books. France based telecom company invented Minitel which has been considered as the most happening pre-WWW online service.
Even during its infant years users had the privilege to make online purchases, check phone directories, chat with each other and various other basic searches just like it happens in today’s Internet.
1984
How would it sound if someone tagged you as the first ever home shopper on this planet. Well, Jane Snowball was tagged as the first ever home shopper when at the age of 72 she became Tesco’s customer.
It was the year 1984 itself when the world’s first B2C (Business-to-Consumer) online shopping system was launched by Tesco. The online shopping system started the concept of Online Shopping Basket which was later renamed Online Shopping Trolley.
Also, it was April 1984 when CompuServe announced Electronic Mall which was almost like the eCommerce of today.
1987
Next up was a Merchant Account launched in the year 1987 that helped software developers sell their software products online. SWREG was the name and it happens to be one of the oldest pieces of software that is still available.
1990
Here we go. The year which marked the launch of the first web browser. The name of the browser was WorldWideWeb which was later renamed to Nexus so as to avoid the obvious confusion. Nexus was also the editor for programmers who coded websites.
During those days Nexus was supposed to be the only medium to access the Internet in graphical format. The amusing part is that the browser was launched for the public by using Internet newsgroups as the medium of communication.
This will help you understand that the communication system (on the Internet) of those days wasn’t as big as it is nowadays.
1991
Back then NSFNET was the backbone of the Internet, but it wasn’t available for commercial use. It was the year 1991 when the NSF (National Science Foundation) cleared the way for the commercial use of NET. This was considered to be a major boost for the eCommerce industry and its future growth.
Statistics state that the traffic on the backbone network of NSF jumped to over 1 trillion bytes per month in the year 1991 itself after it was opened for commercial use. By 1996 there were over 10 million hosts online and the Internet was now a global phenomenon.
It was the year 1991 itself when University of Minnesota launched “gopher”, the first point-and-click based browser that could be used to navigate files on the Internet. At times this has been tagged as the birth of Internet.  Gopher was originally designed to ease campus communication.
“The first Internet application my mom can use.” ~ Mark MaCahil, Team Lead of the computer programming team which launched Gopher.
1992
A book called “Future Shop: How new technologies will change the way we shop and what we buy” was published in the year 1992. The book was considered revolutionary considering the fact that it talked about what will happen in the future of eCommerce and how the Internet will take shape.
“Snider and Ziporyn (the authors of the book) powerfully describe the glass highways of the future, which will not only benefit consumers but will also provide fantastic opportunities for schools, hospitals, businesses, and the average American as we enter the Information Age of the 21st century.” — Conrad Burns, Chair of U.S. Senate Communications Subcommittee
1994
This could be tagged as the “Mother of all Years” for eCommerce as Netscape launched encryption certificate which became the trustworthy means of transmitting data over the Internet.
Certificates gave the browsers a chance to trust a source before displaying its data and sharing personal information. Something that helped the end consumer shower more interest on the Internet and indirectly on eCommerce transactions.
This wasn’t all. The year 1994 also marked the launch of Yahoo! though the domain was registered later in the year 1995. This truly gave the Internet and eCommerce a completely new direction.
1995
It was the year 1995 when NSF started charging a fee for registering domain names.
I wish I was born before so that I could have registered some of the premium single word dot com domains in 1995! At that time the Internet had 12,000 domain names registered and the number jumped to over 2 Million in the next 3 years.
January 18, 1995 was the day when the domain Yahoo.com was registered. The word Yahoo is an acronym for “Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.”
One must understand that by now a lot of other services that would later rule the web had started to appear. Some of these were Amazon, AuctionWeb (which later became eBay) and Verisign etc.
1998
PayPal came into existence in the year 1998. The current PayPal system that we see is actually the merger of X.COM, a financial service company of the late 2000s, and Cofinity which happened to be a payment and cartographic company.
It was the year 1998 only when Google entered the world of eCommerce and Yahoo! launched Yahoo! Stores online.
2000 and Onwards
As they say, what followed after Google is history. Be it the dot com bubble or the Web 2.0, the Internet has experienced exponential growth (with its own pitfalls) that has shaped the lives of many.
As we know it, the Internet continues to grow with major and minor eCommerce companies launching their own set of stores. Today, we can literally buy anything via the Internet. That is the wonderland of eCommerce.

A Brief History of Online Shopping - ODM World
A Brief History of Online Shopping

Short story: Online shopping is the future of shopping which is fast evolving in the present. But online shopping didn’t develop overnight. Certain breakthroughs led to its development; these are the historical frameworks that make online shopping the easiest form of shopping. Read to know more.
Before we dissect the history of online shopping, it’s important to know that the present is only made possible by the past. To fully understand the potential of online shopping in the modern world, we have to go way back in time to the date it emerged and bloomed. What is online shopping anyway; how was it conceived and what led to its present popularity?
What is Online Shopping?
In simple words, online shopping is a unique form of electronic commerce (known as ecommerce) which connects customers and sellers on all corners of the internet with the use of a web browser. Today, it is not uncommon to come across online stores that present a range of products, along with specifications, features, photos and prices to prospective customers.
As a result there are two forms an online shop could take. First is as a B2C store which connects business-to-customers. Second is as a B2B online store which connects business-to-business. Either way, every human with access to the Worldwide Web has engaged in online shopping.
History of Online Shopping
Electronic shopping was invented by an English inventor called Michael Aldrich. In 1979, he invented the earliest form of e-commerce which allowed online transaction processing between business and customers, as well as between business and business.
The invention of the first ever web browser, i.e. the World Wide Web in 1990 is the second major proponent of online shopping. Without an interconnected internet, there would be no online marketplace at all. We owe this marvellous invention called the ‘WWW’ to Tim Berners Lee. That man is the major reason why millions of people have access to the internet which hosts numerous e-commerce platforms.
After the establishment of these two very important platforms, the expansion of online shopping was only imminent. In 1994, Netscape developed an encryption-based internet security protocol called SSL – or Secure Sockets Layer. Just ask any ecommerce owner how important an SSL certificate is for business.
Okay, we’ll break it down here. You see, an SSL makes it difficult or impossible for the exchange of information on the internet to be intercepted. When buying something online, you are required to send sensitive details directly to the online shop. This means that you’re sending private information like credit card details routers to servers. SSL ensures your data isn’t stored by any crooked servers on transmission.
Because of its security, SSL is always required for basically all financial transactions online.
1995 welcomed the biggest transformation of online shopping. The first online marketplaces were established. First came Amazon.com, arguably the biggest online marketplace launched by Jeff Bezos —yup, the richest man in the world as of 2019 with an estimated net worth of $115 billion.
Can’t be a monopoly, so eBay.com joined the party. At the time eBay was called AuctionWeb—good thing they changed the name.
All these online marketplaces with no reliable payment gateway. It is 1998, PayPal gets a full swing at the online payment system niche; quickly becomes a success.
Once a dream, online shopping was now taking shape. Jack Ma, a failure in many things launched a very prominent Chinese marketplace in 1999 called Alibaba.com. You know the one.
At the turn of the 21 st century in 2000, Google launched Adwords, an advertising service that allows sellers to place adverts in Google search results related to viewers’ search preference. In other words, Google connected sellers to buyers on a greater scale.
Another subtle yet huge idea changed the world of online shopping forever. In 2004, Shopify, a prominent online storefront service made it possible for low-capital sellers to set up online stores. Shopify is to online stores as WordPress is to websites.
In 2006, PayPal launched a new way for people to exchange money and buy things they want online directly from their cell phones.
As of 2020, it’s clear to see that the entire internet is now a virtual shopping mall. With people choosing to carry out trades on Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook, it’s safe to say that we are in the online shopping era.
Future of Online Shopping
All well and good but exactly how far can online shopping go? Will it replace the traditional way of shopping at malls? Yes it can. In fact, online shopping has all the precepts to become ‘shopping’ itself.
While in-store retail still enjoys some patronisation, there has been a general shift to ecommerce and all with good reason. The future of ecommerce is now upon us. Eventually, online shopping will replace in-store retail for certain products. In time, shopping will mean ‘online’.
First, credit is due to technological changes that continue to push the online shopping agenda. These technological inventions are blockchain, cryptocurrency, voice search, augmented reality and virtual reality.
Blockchain – Many statistics point to the potential of blockchain simplifying the way payments, transactions and records are handled. Blockchain is the future. Decentralisation, immutability, and transparency are key elements of blockchain; everything online shopping needs to succeed.
Cryptocurrency – A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is created and managed through the use of advanced encryption techniques known as cryptography. Cryptocurrency operates on blockchain technology. For online shopping to be the only marketplace in the world, there should be a common global currency, not competing national currencies.
Voice Search – An extension of AI, voice search automates tasks. Software and devices like Alexa, Google Assistant or Apple’s Siri now makes it easier to participate in ecommerce trade. Never do you have to type the products you need into a search engine. By using voice search, you can get easy access to products on the internet with minimal stress.
Augmented Reality – The biggest problem online shopping faces till today is the distance it puts between the customer and product. Customers are reluctant to buy an item that they cannot experience first-hand. Being a computer enhanced view of the physical world, augmented reality (AR) allows customers to test and explore products online in ways similar to real life experience.
Virtual Reality – Siblings with AR, virtual reality (VR) could also improve online shopping. Because VR is a simulated experience of the real word, similar or different, it allows for the following online shopping possibilities:
The creation of assessable virtual showrooms or virtual stores
Customers will be able to virtually visualise products.
VR can keep the customers coming back.
Conclusion
If you own a physical store somewhere on earth or outer space, it’s about time you considered a transition to online trade. We aren’t very far from a global online shopping space. No longer will people have to queue up in stores to buy a product that may not be in stock. People can now make quality purchases from their comfort zones.
Nothing beats comfort.

The Evolution of E-commerce
The Evolution of E-commerce
Posted by Sarah Wai on Feb 8, 2016 3:47:00 PM
In the days of interweb infancy, the action of purchasing products online was often accompanied by visions of shady characters ready to steal your credit card information. This image, however, has changed in recent years to become a fully accepted part of the buying process for a vast majority of consumers. How did this come to be?
Entering your credit card information online may still trigger an irrational fear in the back of your mind. In spite of this, you may still proceed with an online purchase, trusting the advanced state of online security to ward off identity thieves.
At what point did we transition into acceptance, paving the way for online shopping frenzies like Cyber Monday?
Milestones of E-commerce
To answer this question, it may be pertinent to take a brief look at how E-commerce has evolved over the years and examine the obstacles it had to overcome.
1979- Michael Aldrich is credited with inventing online shopping by connecting a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via a domestic telephone line.
1982- Minitel was introduced in France and was used for online ordering.
1994- Netscape releases the Navigator browser. Pizza Hut offers online ordering on its web page, and the first online bank opens.
1998- PayPal comes into existence.
2002- eBay acquires PayPal for $1.5 billion and changes the scope of online shopping forever.
2003- After eight years, Amazon posts its first yearly profit.
2012- US E-commerce and online retail sales are projected to reach $226 billion (an increase of 12% over 2011).
Fears of E-commerce
So what are some of the main obstacles and deterrents that are blocking the path to a complete acceptance of Ecommerce over all demographics?
Anxiety over online identity theft and credit card fraud.
Not being able to physically see or feel the product before purchase. Some companies have overcome this hurdle through sampling.
The hassle of returning unwanted goods (which many companies are getting better at).
High costs of shipping associated with online purchases.
Addressing the Concerns
Some organizations have addressed the concerns of these remaining obstacles to produce a greater acceptance of Ecommerce:
eBay
Do you like the idea of purchasing something at auction from a complete stranger? Neither does anyone else. eBay became successful due to the backing and protection of its consumers. If your item doesn’t arrive as promised, Ebay has your back!
Pay Pal
Securing information since 1998, Pay Pal has taken the worry out of entering credit card information online. Similar to eBay, it protects consumers by offering refunds and secure servers to keep information safe.
Amazon
Like eBay, Amazon offers free shipping depending on the product and if you exceed a certain purchase limit. This has helped lead the industry in making free shipping a mainstay of online shopping.
These companies above have virtually revolutionized Ecommerce and have allowed us to avoid the craziness of Black Friday shopping by purchasing desired products online in the comfort of our homes. Although having inherent limitations, online shopping is becoming a more and more accepted means of making purchases and will continue to make advances in the consumer landscape in the coming years. That being said, it is important for companies desiring to attain an e-commerce site to understand its history and the fears associated with e-commerce. Understanding these things put you in a position to strategically approach your own buyer personas in a way they will respond positively to.

Alright, so I've got some information from these documents about the history of online shopping. Let's see what they say.

From Doc 1, it seems that online shopping started way back in 1979 when Michael Aldrich invented a way to shop online using a modified TV and a computer connected by telephone lines. That's interesting; I didn't realize it went back that far. Then, in 1981, Thomson Holidays did the first B2B online shopping in the UK. In 1982, France had Minitel, which allowed various online activities including shopping. It looks like online shopping had several early adopters in different parts of the world.

Doc 2 provides a bit more detail on some of these early events. It mentions that in 1979, Michael Aldrich came up with the idea while shopping with his wife and ended up connecting a TV and computer via phone lines to create an online shopping system. In 1981, Thomson Holidays linked travel agents to facilitate B2B online transactions. In 1982, Minitel in France offered a range of online services including shopping, which was considered the most successful pre-Web online service.

Doc 3 gives a timeline starting from 1969 when CompuServe was established, followed by Aldrich's invention in 1979. It then mentions the launch of the first eCommerce platforms in 1982 by Boston Computer Exchange. In 1992, Book Stacks Unlimited was launched as one of the first online bookstores. The document then lists key milestones like the launch of Netscape Navigator in 1994, Amazon and eBay in 1995, PayPal in 1998, and Alibaba in 1999. It also notes the introduction of Google AdWords in 2000, Amazon Prime in 2005, and various other developments up to 2017.

Doc 4 talks about Aldrich's invention in 1979 and the development of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 as foundational elements for online shopping. It emphasizes the importance of SSL encryption developed by Netscape in 1994 for securing online transactions. The document then highlights the launch of Amazon and eBay in 1995, PayPal in 1998, Alibaba in 1999, and Shopify in 2004 as pivotal moments in the evolution of online shopping. It concludes by suggesting that online shopping is the future and that it's already transforming the way people shop.

Doc 5 provides another timeline starting from Aldrich's invention in 1979, Minitel in 1982, Netscape Navigator in 1994, PayPal in 1998, eBay's acquisition of PayPal in 2002, Amazon's first profitable year in 2003, and projections for US online retail sales in 2012. It also discusses the main concerns that have hindered the acceptance of e-commerce, such as identity theft, inability to see or feel products before purchase, difficulties in returning items, and high shipping costs. The document mentions how companies like eBay, PayPal, and Amazon have addressed these issues to build trust and make online shopping more acceptable.

So, from these documents, it's clear that online shopping has a history dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, with significant advancements and milestones in the 1990s and beyond. The development of key technologies like the Web, SSL encryption, and secure payment systems like PayPal were crucial in making online shopping safe and trustworthy for consumers. Major players like Amazon and eBay played a significant role in popularizing online shopping, and the continued evolution of e-commerce shows no signs of slowing down.

But the question is about how online shopping has grown, not just its history. I need to find data or trends that show the growth over time. Maybe I should look for statistics on online sales, number of online shoppers, or market share of e-commerce compared to traditional retail.

Let me consider searching for something like "growth of e-commerce over time" or "e-commerce sales statistics by year."

Development & History of E-commerce: Past, Present & Future
E-commerce: The Past, Present, and Future
Louise Myjel Guevarra
September 6, 2018
If you’re looking to grow your business’ e-commerce sales, you’ve come to the right place! We’ll show you specifically how we can grow your online sales channels. Learn more.
Over the last couple decades or so, e-commerce platforms have slowly crept into our daily lives. These days, online giants like Amazon and Alibaba are well-known for their great deals and convenient purchasing options. The history of e-commerce is undoubtedly an eventful one.
The Cyber Monday event was unheard of until 2005, but nowadays, it has become synonymous to the Black Friday sale—except that purchases can now be made online. It isn’t surprising for similar marketing strategies targeting online shoppers to be rampant today, with the ongoing advancement of the e-commerce industry.
The third quarter of 2017 saw an increase in sales by 15.5% from a year ago, putting its total to $115 billion. Total retail sales for online shops increased 4.3%, while brick-and-mortar retail sales increased by 3.1%. (It’s important to note that e-commerce also encompasses services like online bill payments)
Why E-commerce?
The quick and easy access made e-commerce the preferred way of doing business today. Compared to physical stores, an extensive product database can easily be sifted through by customers without the need to leave the house.
With massive amounts of information available—including options, competitive prices, and testimonials from other buyers—customers who shop online have virtually everything they need to make a buying decision. They can even make the purchase right away if they want to.
Businesses also benefit from taking their products online. Both large and small organizations can use e-commerce to increase exposure, reaching even international audiences through the web and search engines.
Marketing and customer support through websites, social media, and blogs are cheaper, more progressive alternatives compared to traditional paid advertising campaigns. Analytics have also made it easier to track customer preferences and deliver personalized messages.
Driving the Change
The progress of both technology and e-commerce have so far not shown any signs of slowing down, and that may be because the needs of their customers are continually changing, too. This channel for retail gave customers more bargaining power than ever, making it imperative for online businesses to truly understand consumer behavior.
Thankfully, the rise of big data has made understanding consumers much easier over the years. Online analytics tools can help marketers uncover a buyer’s behavioral patterns based on what purchases they’ve made and what content they’ve consumed. The data obtained helps online businesses determine how they can best provide the products and services that consumers are looking for, as well as what platforms and channels they can use to best reach them.
The analyzed data can then be used to uncover what customers really want, need, and look for when it comes to shopping online. Once this is done, brands can apply the necessary changes to optimize the customer journey and improve buyer satisfaction.
E-commerce has come a long way and has a colorful history. This short walk on memory lane will perhaps give you an idea as to where it will take you next.
E-commerce: 1960–1994 (The Past)
The Early Years
The history of e-commerce can be traced back to the 1960s with the development of the Electronic Data Interchange. It was supposed to replace mail and fax because it made data exchange possible through digital transfer, without the need for human intervention.
Trading partners could transmit orders, invoices, and other information using a format that met the American National Standards Institute’s Accredited Standards Committee X12, the set of standards in North America. The information is further examined by a Value-Added Network, then directed to the recipient’s order processing system.
Some claim that the first recorded occurrence of an online transaction was in 1972. Stanford students reportedly sold cannabis to MIT students via an Arpanet account —or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network, a packet switching network that implemented the protocol suite TCP/IP and is said to be the forerunner of the Internet.
The Start of Something New
Not long after that, in 1979, an English inventor was credited with developing the concept of online shopping. Michael Aldrich had just finished his supermarket errands with his wife when he had the idea of hooking up their television to the supermarket to deliver the groceries.
Aldrich then connected a TV to a transaction processing computer using a telephone line, giving birth to what he called teleshopping, or shopping at a distance. This teleshopping system was marketed a year later as a B2B system, although no evidence showed that it was ever used for consumer retail.
Finally, in 1990 Tim Berners Lee and Robert Cailliau built a hypertext project called WorldWideWeb. Lee used a NeXT computer to create the first web server, as well as write the first web browser. In 1991, the web debuted as a publicly available service on the Internet. He then married the hypertext to the Internet and developed the URL, HTML, and HTTP.
Opening the Floodgates
Around this time, the world saw the first secure online purchases —with the notable ones being an order of large pizza from Pizza Hut and a Sting CD.
“ The team of young cyberspace entrepreneurs celebrated what was apparently the first retail transaction made on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee privacy .” – The New York Times, August 12, 1994
In 1992, one of the first e-commerce sites, Book Stacks Unlimited, was opened by Charles M. Stack. It became Books.com in 1994, and eventually became part of Barnes & Noble. In 1997, Dell became the first company to have an online sales record of $1 million.
It was also during this era when the Secure Socket Layers (SSL) encryption certificate was developed. The security protocol made by Netscape provided better security for data transmission over the Internet. The web browser would first check a site for an authentic SSL certificate to know whether to trust it or not.
This came in the heels of customer hesitations and concerns with online shopping.
Today, SSL encryption protocol is a standard for most web servers, making it a vital part of web security.
Ecommerce: 1995–Present
The Would-be Giants
At this point, there’s no stopping e-commerce, especially with significant advancements in technology coming in hot. In 1995, two websites put online shopping on the map for good. Amazon, perhaps the most prominent online retailer today, started as an online bookstore and offered more titles compared to its offline competitors. In 2001, they launched their first mobile site.
Amazon attracts 65 million customers monthly. Before its Prime Day Sale this 2018, Amazon has been reported to have record-high share prices, with a market capitalization of $900 billion, as well as an 80% increase in stocks from a year ago.
Far from their beginnings as a bookstore, Amazon now offers DVDs, CDs, MP3 and eBook downloads, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, and toys.
The world saw the efficiency of e-commerce category pages through Amazon. But more importantly, it was the user review and rating scale that defined the website. This feature helped undecided buyers get an idea of their preferred product from existing customers. It’s now considered one of the most effective social media tactics for driving sales, with reviews producing an average of 18% uplift.
eBay launched in the same year as Amazon (1995). While it also allowed online purchases, it’s mainly famous for introducing online auctions. These two sites lead the way for Zappos and Victoria’s Secret to enter online shopping in 1999.
Meanwhile, 1995 saw the inception of search engines starting with Yahoo!, then Google in 1998. Both  now have e-commerce subsidiaries—Google Shopping and Yahoo! Auction—which goes to show the increasing focus on e-commerce as a revenue channel.
Making the Process Seamless
In 1998, PayPal made global e-commerce possible as an acquired bank that does payment processing for online sellers, auction sites, and commercial users. Customers get to send, receive, and hold funds, in 24 different currencies. Today, PayPal transactions have a 79% higher checkout conversion rate compared to non-PayPal ones.
Additional security for online transactions was applied with the creation of the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council in 2004. The council was tasked to ensure that businesses are complying with security requirements. They also established, improved, stored, circulated, and implemented security standards for account data protection.
As mentioned, the continuing improvement in technology paved the way for better e-commerce, and in 2003, more than 20% of Americans had broadband Internet in their homes or Internet access that is faster and always on (24h) compared to dial-up.
With high-speed connections at disposal, there is now better access to online shops. According to E-Commerce Times, online sales increased by 26% that year, with Amazon alone reporting a 28% sales increase year on year. Faster internet speeds and increase penetration has facilitated product research for interested buyers, as well as the search for competitive prices and alternatives.
The Industry in 2020
The last decade saw the domination of e-commerce, not only due to better technology but also to heightened consumer interest and participation. In 2016, China pulled in around $900 billion of sales, while the US raked in more than $423 billion. The e-commerce industry earned approximately $1.915 trillion in 2016.
These trends may just be the reason for the continuing rise of the industry:
Online Marketplaces
These platforms have become a very convenient choice for vendors to sell, marketers to promote, and customers to shop. It has added a layer of convenience and confidence to buyers, thanks to a range of product offerings and brands, relevant testimonials, and the ability to compare and make purchases.
There are now around 63% of sellers that are online-exclusive, with 55% of them earning a profit margin above 20%. Since 2014, large marketplace platforms like Alibaba, Flipkart, and Magento have grown around 51.7% over a three-year period.
M-commerce
If you’ve ever bought something from the Internet using only a smartphone or tablet, then you’re not alone—in fact, the number of US mobile subscribers jumped in 2008, with 62% having bought a product using their devices.
M-commerce or buying and selling of products or services through handheld devices are considered one of the most vital developments in e-commerce. It has allowed users to browse for goods, compare details and prices, and shop from sites or apps using a smartphone or tablet, without the need to visit a physical store.
In 2015, mobile devices accounted for 30% of e-commerce sales, and it’s expected to grow 2.58 times faster. Javelin Strategy predicts that sales will jump to $319 billion by 2020. But, you only need to listen to public opinion to know how mobile usage has dominated e-commerce in the last few years.
48% of people use mobile to look up product rating or promos
56% believes mobile shopping has helped make the buying experience more enjoyable
Aside from these benefits, mobile marketplaces have more opportunity for interactivity and engagement, mainly through push notifications.
Digital Marketing and Social Shopping
There is no better proof of consumer behavior and mobile influence on e-commerce than in marketing. Digital marketing has enabled companies to speak directly to consumers by hinging on places or apps where people are likely to be present or spending more time.
Aside from reaching a wider audience, online marketing has allowed businesses to adopt client-specific marketing and nurturing through behavioral data, as well as to have the versatility to make dynamic changes to advertising for personalization.
Online behavior is especially helpful for the young demographic who keep their mobile devices on hand. An Accenture millennial shopping study suggests that 89% of respondents believe that access to real-time product availability information would influence their shopping choices regarding which stores to go.
In addition, social networks have incorporated online purchasing on their platforms. According to Flurry , an adult spends 5 hours a day on their devices, with 50% of time spent in social, messaging, media, and entertainment apps. The amount of time consumers spend on social media includes discovering new products (43%) and buying products directly (18.2% ).
Twitter has the “Buy Now” button, while Instagram just recently rolled out actionable advertisements, which is another way for customers to learn and buy products in real time.
E-commerce: The Future
The foreseen development and growth of the industry will still rely heavily on advances in technology and a few sociocultural influences.
AI and Machine Learning
In a practical sense, machine learning can be used for stock management by analyzing sales and predicting when stocks should be replenished. It can also improve customer support through chatbots that can provide quick, 24/7 assistance.
E-commerce can also utilize AI by offering more relevant search results to buyers based on available information and buying patterns. Every detail available about the buyer is valuable, and the AI analysis can help provide improved customer service.
AI also gives way for more defined buyer profiles, which your marketing can tap into for more personalized audience insights. AI can analyze purchases to make suggestions that are of similar or complementary tastes.
Amazon has commented that its recommendation engine is responsible for 35% of its sales, demonstrating the benefits of machine learning to e-commerce companies. Indeed, iAI can be a strong driver for growth and customer satisfaction.
AR/VR
The mixed reality of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) are bound to dominate e-commerce. AR and VR have changed the way customers shop by offering an immersive and interactive experience through layers of digital enhancements to give them an idea as to how a product or service will be useful in their lives.
A proper application of AR is cosmetic retail store Sephora’s Virtual Artist feature. It allows users to try on their preferred makeup via an app or through the website by either choosing a model closest to their skin tone or uploading their own photo and choosing what to put on from the plethora of makeup types or brands available.
AR takes out the uncertainty one may experience from buying a cosmetic product online without seeing how it looks on their skin.
VR, meanwhile, allows consumers to visit a virtual store. In the case of eBay, with help from Australian retailer Myer, shoppers can purchase from a virtual reality department store using a VR headset.
There are virtual isles that they can view, and with only their sight or by gazing at it for a few seconds—what the company calls the “eBay Sight Search”—an item can be selected for purchase or checking. They can also move through the aisles, with the top 100 products viewable in 3D and the rest in 2D.
Cryptocurrency Payments
Digital currencies like Bitcoin are expected to be the new method of payment as they don’t require an intermediary for seller and customer exchange, allowing both parties to have more control over how they do business. It also requires little to no transaction fees, as opposed to traditional payment processing where transaction fees can be much higher.
A multitude of e-commerce stores are opening up their doors to payments in the form of cryptocurrencies, and this is likely to stir a change in buying behavior.
Multi-Channel Buying
Managing multiple channels for your business can be confusing. In fact, nearly a third of retailers “lack the inventory visibility across stores, vendors, and warehouses” needed for multi-channel fulfillment.
This can be problematic, as around 86% of people have been found to shop around on at least two touchpoints or channels, which means that interest can start either offline or online, but the buying process can only continue to be tracked if it’s online.
Multi-channel is about creating a balance so as not to overwhelm your audience, and to avoid overspending on strategies to try to convert people who aren’t interested to begin with. It’s about knowing when and where to amplify and show restraint throughout your channels.
Taking Advantage of Content for Engagement
Different surveys and studies about content marketing have found that:
74% get frustrated when content has nothing to do with their interests
56% say they are inclined to support a retailer if it offered a personalized experience
Brands that rely on content save over $14 on each new customer acquired
HubSpot also found that content can help double website conversion rates from 6% to 12%
64% said that customer experience is more important than price when choosing a brand, according to Gartner
Great content is educational and entertaining, staying relevant to customers’ needs; but it’s tough to do it right. With consumer attention spans spreading thin, marketers now need to optimize their content to drive product interest and sales, while retaining a high quality standard.
Opportunity for B2B
Wholesale e-commerce platforms have had an even bigger chance to flourish, with B2B e-commerce earning bigger than B2C by over $5 trillion. In 2017, Statista found that “the gross merchandise volume of B2B e-commerce transactions is projected to amount to $7.66 trillion, from $5.83 trillion in 2013.” B2C, meanwhile, had projected transactions of $2.143 trillion.
B2B respondents had an average conversion rate of 10%, which is over three times higher than the 3% average of B2C respondents. This goes to show that there’s a huge untapped opportunity for B2B brands that haven’t opened e-commerce channels.
Let’s take a look at e-commerce trends in more detail with this infographic by Subscriptionly:
Nowhere to Go but Up
The 1992 book Future Shop: How Technologies Will Change The Way We Shop And What We Buy provided insight and prediction that may be referring to e-commerce in light of consumerism. It argued that “new information technologies, combined with innovative public policies, could help consumers overcome that confusion over the complex navigation of the marketplace .”
Indeed, new information and technology has helped make the entire purchasing process more seamless for both buyers and sellers and even given way for new ways to buy/sell products and services. And this continuing improvement is only going to give people more reasons to support e-commerce for years to come.

Global Ecommerce Sales Growth (2019–2025)
The global ecommerce growth rate for 2022 is forecast at 12.7 percent, bringing global ecommerce sales worldwide to $5.545 trillion. This growth is, however, a dip from last year’s rate.
In 2021, global ecommerce growth rates hit 16.8 percent. This represented a deceleration from 2020’s growth rate of 25.7 percent, which was also the largest year-over-year increase analysts expect between 2019 and 2025 and can be attributed to the coronavirus pandemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak forced governments all over the world to impose strict lockdowns, which meant brick-and-mortar stores had to stay shut and consumers had to stay home. This boosted online retail growth as people went on the internet to carry out their purchases.
And with some parts of the world still facing stringent in-person shopping regulations, ecommerce sales are set to increase this year—albeit at a slower pace—and growth is projected to decelerate over the coming years.
For instance, ecommerce sales growth worldwide is expected at 11.2 percent in 2023, a 1.7 percentage point dip from 2022. This will fall to 9.8 percent in 2024 and further to 9.0 percent in 2025.
Despite the falling growth rates, the ecommerce share of retail sales is expected to increase. In 2022, this figure is forecast at 21 percent and will increase to 24.5 percent by 2025.

In which parts of the world is ecommerce experiencing the fastest growth?
Recent ecommerce sales growth statistics show that the online shopping trend is growing the fastest in Asia. From 2020 to 2025, ecommerce sales in the continent are forecast to increase by a whopping 51 percent.
The continent’s online retail growth rate beats that of the worldwide average, which analysts forecast at 47 percent.
China, the country with the highest amount of ecommerce sales, is expected to see its online retail sector grow by 49 percent during this period. Its quick growth comes as no surprise, considering its huge population and that it’s home to some of the top ecommerce companies in the world.
Europe and North America, in comparison, are expected to see slower growth rates. Ecommerce sales in Europe are forecast to increase 42 percent over these five years, while growth rates in North America have been projected at 35 percent.
