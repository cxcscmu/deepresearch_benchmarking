As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information on why some people may be against getting vaccinated based on research and studies.

There are several reasons why people might be hesitant or opposed to getting vaccinated. Some of these reasons include:

1. **Misinformation and Misunderstandings**: False information about vaccines can spread quickly, leading people to believe that vaccines are unsafe or ineffective. This misinformation can come from various sources, including social media, unreliable websites, or even well-meaning but misinformed individuals.

2. **Fear of Side Effects**: Some people may be afraid of potential side effects from vaccines. While serious side effects are rare, mild reactions like soreness at the injection site or fever are common and usually temporary.

3. **Lack of Trust in Authorities**: Trust in government institutions, healthcare providers, or pharmaceutical companies can influence vaccination decisions. If someone does not trust these entities, they may be more likely to question the safety and efficacy of vaccines.

4. **Religious or Philosophical Beliefs**: Certain religious or philosophical beliefs may lead some individuals to reject vaccinations altogether.

5. **Perception of Low Risk**: In areas where vaccine-preventable diseases are rare due to high vaccination rates, some people may feel that the risk of contracting these diseases is low, making vaccination seem unnecessary.

6. **Conspiracy Theories**: Belief in conspiracy theories related to vaccines, such as the idea that vaccines are part of a plot to control populations or that they contain harmful ingredients, can also contribute to vaccine hesitancy.

7. **Personal Experiences**: Negative experiences with vaccines or healthcare systems can influence an individual's decision to vaccinate. For example, if someone knows someone who had a bad reaction to a vaccine, they may become wary of getting vaccinated themselves.

8. **Cultural or Social Influences**: Cultural norms and social pressures can play a role in vaccination decisions. In some communities, there may be a general skepticism towards Western medicine or a preference for alternative health practices.

It's important to address these concerns through education, open dialogue, and providing accurate information about the benefits and safety of vaccines. Public health campaigns and healthcare providers play a crucial role in building trust and encouraging vaccination to protect both individual and community health.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{People may be against getting vaccinated due to misinformation, fear of side effects, lack of trust in authorities, religious or philosophical beliefs, perception of low risk, conspiracy theories, personal experiences, and cultural or social influences.}} \]
