So I've been given this question: "Should the law allow an employer to fire an employee without a good reason?" Hmm, this seems like a tricky one because it涉及到 employment rights and labor laws. I need to think about this carefully.

First off, I should probably understand what current laws say about this. In many countries, there are laws that protect employees from being fired unjustly, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look into what's known as "at-will employment." I think that's when employers can fire employees at any time, for any reason, as long as it's not illegal, like discrimination based on race or gender.

Let me try to find out more about at-will employment. Maybe I should search for "at-will employment definition" to get a clear understanding.

What Is the Employment At-Will Definition?
Employment at-will is a legal definition that is listed on employee contracts, or included in employee handbooks, to indicate that they are being employed "at-will." This definition allows an employee to be fired at any time for any reason with few exceptions. This added description gives you little recourse to legally fight your termination, as your employer does not need to show just cause for letting you go.
The only state that protects employees is the state of Montana, which extends employee protection to being fired without cause to those employees who have successfully completed a set probationary period.
Being employed at-will also gives employees the right to quit or leave their jobs without providing a reason. Even though at-will employment had been steadily increasing over time, many employees are shocked to learn that their employment is deemed at-will.
The only way that you can fight termination as an at-will employee is if the employer violates your employee rights, or violates labor laws.
Not only does at-will employment mean that employees can be terminated without reason, but it also means that the terms of their employment can be altered at any time for any reason. This can include termination of benefits, reduced time off, or changes in hours or wages.
What Is At-Will Presumption?
The United States is one of a few countries where at-will employment is predominant, while most other countries require cause for dismissal of an employee. The most common reasons for the prevalence of at-will employment in the U.S. is linked to:
The desire for freedom from contract
The belief that at-will employment is still favored by both employer and employee
Employer deference
Most employment in the U.S. defaults to the at-will rule unless the employment agreement is modified by a contract that requires cause to be shown in the event of termination. This is typically done only at higher levels of employment. In the U.S., these requirements can also be found in collective bargaining agreements where unions agree to employment contracts that usually require cause to be shown for termination.
How Does Employment At-Will Affect Termination Notice?
Just as an employer can terminate an employee's employment at any time, the employee is likewise able to terminate their employment at any time without having to give cause. Employment at-will was not created to simply allow employers to terminate without reason, but to give both employers and employees the freedom to continue employment when desired, and terminate when they feel it is necessary.
Even though at-will employment allows employers to terminate an employee at any time without cause, it is important for employers to check state laws before terminating, as some states will have additional requirements when it comes to at-will employment.
How Do I Know If I Have a Claim for Wrongful Termination?
While an employee may be considered at-will, termination may still be illegal if it is done in violation of labor laws, due to discrimination, or violates other state and federal laws that protect an employee's rights. You also may have the right to file a suit if the employer's termination of your employment was done in retaliation for you exercising a legal right, such as filing a harassment claim or reporting the company for a violation. There are also additional situations in which you may be able to file a wrongful termination claim. Some of these instances include:
Termination for refusal to perform an illegal act
Termination for time off work that is protected under law, such as voting
When filing suit for a wrongful termination, you can file for damages for:
Back pay
Promotion
Reinstatement
Injunctive relief
Reasonable accommodations
Compensatory damages
Front pay
If you have an employment contract with an employer, even an implied one, and they terminate you without cause, you may be entitled to file a legal claim on the basis of breach of contract.
For cases of breach of contract or wrongful termination, it is in the best interest of both parties to retain the services of an employment lawyer.
What Is an Employment Contract?
An employment contract is an agreement between the employer and employee that outlines the basic duties of the job as well as the start date, salary, and benefits.  Employers may have a different contract for different duties in the company.  In these contracts may be verbiage that requires the employer to show cause when terminating employment.
Common Elements That May or May Not Be on Your Employment Contract
Employee contracts can vary widely from company to company, and depend on the position it covers. Some of the items that may be contained in an employment contract include:
Confidentiality, or "non-disclosure" agreements, which require that the employee agree to not share any records or divulge any company information with others
Non-compete agreements, which are when an employee agrees to not work for a competing company, nor engage in any business in direct competition with the company for a stated period of time after employment has ended
Ownership of inventions, which states that an employee who invents as part of their employment agrees that anything invented during, and within the scope of employment, will become the rights of the employer
Exclusive employment, which is where the employee agrees that they will not work for any other company similar to their current business while under contract with the company
No additional compensation, which states that the employee will not be entitled to additional pay if they achieve a position on a committee or serve as an officer
Termination, which entitles either party to terminate the employment at any time for any reason even if it is due to health concerns or injury
Arbitration, which is when the employee agrees to use arbitration or mediation for the resolution of employment disputes instead of seeking recourse in court
Choice of law, which is part of the agreement that states that if a lawsuit should ever arise, it will fall under the regulation of the state in which it is filed
What Is an Implied Contract?
An implied contract is a contract that can be established in other ways aside from being provided in formal wiring. Currently, 41 states as well as the District of Columbia, recognize implied contracts for legal proceedings. Implied contracts are created between an employee and employer in one of several ways.
Oral assurances – Assurances for cause for termination that is implied by a supervisor or employer through the use of such statements as "we don't dismiss employees without giving them a second chance," can be construed as an implied contract to provide cause for termination.
Employer handbooks and policies – Language used in policy manuals or other written documentation that implies employees will not be terminated without cause, or that there is a certain procedure followed before termination can create an implied contract.
Since implied contracts can be held as binding agreements in many states in the U.S. if employers want to protect themselves from wrongful termination suits, it is in their best interest to create a clearly written, unambiguous disclaimer stating that provided written materials of policies and procedures do not create a contractual employment right. It is also important to note that employers can modify their set policies and procedures at any time.
Exceptions to At-Will Employment
While employment without a contract stating otherwise is legally regarded as an at-will employment agreement, there are exceptions to the at-will employer's right to terminate without cause. Employers can still be held liable for wrongful termination if:
The employee is covered under a collective bargaining agreement
There is an employee contract requiring cause for termination
Discrimination plays a role in the termination
If public policy had been violated
If company policy states specific guidelines for termination
If there was an implied contract
If there was an implied covenant of good faith
Having an implied contract is one of the most common claims for wrongful termination. An implied contract could prohibit an employer from firing an employee without cause even if a legal document was not drafted regarding such rights. The burden of proof in these cases lies with the employee and often is difficult to prove. Implied contracts are often discovered through employee handbooks or policy manuals where the employer states that it is not an at-will employer and they will not fire an employee without cause.
Another common case brought for wrongful termination suits is the exception known as implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  This prevents employers from terminating an employee in an attempt to avoid their duties to the employee, such as providing health care, retirement benefits, or providing commission owed.
The public policy exception states that an employer is unable to fire their employee if the act violates the state's public policy. This can occur when an employee is fired for a reason that benefited the public. There are seven states in the U.S. that do not recognize public policy and they include Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, and Florida.
It is important to note that not all of these exceptions are recognized in all jurisdictions, and that states may also have additional exceptions or regulations regarding at-will employee termination.
Additional Tort-Based Claims Limiting At-Will Employment
There are also additional tort claims that can be filed as a result of at-will employment, including:
Intentional interference with a contract – This claim can be made when a coworker or supervisor has an improper motive that is successful in creating the employee's dismissal. This type of claim is not recognized in all state jurisdictions.
Intentional infliction of emotional distress – This tort claim charges the employer with extreme and outrageous conduct that either recklessly or intentionally may result in severe emotional distress to the employee. Under some court jurisdictions, even severe emotional and psychological abuse can fail to fall into the outrageous claim enough to establish liability.
There is also a chance for a tort claim if it is proven that an employer made a clear and unambiguous promise of employment. For this claim to work, it must be proven that the employee relied on the promise of employment, the employee's reliance was reasonable, and the employee was somehow injured as a result. An example of this could be an employee who relocates their family and uproots their life to accept a new job offer in a new city. Upon arrival, or even before the first day of employment, the offer is terminated. The individual would most likely have a case for a promissory claim. Some courts may outright reject these types of claims under the premise that because employment is at-will, the employee should not reasonably rely on any promise of employment made by a current or new employer. When this claim is successful, the damages awarded to the plaintiff will be based on the employee's previous salary and not what was promised in the new job.
At-Will Rule
While there are important exceptions to the at-will rule, the presumption of at-will employment is, and will probably remain, an important feature of the U.S. employment landscape. At-will employment is often supported in the courts, and the burden of proof in wrongful termination claims falls on the employee who may find the claims hard to prove.
At this time, Montana is the only state to have eliminated the at-will rule, and there are many jurisdictions that do not even recognize many of the common exceptions.

Employment at Will
(redirected from At-will)
Also found in: Financial .
Employment at Will
A common-law rule that an employment contract of indefinite duration can be terminated by either the employer or the employee at any time for any reason; also known as terminable at will.
Traditionally, U.S. employers have possessed the right to discharge their employees at will for any reason, be it good or bad. The "at-will" category encompasses all employees who are not protected by express employment contracts that state that they may be fired only for good cause. "Good cause" requirements are typically a part of collective bargaining agreements negotiated by employee unions; nonunion workers rarely have this form of protection. The at-will doctrine also does not apply to contracts for a specified term, such as an employment contract that contemplates the employee providing service for a expressly designated number of years.
The United States is the only major industrial power that maintains a general employment-at-will rule. Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and Sweden all have statutory provisions that require employers to show good cause before discharging employees.
Beginning in the 1980s, employment at will came under challenge in the United States. Employees had grown increasingly dissatisfied with the rule for a variety of reasons. For one thing, a decline in the number of self-employed individuals—due, in part, to a continuing decline in the number of farmers—meant that most U.S. citizens worked for someone else. For another, a typical worker who was discharged currently lost more than in the past in terms of Pension,insurance, and other benefits.
As a result, a greater number of discharged workers brought suits alleging Wrongful Discharge from employment. By the 1980s, as concepts of job security expanded, employees became increasingly successful in such suits. In 1987, California juries ruled in favor of the employees in over two-thirds of such cases and granted an average award of $1.5 million. In some successful cases, the courts have created exceptions to the employment-at-will practice. Thus far, these exceptions have fallen into three broad categories: (1) breach of contract by the employer, (2) breach of an implied Covenant of Good Faith and fair dealing, and (3) violation of public policy by the employer. Employers and legislatures have responded in a variety of ways.
Breach of Contract
Approximately half of the states have allowed exceptions to employment at will on the basis of an express or implied promise by the employer. Typically, a wrongful discharge action alleging the breach of an employer's promise is based on a statement by the employer that expressly or implicitly promises employees a degree of job security. Ordinarily, such statements are found in employee handbooks or in policy memorandums given to employees when they are hired. Some courts have interpreted such statements as unilateral contracts in which the employer promises not to discharge the employees except for Just Cause and in accordance with certain procedures(Duldulao v. Saint Mary of Nazareth Hospital Center,115 Ill. 2d 482, 106 Ill. Dec. 8, 505 N.E.2d 314 [Ill. 1987]). Courts were more reluctant to find exceptions to the employment at-will practice in cases that involved an oral promise of long-term employment.
Breach of an Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
In wrongful dismissal cases based on an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the discharged employee typically contends that the employer has indicated in various ways that the employee has job security and will be treated fairly. For example, long time employees who have consistently received favorable evaluations might claim that their length of service and positive performance reviews were signs that their job would be secure as long as they performed satisfactorily.
Courts that have recognized good-faith-and-fair-dealing exceptions have found either covenants implied in fact or covenants implied in law. Covenants implied in fact have been found in "objective manifestations," including repeated promotions and pay increases, that might reasonably give an employee cause to believe that he or she has job security and will be treated fairly(Dare v. Montana Petroleum Marketing,687 P.2d 1015 [Mont. 1984]; Kerr v. Gibson's Products Co.,733 P.2d 1292 [Mont. 1987]).
A few jurisdictions have recognized implied-in-law covenants of good faith and fair dealing. California courts have ruled that every employment contract carries with it an implied covenant that neither party will impede the other from receiving the benefits of the agreement. In deciding whether such a covenant is to be inferred, a court looks at such factors as whether the company properly followed its stated personnel policies, the length of the person's employment, any job security assurances that may have been made, a presence or lack of prior criticism of performance, and basic notions of fairness.
In Khanna v. Microdata Corp.,170 Cal. App. 3d 250, 215 Cal. Rptr. 860 (1985), for example, a California court of appeals ruled that a company violated an implied covenant when it fired a leading salesman who had brought suit against the company for unpaid commissions. The court found that a breach of an implied-in-law covenant is established whenever an employer engages in a bad-faith action outside a contract and attempts to frustrate an employee's enjoyment of her or his contract rights.
Violation of Public Policy
Several public policy exceptions to the employment-at-will practice have been recognized by courts in some jurisdictions. In public policy cases, the employee alleges that he or she has been discharged in violation of a policy found in a statutory right of the employee, statutes containing penalties, constitutional provisions, and judicial opinions. Courts have generally been more willing to recognize a public policy exception when the policy in question has a statutory basis than when it does not.
Courts in many jurisdictions have been willing to recognize public policy exceptions for employees who were discharged because they asserted a statutory right. For example, in Firestone Textile Co. Division, Firestone Tire&Rubber Co. v. Meadows,666 S.W.2d 730 (1983), the Supreme Court of Kentucky ruled that an employer could not discharge an employee simply because he had filed a workers' compensation claim.
A public policy exception to employment at will has also been found in cases where an employee was fired for refusing to violate a statute. Wrongful discharge has been found in instances where employees were dismissed for refusing to dispose of waste in a place where doing so is prohibited by federal law, for refusing to commit perjury, and for giving testimony in compliance with a court order.
Courts have much less frequently been willing to recognize exceptions to employment at will owing to constitutional provisions. Nevertheless, in Novosel v. Nationwide Insurance Co.,721 F.2d 894 (3d Cir. 1983), a federal appeals court made a public policy exception for an employee who was dismissed for refusing to join a company's Lobbying effort because he privately opposed the company's stance on the issue. The court found that the free speech provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protected the employee's refusal. In Borse v. Piece Goods Shop,963 F.2d 611 (1992), a federal circuit court of appeals ruled that Pennsylvania law may protect at-will employees from being fired for refusing to take part in drug-testing programs if the employees' privacy is unreasonably invaded.
The Response by Employers and Legislatures
Legal guidelines relating to the status of employment at will are still developing or remain unclear in many states. The evolving judgments of legislatures and courts on this issue reflect a continuing debate over how to protect wrongfully discharged at-will employees while allowing employers the freedom to make personnel decisions.
The rising number of wrongful-dismissal suits has alarmed many employers. Faced with the threat of high legal fees, court costs, and huge potential damage awards in such cases, more companies have begun to add express employment-at-will clauses to employment contracts. Many employers have deleted potentially troublesome statements from their handbooks and instructed recruiters to make no promises about just cause or the term of employment. Companies are also turning more frequently to severance pay settlements, in which discharged employees receive a reasonably generous compensation package in exchange for waiving all future claims based on the employment or its termination.
The decline of the power of employee unions and Collective Bargaining has provided many employers with the freedom to insert the new contract clauses. In many instances, companies are concerned more with losing expensive termination lawsuits than with inciting union action or public boycotts.
Whereas employers claim they are simply reasserting their rights under the traditional at-will doctrine, employee advocates believe that many companies may be attempting to cheat workers out of the job security gains they have achieved through several decades of wrongful-dismissal lawsuits. They propose legislation that would protect at-will employees from unjust discharge and provide for arbitrators to handle disputes. This solution, they suggest, would be fair to employees and employers alike. Such legislation would protect at-will employees, not just those who fall under the exceptions and who can afford to pursue a lawsuit that may take years to complete. Businesses would benefit not only because employee morale might improve, but also because relief could be limited to back pay and reinstatement rather than possibly including punitive and Compensatory Damages.
Some state legislatures have enacted legislation that struggles to balance the rights of the employee and the employer. In 1987, Montana passed the Montana Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act (Mont. Code Ann. § 39-2-901). This law limits the rights of employees claiming wrongful discharge, by restating the principle that at-will employees may be dismissed for "any reason considered sufficient by the terminating party." However, a discharge could be considered wrongful even under this principle if it was in retaliation for the employee's refusal to violate public policy, if it was not for good cause, or if the employer violated the express provisions of the employer's own personnel policy.
The Montana statute limits the remedies of a discharged employee who sues the former employer. The employee may be awarded lost wages and fringe benefits but only for a period not to exceed four years, and Punitive Damages may be sought only when there is clear and convincing evidence that the employer engaged in actual Fraud or malice in the wrongful discharge. In addition, any earnings that were or could have been accrued following the discharge must be deducted from the amount awarded in lost wages. The Montana Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the act in Meech v. Hillhaven West,776 P.2d 488 (1989).

What is the At Will Employment Doctrine? An Introduction
At-will employment is a contractual relationship between an employer and an employee in which both parties are free to terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason, as long as the reason is not considered illegal. This form of employment gives both the hired professionals and the hiring companies complete freedom in their relationship.
Components of at-will employment
Although at-will employment gives maximum freedom and flexibility to both parties involved, the employer must make sure that the employee benefits from a suitable work environment and is properly motivated to fulfill their professional duties. Therefore, several basic components need to be in place for at-will employment to work well for everyone involved:
The position must be properly defined: Any employee must understand what their job responsibilities and requirements are, and other important details such as the work address and work hours. An employer can create the foundation of a successful working relationship by being straightforward with this information.
The duration of the agreement needs to be outlined: Although the working relationship can be ended unilaterally by any of the parties, the employment contract must properly define a term of employment, as well as how it can be modified or terminated.
The employee needs to be aware of their professional expectations: Depending on the exact role of the employee, professional expectations can have different levels of detail. In most situations, the employer must clearly outline the performance standards that the employee needs to measure themselves against.
The compensation’s method of calculation must be clear: Every aspect of the new employee’s compensation needs to be properly outlined from the very beginning. This includes the base wage that the two parties agreed upon, but also other important details such as overtime pay or level of commission, when applicable. If the company offers performance-based incentives, the employee needs to know exactly how to reach them.
Any bonus or benefit needs to be fully described: Aside from the basic wage and performance-based incentives, the at-will employment contract also has to describe any additional benefit that the employee will be entitled to. These include elements such as health or dental insurance, and the number of yearly vacation days, stock options or employee retirement plans that the company offers its employees.
Any other elements or requirements that need to be specified: Depending on the nature of the company and the plans of the employers, companies may have special requirements from their employees. Some of them are confidentiality agreements, non-compete clauses forbidding the employee to work for a competing organization within a specified period of time or regulations regarding the use of any copyrighted and patented intellectual property of the company.
The termination and severance conditions also need to be outlined: Despite being relatively simple and straightforward within the at-will employment doctrine, employee termination also needs to be described in the employment contract. The employee needs to know the details of an eventual termination, such as the notice period or the severance package they may be entitled to.
Pros of the at-will employment doctrine
There are several advantages of the at-will employment doctrine. Some of them are:
Maximum flexibility for both parties: An at-will employment agreement gives both parties maximum freedom in their professional relationship. Employers can improve productivity by making it easy to quickly dismiss underperforming employees.
Reduces the risk of litigation: Employees who feel they have been wrongly dismissed have no basis for a lawsuit under the at-will employment doctrine unless they feel they have been unfairly discriminated for reasons that have nothing to do with their work performance.
It encourages meritocracy: An at-will employment doctrine gives employers the freedom to promote solely on merit and offers employees the motivation to evolve. Under classic employment agreements, the workers have more protection from termination, which can potentially cause stagnation. Collective bargaining agreements also may force employers to promote based on seniority rather than pure merit.
It discourages strikes and hold-outs: Aside from more motivated employees, at-will employment also makes them less likely to hold out or to strike, as opposed to employees hired under a collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, if a group of employees does not properly perform their work duties they can be immediately terminated.
At-will employment FAQs
These are some of the most frequently asked questions regarding at-will employment:
Does at-will employment help all parties involved?
Yes, as it gives the employee the same freedom as the employer when it comes to terminating their working relationship. As opposed to other employment agreements, which usually include a two-week notice period after resignation, an employee working under the at-will employment doctrine can usually leave immediately. This means that both the employer and the employee have a common interest in keeping their professional relationship a positive one.
Can an at-will employee collect unemployment benefits after termination?
Most states allow employees who were hired under the at-will employment doctrine and were terminated through no fault of their own to collect unemployment benefits. After termination, the state’s unemployment office will open an investigation that aims to determine whether the employee was terminated under a so-called “good cause” or not. Each state has slightly different ways of determining what a good cause is. Employees that are terminated for any kind of misconduct generally do not qualify for unemployment benefits.
When did at-will employment become law?
At-will employment was adopted within the common law of the employment contract in the late 19th century in most U.S. states. It was later endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 20th century and was typically seen as the default rule at first, but states gradually added a number of exemptions and the emergence of trade unions meant that many workplaces had collective bargaining agreements.

What Does Employment At-Will Mean?
By

Miguel Co / The Balance
What is employment at will? Employment at will means an employee can be terminated at any time without any reason, explanation, or warning. 1 ﻿ It also means an employee can quit at any time for any reason—or no reason at all.
What is Employment At-Will?
At-will employment means employers can terminate employees for no reason. Likewise, employees can leave a job without a reason. 1 At-will employment has grown increasingly more popular over time.
This type of employment involves a great deal of flexibility for both the employer and the employee.
Employers, for example, can change the terms of employment—such as wages, benefit plans, or paid time off—without notice or consequence.
Employees can change jobs without notice if they choose. Although it’s generally best to provide two weeks’ notice, regardless of legal requirements, to protect your reputation with future employers.
Exceptions to At-Will Employment
Some situations might require either an employer or an employee to follow stricter guidelines than what is typical for at-will employment. The following are examples of such exceptions :
Employment Contracts: An employee who is covered under a collective bargaining agreement or who has an employment contract may have rights not afforded typical at-will employees.
Implied Contracts: Employers are prohibited from firing an employee when an implied contract is created between them, regardless of whether or not a legal document exists. 2 ﻿ It can be difficult to prove the validity of such an agreement, and that burden rests with the employee. Your employer’s policy book, or new-hire handbook, might indicate that employees are not at will and can only be fired for good cause.
Good Faith and Fair Dealing: Yet another exception is known as implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 3 ﻿ In this case, employers cannot fire a person in order to avoid their duties, such as paying for healthcare, retirement, or commission-based work.
Public Policy: Employers are not able to fire an employee if the action violates their state’s public policy exception. 1 ﻿ In this case, employers are prohibited from firing or seeking damages from an employee if the employee’s reason for leaving benefits the public. In the United States, only eight states do not recognize public policy as an exception to this rule. These states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New York, and Rhode Island.
Employment at Will and Employee Rights
While at-will employment provides fewer worker protections than alternatives such as employment under a union collective bargaining agreement, employees do have rights after a termination. These include statutory rights under federal and state law, such as unemployment insurance and anti-discrimination laws .
Federal and state governments have laws protecting at-will employees from wrongful termination. 4 ﻿ Reasons can include race, religion, citizenship, retaliation for performing a legally protected action, whistleblowing, disability, gender, age, physical health, sexual orientation, and other factors protected by labor laws.
In addition, company policy may offer protections such as severance pay for employees who are terminated under certain conditions.
Documentation of Company Policy
Most employers state clearly in their employee handbooks that employees are at will. While this is not explicitly necessary, it can help prevent disputes from arising later on. Other employers may have new employees sign a document acknowledging that they are at-will employees and they agree to all conditions that come with that status.
Legal help site Nolo.com suggests the only time this really can be an issue is if an employee accepted a position based on a verbal agreement that conflicts with an at-will employment agreement they later are asked to sign. 5 ﻿ In that event, it is recommended that the employee consult with an attorney before signing such a document.
Does Employment at Will Mean That You’ll Be Fired Without Warning?
In short: not necessarily. But it’s best to conduct yourself as if you might be terminated without warning. Have your resume, references, etc. prepared and ready to go, so that you can begin looking for another job immediately if you need to do so.
That said, employers have a brand just like any company, and most prefer to avoid gaining a reputation for impulsiveness or cruelty. So, barring situations in which they feel you’ve given them good cause, many will prefer to soften your transition.
That might mean giving you a warning in the form of placing you on a performance improvement plan prior to termination, or providing you with severance after a separation, or simply not contesting your claim to unemployment benefits .
The Bottom Line
Just because an employer can do something, doesn’t mean they will. Prepare for the worst, but don’t obsess over it. In today’s job market, it pays to be ready to make a change on short notice regardless. After all, you never know when a better opportunity will come along and you’ll decide to take advantage of at-will employment and get a better job.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Should the law allow an employer to fire an employee without a good reason?" Okay, first things first, I need to understand what this is all about. It seems like it's related to employment laws and the rights of employers and employees.

I recall hearing about something called "at-will employment." From what I remember, at-will employment means that an employer can fire an employee at any time, for any reason, and without notice, as long as it's not for an illegal reason, like discrimination based on race, gender, etc. Similarly, employees can quit at any time without any consequence. Is that right? Maybe I should confirm that.

I think it's important to know what the current laws are regarding this. In the U.S., at least, most states follow the at-will employment doctrine. But I'm not sure about other countries. Maybe I should look into that too.

Let me consider the pros and cons of allowing employers to fire employees without a good reason. On one hand, giving employers this flexibility might encourage them to take risks and hire more people, knowing they can let go of underperforming employees easily. It could also make businesses more efficient.

On the other hand, not having job security could make employees feel insecure and less motivated. They might be afraid to take time off or speak up about issues in the workplace for fear of being fired without cause.

I also think about how this affects different types of employees. For example, workers in positions that are easier to replace might suffer more from at-will employment, whereas those in specialized roles might have more leverage.

Perhaps I should look into some statistics or studies that have been done on this topic. Do countries that have stricter rules about firing employees have higher job satisfaction or lower unemployment rates? Or maybe the opposite?

Wait, I should also consider the perspective of small business owners. They might argue that rigid firing rules make it harder for them to manage their workforce effectively, which could stifle business growth.

Alternatively, employees might argue that without protections, they are vulnerable to being fired for unfair reasons, even if those reasons aren't explicitly illegal.

I wonder if there are any middle grounds here. Maybe laws could be designed to allow firing without cause but still provide some safeguards for employees, like severance packages or access to unemployment benefits.

Let me think about what other options are out there. Some countries have laws that make it harder to fire employees, but they also make it harder to hire them, leading to higher unemployment rates, especially among younger workers.

On the flip side, in places with very flexible labor markets, there might be higher job turnover, which could be good for some but bad for others.

I should probably look into what the law is in different parts of the world. For instance, in Europe, many countries have stronger employment protections compared to the U.S.

Maybe I should search for "at-will employment by country" to see which countries follow this doctrine and which don't.

HR Management & Compliance
European Employment Law 101: Employment At-Will Is Truly a Foreign Concept
By Stephen Bruce, PhD, PHR Apr 7, 2013 HR Management & Compliance
Updated: Apr 7, 2013
European employment laws differ significantly from U.S. employment laws. One of the biggest conceptual differences is the unique U.S. employment at-will doctrine—which does not exist in European employment law. Naturally, understanding this difference (among many others) is especially important when dealing with the European Union and its member states. Many U.S. employers have made mistakes and found out the hard way that errors can be costly, both in terms of dollars and time.
European Employment Law 101: Indefinite Employment vs. Employment At-Will
“The world’s employment law regimes really divide into two parts: there’s employment at-will—which is only the U.S.—and then there’s everybody else.” Don Dowling Jr. told us in a recent BLR webinar. Most other countries have indefinite employment. They regulate employment, but you can’t fire people for no reason as you can in the U.S. If an employer operating in Europe wants to terminate an employee, specific legal procedures must be followed.
Even if you get to the point – after going through all of the legal procedures – that you can fire an employee, you still have to pay severance pay or notice pay – which can be very expensive – unless you have good cause.
“Good cause in these countries, by the way, is very steep. The analogy I like to use . . . is the U.S. unemployment system with the concept of willful misconduct.” Dowling explained. In fact, the definition of good cause in every country is different. In short, there are very few reasons that an employer would not be liable for the severance pay, and the time frame that severance can be months or even years.
There are also some other concepts related to indefinite employment: constructive discharge and vested rights. The idea of constructive discharge refers to the concept of changing the terms of employment to the point that the employee wants to leave—done with the intention of forcing the employee out without being liable for the severance pay. That act is called constructive discharge—the employee is not technically fired, but for all intents and purposes they were.
Naturally the courts do not want to allow this to happen. As such, employees in many countries can place a claim against the employer for changes in the terms and conditions of employment (the employee’s vested rights), stating it is a form of constructive discharge and is not allowed without paying severance.
European Employment Law 101: Regulating Employment Terms
Another difference in European employment law versus U.S. employment law is the fact that in the U.S., fewer aspects of the employment relationship are regulated. For example, the U.S. is one of the few countries that does not have mandatory vacation laws. In Europe there are laws that relate to employee benefits, caps on hours worked, vacation allowances, holidays, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, written employment contracts, and more. Of course the U.S. does have a few laws, such as the FMLA, HIPAA, and the FLSA, but these only provide minimal benefits in comparison to European employment law requirements.
“By European standards – and even Latin American and African and Asian standards – the Family and Medical Leave Act is stingy because it doesn’t give any paid leave. The people who go off on maternity leave or on FMLA leave don’t have a legal right to get paid. All we’re doing is holding open their job . . . by European standards, that’s laughable.” Dowling explained.
European Employment Law 101: Legally-Mandated Written Employment Contracts
Yet another difference between European employment law and U.S. employment law is the requirement of written employment contracts. While uncommon in the U.S., they’re legally-required in Europe.
“In the U.S., because we’re employment-at-will, employers are shy or reluctant to give employment agreements.” Dowling noted. However, the reality is that U.S. employment agreements exist, they’re just typically oral agreements. If someone is employed, they have a contractual right to get paid, even without a written contract. Even though it’s terminable at will, it does exist.
“In Europe, they make you give a written employment agreement.” Dowling told us. “There’s actually a European Union directive that requires written employment agreements or statements of terms and conditions of employment. They call them statements of employment particulars.” In short, employers in Europe have to give everybody a written agreement that covers the list of topics like the place of work, pay rate, title, office hours, etc. It has to be in writing and can’t be changed without agreement from the employee.
That said, it’s also important to realize that written employment contracts in Europe (and everywhere else abroad) actually protect the employer. The employer usually has the burden of proof in an employment claim, and the employer has this document to show the terms. This is the first line of defense against claims, and employers use them to protect themselves.

Is Arizona an At-Will Employment State?
Is Arizona an At-Will Employment State?
Introduction to At-Will Employment in Arizona
The 50 states that comprise the United States can be divided into two categories when it comes to employment law: those states that are considered “at-will” employment states and those that are not. To be sure, the majority of states fall into the former category, including Arizona. This is not an unimportant distinction: Whether the state in which you are employed is considered “at-will” or not affects the rights and protections you have in the event your employer seeks to terminate your employment.
What At-Will Employment Really Means
In theory, “at will” employment means that either you or your employer can terminate your employment with the company for which you work at any time. If you are the employee, this means that you do not have to provide your employer with any type of notice or warning before quitting your job (although you may wish to do so as a matter of professional courtesy). You may quit your job for any number of reasons, or for no reason at all. Even if your employer were to ask for the reason you are quitting your job, you do not need to provide any reason to your employer.
In theory, “at will” employment also means that your employer can terminate you from your job for any reason and without any warning. Your employer could conceivably meet you at the door to your office, hand you a pink slip, and tell you to clean out your office. In practice, however, an employer simply cannot terminate an employee for any reason.
Worker Rights in At-Will Employment States
Even in a state like Arizona that has declared itself to be an “at will” employment state, employers’ hands remain slightly tied when it comes to terminating workers. Although employers still do not have to provide any warning or advance notice to workers prior to terminating their employment, employers may not:
Terminate an employee where there is an “implied contract.” For example, if the employee handbook states that employees will not be terminated except for just cause, then an employer may not terminate an employee without just cause. In other words, before an employer terminates an employee in this situation the employer must provide the employee with the reason for the termination (and the reason must be something like a violation of company rules or a criminal offense) or else the termination may be considered wrongful.
Terminate an employee in violation of public policy. Even in at-will states, an employer may not terminate an employee on the basis of any protected classification (religion, age, sex, etc.). Moreover, the prohibition against terminating an employee in violation of public policy would protect employees from being terminated for bringing unsafe or criminal activity to the attention of the proper authorities, supporting a particular political cause or candidate in the employee’s free time, or engaging in other socially beneficial activities.
What Happens When a Worker is Terminated for an Illegal Reason?
A worker who has been fired for an unlawful reason may have the ability to bring a wrongful termination lawsuit against the employer to recover damages. Before he or she can do this, however, a complaint must be timely filed with the Arizona Attorney General’s office and/or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (depending on whether the employee believes his or her state or federal rights were violated). Once these entities have finished their investigation and have not been able to resolve the dispute satisfactorily, then the employee will be given the ability to file a wrongful termination lawsuit in court. A successful suit may result in lost wages being awarded, reinstatement to the worker’s previous position, and/or other damages and compensation.  Find out more about whether Arizona is an at-will employment state by contacting the experienced attorneys at My AZ Legal Team, PLLC.

At-Will Employment - Overview
At-Will Employment - Overview
4/15/2008
Please note NCSL cannot provide advice or assistance to private citizens or businesses regarding  employment-related matters.  Please consult your state department of labor or a private attorney.
I.  The At-Will Presumption
Employment relationships are presumed to be “at-will” in all U.S. states except Montana.  The U.S. is one of a handful of countries where employment is predominantly at-will.  Most countries throughout the world allow employers to dismiss employees only for cause.   Some reasons given for our retention of the at-will presumption include respect for freedom of contract, employer deference, and the belief that both employers and employees favor an at-will employment relationship over job security.
A.  At-Will Defined
At-will means that an employer can terminate an employee at any time for any reason, except an illegal one, or for no reason without incurring legal liability.  Likewise, an employee is free to leave a job at any time for any or no reason with no adverse legal consequences.
At-will also means that an employer can change the terms of the employment relationship with no notice and no consequences.  For example, an employer can alter wages, terminate benefits, or reduce paid time off.  In its unadulterated form, the U.S. at-will rule leaves employees vulnerable to arbitrary and sudden dismissal, a limited or on-call work schedule depending on the employer’s needs, and unannounced cuts in pay and benefits.
B.  Modification by Contract
The at-will presumption is a default rule that can be modified by contract.  For example, a contract may provide for a specific term of employment or allow termination for cause only.  Typically, U.S. companies negotiate individual employment agreements only with high-level employees.  Collective bargaining agreements usually provide that represented employees may only be terminated for cause.
Cause generally includes reasons such as poor employee performance, employee misconduct, or economic necessity.  An employment contract may specifically outline the situations or employee actions that would lead to termination for cause.
II.  Common Law Exceptions to the At-Will Presumption
Over the years, courts have carved out exceptions to the at-will presumption to mitigate its sometimes harsh consequences.  The three major common law exceptions are public policy, implied contract, and implied covenant of good faith.
The at-will presumption is strong, however, and it can be difficult for an employee to prove that his circumstances fall within one of the exceptions.  Further, not all of the exceptions are recognized by all jurisdictions.
A.  Public Policy
The most widely recognized common law exception to the at-will presumption protects employees against adverse employment actions that violate a public interest.  This common law exception is similar to, and may overlap with, the retaliation exception described below.  Some courts have refused to recognize a separate public policy tort where a statutory remedy is available.
States that recognize the public policy exception vary significantly in how broadly or narrowly it is construed.  The majority of states accept only public policy expressed in state constitutions and statutes.  A minority also allow additional sources that may include administrative rules and regulations, professional codes of ethics, and broader notions of public good and civic duty.
The American Law Institute’s proposed Restatement (Third) of Employment Law identifies four categories within the public policy exception:
Category
Example(s)
1)  Refusing to perform an act that state law prohibits.
Refusing an employer’s request to commit perjury at a trial.
2)  Reporting a violation of the law.
Reporting an employer’s fraudulent accounting practices or use of child labor.
3)  Engaging in acts that are in the public interest.
Joining the National Guard or performing jury duty.
4)  Exercising a statutory right.
Filing a claim under the state workers’ compensation law.
B. Implied Contract
Implied contracts of employment are recognized in 41 states and the District of Columbia, but even where recognized may be difficult for a plaintiff to prove.   An implied contract may be created in several different ways.  Oral assurances by a supervisor or employer representative (e.g., “We need good people around here, you’ve got a job for life!” or “We don’t dismiss employees without giving them a chance to correct their behavior.”) may give rise to an implied contract.  Likewise, the employer’s handbooks, policies, practices or other written assurances may create an implied contract.
Thus, even though there is no express written contract between the employer and an individual employee, that employee may have an expectation of  fixed term or even indefinite employment based on a supervisor’s statement, an employer’s practice of only firing employees for cause, or an assertion in the employee handbook that specific termination procedures will be followed.  The list of examples above is not exhaustive.
As a general rule, courts disregard language promising long-term, lifetime, or permanent employment as aspirational and consider the relationship to be at-will.  Employers can further protect themselves by using a clear and unambiguous disclaimer on written materials stating that its policies and procedures do not create contractual rights.  Employers can also reserve the right to modify policies and procedures at any time.
In states with a statute of frauds, the requirement that contracts of over a year be in writing creates an additional hurdle to employee claims involving oral assurances.
C.  Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
A minority of states recognize an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in employment relationships.  Judicial interpretations of this covenant have varied from requiring just cause for termination to prohibiting terminations made in bad faith or motivated by malice.
Examples of bad faith terminations include an employer firing an older employee to avoid paying retirement benefits or terminating a salesman just before a large commission on a completed sale is payable.  There have been relatively few cases in which employers were found liable under an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing theory.
D.  Additional Tort-Based Claims Limiting At-Will Employment
At-will employees may also bring claims against their employers for the following torts:
Intentional interference with a contract.  This claim may be made in the employment context when a supervisor or co-worker with an improper motive  successfully induces the employee’s dismissal.  This tort is not recognized in all jurisdictions.
Intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Restatement (Second) of Torts defines this tort as extreme and outrageous conduct that intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress.  In many courts, even serious emotional and psychological abuse may not be outrageous enough to establish liability.
E.  Promissory Estoppel
An employer could be estopped from firing an employer, or required to pay damages, if the employee can show the following:
The employer made a clear and unambiguous promise of employment;
The employee relied on this promise;
The employee's reliance was reasonable and foreseeable; and
The employee was injured as a result.
Imagine an individual who receives and accepts a job offer, quits his current employment, and then relocates his family to the city where the new job is located.   Before his first day with the new employer, he is terminated.  An individual in this situation may have a promissory estoppel claim.
It is difficult for a plaintiff to prove all of the promissory estoppel elements, especially in an employment context.  Some courts reject outright promissory estoppel claims made by an at-will employee by contending that an employee cannot reasonably rely on a promise of employment if the employment is at-will.
In any case, promissory estoppel provides only a limited remedy in comparison to a breach of contract claim.  This is because damages are calculated based on the individual’s previous employment, and not on the promised employment.
III.  Statutory Exceptions to the At-Will Presumption
In addition to the common-law exceptions outlined above, there are also several statutory exception to the at-will employment doctrine.
A.  Illegal Discrimination
Federal and state discrimination statutes prohibit employers from basing employment decisions on an employee’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status.  Specific state statutes may also protect employees from discrimination based on other factors, such as sexual orientation.
It is important to recognize that discrimination statutes shield members of protected classes only from adverse employment actions made because of their membership in a protected class.   In other words, an employer may fire Jane because she failed to perform the required functions of her job, but not because she is in a wheelchair.
1.  Protections for an Employee’s Off-Duty Activities
A few states have enacted legislation to protect employees from adverse employment actions resulting from legal off-duty activities.  In Colorado, CRS § 24-34-402.5 was originally known as the Smoker’s Rights Act, but actually protects any legal off-duty activities conducted away from the employer’s premises.  North Dakota adopted a similarly broad statute.  Legislation enacted by Indiana, New Jersey, Oregon, and South Dakota specifically prohibits employer discrimination against smokers.
There are limits even to Colorado’s expansive act.  The legislation allows employers to constrain the lawful, off-duty activities of their employees when 1) the restriction relates to bona fide occupational activity; 2) is reasonably and rationally related to the employment activities and responsibilities; or 3) is necessary to avoid an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of one.
B.  Retaliation
Retaliation is another statute-based exception to the at-will presumption.  Federal and/or state laws prohibit employers from firing employees in retaliation for engaging in legally proper, necessary, or desirable activities.  Example of protected activities include claiming minimum wage or overtime compensation, engaging in union activities, opposing unlawful discriminatory practices, filing for workers' compensation, and "whistleblowing."
1.  Whistleblowing
While most states provide whistleblower protection for public sector employees, protection for private sector employees is more limited.  Approximately seventeen states have enacted whistleblower statutes that protect private sector employees from adverse employment actions if they report an employer’s wrongdoing.  Please see our compilation of state whistleblower statutes for citations and summaries.
Where there is no general state statute, private employees are left with a patchwork of federal and state statutes that address a wide variety of issues including workplace health and safety, environmental protection, accounting fraud, and discrimination, that also include whistleblower protections.  The challenge for employees in these jurisdictions is to find a statute that applies to their particular circumstances.
IV.  Montana’s Good Cause Rule
The Montana Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act of 1987 (WDEA) created a cause of action for employees who believe that they were terminated without good cause.  Although similar legislation has been introduced elsewhere, Montana is so far the only state to have passed a law with such far-reaching effects.
A.  Statutory Provisions
The statute prohibits discharge for other than good cause after a designated probationary period and gives the employee the right to challenge a termination in court or before an arbitrator.  The statute also limits damages to up to four years of lost wages, including the value of fringe benefits, with interest.  See Mont. Code Ann. §§ 39-2-901 through 39-2-915.
B.  Legislative History
Beginning in 1982, the  Montana Supreme Court made a series of pro-plaintiff decisions that expanded the good faith and fair dealing exception to the at-will employment rule.  These decision created uncertainty for employers, and led them to advocate for a more consistent regime.  In essence, Montana employers were willing to trade certainty and limitations on damages for constraints on their ability to fire employees at-will.
V.  Conclusion
Although both common-law and statutory exceptions to the at-will rule exist, the presumption remains an important feature of the U.S. employment landscape.  While an employee may be able to make a variety of claims, they can be hard to prove.  In addition, not all claims are recognized in all jurisdictions and judicial interpretations of common law protections may be broadly or narrowly construed.  Thus far, Montana is the only state to have completely eliminated the at-will rule.

10. At-Will Rule
What Is the Employment At-Will Definition?
Employment at-will is a legal definition that is listed on employee contracts, or included in employee handbooks, to indicate that they are being employed "at-will." This definition allows an employee to be fired at any time for any reason with few exceptions. This added description gives you little recourse to legally fight your termination, as your employer does not need to show just cause for letting you go.
The only state that protects employees is the state of Montana, which extends employee protection to being fired without cause to those employees who have successfully completed a set probationary period.
Being employed at-will also gives employees the right to quit or leave their jobs without providing a reason. Even though at-will employment had been steadily increasing over time, many employees are shocked to learn that their employment is deemed at-will.
The only way that you can fight termination as an at-will employee is if the employer violates your employee rights, or violates labor laws.
Not only does at-will employment mean that employees can be terminated without reason, but it also means that the terms of their employment can be altered at any time for any reason. This can include termination of benefits, reduced time off, or changes in hours or wages.
What Is At-Will Presumption?
The United States is one of a few countries where at-will employment is predominant, while most other countries require cause for dismissal of an employee. The most common reasons for the prevalence of at-will employment in the U.S. is linked to:
The desire for freedom from contract
The belief that at-will employment is still favored by both employer and employee
Employer deference
Most employment in the U.S. defaults to the at-will rule unless the employment agreement is modified by a contract that requires cause to be shown in the event of termination. This is typically done only at higher levels of employment. In the U.S., these requirements can also be found in collective bargaining agreements where unions agree to employment contracts that usually require cause to be shown for termination.
How Does Employment At-Will Affect Termination Notice?
Just as an employer can terminate an employee's employment at any time, the employee is likewise able to terminate their employment at any time without having to give cause. Employment at-will was not created to simply allow employers to terminate without reason, but to give both employers and employees the freedom to continue employment when desired, and terminate when they feel it is necessary.
Even though at-will employment allows employers to terminate an employee at any time without cause, it is important for employers to check state laws before terminating, as some states will have additional requirements when it comes to at-will employment.
How Do I Know If I Have a Claim for Wrongful Termination?
While an employee may be considered at-will, termination may still be illegal if it is done in violation of labor laws, due to discrimination, or violates other state and federal laws that protect an employee's rights. You also may have the right to file a suit if the employer's termination of your employment was done in retaliation for you exercising a legal right, such as filing a harassment claim or reporting the company for a violation. There are also additional situations in which you may be able to file a wrongful termination claim. Some of these instances include:
Termination for refusal to perform an illegal act
Termination for time off work that is protected under law, such as voting
When filing suit for a wrongful termination, you can file for damages for:
Back pay
Promotion
Reinstatement
Injunctive relief
Reasonable accommodations
Compensatory damages
Front pay
If you have an employment contract with an employer, even an implied one, and they terminate you without cause, you may be entitled to file a legal claim on the basis of breach of contract.
For cases of breach of contract or wrongful termination, it is in the best interest of both parties to retain the services of an employment lawyer.
What Is an Employment Contract?
An employment contract is an agreement between the employer and employee that outlines the basic duties of the job as well as the start date, salary, and benefits.  Employers may have a different contract for different duties in the company.  In these contracts may be verbiage that requires the employer to show cause when terminating employment.
Common Elements That May or May Not Be on Your Employment Contract
Employee contracts can vary widely from company to company, and depend on the position it covers. Some of the items that may be contained in an employment contract include:
Confidentiality, or "non-disclosure" agreements, which require that the employee agree to not share any records or divulge any company information with others
Non-compete agreements, which are when an employee agrees to not work for a competing company, nor engage in any business in direct competition with the company for a stated period of time after employment has ended
Ownership of inventions, which states that an employee who invents as part of their employment agrees that anything invented during, and within the scope of employment, will become the rights of the employer
Exclusive employment, which is where the employee agrees that they will not work for any other company similar to their current business while under contract with the company
No additional compensation, which states that the employee will not be entitled to additional pay if they achieve a position on a committee or serve as an officer
Termination, which entitles either party to terminate the employment at any time for any reason even if it is due to health concerns or injury
Arbitration, which is when the employee agrees to use arbitration or mediation for the resolution of employment disputes instead of seeking recourse in court
Choice of law, which is part of the agreement that states that if a lawsuit should ever arise, it will fall under the regulation of the state in which it is filed
What Is an Implied Contract?
An implied contract is a contract that can be established in other ways aside from being provided in formal wiring. Currently, 41 states as well as the District of Columbia, recognize implied contracts for legal proceedings. Implied contracts are created between an employee and employer in one of several ways.
Oral assurances – Assurances for cause for termination that is implied by a supervisor or employer through the use of such statements as "we don't dismiss employees without giving them a second chance," can be construed as an implied contract to provide cause for termination.
Employer handbooks and policies – Language used in policy manuals or other written documentation that implies employees will not be terminated without cause, or that there is a certain procedure followed before termination can create an implied contract.
Since implied contracts can be held as binding agreements in many states in the U.S. if employers want to protect themselves from wrongful termination suits, it is in their best interest to create a clearly written, unambiguous disclaimer stating that provided written materials of policies and procedures do not create a contractual employment right. It is also important to note that employers can modify their set policies and procedures at any time.
Exceptions to At-Will Employment
While employment without a contract stating otherwise is legally regarded as an at-will employment agreement, there are exceptions to the at-will employer's right to terminate without cause. Employers can still be held liable for wrongful termination if:
The employee is covered under a collective bargaining agreement
There is an employee contract requiring cause for termination
Discrimination plays a role in the termination
If public policy had been violated
If company policy states specific guidelines for termination
If there was an implied contract
If there was an implied covenant of good faith
Having an implied contract is one of the most common claims for wrongful termination. An implied contract could prohibit an employer from firing an employee without cause even if a legal document was not drafted regarding such rights. The burden of proof in these cases lies with the employee and often is difficult to prove. Implied contracts are often discovered through employee handbooks or policy manuals where the employer states that it is not an at-will employer and they will not fire an employee without cause.
Another common case brought for wrongful termination suits is the exception known as implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  This prevents employers from terminating an employee in an attempt to avoid their duties to the employee, such as providing health care, retirement benefits, or providing commission owed.
The public policy exception states that an employer is unable to fire their employee if the act violates the state's public policy. This can occur when an employee is fired for a reason that benefited the public. There are seven states in the U.S. that do not recognize public policy and they include Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, and Florida.
It is important to note that not all of these exceptions are recognized in all jurisdictions, and that states may also have additional exceptions or regulations regarding at-will employee termination.
Additional Tort-Based Claims Limiting At-Will Employment
There are also additional tort claims that can be filed as a result of at-will employment, including:
Intentional interference with a contract – This claim can be made when a coworker or supervisor has an improper motive that is successful in creating the employee's dismissal. This type of claim is not recognized in all state jurisdictions.
Intentional infliction of emotional distress – This tort claim charges the employer with extreme and outrageous conduct that either recklessly or intentionally may result in severe emotional distress to the employee. Under some court jurisdictions, even severe emotional and psychological abuse can fail to fall into the outrageous claim enough to establish liability.
There is also a chance for a tort claim if it is proven that an employer made a clear and unambiguous promise of employment. For this claim to work, it must be proven that the employee relied on the promise of employment, the employee's reliance was reasonable, and the employee was somehow injured as a result. An example of this could be an employee who relocates their family and uproots their life to accept a new job offer in a new city. Upon arrival, or even before the first day of employment, the offer is terminated. The individual would most likely have a case for a promissory claim. Some courts may outright reject these types of claims under the premise that because employment is at-will, the employee should not reasonably rely on any promise of employment made by a current or new employer. When this claim is successful, the damages awarded to the plaintiff will be based on the employee's previous salary and not what was promised in the new job.
At-Will Rule
While there are important exceptions to the at-will rule, the presumption of at-will employment is, and will probably remain, an important feature of the U.S. employment landscape. At-will employment is often supported in the courts, and the burden of proof in wrongful termination claims falls on the employee who may find the claims hard to prove.
At this time, Montana is the only state to have eliminated the at-will rule, and there are many jurisdictions that do not even recognize many of the common exceptions.

Thoughts for U.S. Employers Sending Employees Overseas

Juliet Carp, of Dorsey’s London labor and employment team, offers thoughts on benefit arrangements for international assignees.
“At will” employment is a U.S. thing: The first step is to recognise that “at will” employment is not generally recognised outside the United States. Employees working overseas will almost always have an employment contract (whether or not the employer chooses to document it) and are likely to be protected against “unfair” dismissal and changes to employment terms The key “take aways” for U.S. employers are that benefits are likely to be contractual and employment documents offer an opportunity to reduce employer risk.
​Local rules rule: In most cases mandatory employment laws will apply to employees who work in a particular jurisdiction, and there is little that an employer can do to avoid that. For example, confirming that an employment contract will be “governed by” U.S. law will not usually oust “host” country mandatory employment laws. Mandatory host requirements might include, for example, mandatory sick, maternity or holiday pay; pension provision; contribution to an unemployment fund; or medical cover. Host requirements may be imposed in a variety of ways, e.g., by legislation or “collective agreement.” Watch out for jurisdictions where an employee may be automatically covered by a collective agreement even where no trade union is recognised!
The best of both worlds: Bear in mind that just because an employee is covered by one country’s rules that does not mean that the employee will not be covered by another country’s rules. The legal rules on applicable laws are complicated and vary between jurisdictions. Employees sometimes enjoy no protection at all or the best of both worlds! Check before terms are settled. An example of this might be a host requirement to offer a 13th month salary payment – easy to adjust pay to achieve the same net result if you know about the requirement before annual salary is confirmed to the employee.
It’s not fair! Employment contracts are not commercial contracts. In most jurisdictions the unequal bargaining power of employer and employee is recognised and there are many areas where public policy will override employer preferences. What you offer will not necessarily be what you are required to deliver. Take particular care with discretion. Making it clear that a benefit (e.g., bonus or particular medical cover) is discretionary may not work for some jurisdictions. And don’t try to work round employee friendly courts or tribunals by inserting US-style arbitration clauses without thought -- this can increase risk in some jurisdictions.
Tax: Unlike domestic employees, internationally mobile employees will typically be subject to tax and social security requirements in more than one jurisdiction. Employers should think through potential consequences carefully. Should support with tax returns etc. be offered? Should the employee be offered tax protection or equalisation, and if so on what terms? Can benefits be structured to reduce cost?
Get the employer right: The identity of an expatriate’s employer can make a huge difference to assignment costs. Make sure that the practical benefit arrangements and the way they are documented support the identity of the preferred employer.
What are the benefits for? Benefits for expatriates are expensive. Be clear about why they are being offered so that costs can be assessed appropriately. For example:
For compliance, e.g., paid holiday, sickness or maternity leave.
To persuade the employee to go, e.g., by paying American school fees.
To reduce uncertainty about the value of remuneration, e.g., by offering tax equalisation or cost of living allowances
For security, e.g., by providing a car and driver and forbidding use of public transport.
To “put the employee right”, e.g., by covering relocation and repatriation or additional housing costs.
To reduce distraction from the job, e.g., by providing home search support.
Sometimes businesses decide that cash is a better alternative because it encourages the right attitude.
Don’t forget the family: Expatriate benefits are exceptional in that they often have a very direct effect on family members. For example, schooling, housing and flights home may be critical. Never underestimate the importance of “buy in” from the employee’s family or the real value of relatively low cost or informal benefits, like assistance with obtaining a work permit for a partner or social support from colleagues. International assignments frequently fail – sometimes expensively – because families’ needs cannot be met.
Equality: Expatriate benefits are typically linked to “home” country and family. Make sure equality, and potential mitigation strategies, are properly considered before the package is finalised.
Forwards, backwards, sideways: Sometimes the most valuable thing a lawyer can do is to focus minds on the future, including “worst case scenarios.” What happens if host laws change; if benefit costs increase, when the assignment ends? Anticipation can make difference to the financial outcome. Who will bear the costs of breaking a long term lease? Does the reason for termination of the assignment make a difference?  It is important to look backwards, as well as forwards, and to consider the impact on the expatriate personally. For example, does a broad tax equalisation policy cover the employee for the impact of surprise future inheritance, relocation post termination or the detrimental impact of the assignment on the employee’s rights under a previous employer’s share plan?  If not, is it worth making the scope of the promise clear from the outset?  This is not just about managing potential exit costs or reducing the risk of dispute. It is about supporting a positive and trustful employment relationship.
Get the documents right: Expatriates generally need detailed employment documents, not just to protect employer and employee, but because public authorities in a variety of jurisdictions may refer to them, e.g., labor inspectorates, immigration officials, tax, social security or pension authorities.  Clear documents will naturally help with those interactions.  More importantly, clear documents help manage employee – and family – expectations, and increase the likelihood of a happy and successful new assignment.

Okay, so from what I've gathered, at-will employment is a doctrine that allows both employers and employees to terminate the employment relationship at any time, for any reason, without needing to provide justification, as long as it's not an illegal reason. This is primarily an American concept, and most other countries require employers to have a good reason to fire employees.

I looked up how at-will employment works in different countries, and it seems that only the U.S. operates under this doctrine, while the rest of the world requires employers to have cause to terminate employees. This makes me wonder about the implications of such a system.

In the U.S., at-will employment can be modified by contract, meaning that if there's an employment contract specifying certain terms, like requiring cause for termination, then the at-will doctrine doesn't apply. Also, there are exceptions to the at-will principle based on public policy, implied contracts, and other legal doctrines.

I found that Montana is the only state in the U.S. that has moved away from at-will employment, providing some protections to employees. This makes me curious about why other states haven't followed suit.

When considering whether the law should allow employers to fire employees without a good reason, I need to weigh the pros and cons.

On one hand, at-will employment gives employers flexibility. They can quickly address underperformance or changes in business needs without the burden of proving cause for termination. This flexibility might make employers more willing to hire, knowing they can adjust their workforce as needed.

On the other hand, at-will employment can lead to insecurity among employees. Knowing that they can be fired at any moment without reason might discourage employees from speaking up about issues, taking risks, or even reporting misconduct, fearing retaliation.

Moreover, at-will employment can lead to abuses, such as firing employees for discriminatory reasons, even if it's technically illegal. Proving discrimination can be challenging, so having at-will employment might make it easier for some employers to engage in unfair practices.

I also thought about how at-will employment affects different types of workers. For example, temporary or contract workers might be more vulnerable under an at-will system, as they have even less job security.

Looking at international comparisons, countries that require just cause for termination seem to have more stable employment relationships, which might lead to higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates. However, these systems can also make it harder for employers to manage their workforce efficiently, potentially leading to higher unemployment rates, especially among less skilled workers.

I need to consider both sides carefully. Perhaps there's a middle ground where employees have some protections against arbitrary termination, but employers still have the flexibility they need to manage their businesses.

Maybe implementing a system where employers need to provide a reason for termination, but not necessarily "just cause," could be a compromise. This way, employees have some assurance that they won't be fired without any explanation, but employers aren't locked into keeping underperforming employees.

Alternatively, providing severance packages or notice periods for terminations could soften the blow of at-will employment, giving employees some financial cushion or time to find new employment.

I also think about how different industries might require different approaches. For instance, in fast-paced tech industries, flexibility might be crucial, while in more stable sectors, job security could be more important.

Furthermore, the power dynamics between employers and employees play a significant role. In a tight job market where employers have many candidates to choose from, at-will employment might favor employers excessively, leading to exploitation.

On the contrary, in a job market with high demand for certain skills, employees might have more bargaining power and could negotiate better terms, potentially reducing the impact of at-will employment.

I should also consider the impact on small businesses versus large corporations. Small businesses might need more flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances, while larger companies have more resources to manage their workforce with structured processes.

Moreover, the concept of "good cause" needs to be defined clearly. What constitutes just cause for termination can vary widely, and without clear guidelines, it could lead to inconsistencies and potential discrimination.

I recall that some states have laws that protect employees from being fired for engaging in certain activities, like voting or serving on a jury. These are examples of public policy exceptions to the at-will doctrine. Perhaps expanding such exceptions could provide more protection without completely abolishing at-will employment.

Another angle is the role of collective bargaining. Unions can negotiate contracts that require just cause for termination, providing protections for their members. However, not all workers are unionized, especially in the U.S., where union membership is relatively low compared to other developed countries.

I think it's essential to strike a balance between employer needs and employee rights. Perhaps requiring employers to have a legitimate reason for termination, as opposed to any reason, could be a fair approach.

Legitimate reasons could include poor performance, misconduct, or business necessity. This way, employers can still manage their workforce effectively, but employees have some safeguard against arbitrary or unfair treatment.

Additionally, providing unemployment benefits or severance pay to terminated employees could help mitigate the negative impacts of at-will employment.

I should also consider the legal costs and complexities that come with allowing employees to sue for wrongful termination. In states where it's easier to bring such claims, there might be an increase in litigation, which could deter some employers from hiring.

However, if the legal framework is clear and provides reasonable protections, it could foster a more stable and productive work environment in the long run.

I found that in some European countries, employment laws make it difficult to fire employees, which can lead to higher unemployment rates, particularly among young people and marginalized groups. This is because employers are hesitant to hire if they can't easily let go of employees when needed.

This is known as the "rigid labor market" problem, where strict employment protections can discourage hiring and lead to higher structural unemployment.

On the other hand, in the U.S., despite at-will employment, unemployment rates can still be high during economic downturns. So, it's not entirely clear that at-will employment leads to lower unemployment rates.

Perhaps the key is to have a labor market that balances flexibility with protections, tailoring the approach to the specific economic and social context of each country.

In conclusion, while at-will employment provides significant flexibility to employers, it also exposes employees to the risk of arbitrary termination. Implementing适度的保护措施，如要求雇主提供正当理由或给予合理的解雇通知期，可能是在保障雇主需求和员工权益之间取得平衡的一种方式。这样的做法可以在不牺牲雇主灵活性的同时，为员工提供一定的安全感和公正待遇。

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, the law should allow employers to fire employees without a good reason, but with certain protections in place to prevent abuse.}} \]
