So I'm trying to figure out why fast food is so popular. At first glance, it seems pretty straightforward—people like fast food because it's quick and convenient. But I think there's more to it than that. Maybe I should consider some different factors that contribute to its popularity.

Let me start by thinking about what fast food actually is. Fast food is basically pre-made food that can be prepared and served very quickly. It's often mass-produced in centralized locations and then distributed to various outlets. The most common types are burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, and sodas, but nowadays, fast food includes a lot of other options too, like salads, wraps, and even some healthier choices.

One of the main reasons fast food is popular is certainly its convenience. People have busy lives, and they don't always have time to cook meals from scratch. Fast food places are designed for quick service—you can order your food and get it in minutes, sometimes even faster. Plus, a lot of them offer drive-thru services, so you can order without even getting out of your car. That's really appealing to people who are always on the go.

Another factor is the pricing. Fast food is generally inexpensive compared to eating at sit-down restaurants. It's affordable for just about everyone, including families on a budget and college students. The business model of fast food chains allows them to keep costs low by sourcing ingredients in bulk and standardizing their operations.

Marketing also plays a huge role in the popularity of fast food. These companies spend billions of dollars each year on advertising, targeting not just adults but also children through cartoons, toys, and character promotions. Kids especially love fast food because of the fun toys that come with meals and the overall festive atmosphere of places like McDonald's or Burger King.

Moreover, fast food has become a part of our culture. It's synonymous with American cuisine, and many people associate it with comfort and familiarity. Even when traveling to other countries, you can often find international chains like McDonald's, which provides a sense of continuity and safety for tourists.

But I also think that the taste plays a significant role. Fast food is designed to be delicious, often using flavors that are universally appealing, like salt, sugar, and fat. These are elements that our brains are wired to crave, so it's no wonder that fast food is so addictive for many people.

However, there's been a lot of criticism lately about the health implications of fast food. It's well-known that fast food is high in calories, saturated fats, sodium, and sugars, which can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. So, why is it still so popular despite these known risks?

Maybe because the immediate gratification outweighs the long-term consequences for many people. It's easy to choose convenience over health when you're hungry and in a hurry. Additionally, not everyone has access to fresh, healthy food options, especially in certain neighborhoods or regions. This is often referred to as a "food desert," where the only readily available food is from fast food chains or convenience stores.

Furthermore, fast food chains have been adapting to changing consumer preferences by offering healthier menu options. They've added salads, grilled chicken, and fruit cups to their menus to attract health-conscious customers. So, in a way, they're evolving to meet the demands of their audience.

I should probably look up some statistics to support these points. Let me see what data is available on fast food consumption.

FAQs
How many times a week does the average American eat fast food?
In 2018, 31.57% of Americans claimed that they ate fast food one to three times every week. In that same year, 15.8% of Americans said that they ate fast food between four and six times every week. Finally, only 5.65% of Americans said they ate fast food seven to nine times every week.
This shows that the most popular amount of times an average American will eat fast food in a week is around one to three times. In the same survey, it was estimated that around 14.55% of Americans don’t ever eat at fast-food restaurants.
What age group eats the most fast food?
It would appear that the age group that eats the most fast food is people between the ages of 20 and 39. Studies show that 45% of Americans in this age group consume fast food on an average day.
As people get older, however, they tend to consume less fast food less frequently, with only 24.1% of those over the age of 60 only consuming fast food on an average day.
It is likely that those who are older than 39 are more concerned with the healthy eating statistics, and those younger than 20 can’t afford any money spent on fast food.
How much fast food does the average person eat?
On an average day, 84.8 million Americans will eat fast food. That’s a large amount of fast food, and it will definitely affect the American health statistics. Unfortunately, we can’t determine exactly how much fast food each person will consume in that time.
However, we do know that the average American adult used up 11.3% of their daily intake of calories by eating fast food. This is according to information gathered between 2007 and 2010.
Why do people eat fast food?
Many people all over the world choose to consume fast food for a variety of reasons. For starters, it is convenient. McDonald’s statistics of sales are so high because they make food extremely convenient. People can access their fast food without even getting out of their car.
Secondly, it’s often cheaper than healthier alternatives. A healthy meal that’s already prepared will generally cost more than fast food. Finally, the reason that people consume fast food is that it’s tasty due to the high fat, sodium, and sugar contents.
Conclusion
Millions of people purchase food from fast-food restaurants around the world. That’s one thing that’s clear when you look at the above fast-food statistics. There are all sorts of fast-food brands out there, with McDonald’s being the most popular in the United States by far.
Of course, there are many health issues that come with consuming too much fast food, and people should be wary about how much they consume. So next time you want to pick up a burger or a pizza, be mindful of what you’re eating.

Fast food has become a major part of the American diet, and a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals just how many adults eat it.
Between 2013 and 2016, about 37 percent of U.S. adults consumed fast food on any given day, according to the data brief published Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics.
"On any given day in the United States, an estimated 36.6 percent or approximately 84.8 million adults consume fast food," said Cheryl Fryar, first author of the report and a health statistician at the CDC.
"We focused on fast food for this report because fast food has played an important role in the American diet in recent decades," she said. "Fast food has been associated with poor diet and increased risk of obesity."
Fast foods tend to be high in calories, fat, salt and sugar, which -- when consumed in excess -- can be associated with obesity, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, among other health risks.
On average, adults in the US consumed 11.3 percent of their total daily calories from fast food between 2007 and 2010, according to a National Center for Health Statistics data brief published in 2013.
Who eats the most and least fast food
The new report included data on about 10,000 people 20 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2016.
The data revealed that fast food consumption varied by age, income level, race and sex. For instance, 44.9 percent of adults ages 20 to 39 said that they consumed fast food on a given day, compared with 37.7% of adults 40 to 59, and 24.1 percent of adults 60 and older.
The percentage of adults who said they consumed fast food rose with family income level, according to the report. Overall, 31.7 percent of lower-income, 36.4 percent of middle-income and 42 percent of higher-income adults said they had eaten fast food.
"What surprised me was the finding that income was positively associated with more fast food," said Dr. Lawrence Cheskin, an associate professor and director of clinical research at the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.
"That connection or correlation is opposite of what I perhaps would have expected," he said. "But we need these kinds of studies and these kinds of facts and statistics to get a better understanding of what drives the use of foods that, as a nutrition expert I would say, are not your first choice for a variety of reasons."
Cheskin, who is also director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center, emphasized that foods high in sugar and fat can raise the risk of certain chronic health problems. "People have the lowest health risk when they eat fruits and vegetables and whole grains," he said.
The report also found that a higher percentage of non-Hispanic black adults -- 42.4 percent -- said they consumed fast food than non-Hispanic white adults at 37.6 percent, non-Hispanic Asian adults at 30.6 percent and Hispanic adults at 35.5 percent.
Among those who had eaten fast food, 43.7 percent did so during lunch, 42 percent during dinner, 22.7 percent during breakfast and 22.6 percent as snacks, according to the report.
More men (48.3 percent) than women (39.1 percent) said they ate fast food during lunch. However, more women (25.7 percent) than men (19.5 percent) said they had it as a snack. Among all adults, a higher percentage of men (37.9 percent) than women (35.4 percent) said they ate fast food on a given day.
The report has some limitations, including that the subjects' dietary information was obtained through in-person interviews during which the adults recalled what they had eaten in the past 24 hours. Such recall interviews could lead to underreporting and other issues.
'What we should be scared of is double cheeseburgers'
All in all, the report's findings are what most experts would expect and mirror fast food consumption patterns found among children, said Jennifer Harris, an associate professor in allied health sciences at the University of Connecticut and director of marketing initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, who was not involved in the new CDC report.
"Other studies that have looked at 24-hour dietary recall like this have found a similar thing: that about a third of kids on any given day eat fast food," Harris said.
Last month, a Rudd Center report said that 91 percent of 871 parents who took an online survey said they had purchased lunch or dinner for their child in the previous week at one of the four largest fast-food restaurant chains: McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's or Subway. The survey was conducted in 2016.
"On average, they'd gone 2½ -- actually 2.4 -- times per week. So those numbers are pretty comparable to about a third on any given day," Harris said.
That 91 percent was an increase from 79 percent of 771 parents in a 2010 survey and 83 percent of 835 parents in a 2013 survey, according to the Rudd Center report.
"We do know that fast food advertising has gone up during that time by pretty large amounts. We do know that parents take their children, they say, because it's convenient, it's a good value, and their kids like the food. So all of those are driving purchases of fast food," Harris said.
"The other thing that we suspect is also that the restaurants have been introducing healthier items with their kids' meals," she said, adding that even though there are some healthier options on menus, several items are still high in calories, fat and salt.
"We know for children, on days that they consume fast food, they eat about 120 more calories that day. They also consume more sugar and sodium and fat on the days they eat fast food," she said.
Although fast food is typically higher in unhealthy saturated fat, sodium and calories, it tends to be low in several key nutrients that adult bodies need to flourish and that children's bodies need to grow, said Liz Weinandy, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who was not involved in the new CDC report.
"It is funny, when we see news clips of a shark swimming near a beach, it scares us into not going near that beach. However, what we should be scared of is double cheeseburgers, French fries and large amounts of sugary beverages," Weinandy said.
"Adults can go to the grocery store more and prep food to take on the go so we don't have to get in a situation where we need to rely on fast food so much," she said. "It takes time and some organization. I see many people who are successful at this, though, when they take a couple of hours on the weekend, and again midweek, to prep food and then plan ahead just a little to take some things with them."

Approximately 3% of Americans admit to eating at fast food restaurants at least once a day. That's about 9.5 million people who chow down on quick meals.
8. How many eat it each week?
Around 28% of Americans say they grab fast food at least once a week. Sixteen percent are hitting their favorite restaurants several times weekly.
9. How many eat it just once a month?
33% say they only dine on fast food once or twice a month. About 15% say they try it just a few times a year.
10. What percentage of Americans avoid fast food altogether?
Only a very small percentage of Americans, about 4%, say they never include fast food as part of their diet.
11. Do men or women eat more fast food?
Men are more likely to choose fast food than the fairer sex, but only by a slim margin. Around 53% of men go for fast food once a week compared to just 42% of women.
12. What age group consumes the most fast food?
Young people are most likely to eat fast food, and 57% of Americans aged 18 to 29 say they do so at least once a week. Thirty-three percent indulge once or twice a month.
13. Does household income influence who eats fast food?
Part of fast food's appeal lies in the fact that it's cheap. Surprisingly, though, people who earn more tend to eat it the most. Among people making more than $75,000 annually, 51% say they eat fast food once a week versus 39% of those who earn less than $20,000 a year.
14. Which fast food chain is the most popular?
Although it's seen sales decline slightly in recent years, McDonald's is still the number one fast food chain in the U.S. The company brought in $27.4 billion in revenue in 2014.
15. How many Big Macs are sold each year?
McDonald's estimates that it sells about 550 million Big Macs each year in the U.S. That breaks down to one every 17 seconds.
16. What's the top-selling fast food chicken restaurant?
Despite heavy competition from KFC, Chik-Fil-A reigns supreme as the number one fast food chicken eatery in the U.S. In 2013, the company's annual sales topped $5 billion, compared to $4.2 billion for KFC.
FAST FOOD AND YOUR HEALTH
Fast food isn't always the healthiest choice, and if you eat it on a pretty regular basis, your body may be feeling the effects. Numerous studies have been done on the nutritional content and health impact of eating fast food, and what we found may cause you to reconsider before you chow down on another burger.
17. What percentage of Americans believe fast food isn't good for you?
Despite the fact that it can taste pretty good, most Americans don't believe fast food is all that healthy. About 76% of people in the U.S. agree that fast food isn't good for you.
18. How does the number of fast food restaurants influence obesity rates?
The more fast food restaurants a country has, the more likely its residents are to be obese. The U.S., for example, has 7.52 Subway restaurants per 100,000 people and obesity rates of 31% for males and 23% for females. In Japan, where Subway restaurants are far less common, the obesity rates are 2.9% and 6.4% respectively.
19. What percentage of daily calories are consumed in a fast food meal?
On average, 11.3% of adults' daily caloric intake comes from eating fast food. The mean amount of calories in a typical fast food meal is 836.
20. How much fat does a typical fast food meal contain?
On average, a typical fast food meal consisting of a burger, fries and soda contains 47 grams of fat. That's nearly two-thirds of the recommended daily intake for someone who's on a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet.
21. Which fast food meal has the most calories?
Fast food is notoriously high on calories but one meal packs in more than the rest. The Triple Whopper meal from Burger King, complete with soda and fries, has 2,100 calories - not to mention 104 grams of fat and 2,270 milligrams of sodium.
22. Does eating fast food increase the risk of diabetes?
If you're worried about developing diabetes, cutting back on the fast food can help. Research shows that women who eat fast food twice or more each week are anywhere from 40 to 70% more likely to be diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes.
23. Can it shorten your life span?
Because of its high sodium and fat content, eating certain fast foods may be dangerous to your heart health. In one study, the risk of dying from heart disease increased by 20% for people who eat fast food once a week and nearly 80% for those who eat it four times a week or more.
FINAL WORD
Based on the data we found, it doesn't look like the fast food industry will be slowing down any time soon. Even though it may be friendly to your wallet, keeping the potential health risks of eating fast food in mind can help you gauge its true cost.

Fast Food Statistics in the U.S. | GERDHelp
Fast Food Consumption in the United States
In 2018, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that 36.6% of adults consumed fast food on a given day. This means that, daily, one out of three Americans will choose to visit a fast food restaurant. The alarming data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, released by the CDC, breaks down this testimony even further to show that:
Those aged 20-39 consumed the most fast food at 44.9%;
Fast food consumption increases with family income;
Men eat more fast food than women.
The dangers of regular fast food consumption are widely known. This often-processed food, which is high in fat, sugar, and empty calories, is historically linked to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, digestive issues, and even cancer. However, even an infrequent consumption of fast food may exacerbate gastroenterological problems, turning them into a disorder such as GERD.
Decreasing fast food consumption rates in the U.S. should make for a healthier society. While nationwide examinations of the fast food sensation are being conducted, their findings should be understood by any individual who is looking to live a happier, healthier life.
Why Do Americans Eat So Much Fast Food?
Americans eat fast food for a variety of reasons, but most of these reasons tie into a central theme of convenience. Fast food is quick, relatively cheap, and made by someone other than you or a family member. America is a country with plenty of hard-working citizens, so time and money are often highly valued.
It is pretty simple to swing your car into a drive-through and order an inexpensive meal for the family within minutes. This can be more wildly appealing than coming home from an eight-hour work shift, preparing a meal, and then spending an hour or two cooking it. If that is not enough, supermarket prices can be spendy, and grocery trips can be time-consuming.
While fast food is often cheap and easy, it’s potentially damaging effects on the human body should not go overlooked.
The Effects of Fast Food on the Body
The ingredients in fast food can wreak havoc on our bodies and overall health. From high blood pressure and cholesterol, to blood sugar spikes to weight gain, it is clear that fast food often does not contain the nutrients the body needs, while introducing high levels of a diet we don’t need. Fast food can contain many ingredients which are contradictory to a balanced diet, including:
Carbohydrates with little to no fiber. Many fast foods are packed with carbohydrates that our digestive system has trouble breaking down. When broken down, these carbs turned to glucose, or sugar — which increases your blood sugar. Prolonged fast food consumption can lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain.
High sugars and fat. Added sugar means extra (empty) calories. It also is a hazard to your cardiovascular system and can lead to cardiovascular disease. Foods that are high in fats, especially trans fat, can increase bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol, lead to type 2 diabetes, and heart disease.
Sodium. A high sodium diet, which includes regular fast food consumption, can lead to high blood pressure, bloating, and water retention.
Fast food can affect not only your weight, cardiovascular system, and lead to diabetes, but it can also impact your respiratory system, central nervous system, reproductive system, and more. Common symptoms can include depression, acne, shortness of breath, and even acid reflux — but these symptoms can escalate over time until they represent chronic conditions. Simply put, when consumed in excessive quantities, fast food will negatively affect your body.
Improving Nutrition in America
Nutrition in America has become a subject of much conversation. Movements are being made to make changes in school lunches for the health of our youth, encouraging more exercise, and assisting those with low incomes so they can buy more nutritious food.
Ultimately, it falls upon individuals to foster a healthy lifestyle and include their children to propel the notion of healthy eating onward. However, while a healthy lifestyle and diet may be demanding for some, there are several simple steps you can take to help establish the foundation of living a healthy life.
Tips for Staying Healthy
Abstaining from eating fast food is one step to staying healthy, but there are several efforts you should always strive to maintain to live the healthiest life you can:
Limit Your Calorie Intake. Naturally, this includes cutting out junk and fast food. You can also cut calories by counting them, eating small portions, including vegetables in every meal, and eating slower.
Exercise Regularly. Taking time for a consistent exercise routine can help you control your weight, combat several health conditions, improve your mood and energy, and help you sleep better.
Meal Prep. Prepping your own meals can allow you to keep an eye on your caloric intake, prepare smaller meals, and include the nutritious foods your body needs such as fruits and vegetables. It can also allow tailoring your diet according to any medical conditions you may have. One common issue involving certain foods is heartburn and acid reflux; having control and preparing the right foods can lessen reflux symptoms and other problems related to diet.
Less Sugar, More Water. Many times, and especially with fast food meals, consumers drink a large amount of sugar in the form of soft drinks. Choosing water instead of soda can drastically reduce sugar intake — and therefore empty calories.
Find a Friend. It might be easier to stick to a diet when you make a pact with a friend. This agreement can hold you accountable for holding up your end of the bargain. Similarly, hitting the gym with a friend can be much easier and having a workout buddy can be fun.

Fast Food Statistics
(Updated March 2022)
Fast food. It’s everywhere. And we eat a lot of it. It’s safe to say that Americans love their fast food restaurants - as you’ll see in this article.
We’ve gathered up some of the latest statistics about the fast food industry regarding the frequency of fast food consumption. We wanted to know: who eats the most, how much is spent on it, reasons behind its popularity, health risks associated with regularly eating it, the most popular fast food brands, and finally, how we can eat at home more often.
Let’s take a look.
Quick Fast Food Industry Statistics
Most Americans eat fast food 1-3 times a week.
⅓ of Americans are eating fast food on any given day.
People ages 20-39 years old eat the most fast food on any given day.
Men consume more fast food than women.
83% of American families eat at fast food restaurants at least once a week.
The average American household spends 10% of their annual income on fast food.

Fast Food Consumption
How many times does the average person eat fast food per week?
Most Americans eat at a fast food restaurant 1-3 times a week. Statistics from a survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics from Center for Disease Control shows that a little over one-third (36.6%) of adults in America eat it on any given day. That’s about 84.8 million adults eating fast food every day! Yikes!
Age
Does age play a role in consumption of fast food? We learned that 44.9% of  Americans aged 20-39 eat fast food on any given day. Slightly less, you'll find 37.7% of the 40-59 years old population partaking, and only 24.1% of the 60+ crowd indulging in fast food. Do people younger than 60 eat out more because they are still in the workforce and have the income to do so? Maybe. People older than 60 are generally moving out of the workforce and now have time to cook for themselves at home. Fast food is expensive, too, and retirement can leave people with fixed incomes. It’s possible that they are choosing to eat at home to be healthier and save money.
Gender
What about gender? It turns out that more men than women consume fast food on any given day, and the same report from the CDC shows that 38% of men are consuming it daily versus 35.4% of women.
Race
According to the data, it appears as though the group consuming fast food the most was the African American population, with 42.4% partaking on any given day. The Asian Americans consumed the least, with only 30.6% visiting fast food restaurants.
How much did Americans spend on fast food in 2019?
It’s no secret that Americans eat a LOT of fast food. In 2018, the CDC reported that roughly one out of every 3 Americans were consuming some type of fast food on any given day.
The average American individually spends $1,200 a year on fast food alone, while the average American household spends around 10% of their income. That adds up to $110 billion dollars a year, which could end world hunger for up to three years.
Why is fast food so popular in America?
It saves time.
As a culture, we don’t have the time to stop to prepare food or sit down and eat. Fast food in the United States is popular because it’s just that - fast! Its convenience and speed make it an easy choice for families and people on the go. Most families in America (83% of them) eat it at least once a week. Many fast food meals are even eaten in the car, as much as 20%.
It’s cheap.
Or so many people think. Fast food is relatively inexpensive compared with other restaurants. However, it’s significantly more expensive than preparing food at home. In fact, about 32% of the people that eat fast food eat it because they think it is cheaper than the alternatives.
And while there is an idea out there that lower income families eat more fast food because of the “inexpensive costs,” that idea is actually not based on the data. The numbers show that those with higher income tend to consume more fast food than those with lower incomes.
The National Center for Health Statistics, a division of the Center for Disease Control & Prevention, shows that 42% of adults that have a higher family income level eat fast food on any given day, while only 31.7% of adults in lower income brackets do so as well.
It’s convenient.
With 826,000 fast food restaurants worldwide - this type of food is easy to find. Lunchtime is the most popular time for fast-food consumption, as 43.7% of consumers eat their fast food at this time, while dinner is a very close second at 42%.
It tastes good.
Fast food is high in calories and loaded with fat, sugar & salt. Most of the nutrition that would be present has been stripped away due to processing, so those things are added in order to make the food taste good. Combine that with a caffeine & sugar laden soft drink and it’s no wonder we all hit that work day slump around 3 pm. Fast food might taste good - but it’s not good for you.
Is fast-food consumption increasing?
The fast food industry continues to grow 2.2% a year. It’s fair to say that despite all the health risks that accompany the regular consumption of fast food, it is still increasing. The fast food industry also currently employs 13 million people and has 826,000 restaurants and establishments world wide, so it’s safe to say it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.
Fast Food Health Risks
If you frequent fast food establishments, there are usually healthier options like salads & unsweetened tea available for purchase. These tend to be more expensive and harder to eat in the car (remember about 20% of fast food is eaten in the car). Value meals often include french fries and a sugary drink, and Americans love a good deal! But what does it really cost?
While there are many factors that lead to health problems, like stress and a sedentary lifestyle. Both of which might be why we turn to fast food in the first place - to save time & reduce the stressors of planning for and preparing food.  Regular consumption of fast food certainly does not help you regain your health.
There are an average of 836 calories in a fast food meal. Also, on average adults in the United States eat 11.3% of their daily caloric intake from fast food. Children tend to eat 120 more calories per day on days when they eat fast food restaurant, and 34% of children eat fast food on a daily basis. For adults and kids alike, more fat, sugar and sodium are consumed on days when fast food is eaten than on days when all meals are prepared at home.
While the occasional fast food restaurant meal doesn’t pose a huge risk, regular consumption starts posing significant health risks. Consumption of fast food at least twice a week can double your risk of type 2 diabetes as it can promote insulin resistance, and even just living near a fast food restaurant is linked to a 5.2 % greater risk of obesity. Type 2 diabetes and obesity both increase your risk for heart disease and a multitude of other illnesses. In fact, regular consumption of fast food  not only increases your risk for heart disease, but can also increase your risk of depression by up to 51%. In order to manufacture food that can be cooked quickly and be relatively shelf stable, the process strips the food of it’s vital nutrients. With the lack of proper nutrients combined with excessive intake of sodium and sugar, it’s no wonder that we don’t really feel good when we eat a lot of fast food.
The Most Popular Fast Food Chains
Despite all the media attention and warnings from physicians, the fast food industry remains popular among Americans and abroad. If we look at the amount of money that is spent on fast food, statistics show that McDonald’s is king.  Worldwide, adults spent a whopping $130.4 Billion at McDonald’s in 2019. Starbucks was second worldwide with people spending $45.9 Billion there in 2019. That means almost 3 times more money was spent at the McDonald’s fast food chain than at Starbucks last year. Could it be that McDonald’s just has more stores than Starbucks? While, yes it is true that McDonald’s has more establishments - we’re not sure if the difference is enough to make up for the almost 3x more money spent there. At the end of 2018, Starbucks had 29,324 locations worldwide while McDonald’s had 37,855.
In the United States, McDonald’s is still the most popular fast food restaurant in every state. They even average selling 75 hamburgers a second. That’s 4500 a minute, or 270,000 an hour.
Besides McDonalds and Starbucks, KFC, Subway, Domino’s, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tim Hortons, Chipotle & Taco Bell round out the top 10 Fast Food Restaurants as of 2019 when we look at the dollars spent there.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Why is fast food so popular?" It seems like a straightforward question, but I think there's more to it than meets the eye. I need to dig deeper and understand the various factors that contribute to the popularity of fast food.

First off, I should probably define what fast food is. Fast food is essentially pre-prepared food that's designed to be served quickly. It's often characterized by its convenience, affordability, and standardized taste. Think about places like McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and so on. They serve food that's consistent, no matter where you are in the world.

So, why is it so popular? I can think of a few reasons right off the bat:

1. **Convenience**: Fast food is incredibly convenient. You can walk in, order your food, and get it in minutes. Some places even have drive-thrus, so you don't even have to get out of your car. In today's fast-paced world, where everyone is busy with work, school, or other commitments, convenience is key.

2. **Affordability**: Fast food is generally cheaper compared to dining at full-service restaurants. It's accessible to a broader range of income levels, which makes it a go-to option for many people, especially those on a tight budget.

3. **Taste**: Fast food is engineered to be tasty. It often contains high levels of salt, sugar, and fat, which can be addictive. People enjoy the flavor and find it satisfying.

4. **Cultural Influence**: Fast food has become ingrained in our culture. It's associated with leisure, treats, and sometimes even as a reward. Plus, the marketing tactics used by fast food chains are relentless, targeting both adults and children through various media channels.

5. **Availability**: Fast food restaurants are ubiquitous. They're located practically everywhere – on street corners, in malls, near schools and offices. Their widespread presence makes them easily accessible to everyone.

But I need to back up these points with some data. Maybe I should look up some statistics on fast food consumption and see what they say.
