Alright, so I need to figure out how climate change affects hurricanes. I know that climate change is related to global warming and it's caused by increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities like burning fossil fuels. Hurricanes are these big storm systems that form over warm ocean waters, especially in tropical regions. So, there might be a connection between the warming oceans and hurricane formation or intensity.

First, I should probably understand what causes hurricanes to form. I remember that hurricanes need certain conditions to develop: warm ocean waters, moist atmospheres, and specific wind patterns. So, if the ocean waters are getting warmer because of climate change, that might influence hurricane formation.

Let me think about this step by step. If the oceans are warming up, that could mean there's more energy available for storms to form and strengthen. Warmer water can lead to more evaporation, which can fuel storms. So, maybe hurricanes are becoming stronger or more frequent because of this.

But I need to make sure that this is actually the case. Maybe there are other factors at play here. Perhaps changes in wind patterns or atmospheric pressure could also affect hurricanes. I should look into whether climate change is affecting these aspects as well.

Also, I've heard that climate change can lead to rising sea levels. If sea levels are rising, that could make coastal areas more vulnerable to hurricane storm surges, which are already a major hazard. So, even if the frequency or intensity of hurricanes isn't changing, the impacts could be worse because of higher sea levels.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. I need to check if there's scientific evidence supporting these ideas. Maybe I should look for studies or reports that examine the relationship between climate change and hurricanes.

I recall that there have been some studies suggesting that while the overall number of hurricanes might not increase, the proportion of stronger hurricanes could go up. In other words, there might be fewer Category 1 and 2 hurricanes, but more Category 4 and 5 hurricanes.

That sounds plausible, given that warmer oceans provide more energy for storms to intensify. But again, I need to verify this with actual data and scientific consensus.

Another thing I've heard is that climate change could affect the tracks that hurricanes take, meaning that they might be moving into areas that haven't historically been prone to hurricanes. For example, perhaps hurricanes are reaching further north or south as the Earth warms.

Hmm, that could have significant implications for regions that aren't prepared to handle hurricanes. It would be important to know if there's evidence to support this.

Additionally, I've read that climate change might be causing hurricanes to move more slowly, which could lead to more rainfall and greater flooding in affected areas. Is there any truth to that?

I need to gather more information to answer these questions accurately. Maybe I should perform a search to find reliable sources that can provide insights into how climate change is impacting hurricanes.

Let me try searching for something like "climate change and hurricanes impact." See what comes up.

Hurricanes and Climate Change
Although scientists are uncertain whether climate change will lead to an increase in the number of hurricanes, there is more confidence that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to intensify their intensity and impacts. Stronger hurricanes will be far more costly in terms of damages and deaths without action to make coastal (and inland) areas more resilient.
Hurricanes are subject to a number of climate change-related influences:
Warmer sea surface temperatures could intensify tropical storm wind speeds, potentially delivering more damage if they make landfall. Based on complex modeling, NOAA has suggested that an increase in Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is likely, with hurricane wind speeds increasing by up to 10 percent.  Warmer sea temperatures also are causing hurricanes to wetter, with 10-15 percent more precipitation from cyclones projected in a 2 degree C scenario. Recent storms such as Hurricane Harvey in 2017 (dropping over 60 inches in some locations), Florence in 2018 (with over 35 inches) and Imelda in 2019 (44 inches) demonstrate the devastating floods that can be triggered by these high-rain hurricanes.
Sea level rise is likely to make future coastal storms, including hurricanes, more damaging. Globally averaged, sea level is expected to rise by 1-4 feet in low and moderate emissions scenarios during this century, which will amplify coastal storm surge. For example, sea level rise intensified the impact of Hurricane Sandy which caused an estimated $65 billion in damages in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in 2012. Much of this damage was related to coastal flooding.
Areas affected by hurricanes are shifting poleward. This is likely associated with expanding tropics due to higher global average temperatures. The changing patterns of tropical storms (a shift northward in the Atlantic) could put much more property and human lives at risk, but much more research is required to build a better understanding of how these patterns might change.
The connection between climate change and hurricane frequency is less straightforward. It is likely the number of storms will remain the same or even decrease, with the primary increase being of the most extreme storms. For the 21 st century, some models project no change or a small reduction in the frequency of hurricanes, while others show an increase in frequency. More recent work shows a trade-off between intensity and frequency – that as warmer oceans bolster hurricane intensity, fewer storms actually form.

Background on Hurricanes and Tropical Storms
A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, which is a general term for a low-pressure system with activity like thunder and lightning that develops in the tropics or subtropics. In the Northern Hemisphere, these storms rotate counter-clockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate clockwise. Stronger systems are called “ hurricanes ” or “ typhoons ,” depending on where they form. Weaker tropical cyclones might be called “ tropical depressions ” or “ tropical storms .”
The National Hurricane Center categorizes Atlantic hurricanes based on wind speed. A storm with winds exceeding 74 mph is a Category 1 hurricane. Storms with winds stronger than 111 mph are considered “major hurricanes” (Category 3 or higher). Wind speed is just one of many factors that contribute to a hurricane’s impact. Others include its track (the site where the storm makes landfall), size, storm structure, rainfall amount, duration, and the vulnerability of the area it affects.
Frequency and intensity vary from basin to basin. In the North Atlantic Basin, the long-term (1966-2009) average number of tropical storms is about 11 annually, with about six becoming hurricanes. More recently (2000-2014), the average is over 15 tropical storms per year, including about seven hurricanes. This increase in frequency is correlated with the rise in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which could be partially related to global warming.
Threats Posed by Hurricanes
Climate change is adding to the coast and threat of hurricanes. While there have been extreme storms in the past, recent history reflects the growing expense of hurricanes. Four of the 10 costliest hurricanes on record in the United States occurred in 2017 and 2018. Hurricane Katrina (2005) remains the most expensive hurricane on record costing $168 billion (2020 dollars).
Find a map of billion-dollar extreme weather events here.
The 2017 hurricane season was historic, with Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma costing nearly $300 billion together (2020 dollars). It is important to note that while stronger hurricanes are more damaging, there are nearly 50 million homes and at least $1.4 trillion in assets within an eighth of a mile of the coast and a growing amount of property at risk in coastal areas. An important driver of the increased cost of hurricanes is increasing development in coastal areas. U.S. coastal populations grew by nearly 35 million people between 1970 and 2010. As more development occurs in harm’s way — regardless of climate change — the more likely the damage will grow.
In addition to damages to buildings, hurricanes threaten infrastructure, undermining energy systems, water and sewer systems, transportation, and flood management structures.
Stronger hurricanes pose a significant risk to public health and human lives. Hurricane Katrina caused over 1800 deaths, and Hurricane Maria in 2018 caused 2981 deaths mostly in Puerto Rico. Disruptions to water supplies and power systems can create risk for waterborne illness, environmental contaminants, mosquito borne illnesses and cause hospitals to close or affect care for patients.
How to Build Resilience
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one way to reduce the risk of the strongest storms in the future. Communities can also bolster their resilience to the impacts of hurricanes by:
Preserving coastal wetlands, dunes, and reefs to absorb storm surge and ensure building and development does not occur in harm’s way.
Replenishing beaches and improve infrastructure that affords coastal protection, such as seawalls.
Elevating vulnerable buildings to reduce flood damage.
Encouraging residents in areas that have had historically low hurricane risk to purchase flood insurance.
Designing structures to be resilient to high winds and flying debris.
Prepare directly prior to a storm’s arrival by boarding windows, clearing property of potential flying debris, and having an evacuation plan.

Increasingly destructive hurricanes are putting a growing number of people and structures at risk.
Maria. Irma. Harvey. Sandy. Katrina. Andrew.
For coastal communities, the social, economic, and physical scars left behind by major hurricanes are devastating.
While hurricanes are a natural part of our climate system, recent research suggests that there has been an increase in intense hurricane activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970s. In the future, there may not necessarily be more hurricanes, but there will likely be more intense hurricanes that carry higher wind speeds and more precipitation as a result of global warming. The impacts of this trend are likely to be exacerbated by sea level rise and a growing population along coastlines.
Scientists are continuing to refine our understanding of how global warming affects hurricane activity. Cutting edge research is beginning to be able to attribute individual hurricanes to global warming. For example, new research estimates that as the Earth has warmed, the probability of a storm with precipitation levels like Hurricane Harvey was higher in Texas in 2017 than it was at the end of the twentieth century. Because of climate change, such a storm evolved from a once in every 100 years event to a once in every 16 years event over this time period.
Observed trends in hurricanes
The number and strength of storms is highly variable from year to year, which makes it challenging to detect trends in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes over time.
The advent of satellite technology in the 1970s made it possible to more consistently track hurricanes. Storm counts and strength measurements from before to the 1970s are less consistent, further complicating the study of long-term trends.
To help address these challenges, scientists run hurricane models calibrated with observations over the historical period to project future trends and understand the major factors driving these trends.
Recent research in this area suggests that there has been an increase in intense hurricane activity over the past 40 years.
The National Weather Service added new colors to its rainfall maps to effectively map Hurricane Harvey, which dropped unprecedented amounts of rainfall over Texas
The category system classifies the strength of Hurricanes on a scale from 1 to 5 according to wind speed. One 2005 peer-reviewed study showed a large increase in the number of North American hurricanes that reach Categories 4 and 5 when comparing the most recent 15-year period to the prior 15-year period. Indices for hurricane activity based on storm surge data from tide gauges further indicate an increase in intensity.
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey produced unprecedented levels of precipitation. The National Weather Service added two more shades of purple to its rainfall maps to effectively map Hurricane Harvey's rainfall amounts.
There is some evidence that in the western North Pacific Ocean, hurricanes—known as typhoons in this region—are also intensifying. Whether hurricanes are intensifying in other regions is less clear, though other recent evidence suggests that the trend toward more intense hurricanes may extend globally.
There has been little change, however, in the frequency of hurricanes globally. Roughly 90 hurricanes occur each year around the world, with by far the greatest number occurring in the largest ocean basin on Earth –the Pacific.
Factors that increase the destructive potential of hurricanes
The oceans have taken in nearly all of the excess energy created by global warming, absorbing 93 percent of the increase in the planet’s energy inventory from 1971-2010.
Human-made global warming creates conditions that increase the chances of extreme weather. In some ocean basins, the intensification of hurricanes over time has been linked to rising ocean temperatures. Since 1970, sea surface temperatures worldwide have warmed by about an average of 0.1°C per decade. This warming is especially pronounced in the North Atlantic basin.
Sea levels are also rising as the oceans warm and seawater expands. This expansion, combined with the melting of land-based ice, has caused global average sea level to rise by roughly 7-8 inches since 1900—a trend that is expected to accelerate over coming decades.
Higher sea levels give coastal storm surges a higher starting point when major storms approach and pile water up along the shore. The resulting storm surge reaches higher and penetrates further inland in low-lying areas. The risk is even greater if storms make landfall during high tides.
Growing population density on coastlines also increases the destructive potential of hurricanes.  Roughly 40 percent of the US population—about 123 million people—lives in coastal counties. US coastal county populations are growing much denser than non-coastal counties. Between 1970 and 2010 coastal counties increased population density by 39 percent (excluding Alaska). In non-coastal counties, population density hardly changed over the same period.
By concentrating ourselves along the coasts, we have increasingly exposed our communities and homes to powerful storms. As a result of coastal development, storms are exacting rising financial tolls.

Rising ocean temperatures fuel stronger North Atlantic hurricanes
Warm ocean temperatures are one of the key factors that strengthen hurricane development when overall conditions are conducive for their formation and growth.
Hurricanes require high humidity, relatively constant winds at different altitudes, and can occur when surface ocean temperatures exceed about 79°F (26°C). The rising of warm, moist air from the ocean helps to power the storm.
Two other factors may also be contributing to the rising intensities of hurricanes. First, warm air holds more water vapor than cold air—and the rising air temperatures since the 1970s have caused the atmospheric water vapor content to rise as well. This increased moisture provides additional fuel for hurricanes. Climate models project an increase in the average precipitation rate of hurricanes as a result of global warming.
Second, as ocean temperatures rise, there is also less cold, subsurface ocean water to serve as a braking mechanism for hurricanes. When strong storm winds churn up cold subsurface water, the cooler waters can serve to weaken the storm. But if deeper waters become too warm, this natural braking mechanism weakens. For example, Hurricane Katrina intensified significantly when it hit deep pools of warm water in the Gulf of Mexico.
Not all changes in climate will fuel hurricanes. For example, when there are large changes in wind speed at different altitudes (also known as "vertical wind shear ") above an area of the ocean, those conditions can interfere with hurricane formation. There is evidence that climate change may increase vertical wind shear over some regions in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean.
However, when scientists put the pieces together, they project that in general, hurricanes will become more intense in a warming world, with higher wind speeds and greater levels of precipitation.

The role of natural cycles in hurricanes
The oceans experience a variety of natural circulation patterns, or oscillations, that influence the distribution of warm and cold water in the upper ocean. These naturally occurring oscillations affect ocean conditions on timescales ranging from just a few years to several decades and are known to affect the intensity of hurricanes.
During the warm, or El Niño, phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), for example, hurricanes are less likely to make landfall in eastern Australia and Atlantic hurricanes tend to be suppressed. However, El Niño conditions can boost typhoon risks in parts of Asia.
The presence of these natural oscillations can mask or enhance the potential influence of human-caused warming on hurricane activity. Recent scientific studies increasingly question whether human activities have contributed to observed shifts in natural circulation patterns.

What the future holds
As the climate continues to warm, the average intensity of tropical cyclones (including hurricanes in the North Atlantic) is projected to rise while the overall number of hurricanes globally is expected to either decrease or remain unchanged. Scientists project that, on average, tropical cyclones and hurricanes will have higher wind speeds and higher precipitation rates. There is some evidence that there will be an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, though there is more evidence of this finding for the eastern North Pacific than there is for the western North Pacific and Atlantic.
The projected increase in intense hurricanes is substantial—a doubling or more in the frequency of category 4 and 5 storms by the end of the century—with the western North Atlantic experiencing the largest increase. With continued warming, sea level is likely to rise by one to four feet globally by the end of the century, enabling the powerful surge associated with hurricanes to penetrate further inland than today.
Given the loss of life and the huge costs of rebuilding after hurricanes, it is essential to do whatever we can to avoid dangerous warming and protect coastal communities for ourselves and our children.
Recent experiences with super storms like Sandy in 2012, Harvey, Irma and Maria, all in 2017, have left some valuable lessons: We can’t afford to ignore global warming. Investing for the present and future of a changing climate is pressing.
How are we preparing our communities, and making sure that we don’t leave people behind? What actions are we taking to mitigate climate change and avoid its worse projections?

Hurricane Sandy is a stark reminder of the rising risks of climate change. A number of warming-related factors may well have intensified the storm’s impact. Higher ocean temperatures contributed to heavier rainfall. Higher sea levels produced stronger storm surges. New research suggests that Arctic melting may be increasing the risk of the kind of atmospheric traffic jam that drove Sandy inland. While no single weather event can be said to have been directly caused by climate change, our weather now is the product of our changing climate, as increased warming raises the probability of extreme weather events. In highlighting our vulnerabilities to extreme weather, Hurricane Sandy underscores two imperatives: We need to reduce the risks of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, and we must strengthen our defenses against future impacts that it may be too late to avoid.

Impacts of Climate Change
Hurricanes and Climate Change
In 2017, Hurricane Harvey decimated the Texas coast around Houston, causing catastrophic flooding due to a record amount of rain. Harvey, which came ashore as a strong Category 4 storm, weakened and then stalled. Over four days, as the storm wandered along the coast, many areas received more than 40 inches of rain (and some got up to 60 inches) causing major flooding, causing over a hundred billion dollars in damage, and displacing more than 30,000 people.

Hurricane Harvey was very unusual but will we see more unusual hurricanes as the climate continues to change? The answer is yes. We know a lot about how human-caused climate change is affecting hurricanes and tropical storms now, and how it will likely affect them in the future.
More Precipitation
A hurricane’s ability to produce rain is affected by the temperature of the air and ocean water. Warm air can hold more moisture; more moisture often leads to more rain. That’s how climate change causes wetter storms. Researchers studying Hurricane Harvey found that human-induced climate change made extreme rainfall more likely. In general, models show hurricane rainfall increasing by 10 to 15 percent on average by the end of the century. That means that we may see more storms like Harvey.
Stronger Winds
There’s evidence that over this century anthropogenic climate change will cause more intense tropical cyclones globally. Hurricane intensity is characterized by the strength of a storm’s winds.
Warmer water causes hurricanes and tropical storms to become more intense, with faster wind speeds. The storms draw energy from warm ocean water which can cause a weak storm with moderate winds to intensify into a strong and destructive storm. For example, Harvey had weakened to a tropical storm before it encountered warm water in the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened to a Category 4 storm.
Sea surface temperature rose an average of 1.5 F between 1901 and 2016 and the tropical sea surface has warmed faster than the global average. During this century, the temperature of the sea surface is projected to warm even faster, which will fuel stronger hurricanes in the tropics. Some models predict that, toward the end of the century, although there may not be more storms (and there could possibly be fewer storms), more of them will be Category 4 and 5 hurricanes.
Sea Level Rise and Vulnerability
Thirty-nine percent of the US population lives in coastal communities putting many people directly in harm’s way because of rising seas and potentially more intense hurricanes. Sea level is predicted to rise between 29 and 82 centimeters (about one to three feet) by the end of the century as a warmer planet causes thermal expansion of the seas and melting glaciers and ice sheets according to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Sea level rise will make storm surge flooding during hurricanes more devastating.
If the global climate keeps warming, hurricanes are likely to be more intense and potentially more destructive. Storm surges and intense rainfall will cause more flooding. Storms like Hurricane Harvey in 2017 may seem less like unusually catastrophic anomalies and more like the new normal.

How to Prepare for a Hurricane

Pounding rain, raging winds, and devastating storm surge. When hurricanes make landfall, they bring a trifecta of threats capable of leveling communities and destroying lives and livelihoods. Named after the ancient indigenous god Hurican (the Carib god of evil), hurricanes are giant energy powerhouses. Here’s a look at what they’re made of, how climate change is affecting them, and how to limit damage from their wrath.
Hurricane Facts
What Is a Hurricane?
A hurricane is an intense low-pressure weather system of organized, swirling clouds and thunderstorms that gain energy from warm tropical waters. While we’re using the term hurricane here, these systems are actually identical to typhoons or cyclones—with the name depending on where they occur. They’re called hurricanes in the Atlantic and in the central and eastern Pacific, typhoons in the northwestern Pacific, and cyclones in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific (more on this later). To be classified as a hurricane, wind speeds must reach 74 miles per hour (mph). That’s powerful enough to peel off roof shingles.
With their distinctive buzz-saw shape when viewed from above, hurricanes spin around a low-pressure center known as the eye—an area of calm and sometimes even clear sky. Journalist Edward R. Murrow, who flew through the eye of 1954’s Hurricane Edna, described it as “a great amphitheater, round as a dollar . . . a great bowl of sunshine.” The eye, which is typically 20 to 40 miles across, is surrounded by a circular “eye wall,” a dense wall of clouds and thunderstorms containing the most violent wind and rain. Beyond the eye wall and extending for as much as hundreds of miles, slowly rotating rain bands bring their own intense thunderstorms, capable of producing fierce winds and tornadoes.
Hurricane Categories
Meteorologists measure a hurricanes’ strength based on the intensity of their sustained wind speeds and rate them using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. There are five categories of hurricane: a category 1 produces sustained winds of at least 74 mph, a category 2 storm begins at 96 mph, and a category 3—considered “major”—has winds of at least 111 mph. Categories 4 and 5—both considered “catastrophic”—generate winds of at least 130 mph and 157 mph, respectively.
Aaron McConomy
The category of a hurricane reflects only the wind speed, not the overall potential for damage. In fact, the greatest risk comes from flooding associated with the storm surge or the intense rains the storms generate. Consider Superstorm Sandy, which arrived in New Jersey with 80 mph winds (barely over the category 1 minimum) but still proved devastating. Sandy lacked the extreme winds of a major storm, but the massive swell of water it generated slammed into New Jersey and New York, obliterating beaches and boardwalks, filling subway tunnels, inundating neighborhoods, and destroying massive amounts of infrastructure. Similarly, most of the damage caused by hurricanes Harvey and Florence were largely attributable to torrential rains, not wind or even storm surge in coastal areas.
Hurricane Season
For the Atlantic basin (comprising the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico), hurricane season runs from June through November. The Atlantic season peaks between mid-August and late October and produces an average of 6.2 hurricanes a year—with more than a third of them typically measuring category 3 or above. Hurricane season in the eastern Pacific, an area extending from the U.S. West Coast to 140 degrees west longitude (about due south of Alaska’s eastern border), lasts from mid-May through November. An average of 8.5 hurricanes a year appear in the eastern Pacific, with fewer than half measuring category 3 or above. The central Pacific, which includes Hawaii, typically sees four to five hurricanes a year during its season—June through November—with most storms appearing in August and September.
Fewer than two hurricanes make landfall in the United States in a typical year, according to data from 1851 to 2017, with an average of three major hurricanes pummeling the coastline every five years. About 40 percent of hurricanes make landfall in Florida, while nearly 90 percent of major hurricanes hit either Florida or Texas. Hurricane Michael in October 2018 was the first category 4 storm to strike the Florida Panhandle since record-keeping began in 1851—and the strongest to make landfall the United States in more than 25 years.
How Is a Hurricane Different from Other Storms?
The fact that hurricane, typhoon, and cyclone are all used for the same weather phenomena can be confusing. This explains where (and when) they occur, and how they’re different from other major rain and wind events.
Typhoon
A typhoon is tropical cyclone that occurs in the northwestern Pacific basin, covering eastern and southeastern Asia and Micronesia. Nearly one-third of the world’s big storms develop here, with an average of 16.5 typhoons a year, mostly between May and November. The world’s largest recorded tropical cyclone was Super Typhoon Tip, which slammed into Japan in 1979, producing winds of 190 mph and measuring 1,380 miles in diameter, about the distance from New York City to Dallas.
Cyclone
A cyclone —or a “tropical cyclone” or “severe tropical cyclone”—occurs in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific and is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon elsewhere. Cyclones generally occur from May to November in the northern Indian Ocean and between November and April in the southern Indian Ocean and South Pacific. Areas impacted by cyclones include Southeast Asia, northern Australia, the South Pacific islands, India, Bangladesh, and some parts of East Africa, including Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius and Madagascar.
Tornado
Although both storms are known for their spiraling, violently destructive winds, the similarity between tornadoes and hurricanes ends there. A hurricane forms over tropical waters and can span several hundred miles, last for days to weeks, and be predicted well in advance. A tornado, on the other hand, forms over land as a tall, rotating column of air that extends from the base of a thunderstorm (including those produced by hurricanes) to the ground. The largest tornadoes are just over a quarter mile wide and typically last for no more than an hour, though they can pack a punch in terms of wind speed— as high as 300 mph. (Most hurricanes top out around 180 mph .) Advance warnings for tornadoes are typically less than 15 minutes.
Monsoon
Similar to a hurricane, a monsoon can produce torrential rains that lead to damaging floods, injury, and death. But while a hurricane is basically a single weather event, a monsoon is a seasonal change in the prevailing winds that move from ocean to land—and vice versa—and can produce months of wet (or even dry) conditions. Although most often associated with Southeast Asia, monsoon winds exist around the world, including the U.S. Southwest.
Hurricane Impacts
Hurricanes leave a trail of devastation in their wake, piling up costs in terms of lives and livelihood. Here are some of the ways these storms impact communities and the surrounding environment.
How Hurricanes Impact Communities
Hurricanes create a range of short- and long-term health and economic woes, with socially vulnerable populations often shouldering the greatest burden.
Flood damages
Flooding isn’t just the deadliest threat; it also causes tremendous damage to homes, buildings and infrastructure, whether from storm surge or flooding after extreme rains. In fact, flooding was the main cause of damage for many of the costliest hurricanes. The trend toward storms with heavier rainfall has put a strain on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which has been in debt since Katrina caused $16.3 billion in flood-related damages in 2005. More than 80 percent of the program’s payouts to cover losses have occurred since 2000, even though it was created in 1968.
Economic loss
Hurricanes are the costliest form of weather disaster, accounting for more than half of the total damages from billion-dollar U.S. weather events since 1980. Through September 2018, when Hurricane Florence battered the East Coast, 41 hurricanes each averaged nearly $22 billion in losses (the data do not include Hurricane Michael). That figure includes everything from wrecked homes and waterlogged hospitals to mangled material assets such as cars and boats. It also includes damage to public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power lines, along with lost wages and income-generating assets such as crops, livestock, and businesses. It does not include health-related costs or values related to lost lives.
Climate change is expected to further increase the tab, with potential future losses from hurricanes and other extreme weather events projected to as much as double by 2100.

Health toll
Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico in 2017 and is considered the deadliest hurricane in recent U.S. history, shows how a storm can overwhelm the local electricity, water, and medical infrastructure and take a long-term toll on human health, including mental health.
The second-most deadly storm in recent years, Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Southeast in 2005 and claimed more than 1,800 lives. The majority of Katrina’s victims perished from the storm surge, which is the cause of about half of all U.S. fatalities related to a hurricane's force. Flooding from rainfall is the second-gravest danger, resulting in about a quarter of immediate deaths. While a storm’s strength is based largely on wind speed, deaths from falling debris and other wind-borne hazards—including tornadoes spawned by the hurricane—account for a little more than one-tenth of fatalities. Drownings, either near shore or out at sea, account for 12 percent.
These statistics don’t tell the full story of how a hurricane impacts health, however. Flood-induced sewage overflows from wastewater treatment plants can dump fecal bacteria into floodwaters and waterways, increasing the risk of skin, eye, ear, and gastrointestinal infections. Runoff from toxic waste sites and factory farms can expose nearby residents to hazardous waste. After the storm has passed, flooded, water-damaged homes can harbor bacteria and mold, making the air unhealthy to breathe. Mold can be a particularly pervasive health hazard, since it starts growing immediately and can be hard to detect and remove.
Who are the most vulnerable?
While hurricanes impact everyone living in a storm-affected area, those impacts aren’t shared equally. Low-income communities, people of color, and the elderly are disproportionately exposed to storms. These populations often live in suboptimal housing situated in areas particularly vulnerable to storm threats—sometimes close to polluting industries that raise the risk of contamination via pipeline or facility leaks or chemically contaminated floodwaters. Due to limited mobility, lack of funds, or insufficient storm-warning information, these communities often face greater challenges in escaping impending storms as well. Often they may be unable to bounce back as quickly after a hurricane has passed, facing challenges in accessing public disaster relief, job ass istance, and affordable housing.

How Hurricanes Impact the Environment
Ravaged homes and submerged streets are the images most often seen on the news after a hurricane strikes, but coastal ecosystems—both on land and at sea—experience their own forms of devastation as well.
Saltwater/freshwater intrusion
When seawater surges into wetlands, bays, and estuaries, the onslaught of salt can harm freshwater marsh grasses and plants as well as crabs, minnows, and other marine life. When saltwater washes over land, it can harm or even kill bottomland forests and coastal trees unaccustomed to the uptick in salinity. The opposite can happen, as well: Heavy rains can cause freshwater to flood into coastal basins, decreasing the salinity of typically brackish waters and imperiling the species that depend on them.
Dislocation of species
Both strong winds and the relative calm of a hurricane’s eye (which acts as a natural cage) can push birds, particularly seabirds and water fowl, hundreds of miles from home. Meanwhile, floodwaters—from both storm surge and overflowing rivers and streams—can strand animals far from their natural territory.
Forest destruction
Hurricane-force winds can uproot trees and bushes or strip them of their leaves, seeds, fruit, berries, and branches, damaging entire wooded ecosystems. This can not only create short-term food shortages for species, but also change the face of an entire area. Once a forest canopy is damaged, a once cool, damp, and shady area may become a sun-filled, hot, and dry space—effectively creating new habitat for some invasive species while destroying ideal conditions for other, longer-term inhabitants.
Wetland, dune, and beach loss
Storm surge, waves, and winds can destroy wetlands and erode dunes and beaches, which provide critical habitat and important nesting grounds for a wide variety of wildlife species. These areas provide a first line of defense from storm surge for us humans as well. Wetlands alone prevented an estimated $625 million in flood damage to East Coast communities during Hurricane Sandy.
Turbid waters
Heavy rainfall and flooding can wash everything from soil and sediment to nutrient pollution to hazardous waste from wastewater treatment plants, refineries, and Superfund sites into marine, coastal, and freshwater environments. The introduction of mud and debris can smother marine life, such as oysters, and damage grasses and agriculture; poisonous contaminants can accumulate in fish and shellfish (and then be eaten by us); and nutrient pollution can contribute to coral bleaching.
What Causes a Hurricane?
Whether you call them hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones, these systems result from the interplay of four main ingredients: warm ocean water, cooperative wind patterns, stormy weather, and a dose of bad luck (since the first three ingredients alone aren’t always enough).
How Do Hurricanes Form?
While any tropical disturbance can spawn a hurricane, the origins of nearly 85 percent of major Atlantic hurricanes (category 3 and up) come from north Africa, where the Sahara’s scorching summer heat meets the cooler, more humid air that rises from west Africa’s forested coastal regions. The contrast in temperatures forms an area of strong high-altitude winds known as the African easterly jet, which moves from east to west. Because of the difference in land temperatures over which it crosses, the jet wobbles from north to south, creating atmospheric troughs—basically V-shaped tropical waves—of low-pressure areas that get pushed along by the winds. These tropical waves, which can trigger clusters of thunderstorms, emerge near the Cape Verde Islands, just west of Africa (hence the term Cape Verde hurricane) and continue westward across the Atlantic Ocean.
Aaron McConomy
About 60 tropical waves typically track across the Atlantic Ocean each year, peaking in summer and early fall—around the same time that the ocean is at its warmest. And that’s the kicker: When seawater with a temperature of at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit and a depth of about 165 feet meets a low-level weather disturbance like a tropical wave, conditions grow favorable for hurricane development. As a storm system moves across tropical ocean waters, the evaporation of warm water pushes more moist air up into the clouds, creating a low-pressure pocket near the sea’s surface and fueling the storm. Like water going down a drain (but inverted), moist air from surrounding areas rushes in to fill the atmospheric void, then evaporates as well, further fueling the formation of clouds and thunderstorms. As winds pick up and the energy-generating process continues, what was once a tropical disturbance can develop into a tropical depression and then a full-blown hurricane.
Hurricanes and Climate Change
As we continue to heat the planet by burning fossil fuels, we’re altering both the earth’s longer-term climate systems and its shorter-term weather, increasing the threat and cost of extreme weather events. Here’s a look at how the consequences of climate change —and global warming, in particular—affect hurricanes.
How Does Climate Change Affect Hurricanes?
Warmer ocean temperatures
Over the past 50-plus years, the earth’s oceans have absorbed more than 90 percent of the extra heat generated by man-made global warming, becoming warmer as a result. Since warm sea surface temperatures fuel hurricanes, a greater temperature increase means more energy, and that allows these storms to pack a bigger punch. Indeed, some weather analysts suggest a link between the intensity of Hurricane Florence—a Cape Verde storm that drowned the Carolinas with record-breaking rains —and warmer-than-normal Atlantic waters.
Rising air temperatures
The burning of fossil fuels and other human activities have caused an estimated 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) of global warming since preindustrial times. Since a hotter atmosphere can hold—and then dump—more water vapor, a continued rise in air temperature is expected to result in storms that are up to 15 percent wetter for every 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming, meaning an even greater capacity to generate flooding.
Sea level rise
As the ocean warms and expands and as terrestrial glaciers and ice sheets melt, sea levels are expected to continue to rise. That increases the threat of storm surge —when powerful winds drive a wall of ocean water onto land—for coastal areas and low-lying nations. Hurricane Katrina’s 28-foot storm surge overwhelmed the levees around New Orleans in 2005, unleashing a devastating flood across much of the city.
Longer-lasting storms
Research suggests that global warming is weakening the atmospheric currents that keep weather systems like hurricanes moving, resulting in storms that linger longer. Sluggish storms can prove disastrous—even without catastrophic winds—since they can heap tremendous amounts of rain on a region over a longer period of time. The stalling of Hurricane Harvey over Texas in 2017, as well as the slow pace of Hurricane Florence, helped make them the storms with the greatest amount of rainfall in 70 years.
Have Hurricanes Increased in Number?
While there may seem to be a growing number of hurricanes snatching headlines each year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) does not see a general global trend toward increasing hurricane frequency over the past century. The exception is the North Atlantic, which the United Nations body notes has seen an increase in the frequency and intensity of its hurricanes—though as some researchers note, the uptick may be due in part to improvements in monitoring. Looking forward, the IPCC projects that while there might be a slight decrease in hurricane frequency through 2100, the storms that do make landfall are more likely to be intense—category 4 or 5—with more rain and wind.
Are Hurricanes Getting More Intense?
We may not be experiencing more storms, but we are riding out stronger ones, with heavier rainfall and more powerful winds (hence all those news headlines). Recent research, for example, estimates that Hurricane Harvey dumped as much as 38 percent more rain that it would have without climate change. Another Harvey analysis indicates that the likelihood of a storm of its size evolved from once per century at the end of the 20th century to once every 16-years by 2017—again, due to climate change. Looking forward, the intensity of hurricanes that make landfall is expected to increase through the end of this century, with more category 4 and 5 storms.
Hurricane Prevention
As the evidence makes clear, the force, strength, and impact of today’s natural disasters is inextricably tied to society’s past choices. Our centuries-long reliance on dirty fossil fuels has driven the global warming trend, and we’re now experiencing the repercussions in the form of more severe weather events, including catastrophic hurricanes.
Of course, hurricanes are natural phenomena, and there is nothing we can do to halt any single storm in its path (though some people may try ). We can, however, forgo the burning of carbon-emitting oil, coal, and gas for more efficient renewable energy options —such as wind and solar—and thereby reduce future warming and the ferocity of tomorrow’s storms.
And that’s a big point of the Paris Agreement, which was signed by nearly every nation on earth in 2015 and aims to curb the consequences of climate change by limiting global warming since preindustrial times to, ideally, 1.5 degrees Celsius. But getting there will require serious heavy lifting in the form of immediate, transformative global action, as the IPCC noted recently in a stark report drafted by some 91 climate scientists representing 40 countries. It will mean slashing global carbon emissions by nearly half by 2030, relative to 2010 levels, zeroing out emissions entirely by about 2050, and meeting as much as 87 percent of global energy needs with renewable sources. The alternative, as laid out by the IPCC, is clear: With a business-as-usual approach, the “extreme” weather of today will seem commonplace by tomorrow.
Think Globally, Act Locally
Unfortunately, the Trump administration ignored the overwhelming evidence from climate scientists worldwide and instead chose to double down on fossil fuels and undermine policies designed to reduce carbon emissions and boost clean energy. The administration had committed to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, ditch carbon-cutting policies such as the Clean Power Plan, weaken fuel efficiency standards for cars, and roll back wide-ranging environmental safeguards.
But while the Trump administration shirked its climate responsibilities, many American leaders—and much of the rest of the world— pushed ahead. Mayors, governors, companies, and utilities are charting their own course, finding ways to tackle climate change.
That’s where individuals come in, too—especially everyday Americans, who on average produce nearly four times more carbon pollution than citizens elsewhere. As customers, we can support companies invested in meaningful climate action. As U.S. citizens, we can urge political leaders to prioritize clean energy and energy efficiency. And as global citizens, we can take myriad steps to slash carbon pollution from our own daily live s. As the IPCC report shows, there’s still enormous work to be done, but it is only the ramping up of these efforts that will move the needle on climate change.

Reduce Damage and Loss
While we may not be able to prevent the next hurricane, there are ways to reduce the widespread destruction these storms leave in their wake. First, communities, cities, and states should work together to improve climate resiliency and ensure that public safety is a primary factor in determining where and what we build.
A critical component of this effort would be an overhaul of the NFIP, the federal flood insurance program that covers more than five million property holders and incentivizes the rebuilding of properties in flood-prone areas rather than helping victims move out of harm’s way. More than 30,000 U.S. properties have been flooded an average of five times each (with some homes flooded 30-plus times) and then reconstructed with the aid of NFIP. With some commonsense reforms, such as helping homeowners relocate, updating flood maps to reflect new climate realities (including sea level rise and its effects on local storm surge levels), and sharing data on flood hazards, the program could better keep America safe and dry.
Another way to build hurricane resiliency would be to reinstate the Obama administration’s 2015 federal flood protection standard, designed to keep communities safe and to reduce damages from natural disasters. The program, which President Trump scrapped, ensured that any new, federally funded infrastructure projects, such as schools, hospitals, public housing, and police stations, would be built outside flood-prone areas or at least made more resistant to flooding.
Measures such as these could result in major cost savings. Indeed, according to a report by the National Institute of Building Sciences, every $1 spent by the federal government on hazard mitigation today—for example, reducing the number of homes in flood-prone areas and increasing the weather resilience of buildings—could save $6 in future disaster-related expenses.
How to Prepare for a Hurricane
If you live in an area considered at risk for hurricanes, knowing what to do before, during, and after a storm will go a long way toward keeping you safe. Below are a handful of hurricane safety tips.
Aaron McConomy
Hurricane Preparedness List
Put an emergency action plan in place to ensure that you and your family know what to do, where to go, and whom to contact in case of a hurricane.
Visit your local government website to find out if you live in a hurricane evacuation area and to familiarize yourself with your area’s evacuation plans, routes, and shelters.
Prepare a disaster supply kit with enough water and food to sustain your family and pets for three days, plus basic household items such as power sources and a first-aid kit.
Before a storm hits, add last-minute essentials such as medications, important documents and medical records, and cash, which can prove essential if the power goes out.
If a storm is possible, fill the gas tank for vehicle or generator in advance.
Review your homeowner’s insurance policy, and consider insuring your property against the extreme weather events you may face in your area.
At the start of hurricane season, inspect your home for vulnerabilities. Fix loose shingles, clear drains and gutters, and remove tree branches that could pose a threat during high winds and heavy rain.
To avoid flood damage, consider home improvements such as elevating boilers and central air-conditioning units, installing a sewer backflow valve, and landscaping to guide water away from your house.
Before a hurricane’s arrival, secure your property by protecting windows with hurricane shutters or plywood and removing outdoor furniture, trash cans, and other items that could blow away.
Sign up for local weather alerts to stay on top of storm developments. And keep in mind this key terminology: A “hurricane watch” indicates a storm may happen within 48 hours, while a “hurricane warning” means a storm is expected within 36 hours.
What to Do During a Hurricane
Before, during, and after a storm, follow the instructions of local authorities. If told to evacuate, do so immediately. As a storm develops, evacuation routes may close.
If forced to weather a storm in place, stay away from windows, skylights, and glass doors. Head to an interior room, bathroom, or closet. If floodwaters are a threat, head to the highest floor—excluding closed attics, where you could be trapped if floodwaters go high enough. Do not operate gasoline-powered machinery such as generators inside.
Remain indoors until officials give the “all clear” on a local website or a radio or television station. If you do venture outside, avoid floodwaters, which may contain dangerous debris or hide downed power lines. And remember: Six inches of fast-moving water can sweep you off your feet, and just one foot of moving water can wash a vehicle away. Finally, if you're feeling emotional distress, don't hesitate to reach out for help.

Alright, I have these search results from different sources like the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, Union of Concerned Scientists, and NRDC. All of them talk about how climate change affects hurricanes. Let me try to summarize what I'm reading.

First, it seems that climate change is making hurricanes stronger. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes to form and intensify. So, even if the number of hurricanes might not increase, the ones that do form could be more powerful, with higher wind speeds and more rainfall.

For example, one document mentions that there's been an increase in intense hurricane activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970s. Another says that there's evidence of more Category 4 and 5 hurricanes in some regions.

Also, warmer temperatures lead to more moisture in the atmosphere, which can result in heavier rainfall during hurricanes. This was seen in Hurricane Harvey, which dropped record amounts of rain in Texas.

Moreover, sea levels are rising due to climate change, which exacerbates the storm surges that hurricanes bring. Storm surges are already a big problem, and higher sea levels make them even more destructive.

Another point is that climate change might be affecting where hurricanes go. There's mention of hurricanes possibly moving into areas that haven't traditionally been prone to them, maybe because of expanding tropics or changes in wind patterns.

Additionally, some studies suggest that hurricanes might be moving more slowly because of changes in atmospheric conditions, which could lead to more flooding in affected areas.

But I should also note that not all aspects of hurricane behavior are clearly linked to climate change yet. For instance, the frequency of hurricanes is still a topic of research. Some models suggest that there might be fewer hurricanes overall but with more of the strongest ones.

It's also important to consider that coastal development is increasing, which means more people and infrastructure are at risk when hurricanes hit. So, even if hurricanes aren't changing, the impacts could be worse because there's more to damage.

In terms of what can be done, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is key to mitigating the long-term effects of climate change on hurricanes. Also, improving preparedness and resilience in coastal communities can help minimize the damage from these storms.

So, to sum it up, climate change is likely making hurricanes stronger and potentially more damaging through warmer oceans, increased rainfall, and rising sea levels. It's a complex issue, but these seem to be the main points.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Climate change is making hurricanes stronger and more damaging due to warmer ocean temperatures, increased rainfall, and rising sea levels.}} \]
