Global climate change refers to long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These activities release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to a rise in global temperatures.

Climate change can indeed affect people's lives in numerous ways:

1. **Extreme Weather Events:** Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, and heatwaves. These events can damage infrastructure, disrupt livelihoods, and pose threats to human health and safety.

2. **Sea-Level Rise:** Melting polar ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels, which can lead to coastal flooding, erosion, and loss of land. This affects millions of people living in coastal areas and island nations, forcing them to relocate and disrupting their communities and economies.

3. **Agricultural Impacts:** Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can alter growing seasons and crop yields, affecting food security worldwide. Some regions may experience reduced agricultural productivity, leading to higher food prices and potential shortages.

4. **Water Scarcity:** Climate change can exacerbate water scarcity issues in already arid regions, while also causing more frequent and severe droughts in other areas. This impacts access to clean water for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation.

5. **Human Health:** Warmer temperatures can expand the range of disease-carrying insects, increasing the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Additionally, heatwaves can lead to heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations.

6. **Economic Consequences:** The impacts of climate change can have significant economic costs, including damages from extreme weather events, losses in agricultural production, and increased healthcare expenses. These costs can strain national budgets and hinder economic growth.

7. **Social Displacement:** As climate change alters environmental conditions, it can lead to mass migrations and displacement of populations. This can result in social unrest, conflict over resources, and challenges for host communities.

In summary, global climate change has the potential to profoundly impact various aspects of people's lives, from their physical environment and economic well-being to their health and social stability. Addressing climate change requires comprehensive global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to inevitable changes, and support affected communities.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes, global climate change can significantly alter people's lives through various environmental, economic, and social impacts.}} \]
