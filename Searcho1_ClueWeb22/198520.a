Alright, so the question is whether children should be encouraged to be competitive. Hmm, this seems like a pretty broad topic, and I guess it depends on various factors. First off, I need to understand what being competitive means in the context of childhood development. I think competition can be healthy in some ways, but maybe not always. Let me try to break this down.

I remember from school that competitions can motivate kids to do better, like in sports or academics. Maybe it pushes them to reach their full potential. On the other hand, too much competition might put a lot of pressure on them and could lead to negative outcomes like stress or bullying. So, there must be a balance somewhere.

Perhaps I should look into some research or expert opinions on this. Maybe there are studies that show the effects of competition on child development. I could try to find some articles or papers that discuss this topic.

Let me consider the pros and cons of encouraging competitiveness in children.

Starting with the pros:

1. Motivation: Competition can motivate children to work harder and achieve more than they would otherwise.

2. Skill development: In competitive environments, children may learn important skills like strategic thinking, resilience, and how to handle both winning and losing.

3. Social skills: Competing with others can help children learn how to interact with peers, follow rules, and be part of a team.

Now, the cons:

1. Stress and pressure: Excessive competition can lead to high levels of stress and pressure, which might harm a child's mental health.

2. Focus on winning: Children might become too focused on winning and lose sight of the enjoyment and learning aspects of activities.

3. Negative behaviors: Some children might resort to cheating or other unethical behaviors to win.

4. Self-esteem issues: Constant comparison with others could affect a child's self-esteem, especially if they don't perform well.

Hmm, so there are valid points on both sides. Maybe the key is to encourage healthy competition, where the focus is on personal improvement and enjoyment rather than just beating others.

I also think that the age of the child matters. Younger children might not understand the concept of competition as well, so introducing it too early could be problematic. Perhaps as children grow older, they can handle more competitive situations.

Moreover, different children have different temperaments and personalities. Some might thrive in competitive environments, while others might feel overwhelmed. It's important to consider each child's individual needs and abilities.

I wonder if there are any educational theories or psychological studies that address this issue. Maybe I should look into that.

Let me try to think of some specific examples. In schools, there are often academic competitions like spelling bees or math contests. These can be great opportunities for students who enjoy them, but they might also create pressure for those who don't perform as well. Similarly, in sports, team competitions can build camaraderie and skills, but there's also the risk of injury and overemphasis on winning.

Perhaps it's essential to teach children how to compete gracefully, meaning they learn to appreciate their own efforts and those of others, regardless of the outcome.

Another aspect is the role of parents and teachers in encouraging competition. If adults place too much importance on winning, children might feel compelled to excel at any cost. On the contrary, if competition is presented as just one among many aspects of an activity, it might be less detrimental.

I also recall hearing about the difference between "mastery-oriented" and "performance-oriented" goals. Mastery-oriented goals focus on learning and improving one's own abilities, while performance-oriented goals are about demonstrating competence compared to others. Research suggests that mastery goals are more beneficial for long-term motivation and resilience.

Maybe encouraging children to set mastery-oriented goals could be a way to channel competitiveness in a positive direction.

Let me see if I can find some resources to support this idea.

[At this point, I would perform a search to find relevant studies or articles on childhood competition and its effects.]

5 Reasons Why Competition is Good (and bad) for your Child

What does the word ‘competition’ bring to mind? Is all competition a good thing? How do you distinguish between helpful competition and that which may harm your child?
In this article, you’ll discover what competition is, how it can affect your child, and how to help your child choose the right kind of competition for their stage of sporting development.
Sport usually takes the form of competition, whether it’s a game of basketball or the school cross country championships, competition is the activity of striving to win something by defeating or gaining supremacy over others.
However, competition is not just about structured games and events. In fact, it transpires any time an individual or team pitches their skills against one another.
Think back to great competitions you had as a kid – where did they take place?
Competition is a social process. How a child interacts with and interprets competition depends on the biological and social changes that they are going through.
At the age of 7 children start to learn organisation skills, such as the ability to resolve disputes and work towards collective goals.
The way they experience competition is entirely different to a 15-year-old with 8 more years of cognitive development.
Competition provides feedback that we can evaluate in terms of behavioural, psychological, social outcomes and can offer a rich learning environment for kids to express and develop physical skills and personal attributes.
Here are 5 reasons why competition is a good thing for your child:
Competition embodies play.
Play is perhaps the greatest setting for learning social skills and integration.
Competition is exciting.
Learning happens best when you’re excited about it. A competitive environment is perfect for developing your skills because it pushes you to always give your best.
Competition fosters cooperation.
In an age of social media and growing individualism, time spent interacting and communicating with others is reducing. However, our ability to work with others to achieve a common goal is an essential skill to develop, not only in sport but in life. Competition allows children to learn patterns of social cooperation without exceeding critical limits of aggression.
Competition develops emotional control.
With appropriate instruction, competition encourages children to reflect on their behaviour under emotionally intense situation and develop strong emotional intelligence, accordingly. Control and competence are correlated – when you feel in control of your emotions, your preference to work hard and take on new challenge to learn increases.
Competition inspires creativity.
Time and again, to win the game, or gain the supremacy, requires thinking outside of the box. Competition urges children to challenges their status quo and try new things, which improves their creativity and problem solving skills.
On the other hand, competition can be detrimental to your child’s development when poorly executed.
Here are 5 negative effects to watch out for:
Competition harbours hostility and aggression.
A winning at all costs attitude can easily manifest into aggressive behaviours, a loss of sportsmanship, and ultimately, cheating.
What’s more, some parents instigate this behaviour by trying to fulfil their need for satisfaction and success through their children.
Competition leads to dropout.
When a child perceives a lack of competence, or are no longer able to satisfactory demonstrate achievements, they lose the motivation to continue and look for other activities to draw pleasure from.
Competition triggers injury.
Intensity peaks during competition. When a child is underprepared physically, or is competing too much for their growing body to handle, their likelihood of injury goes up dramatically.
Competition chokes performance.
Competitive experiences can be perceived as threatening. And when a child’s threat mode is activated it triggers survival emotions like fear, and anger, which fills crucial brain processing space otherwise used for high-level thinking stuff vital to performing at your best.
Competition is ego deflating.
The success of one child or team causes the failure of another. This is more likely to happen when success is measured solely on the competition outcome.
Because competition can deliver both positive and negative experiences (depending on the environment or situation) to your child, the question is: how can you help your child choose the best available options?
I recommend considering three important criteria:
Great competition happens at, or just above, your child’s ability level.
We are at our best when in pursuit of a great goal or challenge, one that is just outside our reach and excites us to reach inside ourselves and grow. Competition that is too easy is boring and causes motivation to suffer, while a competitive challenge well outside our reach can be overwhelming.
Great competition is focused.
It’s easy to think more is better when it comes to competition – more people, more teams, more opportunity. However, often the best competition is selective, involving an opponent or adversary that challenges you in a way that reveals your strengths, grows your weaknesses, and inspires you to bring your ‘A-game’ every time you turn up.
Great competition emphasises the process, not the result.
The competitive environment is critical. Choose environments that focus on self-reflection and mastery rather than winning, expert assistance rather than instruction, and inquisition rather than close-mindedness.
To sum up, competitive environments are a big part of the sporting experience, yet they can impact development in both positive and negative ways.
Therefore, it’s important to think carefully about the type of competition your child participates in.

Why Competition Is Good for Kids (and How to Keep It That Way)
When done right, competition can help your children learn skills they'll use throughout their lives.
By Devan McGuinness
To some parents, "competition" is a dirty word. Not only does it place too much pressure on kids to be their best, they argue, but it can also cause unnecessary stress and leave children feeling disappointed if they don't measure up. To shield kids from disappointment, many well-meaning moms and dads either declare everyone a winner or avoid competitive situations altogether.
But is a shelf full of participation trophies really the answer? Not necessarily. Child development experts point out that a little healthy competition can be good for kids. Besides setting them up for wins and losses later in life—hey, they won't always land that big promotion—competitive activities help them develop important skills they'll use well into adulthood, like taking turns, developing empathy, and tenacity.
"Competition helps kids learn that it is not always the best or the brightest who are successful, but rather those that work hard and stick with it," says Timothy Gunn, Psy.D., a pediatric neuropsychologist, owner of Gunn Psychological Services, Inc., in Southern California, and a judge on Lifetime Network's Child Genius: Battle of the Brightest docu-series. What's more, he says, children who engage in competition "earn critical social skills through interacting with other children, while also learning the value of hard work and developing self-esteem and self-efficacy."

Another plus: It's a healthy setting for your child to learn how to be a team player. "Many cooperative games teach children to problem solve as a team and help them learn the lifelong skills of working for the common good of the group," says Ronda Klosterman, a physical education teacher at St. Joseph Elementary School in Long Beach, California.
The key is to ensure the atmosphere promotes constructive competition. That's not always something your children are able to pick up on or communicate with you, so take note of how they react to competitive situations.
If your children are involved in healthy competition, they may:
ask to participate in the activity again
be able to win and lose gracefully
learn new skills and want to better themselves
enjoy improved self esteem
If your children are involved in unhealthy competition, they may:
resist participation in the activity
fake an illness to avoid the activity
say outright they doesn't want to participate
show signs of depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, or loss of appetite—all red flags that warrant further discussion. "Most competitive children experience some anxiety before a big game (or test), but they should not be constantly worried to the extent that it is affecting other areas of their life," Dr. Gunn warns.
How to encourage healthy competition
Losing a nail biter of a game or falling short of winning top prize isn't easy for anyone, but you have the power to help your kids think positively about competition. For starters, it helps to define accomplishment not just as winning the activity, but as setting a goal for something they put their minds to and accomplish. Try to be there to support your kids through their challenges and regularly reinforce the message that it's okay to lose as long as they are putting forth and effort and learning from the experience, Dr. Gunn says. Modeling good behavior (read: no blaming the refs afterward) is also a powerful tool.
And never underestimate a change in perspective. "I believe that part of developing healthy competition is that children learn their most important competitor is their self," says Dr. Gunn. He had a chance to put his beliefs into practice when his 5-year-old son felt defeated after losing a cross-country running event. Rather than concentrating on his son being the slowest one on the team, Dr. Gunn shifted the focus to the child beating his last time.
"We taught him that we wanted him to not worry about how fast the other kids were running but to just race against the clock," he says. "We set times for him to complete certain distances, so his perspective changed from competing against the other kids to competing against his own performance. As a result, he went from experiencing failure to experiencing success, and has continued to enjoy cross-country practice—even though he is often the last child to finish."

Abstract
This study examined the effects of competition on intrinsic motivation. Subjects (N = 23) were randomly assigned to conditions of competition or intrinsic-mastery orientation. In the competition condition, subjects were instructed to perform an interesting activity with the explicit goal of “beating” other participants. In the intrinsic-mastery orientation condition, subjects were told to do as well as they could while looking for novel ways to perform the activity. Results showed that subjects in the competition condition displayed less subsequent intrinsic motivation than did mastery-oriented subjects. The present findings corroborate predictions based on cognitive evaluation theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) that competition can have deleterious consequences on intrinsic motivation.

... Reaching and sustaining intrinsic motivation is not an easy task, because many risks threaten it. For example, competition can jeopardize intrinsic motivation (Vansteenkiste & Deci, 2003), whereby personality traits can have an influential character (Epstein & Harackiewicz, 1992;Tauer & Harackiewicz, 1999; Vallerand et al., 1986). In an experiment it was shown that high performance motivated subjects prefer a competitive environment, whereas low performance motivated subjects prefer to avoid competition (Tauer & Harackiewicz, 1999).  ...

... A number of hypotheses have been proposed regarding the impact of trait competitiveness on variables related to organizational performance. For instance, it has been argued that it can affect job motivation in either a positive way (Epstein & Harackiewicz, 1992;Choi, Jung, & Im, 2018) or negative way (Deci, Schwartz, Sheinman et al., 1981; Vallerand, Gauvin, & Halliwell, 1986; Amabile, 1982). Personal development competitiveness has also been reported to decrease corruption tolerance, while interpersonal competitiveness showed the opposite effect, although this effect was moderated in a performance-oriented climate (Mudrack, Bloodgood, & Turnley, 2012;Choi, Jung, & Im, 2018).  ...

... Admittedly, direct competition is a potent motivator of human behavior (Festinger, 1954;Garcia, Tor, & Schiff, 2013). On the other hand, social psychologists document how competition in some contexts undermines students' intrinsic motivation (Deci, Betley, Kahle, Abrams, & Porac, 1981; Vallerand, Gauvin, & Halliwell, 1986). Given that business schools function as "identity workspaces", i.e. a holding environment that facilitates sensemaking to create or stabilize an identity (Petriglieri & Petriglieri, 2010), one may well ask: should students be developing their professional identity primarily around the dynamic of rivalry (at the potential expense of undermining intrinsic motivation)?  ...

Introduction
It has been well documented by quantitative and qualitative researchers that children in the early 21st century—particularly those in the middle class—live busy lives, full of scheduled activities in the after-school hours. What is critical, and not discussed as often, is the subject of this article: competition. Competition is a powerful presence in children’s lives, as many adults (mainly parents and teachers, but also coaches and instructors) place an emphasis on the acquisition of a competitive spirit in childhood. This is happening in a variety of fields across the age spectrum. The popular media have picked up on the increase in competition for young children and adolescents, and the conflicts that often ensue, particularly in the United States. Academics have been slower to study this trend, with few examining the structure, content, and Consequences of childhood competition; given the media focus, much of the scholarly work discussed below focuses on American children, and in cases where Australian and Canadian children are the focus, the results are presented by American publishers. This article pulls together work on kids and competition in a variety of areas, conducted by a range of scholars including sociologists, psychologists, historians, and economists. Given that competition is often a luxury afforded to those families who do not have to worry about housing, feeding, and clothing their children, most of the studies presented here look at those in the middle class; when lower classes are included, the potential to see how crucial childhood competition can be in the perpetuation of inequality is clear. Regardless of class, we can envision three major types of competition in children’s lives: (1) academic, (2) athletic, and (3) artistic. Social competition is also present, sometimes encompassing more specific competitive endeavors. Each of these categories is discussed below, though all are given equal weight. The ways in which certain categories—like Gender—impact the competitive experience overall are also discussed.
General Social Scientific Studies
Anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists have been tackling what it means for children to live in a competitive culture and how this culture is shaped by social class. Best 2011, Lamont 1992, Friedman 2013, and Levey 2010 examine issues related to parents and education. Darrah, et al. 2007 focuses on families and how competition touches them as they interact with the world on a daily basis. Levine 2006 and Luthar, et al. 2006 look at how pressures impact teens, especially those from affluent families. Family, schooling, and social class, in addition to after-school activities, are the primary social institutions involved in these works.

Sociologist Best tackles the relationship between status and competition; chapter 3 addresses the prizes available to students today, like having multiple valedictorians and many honor societies; based on critical analysis of culture, less on original data, showing that competition can help us find our place in a complicated society.
Darrah, Charles N., James M. Freeman, and June A. English-Lueck. Busier Than Ever! Why American Families Can’t Slow Down. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2007.
This team of anthropologists followed fourteen American families and found that people are competitive about their busyness, especially when it comes to their children’s lives and activities; being “busy” is seen as a sign of success, even as the time demands sometimes stress everyone out.
Friedman, Hilary Levey. Playing to Win: Raising Children in a Competitive Culture. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2013.
First book to systemically consider the shape and impact of competitive after-school activities for elementary school-age children, their families, and the adults who teach them; a crucial starting point to understand the sociological, historical, and psychological perspectives related to the growth of these activities over time, drawing on examples from chess, dance, and soccer.

A now-classic work of cultural sociology, Lamont interviewed 160 upper-middle class men to find out how they define success; a crucial part of this is how they raise their children to be competitive in school and sports, a crucial part of class reproduction.

This is the first article on the development of competitive after-school activities, and it covers the Public Schools Athletic League and other organizations, like Little League; the argument is that while competition in after-school hours originally focused on low-income youth, one hundred years later the focus had shifted to middle- and upper-middle-class kids.
Levine, Madeline. The Price of Privilege: How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids. New York: HarperCollins, 2006.
Levine, a practicing clinical psychologist, considers what is making affluent kids so unhappy and concludes that competitive pressures in the school system and sports are a key component; draws on her own experiences as a therapist in the Bay Area and research by others like Luthar.

DOI: 10.1037/0012-1649.42.3.583
Psychologist Luthar is a pioneer studying affluent children and the pressures they face to achieve in and out of school; in addition to this paper, she has written a host of other articles based on original survey data looking at how academic and extracurricular anxieties increase well-off children’s rates of depression and rates of self-injury.

The Effects of Sibling Competition Dr. Sylvia Rimm
THE EFFECTS OF SIBLNG COMPETITION
Parents 
    
    often wonder why their children are so different from 
    
    each other even though they are raised in the very same 
    
    family. In addition to genetic differences, competition 
    
    among siblings does affect the development of other children 
    
    in the family, and may be the most important reason why 
    
    children raised in the same way are so different.
Sometimes, 
    
    second or third children feel inadequate by comparison to a 
    
    first sibling and thus search for different areas of expertise. 
    
    Parents often reinforce those differences because they want 
    
    to encourage self-esteem in each child and also fear that the 
    
    second or third child may not be as skilled as the first child. 
    
    That process often results in parents labeling their children. 
    
    For example, if the first child is considered the "scholar," 
    
    the second child may be referred to as the "creative" 
    
    child, the "social" child, or the "athlete." 
    
    Those labels may increase the competitiveness within the family 
    
    because each child believes he/she should be best in the family 
    
    at something. Labeling also causes children to assume they are 
    
    not good at whatever another sibling is best at. So the scholars 
    
    may assume they can't be creative, and the creative children 
    
    may give up on academics because they believe they can't achieve 
    
    as good grades as their sibling.
Children 
    
    in the same family are surely different from each other 
    
    but also have much in common. If the children study and 
    
    do homework, it is likely they will all be reasonably 
    
    good students. Indeed, families should encourage their 
    
    children to know they can have a whole smart family. Children 
    
    can also be physically fit, although they may surely choose 
    
    different sports or activities to exercise their fitness.
Even social skills can be learned, 
    
    and although some children may enjoy friends more than 
    
    others, labeling your children as the social ones has 
    
    the impact of directing them to be the best partiers, 
    
    and you will surely regret that label by their teenage 
    
    years.
Dr. 
        
        Anne Caroles, Psychologist*
Dr. 
            
            Anne Caroles was referred to as the "brain" in her 
            
            family. Her sister was called the "beauty." As a 
            
            teenager, Anne viewed herself as "ugly" and believed 
            
            she would never be attractive to anyone. Her studies became 
            
            a hiding place for her. Now she looks back at her pictures 
            
            and realizes she was quite normal looking.
*Excerpt 
          
          from See Jane Win by Sylvia B. Rimm (1999, Crown Publishing.)
It is not coincidental that two sisters or brothers close 
          
          in age seem to be so different from each other. If one is 
          
          neat, the other is often sloppy. If one is quiet, the other 
          
          is often noisy. Children are attracted to being different 
          
          than their siblings so they can receive their own special 
          
          attention from their parents. Some differences are not worrisome; 
          
          however, important differences, such as achievement and underachievement 
          
          or honesty and dishonesty, will cause parents to find they 
          
          have serious sibling problems on their hands.
When 
    
    children are labeled best in a domain, they often do their best 
    
    to prevent another sibling from encroaching on their domain. 
    
    They feel ownership and are threatened by a sister or brother 
    
    who is as good in math or better in sports. Sometimes they even 
    
    beg their parent not to let their siblings participate in their 
    
    activities. It would be better to talk to your child about the 
    
    jealousy they feel than to prevent another sibling from joining 
    
    a particular activity. Sometimes you may find your children 
    
    have little confidence in their abilities; thus, you may decide 
    
    to protect that child's domain. That would be particularly so 
    
    if you have one child in the family who seems best at everything 
    
    else.
How 
    
    Sibling Competition Causes Underachievement
There are specific sibling combinations that predispose 
    
    children toward underachievement. These particular combinations 
    
    are inherently more competitive than usual, and one or 
    
    more of the siblings are disadvantaged by this competition. 
    
    Many families learn to minimize minor sibling rivalry 
    
    or at least assist siblings in dealing with their competitiveness. 
    
    However, with these special combinations, the parenting 
    
    job is extremely challenging.
The combinations that seem unusually 
    
    difficult include: very close-aged, same-gender siblings, 
    
    siblings of an extremely gifted child, and a family 
    
    of children with one who is considerably younger.
TWO CLOSE-AGED, SAME-GENDER CHILDREN
Judge 
        
        Edna Conway*
Judge Edna Conway’s success seemed 
            
            to grow in contrast to her older sister’s lack 
            
            of success. No challenge was too difficult for Edna. 
            
            She would quietly assess each obstacle, admit that perhaps 
            
            it might be difficult, and then decide it wouldn’t 
            
            be impossible. Her conclusion typically was, "I 
            
            think I can do that—I just have to keep going." 
            
            Edna’s sister, in stark contrast, was negative 
            
            about almost everything, was pessimistic, complained 
            
            about any chore, and completed very little of what she 
            
            began. Edna explained, "I felt more like an oldest 
            
            or only child and always felt ready to step out on my 
            
            own." Edna not only graduated college and law school, 
            
            but was also elected to a judgeship. Her sister dropped 
            
            out of college and struggled with finding any positive 
            
            direction.
*Excerpt 
          
          from See Jane Win, by Sylvia B. Rimm (1999, Crown Publishing)
Where two close-aged, same-gender siblings 
    
    are treated similarly, both children are likely to feel more 
    
    competitive pressure. Because they are expected to act the 
    
    same, the age difference typically puts stress on the younger 
    
    one to keep up with the older one, causing the younger one 
    
    to feel inadequate. The older one may also feel some frustration 
    
    because he doesn’t receive special privileges that go 
    
    with age. Because the older sibling usually outperforms the 
    
    younger, he will appear confident. Both siblings are also 
    
    likely to compete for a close relationship with the same-gender 
    
    or most powerful parent. Recognizing individuality by acknowledging 
    
    privileges of age and differences in interests and abilities 
    
    relieves some of the competitive pressures. However, parents 
    
    can expect to be frustrated as they try to deal with two competitive 
    
    brothers or two hostile sisters who should be such good company 
    
    for each other.
FOLLOWING A VERY TALENTED
OLDEST CHILD
When 
    
    the first child exhibits unusual talent, she is likely 
    
    to be the recipient of special parent and school attention, 
    
    unusual educational opportunities, and a multitude of 
    
    honors and awards. This child thus becomes the pace-setter 
    
    for the siblings who follow. High standards are set, 
    
    and younger siblings believe that in order to earn equal 
    
    recognition they must achieve a similar level of success.
Even 
    
    if your children are very capable, they are likely to 
    
    view such accomplishment as quite impossible and may 
    
    feel great pressure. Because they want to establish 
    
    an individual and respectable place in the family, and 
    
    because they view themselves as unlikely to compete 
    
    successfully, they may select a different and sometimes 
    
    opposite direction for achievement and attention. If 
    
    the family can encourage their activities and help them 
    
    to understand their competitive feelings, the child 
    
    may develop both competence and confidence.
If 
    
    the oldest sibling’s accomplishments are significant, 
    
    it’s often difficult to convince younger children 
    
    of their own talent. In such cases they may resort to 
    
    underachievement for attention seeking. Their failures 
    
    and behavior problems may thus become their route to 
    
    family recognition. They manipulate family members to 
    
    attend to their problems, thus setting an underachieving 
    
    cycle in motion.
THE "BABY" OF THE FAMILY
The 
    
    sibling combination in which the youngest is labeled 
    
    the "baby of the family" may also initiate 
    
    underachievement. The youngest child is by no means 
    
    always an underachiever. As a matter of fact, research 
    
    on eminence finds youngest children to be second only 
    
    to oldest children as achievers. However, if youngest 
    
    children are either over-indulged or overempowered by 
    
    older siblings, particularly when they are much younger 
    
    than the others, they may likely be underachievers.
Older 
    
    children may treat their youngest siblings almost as 
    
    toy dolls and do so much for them that the younger ones 
    
    are prevented from developing their own ideas and activities. 
    
    In this case they become dependent on the positive feedback 
    
    from older siblings and may become fearful of assuming 
    
    responsibilities or initiating creative activities. 
    
    The youngest child may see little likelihood of becoming 
    
    as competent and successful as older siblings, and besides, 
    
    it’s much easier to get help from the collection 
    
    of "big" people around them.
WHAT PARENTS CAN DO TO
CREATE A WHOLE SMART FAMILY
Dr. 
        
        Sandra Calvin, Engineer*
Dr. Sandra Calvin’s family provides an excellent prototype 
            
            of how parents can raise a whole smart family. Although there 
            
            were five children in the family, all went to college and all 
            
            have careers.
Sandra’s parents considered all the 
          
          kids to be smart, including her brother, who had a learning 
          
          disability. Being smart and hardworking were both assumed 
          
          and emphasized. The children varied in their musical and athletic 
          
          skills and activities, but all participated in both. The whole 
          
          family was included whether they were going to a concert or 
          
          a basketball game. Music, science, camping, and sports were 
          
          part of growing up in their enriched family environment. It 
          
          was just assumed that all would continue their education beyond 
          
          high school, and indeed they all did.
*Excerpts 
          
          from See Jane Win by Sylvia B. Rimm (1999, Crown Publishing.)
Avoid labeling. Although it's obvious that all children in the family are not 
    
    genetically alike and that some children may have differences 
    
    in intellectual, artistic, musical, or physical abilities, it’s 
    
    also obvious that family competition seems to encourage each 
    
    child in the family to seek special attention. When parents 
    
    label their children, it limits their confidence in almost all 
    
    other areas.
Prioritize 
    
    education as first. It’s important for 
    
    parents to consider all their children intelligent even if 
    
    one seems a bit more intelligent than the others. When parents 
    
    expect all their children to be smart and value challenge, 
    
    the children are actually less competitive with each other.
Consider 
    
    both parents intelligent. When parents consider each other to be intelligent, their 
    
    children have high regard for both. Regardless of which parent 
    
    children identify with, they automatically consider themselves 
    
    smart.
HOW TO BE A WHOLE SMART FAMILY
Cheer for your siblings and they'll cheer for you.
You may be second best in your family but might be 
      
      best if you were in other families.
Even if you're best in your family, you might be second 
      
      best compared to another family.
Doing the best you can do is more important than being 
      
      best in the family.
Learn to enjoy your experiences and improvement without 
      
      continually comparing yourself to your siblings.
Effort 
      
      and attitude count.

Alright, I've got some information here from different sources. Let's see what they say about competition and children.

The first article is from AUT Millennium News, and it talks about the good and bad aspects of competition for children. It mentions that competition can be exciting and foster cooperation, emotional control, and creativity. However, it can also lead to hostility, dropout, injuries, choking performance, and ego deflation. The article suggests considering three criteria for choosing the right competition: it should be at or just above the child's ability level, focused, and emphasize the process over the result.

That seems balanced. It acknowledges both the benefits and drawbacks of competition and provides guidelines for parents to help their children engage in healthy competition.

The second article is from Parents.com, and it argues that competition can be good for kids when done right. It says that competition helps children develop important skills like taking turns, empathy, and tenacity. The article emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the competitive environment is constructive and offers tips for encouraging healthy competition, such as focusing on effort and learning rather than just winning and modeling good behavior.

This aligns with the first article, promoting the idea that competition can be beneficial if managed properly.

The third document is a research paper titled "Negative Effects of Competition on Children's Intrinsic Motivation." It reports on a study that found children in a competition condition displayed less intrinsic motivation than those in a mastery-oriented condition. This suggests that competition can have deleterious effects on intrinsic motivation, which is consistent with some of the cons I listed earlier.

So, there's empirical evidence suggesting that competition can reduce intrinsic motivation in children, which is something to consider.

The fourth source is from Oxford Bibliographies, and it provides an overview of research on children and competitiveness from various disciplines like sociology, psychology, and history. It discusses how competition is increasingly present in children's lives, particularly in middle-class families, and how it affects different areas like academics, athletics, and arts. The article also mentions that competition can be a double-edged sword, potentially leading to both positive outcomes like skill development and negative outcomes like stress and inequality.

This seems like a comprehensive review, highlighting the complexity of the issue.

The fifth article is by Dr. Sylvia Rimm and focuses on the effects of sibling competition. It explains how siblings may develop different identities to differentiate themselves and how labeling can reinforce these differences, sometimes leading to underachievement in one or more siblings. The article provides strategies for parents to minimize negative effects, such as avoiding labels and prioritizing education.

This is interesting because it looks at competition within the family context, which is an important aspect.

Overall, the consensus seems to be that competition can be beneficial for children if it's handled appropriately, but it can also have negative consequences if not managed well. It's essential for parents and educators to create a supportive environment that emphasizes personal growth, effort, and enjoyment over just winning.

Considering all this, I think the answer to whether children should be encouraged to be competitive is yes, but with caveats. Competition can be a positive force in a child's development, fostering important skills and motivations, but it needs to be approached thoughtfully to mitigate potential harms.

So, my final answer is: Yes, but with careful consideration of the context and the individual child's needs and temperament.

\boxed{\text{Yes, but with careful consideration of the context and the individual child's needs and temperament.}}
