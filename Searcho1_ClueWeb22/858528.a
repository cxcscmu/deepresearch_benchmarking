So I've been thinking about this question: "Why do people want gun control?" It's a pretty complex topic, and opinions vary widely. I think to really understand this, I need to look at it from different angles—like public safety, prevention of mass shootings, and perhaps even mental health considerations. Maybe I should start by understanding what gun control actually means. I know that it refers to laws and regulations that govern the manufacture, sale, transfer, possession, modification, or use of firearms by civilians. But why do some people think these controls are necessary?

I remember there have been a lot of debates about gun control in the news, especially after tragic events like school shootings. It seems like after these incidents, calls for stricter gun laws get louder. So, public safety might be a major reason. People might feel that if guns are more restricted, fewer tragedies like these would occur. But I also know that others argue that guns don't kill people; people kill people, and that restricting guns would only disarm law-abiding citizens while criminals still get hold of them illegally.

Maybe I should look into some statistics on gun violence and see how the United States compares to other countries. I've heard that the U.S. has a higher rate of gun ownership and also a higher rate of gun violence, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. Perhaps comparing it to other nations could provide some insight into whether gun control measures are effective.

Let me try to search for some information on this.

On gun violence, the United States is an outlier
Publication date:
March 25, 2021
Among 64 high-income countries and territories, the United States stands out for its high levels of gun violence. The US ranks eighth out of 64 for homicides by firearm (age-adjusted). ​Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, two US territories, rank first and third on that list. Firearm injuries tend to be more frequent in places where people have easy access to firearms, according to findings from the 2018 Global Burden of Disease study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).
(Graph Source: GBD Compare (ihmeuw.org/5f6r)
When we look exclusively at high-income countries and territories with populations of 10 million or more, the US ranks first.
(Graph Source: IHME/Scott Glenn)
Age-adjusted firearm homicide rates in the US are 13 times greater than they are in France, and 22 times greater than in the European Union as a whole. The US has 23 times the rate of firearm homicide seen in Australia.
Within the US, gun violence varies widely. Age-adjusted firearm homicide rates range from a high of 17 per 100,000 in Washington, D.C. to a low of 0.91 per 100,000 in New Hampshire. Washington, D.C.’s rate is similar to those of the Bahamas and Mexico, which rank eighth and tenth globally. New Hampshire’s rate is similar to that of Pakistan. Even though New Hampshire has the lowest rates of age-adjusted firearm homicides in the US, its rate is nearly five times greater than that of the European Union as a whole.
(Graph Source: IHME/Scott Glenn)
Taking a global view, the six countries with the highest age-adjusted rates of firearm homicides are:
El Salvador
Venezuela
Guatemala
Colombia
Honduras
Brazil
Research has found high levels of homicides in these countries are associated with drug cartels, the illegal trade in firearms from the US, and firearms flowing to civilians after conflicts end, as summarized in the Global Burden of Disease study .
Numerous studies have highlighted promising policies to reduce gun violence. In the US, research published in JAMA found an association between laws strengthening background checks or requiring permits to purchase firearms with reductions in rates of firearm homicides.
Following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 in Australia, the Australian National Firearms Agreement restricted the use of firearms by civilians. This legislation has been credited with ending mass shootings and reducing firearm suicides in Australia according to a study published in JAMA.
In South Africa, rates of violent deaths dropped after the passage of the Firearms Control Act of 2000, according to research published in The South African Medical Journal .
In Brazil, São Paulo reduced firearm homicides through firearm buy-back programs, enforcement of firearm control legislation passed in 2003, and improvements in policing, as made evident in research published in SciElo.

Deaths From Gun Violence: How The U.S. Compares With The Rest Of The World

Nurith Aizenman
The level of gun violence in the United States is completely outsized compared to what's seen in other wealthy countries. In fact, the rate of gun violence in the U.S. is higher than in many low-income countries.
Those are the findings of the latest version of an annual report on gun violence from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death.
The report points out that when you consider countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success — income per person and average education level, for instance — the United States is bested by just 18 nations, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan.
Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence. But the U.S. has the 28th-highest rate in the world: 4.43 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2017. That was nine times as high as the rate in Canada, which had 0.47 deaths per 100,000 people — and 29 times as high as in Denmark, which had 0.15 deaths per 100,000.
The 2017 figures also paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the rest of the  world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor — such as Bangladesh, which saw 0.07 deaths per 100,000 people.
Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape.
"It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence," Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME, told NPR. "If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out."

To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad said a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. "The gangs and drug traffickers fight among themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police," said Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire. Another country with widespread gun violence is Venezuela, which has been grappling with political unrest and an economic meltdown.

One more way to consider these data: The institute also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should be seeing only 0.46 deaths per 100,000 people. Instead, its actual rate of 4.43 deaths per 100,000 is almost 10 times as high.
Correction Nov. 12, 2018
A previous version of the chart in the story on countries in "East, Southeast and South Asia" included Seychelles in the list. Although the Seychelles is geographically located between Africa and Asia, it is generally considered an African nation. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, however, categorizes it as Asian because, according to a spokeswoman for the institute, the country's epidemiological profile is "much more similar ... to countries in the Southeast Asia region."

Exactly How High Are Gun Violence Rates in the U.S., Compared to Other Countries?
A reader asks about the differences between firearm homicide and suicide rates in the United States and the rest of the world.

Last month, we relaunched Ask The Trace, a question-and-answer series about gun violence in the U.S. As always, if you have a burning question about the issue we cover, please follow this link. The Trace’s journalists will review your query and may answer it in an article like this one.
The first reader question we’re tackling this year: How does gun violence in the U.S. compare to gun violence in other countries?
A dig through The Trace’s archives shows that we examined the issue in 2018, following the publication of a study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a global research center at the University of Washington. The study created a country-by-country ranking of gun homicides and suicides, and explored possible drivers of the violence in each country.

Among the main findings: America’s gun homicide rate was more than double the average for all countries, and was at the top of the list for countries with high Socio-demographic Index (SDI) scores, a summary measure of a country’s health outcomes. When it came to gun suicides, the U.S. was by far the global leader. Despite accounting for only 4 percent of the global population, America was responsible for more than a third of the world’s firearm suicides.
The original study used cause-of-death data, supplemented with statistical modeling, to estimate firearm mortality across 195 countries and territories. The estimates showed that the death toll from guns surpassed that from war and terrorism nearly every year since 1990.
For this story, we revisited the data used to create that global ranking, and found that three years later, very little has changed. Americans are still significantly more likely to die by gun: 11.1 out of every 100,000 Americans were killed by firearms in 2019. That’s more than triple the global rate of 3.0.
Here’s an updated chart, showing how U.S. murder and suicide rates compare to other countries.
As the chart shows, the American gun suicide rate is exceedingly high. Roughly seven out of every 10 gun fatalities are self-inflicted in the U.S., amounting to a gun suicide rate that sets the U.S. apart on the global stage. No other country compared.
There were 13,000 firearm murders in the U.S. in 2019, according to IHME — about 7 percent of all the murders counted in its database of more than 200 countries. That works out to roughly four in every 100,000 Americans dying in a gun-related homicide, the 30th highest rate in the world. Many of the countries with higher per-capita murders are major sites of drug production or trafficking, which the researchers in the IMHE study identified as a significant factor influencing a country’s rate of gun murders.
When the set of countries is narrowed to those with high scores on the SDI index, though, the U.S. is firmly in the top spot. The index is a spectrum of development that accounts for a country’s income per capita, average educational attainment, and fertility rates. Residents of countries with higher scores generally report better well-being and lower levels of violence.
According to the researchers, an extraordinarily high rate of gun ownership in the U.S. has contributed to the prevalence of violence here. To compare countries’ gun ownership rates, researchers in the original study assigned each nation a score based on figures from the Small Arms Survey, the country’s ratio of firearm suicides to all suicides (a common proxy for firearm availability), and other data sources. The United States received the maximum score of 100. No other country scored above 50.
This gap has likely yawned in the years since the study was published. Starting in 2020, the United States entered a dizzying upswing in gun-buying, spurred in part by social unrest from the pandemic. Nine of the top 10 highest months for gun sales in United States history came in 2020 and 2021, including the top three spots.
Just as past research has shown that states with more gun owners also see more firearm deaths, the study found that the same holds true for countries. The authors suggested that limiting the availability of guns can be an effective life-saving measure.
“Efforts to reduce the number of firearms in homes and supporting secure storage of existing firearms,” they wrote, “can … [limit] immediate access to a means of harm that generally does not allow opportunity for second thoughts.”

How U.S. gun deaths compare to other countries
By Robert Preidt
February 3, 2016 / 1:44 PM / HealthDay
Americans are 10 times more likely to be killed by guns than people in other developed countries, a new study finds.
Compared to 22 other high-income nations, the United States' gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. And, even though the United States' suicide rate is similar to other countries, the nation's gun-related suicide rate is eight times higher than other high-income countries, researchers said.
The study was published online Feb. 1 in The American Journal of Medicine.
"Overall, our results show that the U.S., which has the most firearms per capita in the world, suffers disproportionately from firearms compared with other high-income countries," said study author Erin Grinshteyn, an assistant professor at the School of Community Health Science at the University of Nevada-Reno. "These results are consistent with the hypothesis that our firearms are killing us rather than protecting us," she said in a journal news release.
Death by gun: Top 20 states with highest rates 21 photos
The review of 2010 World Health Organization data also revealed that despite having a similar rate of nonlethal crimes as those countries, the United States has a much higher rate of deadly violence, mostly due to the higher rate of gun-related murders.
The researchers also found that compared to people in the other high-income nations, Americans are seven times more likely to die from violence and six times more likely to be accidentally killed with a gun.
"More than two-thirds of the homicides in the U.S. are firearm homicides and studies have suggested that the non-gun homicide rate in the U.S. may be high because the gun homicide rate is high," Grinshteyn said.
"For example, offenders take into account the threat posed by their adversaries. Individuals are more likely to have lethal intent if they anticipate that their adversaries will be armed," she explained.
Even though it has half the population of the other 22 nations combined, the United States accounted for 82 percent of all gun deaths. The United States also accounted for 90 percent of all women killed by guns, the study found. Ninety-one percent of children under 14 who died by gun violence were in the United States. And 92 percent of young people between ages 15 and 24 killed by guns were in the United States, the study found.

Murder is the second leading cause of death among Americans aged 15 to 24, the study found. The research also showed that murder was the third leading cause of death among those aged 25-34. Compared to those in the same age groups in other wealthy countries, Americans aged 15-24 are 49 times more likely to be the victim of a gun-related murder. For those aged 25-34, that number is 32 times more likely, the research revealed.
Is gun violence a public health issue?
The researchers also point out that numerous studies suggest that reduced access to guns would lower the suicide rate in the United States.
"Differences in overall suicide rates across cities, states and regions in the United States are best explained not by differences in mental health, suicide ideation, or even suicide attempts, but by availability of firearms," said study co-author David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard University's School of Public Health, and director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and the Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center, all in Boston.
"Many suicides are impulsive, and the urge to die fades away. Firearms are a swift and lethal method of suicide with a high case-fatality rate," he noted in the news release.

Abstract
Violence is a serious public health issue in the U.S. This research compares the US and other high-income countries in terms of violent death. We used data from the World Health Organization for populous, high-income countries. Data from CDC's WISQARS and WONDER systems were used to assess mortality data among US white and non-white populations and in low-, medium-, and high-gun states in 2015. Death rates per 100,000 populations were calculated overall, by age, and by sex. Poisson and negative binomial regression were used to test for significance. The homicide rate in the US was 7.5 times higher than the homicide rate in the other high-income countries combined, which was largely attributable to a firearm homicide rate that was 24.9 times higher. The overall firearm death rate was 11.4 times higher in the US than in other high-income countries. In this dataset, 83.7% of all firearm deaths, 91.6% of women killed by guns, and 96.7% of all children aged 0-4 years killed by guns were from the US. Firearm homicide rates were 36 times higher in high-gun US states and 13.5 times higher in low-gun US states than the firearm homicide rate in other high-income countries combined. The firearm homicide rate among the US white population was 12 times higher than the firearm homicide rate in other high-income countries. The US firearm death rate increased between 2003 and 2015 and decreased in other high-income countries. The US continues to be an outlier among high-income countries with respect to firearm deaths.

Alright, so from these articles, it's clear that the United States has a significantly higher rate of gun violence compared to other high-income countries. The data shows that Americans are more likely to die from gun-related homicides and suicides. For example, one study found that the U.S. has a firearm homicide rate that is 25 times higher than other high-income countries. Additionally, even though the U.S. has a similar overall suicide rate, its gun-related suicide rate is eight times higher.

I think this disparity in gun violence rates is a key reason why many people in the U.S. support gun control measures. If having more guns leads to more gun deaths, then logically, reducing access to guns could lead to fewer deaths. This is backed by some of the research mentioned, which suggests that limiting firearm availability can save lives.

But, it's important to note that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation. Just because the U.S. has more guns and more gun violence doesn't automatically mean that the guns cause the violence. There could be other factors at play here. For instance, maybe there are cultural or social differences between the U.S. and other countries that contribute to higher levels of violence, and the ease of accessing guns simply makes that violence more lethal.

Moreover, some people argue that guns are necessary for self-defense. They believe that restricting gun ownership would leave law-abiding citizens vulnerable to criminals who would still find ways to obtain guns illegally. So, even if there are more guns in circulation, the idea is that "good guys" with guns can prevent crimes or stop them in progress.

I need to consider both sides of the argument. Maybe I should look into studies that examine the effectiveness of gun control measures in reducing violence.

Abstract and Figures
Do gun control laws reduce violence? To answer this question, a city-level cross-sectional analysis was performed on data pertaining to every U.S. city with a population of at least 25,000 in 1990 (n = 1,078), assessing the impact of 19 major types of gun control laws, and controlling for gun ownership levels and numerous other possible confounders. Models were estimated using instrumental variables (IVs) regression to address endogeneity of gun levels due to reverse causality. Results indicate that gun control laws generally show no evidence of effects on crime rates, possibly because gun levels do not have a net positive effect on violence rates. Although a minority of laws seem to show effects, they are as likely to imply violence-increasing effects as violence-decreasing effects. There were, however, a few noteworthy exceptions: requiring a license to possess a gun and bans on purchases of guns by alcoholics appear to reduce rates of both homicide and robbery. Weaker evidence suggests that bans on gun purchases by criminals and on possession by mentally ill persons may reduce assault rates, and that bans on gun purchase by criminals may also reduce robbery rates.

... There is also a rift in support for gun control amongst scholars, with some favoring more-restrictive forms of gun control and others favoring less-restrictive forms of gun regulation (Morral et al., 2018). The legality and utility of gun regulation has promoted much discussion amongst academics (see Braga et al., 2021; Kleck et al., 2016; Winkler, 2018). Public support for gun control is also mixed and has varied across time, although current estimates suggest that a slight majority favor more-restrictive forms of gun control, but do not favor complete firearm bans (Gallup, 2020;Parker et al., 2017).  ...
... These advocates tend to conform to the adage endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA) "guns don't kill people, people kill people" (Braga et al., 2021;Henigan, 2016;Shammas, 2019). This group believes that more-restrictive gun control will do little to reduce crime or to save lives (Kleck, 1997; Kleck et al., 2016; Wolfgang, 1958). On the other side of the debate are proponents of more-restrictive forms of gun regulation, or those who believe that "guns do kill people" (Braga et al., 2021, p. 148).  ...
... In fact, the United States civilian gun ownership rate is the highest in the world, with estimates suggesting that there are more than 350 million guns owned by Americans (Institute of Medicine & National Research Council, 2013). These instruments serve both legitimate (i.e., recreation, hunting, self-defense, etc.) and illegitimate purposes (i.e., criminal activities; Cook et al., 2011; Kleck et al., 2016). Thus, the real questions in the debate are (1) will strict gun control policies be able to effectively keep guns away from dangerous and "at risk" individuals who may want to harm themselves or others?  ...

... US states have enacted a diverse array of legislative and regulatory frameworks for gun control. Types of gun regulations may be roughly classified into registration, licensing, safety training, storage, and sales and distribution requirements (Carter, 2006;Hurka & Knill, 2020; Kleck, Kovandzic, & Bellows, 2016; Kwon & Baack, 2005). On the whole, studies find that gun regulations are associated with lower levels of crime and violence (Andres & Hempstead, 2011;Fleegler et al., 2013;Hurka & Knill, 2020;Smith & Spiegler, 2020).  ...
... A smaller body of research slightly diverges from these patterns. For example, in a quasi-experimental study, Kleck et al. (2016) investigated 19 gun control laws in more than one-thousand US cities but did not find strong evidence that gun control affected crime rates. Only licensing requirements and bans on gun purchases by those with a history of alcoholism were related to declines in homicide and robbery (Kleck et al., 2016).  ...

A huge international study of gun control finds strong evidence that it actually works
By Zack Beauchamp @zackbeauchamp zack@vox.com Updated Nov  6, 2017, 10:06am EST
The state of gun violence in the US, explained in 18 charts
Watch on
Does gun control help reduce gun deaths? It's a crucially important question in light of the horrible news out of Texas, but even for PhDs, it's a tough one. There's been a mountain of research on the subject, but these dozens of studies conducted over many years and in many different countries reach a broad and sometimes contradictory range of conclusions. It's hard to know what it really tells us, taken together, about whether gun laws can reduce gun violence.
A 2016 study, published in the academic journal Epidemiologic Reviews, seeks to resolve this problem. It systematically reviewed the evidence from around the world on gun laws and gun violence, looking to see if the best studies come to similar conclusions. It was the first such study to look at the international research in this way.
The authors are careful to note that their findings do not conclusively prove that gun restrictions reduce gun deaths. However, they did find a compelling trend whereby new restrictions on gun purchasing and ownership tended to be followed by a decline in gun deaths.
"Across countries, instead of seeing an increase in the homicide rate, we saw a reduction," Julian Santaella-Tenorio, a doctoral student in epidemiology at Columbia University and the study's lead author, told me in an interview shortly after publication.
What the study found

Santaella-Tenorio's study (co-authored with Columbia professors Magdalena Cerdá and Sandro Galea, as well as the University of North Carolina's Andrés Villaveces) examined roughly 130 studies that had been conducted in 10 different countries. Each of those 130 studies had looked at some specific change in gun laws and its effect on homicide and/or suicide rates. Most of them looked at law changes in the developed world, such as the US, Australia, and Austria, while a few looked at gun laws in developing countries, specifically Brazil and South Africa.
This isn't, then, a study that compiled its own original data on one specific gun law. It's actually more valuable than that: It's telling us what all the different studies on individual laws say when you examine them put together.
So what do Santaella-Tenorio et al. conclude? First, and most importantly, that gun violence declined after countries pass a raft of gun laws at the same time: "The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths," the study finds.
This finding doesn't highlight one specific law, like an assault weapon ban, in isolation. There were "so many different kinds of laws," Santaella-Tenorio told me, that it was hard to make good international comparisons on every specific kind of gun restriction.
Rather, countries passed big packages of gun laws, which overhauled the nation's firearm code fairly broadly, which all tended to share similar features. According to Santaella-Tenorio, they generally included:
Banning powerful weapons, like automatic rifles.
Implementing a background check system.
Requiring people to get permits and licenses before buying a gun.
South Africa's comprehensive Firearm Control Act, passed in 2000, contained all these measures. One study found that firearm homicides in five major South African cities decreased by 13.6 percent per year for the next five years.
"Reductions in nonfirearm homicides were also observed," Santaella-Tenorio et al. note, "although not as pronounced as the ones observed for firearm homicides."
Austria's 1997 firearm law, similarly, required background checks, limited access to powerful firearms, and imposed rules about how gun owners had to store their guns. Santaella-Tenorio reviewed two studies on Austria's 1997 law, both of which found evidence that the law had reduced deaths. According to one of them, firearm homicides went down by 4.8 percent, while suicides went down by 9.9 percent.
Australia's 1996 National Firearms Agreement (which outright confiscated 650,000 guns, in addition to imposing background checks and licensing rules) is perhaps the best-studied of any of the international laws. Santaella-Tenorio et al. reviewed eight studies on it, most of which found clear and strong evidence of a reduction in firearm deaths after the law's passage.
One study, for example, compared the Australian state of Victoria to others around the country. Victoria had passed a raft of firearm restrictions in 1988, so the NFA didn't change policy there that much. But firearm deaths went down countrywide by an average of 14 percent in other states relative to Victoria, suggesting that the NFA provisions specifically had made the difference.
Santaella-Tenorio and his co-authors also found evidence that specific laws, such as background checks and rules on storage, reduced specific kinds of gun deaths.
"Laws restricting the purchase of (e.g., background checks) and access to (e.g., safer storage) firearms," they write, "are also associated with lower rates of intimate partner homicides and firearm unintentional deaths in children, respectively."

Santaella-Tenorio and his colleagues looked at a number of studies on gun control in the United States as part of their overall review. There was strong evidence that that restricting access to guns tends to reduce gun deaths.
One study, for example, looked at Missouri's 2007 repeal of its law requiring a permit to purchase a firearm, which in effect repealed the state's background check requirement. This study found that after 2007, Missouri's homicide rate jumped by 25 percent. No other changes in law or circumstance appear to be able to explain the increase.
By contrast, laws favored by the National Rifle Association (such as concealed carry or stand your ground), when implemented, either had no effect on gun deaths or increased gun violence. And Santaella-Tenorio found this by considering not just studies that reached this conclusion, but also studies that supported loosening gun laws.
Most of the studies that supported these laws were written by a handful of authors, like Florida State's Gary Kleck and Fox News columnist John Lott. Scholars who reexamined their conclusions, sometimes even using their own data, generally came to the opposite results.
For instance, a study by Lott and the University of Georgia's David Mustard found that laws permitting concealed carry reduced homicides in states and counties that passed them. However, a subsequent study that reexamined the same data found no effect, and that Lott and Mustard had used flawed statistical procedures in examining the data.
Another Lott study found that castle doctrine laws — laws that eliminate the legal duty to retreat before using deadly force, but only in your home — reduced homicides by 9 percent. But a second study came to the opposite conclusion, finding an uptick in homicides after states passed such laws.
A third study looking at stand-your-ground laws — which go beyond castle doctrine in eliminating retreat duties outside the home as well — also found an uptick in deaths. Santaella-Tenorio and his coauthors summarize: "Stand your ground laws were associated with a 6.8% increase in homicide rates, mainly driven by increments (14.7%) in homicide rates among white males."
The point, then, is that the pro-gun studies tended to be outliers in the literature, and were not supported by the most rigorous available analysis.
"Our goal was just to see what was out there, and identify the quality of the studies," Santaella-Tenorio told me. "We eventually found that many others had used Lott's data, and they have found different results after adjusting for other variables, or using more years of data, or using different models."
This isn't conclusive, but it's powerful evidence

In our conversation, Santaella-Tenorio was insistent that he and his colleagues have not "proven" that gun laws reduce violence. The data, he says, is simply too complicated, and the analyses too primitive, to come to such a hard conclusion.
"It's really hard. In epidemiological studies — for example, pharmaceutical ones — you can randomly select your groups, and then have one group exposed to the pill and the other group not exposed," he says. "However, in policy studies ... you can't have some states be exposed to legislation and other states not."
This helps explain some unusual results. For instance, some data from Quebec found that a Canadian law reducing access to firearms led to an increase in suicides by hanging — a large enough increase to offset the decline in suicides by firearm that followed the law. Other studies, from Australia and New Zealand, found a similar substitution effect.
However, there is very good evidence — some of it from the same countries — that reducing access to guns reduces overall suicides. Indeed, Santaella-Tenorio himself believes that despite those three studies, limiting access to guns is very likely to reduce suicide rates overall.
"There's some other evidence that we didn't include in this review," he says, that finds attempting suicide is an impulsive decision that people regret (if they fail) and thus don't repeat. Firearms, because they're much more effective than taking pills or slashing your wrists, don't give people that option. Thus, reducing access to guns should (and empirically generally does) reduce the overall suicide rate.
This illustrates, then, that the findings in this study don't end the academic debate over guns. It's limited by study design — it only reviewed studies on firearm policy changes, not firearm ownership in general — and the inherent limitations in studying the effect of complicated public policy issues.
Nonetheless, this is a very important contribution to the gun debate. About 130 studies, from 10 different countries, converged on the idea gun deaths declined after laws restricting access to firearms went into force.
While it's not conclusive, it is very, very suggestive.

Abstract and Figures
In response to rising rates of firearms violence that peaked in the mid-1990s, a wide range of policy interventions have been developed in an attempt to reduce violent crimes committed with firearms. Although some of these approaches appear to be effective at reducing gun violence, methodological variations make comparing effects across program evaluations difficult. Accordingly, in this article, the authors use meta-analytic techniques to determine what works in reducing gun violence. The results indicate that comprehensive community-based law enforcement initiatives have performed the best at reducing gun violence.

Gun Control: Here's the Data About How Gun Control Can Reduce Deaths
Home Science
Gun control really works — here's the science to prove it
Kevin Loria
Updated
Aug 27, 2018, 6:55 AM
AP
There are more than 38,000 gun deaths in the US every year, and approximately 85,000 non-fatal injuries.
Despite some restrictions on gun research, scientists have sought to evaluate how certain policies affect gun deaths.
Policies that seem to reduce rates of gun violence include stricter background checks, limiting access to dangerous weapons, and prohibiting domestic abusers from owning weapons.
On Sunday, a gunman opened fire at a Madden NFL video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida. The shooter killed at least two victims and himself, and shot at least nine others.
As the country tries to figure out what — if anything — can be done in the wake of yet another mass shooting, it's worth taking a look at the evidence we have on the effects of gun regulations.
There are close to as many guns in the US as there are people. There may be more, or there may be fewer, depending on which study you look at — there's no exact count, since there isn't a national database of gun purchases or firearm owners, and federal law does not require a prospective gun owner to get a license or permit.
That's one of the many obstacles researchers come up against when trying to evaluate why so many people die from guns in the US.
But what they do know is that the number of gun deaths in the US is incredibly high. Most of these deaths are not from mass shootings, but from firearm suicides and murders. According to the American Public Health Association, guns kill more than 38,000 people per year and cause approximately 85,000 non-fatal injuries.
There's still a lot we don't know about this recent recent shooting, including whether the shooter purchased his weapon legally or if any common policy recommendations would have stopped him from obtaining a weapon.
Yet we do have evidence on effective policies that could have helped prevent some incidents. Despite some congressional limitations on gun research, scientists have sought to evaluate the effects of gun-control legislation in the US and in other places around the world.
Here's what the data shows.
Making it easier to carry concealed guns increases the number of gun homicides.

In states that have so-called right-to-carry laws, anyone who is allowed to own guns and meets the necessary conditions can also get a concealed-carry permit.
Many people have argued that right-to-carry laws deter crime because there could be more armed people around to stop a shooter. Though that idea was supported by a controversial 1997 analysis, recent and more thorough analyses have found the opposite effect.
One recent study found that such laws increased the rate of firearm homicides by 9% when homicide rates were compared state by state. That could be because confrontations were more likely to escalate to involve guns or because there were more guns around that could be stolen. Other factors could also be at play.
A spike in gun purchases after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School led to an increase in accidental gun deaths, especially among kids.

Research has found that when people are around more guns, they're more likely to end up dying from accidental shootings.
After a 20-year-old man killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012, there were calls for legislation that would limit some people's access to firearms. That push resulted in what's now become a predictable phenomenon after shootings: people bought lots of guns.
With more guns around in the months after the school shooting, the rate of accidental deaths related to firearms rose sharply, especially among children, according to a recent study published in the journal Science.
The researchers' calculations showed that 40 adults and 20 children died as a result of those additional gun purchases.
Barring people convicted of domestic abuse from owning guns has a huge effect on the number of gun deaths.

The so-called Lautenberg amendment to the 1968 Gun Control Act disqualifies people with a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence from buying or owning weapons.
Researchers found that gun murders of female intimate partners decreased by 17% as a result of the amendment.
Laws that call for longer sentences for gun crimes also seem to help a little.

Gun-robbery rates have gone down in states that have approved longer sentences for assault or robbery with a gun.
In the 1970s and 1980s, there were 30 "add-on" sentencing laws calling for additional prison time for people convicted of robbery or assault with a gun.
A 40-year-analysis found that gun-robbery rates dropped by about 5% in the years after the sentencing laws were enacted.
States that have stricter gun-control laws and spend more money on education and mental-health care have fewer school shootings.

One recent study found that states with fewer school shootings tended to have stricter background checks for weapon and ammunition purchases, and also spent more money on education and mental-health care.
Though school shootings are not the most common form of gun violence, a recent spike in these types of events in the US has prompted concern. There was an average of one school shooting per year from 1966 to 2008, but an average of one per week from 2013 to 2015, the study found.
The researchers said that based on available data, it was difficult to say which factor was most important in reducing shootings in schools.
However, mental-health treatment is unlikely to be solely responsible, as people with mental illness are more likely to be a victim of violence than a perpetrator. Though about 20% of Americans have some form of mental illness, people with a serious mental-health problem account for only about 3% of violent crime.
After Congress let a 1994 ban on assault weapons expire in 2004, gun massacre deaths skyrocketed.

Arguments about the exact meaning of "assault weapon" obfuscate an important point: When people in the US were allowed to start buying military-style firearms with high-capacity magazines, the number of people killed in gun massacres (defined as shootings in which at least six people die) shot up.
The number of gun massacres and massacre deaths decreased by 37% and 43%  respectively after the 1994 ban on assault weapons went into effect, one researcher found. After it expired in 2004, they shot up by 183% and 239%.
There's debate over the effectiveness of this legislation in reducing overall gun crime or firearm deaths, since most gun deaths in the US are suicides and most murders involve a handgun.
But most of the deadliest mass shootings in recent US history have one thing in common: They involved a military-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.
According to one study, replacing medium- and large-caliber weapons with small-caliber guns would dramatically reduce gun homicide rates.

For a study published in July, researchers examined data about 511 gunshot victims from files kept by the Boston Police Department.
They found that weapon caliber — which refers to the diameter of the firearm barrel and is an indication of the diameter of the bullet — played a big role in how fatal shootings were.
Caliber didn't affect where on the body people got shot. But people who were shot with larger bullets were more likely to die. People shot with medium-caliber weapons (defined as .38, .380, and 9 mm) were more than twice as likely to die as those shot with small-caliber guns (defined as .22, .25, and .32 mm).
People shot with large caliber weapons (.357 magnum, .40, .44 magnum, .45, 10 mm, and 7.62 × 39 mm) were more than four and a half times as likely to die as those shot with small-caliber firearms.
All in all, the researchers found that replacing large- and medium-caliber guns with small ones would have reduced homicide rates by 39.5%.
Reducing access to guns could reduce the number of suicides in the US.

Some gun-rights advocates argue that if you limit access to guns, people will just find other ways to kill themselves or others.
But data indicates that this "substitution hypothesis" is not correct.
More than 60% of gun deaths in the US are suicides, and research has found that people are most likely to try to kill themselves shortly after they decide to do so. People who attempt to do that with a gun as opposed to another method are much more likely to kill themselves.
Data from other countries supports restricting gun access, too. When the Israel Defense Forces stopped letting troops bring weapons home on the weekends, suicide rates dropped by 40%, one study found.
Historically, suicides also dropped after the UK switched from coal-gas ovens — which used a gas that people inhaled to kill themselves — to a different type of fuel. The country saw an increase in the use of other methods to attempt suicide, but it did not offset the drop in suicides by coal gas.
Weapons buy-back programs have been successful in reducing mass shootings.
David Gray/Reuters
After at 1996 mass shooting left 35 people dead in Australia, the country said "enough."
Leaders swiftly enacted gun-control legislation and set up a program for citizens to sell their weapons back to the government so they could be destroyed.
The initiative seems to have been successful: firearm suicides dropped by 65% and homicides by 59% over the next 10 years.
While Australia had seen 13 mass shootings — defined as five or more deaths — in the 18 years before the 1996 massacre, there has only been one in the 22 years since.
It's possible that some of those declines were due to other trends. But either way, getting many guns off the streets and out of shops was connected to big drops in gun deaths in Australia.
The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma has called for regulations that they say will make the population safer.

In a statement published in the journal Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open on August 7, the  Board of Managers for the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma issued 14 recommendations "in an attempt to stem the tide of deaths from firearm violence and support safe firearm ownership."
Their recommendations include removing firearms from domestic violence perpetrators (and those threatening violence while their cases are underway); regulating the sale of high volume ammunition, semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, and trigger actuators; and requiring reporting of all firearm sales.
The US has a higher rate of gun violence than any other similarly wealthy country. Why not try to change that?

The US has far more mass shootings than just about any country in the world. Of countries with at least 10 million people, there are more mass shootings per capita in only Yemen, which has the second-highest per-capita rate of gun ownership (the US has the highest).
Even other countries with lots of guns, like Switzerland, have far fewer firearm deaths.
In Switzerland, however, most people gain access to weapons because of military service that provides training; other prospective purchasers have to go through a multiweek background check. Authorities there also prohibit some citizens whom psychologists deem a potential risk from owning weapons.
The US is not inherently a more violent society. What sets the country apart is that it has a lot of guns that are still really easy to get. The data that we have indicates that some gun-control measures — like banning some types of weapons, improving background checks, and putting more restrictions on weapon access — could help.
At the very least, gathering and analyzing data could help leaders determine what sort of changes might help prevent another Parkland, Las Vegas, or Sandy Hook.
Or we could do nothing and wait for the same thing to happen again.

2.	Describe the role of law and policy in addressing gun violence at the federal, state, and local levels.
3.	Compare the effectiveness of gun violence policies and highlight the importance of changing the way we talk about gun                      
        violence.
4.	Describe state standards for civilian gun carrying and use and how those standards affect crime and violence.
5.	Describe how firearm design is regulated, the effective and just enforcement of firearm laws, and strategies for reducing 
        police-involved shootings.
6.	Identify and explain evidence-based programs to reduce gun violence and understand public opinion on gun policy.

Alright, so from these articles, it's clear that the United States has a significantly higher rate of gun violence compared to other high-income countries. The data shows that Americans are more likely to die from gun-related homicides and suicides. For example, one study found that the U.S. has a firearm homicide rate that is 25 times higher than other high-income countries. Additionally, even though the U.S. has a similar overall suicide rate, its gun-related suicide rate is eight times higher.

I think this disparity in gun violence rates is a key reason why many people in the U.S. support gun control measures. If having more guns leads to more gun deaths, then logically, reducing access to guns could lead to fewer deaths. This is backed by some of the research mentioned, which suggests that limiting firearm availability can save lives.

But, it's important to note that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation. Just because the U.S. has more guns and more gun violence doesn't automatically mean that the guns cause the violence. There could be other factors at play here. For instance, maybe there are cultural or social differences between the U.S. and other countries that contribute to higher levels of violence, and the ease of accessing guns simply makes that violence more lethal.

Moreover, some people argue that guns are necessary for self-defense. They believe that restricting gun ownership would leave law-abiding citizens vulnerable to criminals who would still find ways to obtain guns illegally. So, even if there are more guns in circulation, the idea is that "good guys" with guns can prevent crimes or stop them in progress.

I need to consider both sides of the argument. Maybe I should look into studies that examine the effectiveness of gun control measures in reducing violence.
