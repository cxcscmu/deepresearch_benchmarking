Alright, so I've got this question: "Are nurses spending too much time documenting using EHR?" Hmm, EHR stands for Electronic Health Record, right? It's that digital system where medical information is stored. So, nurses are using these EHR systems to document patient information, and the question is whether they're spending too much time on this task.

First off, I need to understand what EHRs are and how they're used in a nursing context. I know that EHRs are designed to improve patient care by making health information more accessible and easier to manage. But, like any tool, they can have drawbacks, especially if they're not user-friendly or if they require a lot of time to input data.

I should probably look into some studies or articles that discuss the time nurses spend on documentation using EHRs. Maybe there are statistics or reports that show how much time is typically spent on this activity compared to direct patient care.

Let me consider the potential reasons why nurses might be spending a lot of time on EHR documentation. One possibility is that the systems are not intuitive, and nurses have to navigate through multiple screens or enter data in a cumbersome way. Another reason could be that there's an increased demand for detailed documentation due to regulatory requirements or billing purposes.

Also, I should think about the impact of this documentation time on patient care. If nurses are spending too much time entering data into computers, they might have less time to interact directly with patients, which could affect the quality of care.

Maybe I can look for case studies or research papers that have investigated this issue in different healthcare settings, like hospitals or clinics. It would be helpful to see if this is a普遍 problem or if it varies depending on the specific environment or the EHR system being used.

Another angle to consider is whether there are any solutions or improvements being developed to make EHR documentation more efficient for nurses. For example, perhaps there are new technologies or training programs that aim to reduce the time spent on documentation without compromising the quality of the records.

I should also think about the perspective of nurses themselves. Maybe there are surveys or interviews where nurses have expressed their experiences and frustrations with EHR documentation. Their firsthand accounts could provide valuable insights into whether they feel overwhelmed by the documentation workload.

Additionally, it might be useful to compare the time spent on documentation before the advent of EHRs, when records were kept manually, to see if there has been an increase or decrease in documentation time with the switch to electronic systems.

Wait a minute, maybe in some cases, EHRs have actually made documentation more efficient by automating certain tasks or providing templates. So, it's possible that the time spent could be less than before, but perhaps there are still issues with the current systems.

I need to approach this objectively and look at both sides of the argument. On one hand, EHRs might save time through automation and standardization, but on the other hand, they might introduce new complexities that increase the time required for documentation.

Perhaps I can look for data on nurse productivity or job satisfaction in relation to EHR use. If nurses are spending too much time on documentation, it could lead to burnout or decreased job satisfaction, which are significant issues in the healthcare industry.

Also, I should consider the potential impact on patient safety. Accurate and timely documentation is crucial for ensuring that all healthcare providers have access to the latest information about a patient's condition and treatment. If nurses are rushed or overloaded with documentation tasks, it could potentially lead to errors or omissions in the records.

Maybe there are best practices or guidelines for optimizing EHR documentation processes to minimize the time burden on nurses while maintaining the integrity of the records.

I think I need to do some research to gather more concrete information on this topic. Let me start by searching for studies or articles that quantify the time nurses spend on EHR documentation.

Abstract
Background: Effective management of hospital staff time is crucial to quality patient care. Recent years have seen widespread implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems but the effect of this on documentation time is unknown. This review compares time spent on documentation tasks by hospital staff (physicians, nurses and interns) before and after EHR implementation.
Methods: A systematic search identified 8153 potentially relevant citations. Studies examining proportion of total workload spent on documentation with ≥40 h of staff observation time were included. Meta-analysis was performed for physicians, nurses and interns comparing pre- and post-EHR results. Studies were weighted by person-hours observation time.
Results: Twenty-eight studies met selection criteria. Seventeen were pre-EHR, nine post-EHR and two examined both periods. With implementation of EHR, physicians' documentation time increased from 16% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11-22%) to 28% (95% CI 19-37%), nurses from 9% (95% CI 6-12%) to 23% (95% CI 15-32%) and interns from 20% (95% CI 7-32%) to 26% (95% CI 10-42%).
Conclusions: There is a lack of long-term follow-up on the effects of EHR implementation. Initial adjustment to EHR appears to increase documentation time but there is some evidence that as staff become more familiar with the system, it may ultimately improve work flow.

Abstract
A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the impact of electronic health records (EHRs) on documentation time of physicians and nurses and to identify factors that may explain efficiency differences across studies. In total, 23 papers met our inclusion criteria; five were randomized controlled trials, six were posttest control studies, and 12 were one-group pretest-posttest designs. Most studies (58%) collected data using a time and motion methodology in comparison to work sampling (33%) and self-report/survey methods (8%). A weighted average approach was used to combine results from the studies. The use of bedside terminals and central station desktops saved nurses, respectively, 24.5% and 23.5% of their overall time spent documenting during a shift. Using bedside or point-of-care systems increased documentation time of physicians by 17.5%. In comparison, the use of central station desktops for computerized provider order entry (CPOE) was found to be inefficient, increasing the work time from 98.1% to 328.6% of physician's time per working shift (weighted average of CPOE-oriented studies, 238.4%). Studies that conducted their evaluation process relatively soon after implementation of the EHR tended to demonstrate a reduction in documentation time in comparison to the increases observed with those that had a longer time period between implementation and the evaluation process. This review highlighted that a goal of decreased documentation time in an EHR project is not likely to be realized. It also identified how the selection of bedside or central station desktop EHRs may influence documentation time for the two main user groups, physicians and nurses.
The electronic health record (EHR) is increasingly being deployed within health care organizations to improve the safety and quality of care. 1 However, to achieve these goals, the EHR must be used by clinicians, and this remains a major challenge. Various factors appear to be associated with EHR use. Maximization of the technical characteristics supporting the system such as speed and value-added functionalities such as order entry systems or automated reports 2,3,4,5 have been documented with higher rates of EHR use. User-related characteristics 3,4,6,7 as well as training 5 are also believed to be important. The integration of the EHR into clinical workflow must be taken into consideration in the early phases of planning in order to optimize the integration of the system into routine clinical use. Indeed, the need for a good fit between the EHR and routine clinical practice is recognized as essential, 3,8,9,10,11,12 and time efficiency is one of several factors that is used to assess the quality of this integration.
Clinicians spend the majority of their time providing direct care to patients 13,14,15,16,17 and hope that an EHR could increase this patient-interaction time and consequently the quality of care delivered. 18 On the other hand, provision of care requires the documentation of clinical information as an intrinsic aspect of routine clinical activity and is essential from both professional and legal standpoints. Thus, clinicians will consider a system to be efficient if the system reduces their documentation time, 19 even if the time savings do not translate into better patient care. 20 For this reason, in evaluating the impact of EHR on clinician activities, some studies use documentation time as a primary outcome and direct patient care time as a secondary outcome. The importance of evaluating time efficiency in documentation is also related to the observation that increased time for documentation is one of the most commonly stated barriers to successful implementation of an EHR. 3,10,11,18,21,22,23
Electronic health record implementation requires considerable investment with most projects averaging several million dollars (U.S.). 24,25 For the EHR to be successful, it is essential that managers are able to identify and manage elements of EHR implementation that are critical to enhance time efficiency of documentation by physicians and nurses. Clinical information systems and user populations vary in their characteristics, and for this reason, individual studies are unable to identify common trends that would predict EHR implementation success. This paper presents the results of a systematic review conducted to estimate the extent to which an EHR affects clinicians' documentation time and to identify factors that may explain efficiency differences observed across studies. In the context of this review, documentation comprises all notes, orders, and referrals that are part of the care plan of a patient and documented in a patient's medical chart.

Methods
Search Strategy
An extensive search of the literature from 1966 to January 2004 was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, and Current Health databases. Search strategies were specific to the database and included the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) associated with key words that reflected EHRs and workflow. The MEDLINE search strategy included the following terms: health informatics, electronic records, medical records systems, medical informatics, information systems, computerized patient records, workflow, time and motion, task performance and analysis, work redesign. When searching the CINAHL and HealthSTAR databases, the key words efficiency, organizational, hospital information systems, and workload were added to the search strategy used for the MEDLINE database. Only French or English full-text papers published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings were selected for further review. Editorials, letters, and conceptual papers were excluded. While systematic reviews often limit their selection of papers to randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) as the highest level of evidence, 26 RCTs are not always feasible 27 or the method of choice 28 for the evaluation of the time efficiency of EHRs. Therefore, all papers that addressed the research question were retrieved, regardless of their study design. Abstracts of all papers identified from the search strategy were read and assessed by one of the authors. Abstracts that were rated as relevant to the research question were kept and full-text papers were retrieved for further review. In the absence of an abstract, full-text papers were retrieved and reviewed. Reference lists of selected papers were examined to identify other relevant articles. Finally, publications of key authors, selected based on their expertise and quality of publications in the area of workflow and EHRs, were looked at using the Web of Science Citation Index.
The quality of selected papers was assessed independently by two reviewers using a standardized evaluation process. For papers to be selected for final review, the following criteria had to be met: (1) the study design included a comparison group, (2) documentation or charting time was one of the outcomes, (3) quantitative estimates of time differences were documented, (4) subjects were health professionals, and (5) the working environment was either a home, hospital, or community clinic. Papers that assessed the impact of time efficiency only through direct patient care time measurement were excluded even if the authors assumed that the time difference in patient care could be attributed to increased or decreased time efficiency in chart documentation, as there was no evidence to support this assumption. Documentation was defined broadly to capture all patient-specific notes written in the chart by nurses or physicians, including order entries. Therefore, regardless of whether the term charting, writing notes, ordering, or documentation was used, if the authors made it clear that these clinical activities were for patient care, the study was included in the review. Evaluation disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer.
Evaluation Process
Previous systematic reviews have used scoring systems to assess the validity of studies selected for review. 29,30,31 Existing scoring systems did not provide criteria that could be used in evaluating the scope of study designs and divergent methodologies used in the area of workflow assessment. Therefore, papers were rated qualitatively based on the two critical aspects that could influence the validity of the study: study design and methods used for data collection. Using the Campbell and Stanley 32 hierarchy for the internal validity of research designs, studies designed as RCTs were ranked first followed by posttest-only control group designs and one-group pretest-posttest designs in which the main source of internal bias would be related to the effects of temporal trends in care delivery. The method of measurement was ranked according to the precision of the data collection. Data collected by time and motion observer methodology ranked first, followed by video recordings as both provided direct and objective measurement of time. Work sampling techniques and self-reporting surveys were ranked third and fourth respectively, as they provide estimates of time efficiencies but the accuracy is influenced by the overall number of observations made, 33 interevent variability, and self-report biases. 34
Studies that used time and motion or video-recording techniques measured time as a continuous variable and differences were reported as means (standard deviations) and units were minutes or seconds. Work sampling techniques estimate time using counts of the occurrences of an activity within a specified time period and were thus reported as proportions. To facilitate comparisons across studies and accommodate for the different sampling units, such as patient-physician encounters versus total working shifts, a relative time difference was calculated. The relative time difference was determined for each study as the time (mean or proportion) to document with computer minus the time to document on paper divided by the time to document on paper, producing a negative value when the EHR was time efficient. We calculated 95% confidence intervals for differences in means and proportions to assess the significance of reported differences. When there was insufficient information to compute 95% confidence intervals, the authors were contacted and the data needed to construct the confidence interval were requested. To account for the variability in sample sizes across studies, weighted averages were calculated for both types of sampling units (patients and working shifts). Weighted averages were calculated using the following formula:

Results
A total of 628 abstracts were read and of these, 63 papers were retrieved and assessed against the selection criteria. Forty papers failed to meet minimum requirements for review, the most common reason being unavailable or limited information on methodology. For example, 14 papers were excluded because the method for data collection or study design was not identified. Eleven papers did not report sufficient information on time efficiency, nine did not have paper charting comparisons, three did not report on documentation time, two papers did not address the issue of workflow/time efficiency, and one paper was a simulation study. In total, 23 papers met the final criteria and were included in this review. Major technology improvements occurred over the years, making systems developed 20 years ago incomparable with those developed more recently. We chose to present the results of all studies but excluded those published before 1990 from our data analysis. ▶ summarizes the study designs and methodologies of the reviewed papers. Five were RCTs, six were posttest-control studies, and 12 were one-group pretest-posttest designs. A majority of studies (58%) collected data using a time and motion methodology in comparison to work sampling (33%) and self-report/survey methods (8%). Of all reviewed papers, subjects were either nurses or physicians, providing the opportunity to examine results and conduct separate analyses for each of the population groups being observed.

Impact on Time Efficiency
Nurses
Eleven studies examined the impact of EHRs on time efficiencies of nurses and the main characteristics of these studies are summarized in ▶. The study by Bosman et al. 35 appears twice in ▶ due to the report of time efficiencies using two different sampling units. Similarly, Pierpont and Thilgen 36 reported two sets of data but used the same sampling units. Among all studies, six 15,16,35,36,37,38,39 reported a reduction in documentation time when using a computer. Among those, the relative time differences ranged from −2.1% to −45.1% and each of these studies assessed the time efficiency of bedside terminals or computerized systems that were accessible through either bedside terminals or central station desktops. Two studies 13,35 found that bedside terminals increased documentation time (relative time difference of 7.7% and 32.9%, respectively). One study 35 reported different results depending on the specific content of the information being documented. Documenting the admission information was time efficient for nurses, while registration information required more time when entered on the computer rather than on paper. The largest time inefficiency reported is attributed to the use of a handheld device (personal digital assistant [PDA]) that required 128.4% more time than usual paper charting. 40 This study was the only one conducted in a home setting. The PDA was used to enter data on an activity of daily living (ADL) assessment tool and was used as an independent device with no data exchange at the time of data entry.

Two studies 13,16 were not taken into account in the calculations of weighted averages, one because of lack of reported sample size and the other because the study was conducted before 1990. Among the 11 studies (two studies reported two sets of data each), only three 35,40,41 assessed the impact of EHR on nurses' time efficiency using the patient as the sampling unit (▶ ). Regardless of whether documentation was performed on bedside terminals, central stations, or a PDA, the impact on time spent documenting per patient was unfavorable, with increases of time ranging from 7.7% to 128.4%. Conversely, studies 15,35,36,37,38,39,42 that reported the impact of EHR use on the total working shift are on average favorable. Weighted averages of the relative time differences are presented in ▶. When the weighting algorithm was applied to the individual studies, we determined that, on average, using bedside terminals saved nurses 24.5% of their overall time spent documenting during a shift, which compared advantageously with the use of central station desktops (23.5%). Despite similar weighted averages between bedside terminals and central station desktops, the five studies that assessed bedside terminals were consistent and showed a time reduction, while the two studies looking at central station desktops had opposite results.

Regardless of the system (bedside or central station desktops) being evaluated, most differences between paper and computer documentation systems were statistically significant (▶ ). Only two studies 15,37 had nonsignificant results. Three studies 16,36,42 lacked sufficient information to either compute the 95% confidence interval or identify, from available information in the paper, whether or not the results were significant.
Physicians
Ten studies examined the impact of EHR on time efficiencies of physicians (▶ ). The study from Makoul et al. 43 reported two sets of time estimates that we reported separately. Studies 22,44,45 specifically identified as computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems were analyzed separately from other studies that examined clinical information systems even if these had CPOE functionalities. Additionally, CPOE studies reported time efficiency estimates in relation to working shifts, contrary to the other physician studies that used patients or patient encounters as the sampling unit. Among studies that were not CPOE focused, four reported an increase in documentation time 43,46,47,48 with unweighted relative time differences ranging from 11.2% to 40.6%. In three studies, 49,50,51 the use of the EHR was time efficient with unweighted relative time reductions per patient or patient encounters of −12.6% to −45.5%. Weighted average relative time differences were estimated in relation to the system used. Our results (▶) show that using bedside or point-of-care computer systems increases documentation time of physicians by 17.5%. In comparison, the use of central station desktops to document clinical notes is slightly less time-consuming, with a weighted average of 8.2%. The use of central station desktops for CPOE was time inefficient in all three studies, consuming from 98.1% to 328.6% more time per working shift. The weighted average relative time difference across these CPOE-oriented studies was an increase in documentation time of 238.4% (▶ ).

¶ These papers were selected for the review papers but were not included in the analyse because they were older papers.
Contrary to the study with nurses, the single physician study comparing the use of a PDA to paper 51 showed favorable results, with a 22.2% reduction in time. Although over 90 patient encounters were assessed, this was a single-physician study and thus the results may not be generalizable.
Six of the ten studies 22,43,44,45,48,51 reported significant results. In the study conducted by Makoul et al., 43 the use of a point-of-care system had a significant unfavorable impact on initial visit time (time increase of 40.6%), but the time increase (13.1%) per encounter regardless of the type of visit did not reach statistical significance. Only one study 50,52 lacked sufficient information to either compute the 95% confidence interval or identify from the information presented in the paper whether the results were significant. In the remaining three studies, there were no significant differences between computer and paper documentation time.
Study Characteristics
Of the 23 studies, only two 40,41 used self-reported time and both reported an increase in documentation time with computer-based documentation. Among all reviewed papers, one third conducted their evaluation process within three months of the implementation of the computerized system. 15,36,38,41,46,51 Overall, these studies tend to demonstrate favorable results with a reduction in documentation time with computer-based documentation (weighted average, −34.0%/working shifts) but a slight increase at the patient level (weighted average, 5.7%). In comparison, studies 13,16,35,39,40,42,43,47,48,49,52 that were conducted more than three months after system's implementation had an impact on time efficiency that was clearly unfavorable in relation to patients (weighted average, 66.1%) but favorable at the working shifts level (weighted average, −10.0%). Although three of the earliest studies 13,52,53 conducted in the 1980s show an increase in documentation time following computer use, no trend toward increased or diminished efficiency could be identified among the more recent studies with nurses (▶) or physicians (▶ ).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to document in a quantified way the time differences between computer- and paper-based documentation among studies that assessed the documentation activities of nurses and physicians. Time efficiency is only one possible outcome for which the success of EHR integration can be assessed, and studies in this review also reported on direct patient care time, 13,15,16,37,42,47,48,50 user satisfaction, 15,22,42,46 accuracy of the information, 13,15,40 completeness of data entered, 15,38,41,43,49,50 and the overall impact on workflow. 16,22,44,45 However, time efficiency is recognized as an important facilitator or barrier of EHR implementation, 3,10,11,18,21,22,23 and consequently needs to be assessed with rigorous methodologies. Only 23 studies (36% of total retrieved) involved a quantitative examination of the integration of EHR into clinical workflow. One possible explanation of the paucity of research may be the limitations associated with the methods available to accurately document the impact of EHR on time. Continuous observation of work processes as captured by time and motion or video-recording methods are seen as the most accurate data collection techniques to monitor clinical activities 33 as they provide precise estimates of time spent in each activity. Fifty-eight percent of the reviewed studies used these methods despite the higher costs of one-to-one direct observations. Under the work-sampling technique, data are collected at predefined intervals of time, which allows the observation of multiple individuals by a single observer, which is seen as a major advantage over the time and motion technique. Activities are captured as “snapshots” of professional processes. Single counts of categorized activities do not provide any information on the real time spent performing the activity. 54 The overall proportion of time must be estimated using the number of snapshots in one category over the total number of snapshots that were recorded during the work-sampling time period. Recognized as a valid approach to evaluate work patterns, 54,55 a major disadvantage of the work-sampling technique lies in its need for very large sample sizes for the time estimates to have an acceptable level of precision, a criterion not often met. 33 This limitation of work sampling methods is not likely to influence the conclusions of our review since the errors in estimating time related to the chart documentation would occur in both the computer- and paper-based groups.
Only a few study results 44,48 reported in our review had large confidence intervals (▶ and ▶ ), and although sample size may influence the width of confidence intervals, only one had a fairly small sample size (pre/post, 14/39 patients). 48 Population characteristics also play an important role in the variability of the data, and, hence, on the width of confidence intervals. For example, the two studies 44,48 were conducted in environments (general internal medicine and community clinics) where care delivery is highly variable because of the population's heterogeneity. In comparison, studies conducted in highly specialized settings such as the one by Weinger et al. 48 are more likely to have uniform care delivery patterns, less variability across patients and physicians, and therefore narrower confidence intervals, despite a smaller sample size.
Results of this review suggest that nurses are more likely than physicians to gain time efficiencies by using a computer system to document patient information. Several reasons may explain the difference between nurses and physicians. First, nurses and physicians document different types of information. Nurses often document using standardized forms or care plans, 56 while physicians rarely use standardized templates to write their clinical notes.
Retrieval or viewing of information is part of the work processes of both nurses and physicians. However, it is much more intricately related to the documentation process of physicians. This may have played an important role in time efficiencies of CPOE systems that combine retrieval, viewing of information, data entry, and, in many cases, responses to alerts and reminders. These additional factors are difficult to capture by time and motion or work-sampling methods as both have limited capacity in capturing simultaneous activities, 57 and these may have accounted for the extra time that physicians take to document or enter orders on a computer. Several studies have shown that computers increase the completeness of information being documented. 15,38,41,43,49,50,58 This additional information available to physicians will influence the time required to retrieve information, 59 and their motivation to use EHRs if part of that information is perceived as unnecessary to their clinical activities. 60,61
While both nurses and physicians see the added value of integrating EHR into their daily practice, 17,59,62 physicians and nurses differ in their incentives to use the EHR 56 and in their speed of adoption. 63 These can be influenced by the fact that nurses tend to work in a single location and will therefore be more frequently exposed to the EHR in contrast to physicians who tend to work in several locations, both inside and outside the hospital. The degree of exposure to a newly implemented EHR may influence the learning curve and ability to become an efficient user more rapidly. As employees of a health care organization, nurses may be more likely to receive support from clinical leaders and paid training sessions, both of which have been identified as essential requirements for EHR adoption. 64 The autonomy and accountability of nurses and physicians are different and may influence their performance. 65 Those may explain why nurses tend to be more time efficient than physicians. Both groups also differ in their work processes. For example, nurses are part of a care team and need to verbally transmit information to their colleagues at the end of their working shifts. The use of computers has been shown to reduce the time devoted to the end-of-shift report, 13 and this change in workflow may have been a strong incentive for nurses to become efficient users of the system. Our results support this assumption, with all studies examining the impact of EHR over working shift periods, reporting favorable time efficiencies compared to those with patients or patient encounters as the sampling units. In our review, all studies on physicians, except for CPOE studies, used patients as their unit of analysis and most reported an unfavorable impact of the EHR. Time gains, at the patient level, may be difficult to achieve and examining the impact of EHR time on the overall clinic or hospital day may have yielded different results for physicians.
It was surprising to see that studies that observed clinicians relatively soon after implementation time (three months or less) showed a slight reduction in documentation time, while those that waited longer tended to show increases. It is possible that once clinicians become familiar with the system, they begin to take advantage of its other functionalities and thus may appear to be less efficient. Another reason may be that most projects have intensive support in the early implementation phase and that support may decrease over time. The optimal time period for assessment of time efficiencies post-implementation of EHRs remains a challenge and will require further research.
To understand the role that system use may play in time efficiencies, standardized audit trail information needs to be collected that would allow assessment of the extent to which individual components of a system are used. This review clearly highlighted the absence of any consistency or agreement on a standard time period after which a system should be tested. In fact, 25% of the studies in our review neglected to mention the time period in which the evaluation was performed despite the importance of this time period on adoption, use, and efficiency rates. 15,16,46
We attempted to characterize the different EHR systems reviewed in this paper in a systematic way and reported for each system the location (bedside or central station), data entry format (structured, free text, keyboard, touch screen), and the main functionalities (POE, complete clinical notes). Obviously, other characteristics such as the number of available fields in the EHR that one must navigate to enter data and the speed of the computer were not systematically reported and would likely play a major role in the clinician's time efficiency. For informed and valid comparisons of time efficiency within and across studies, timed standardized tasks would be helpful in establishing baseline expected efficiencies as some EHRs may not have the capacity to be time efficient in comparison to paper charting, regardless of the user or the environment. Knowing this information prior to EHR implementation will influence the deployment and training strategies. The focus on time efficiency should then be oriented toward the overall processes of care delivery rather than toward the potential time gains in performing specific activities, like documenting or ordering tests.
Limitations of the Study
Only 23 papers met our selection criteria despite the fact that we examined all papers published since 1966 and did not limit our search to RCTs. The concept of time efficiency is reported in the health informatics literature through quantitative or qualitative results or anecdotal evidence, but our focus was on quantitative results only. The inclusion of the numerous qualitative or anecdotal evidence studies may have provided valuable information to this area of knowledge but would have prevented summarizing the results in a quantitative way, which we thought was highly informative. A wide range of EHR systems were covered in this review (from POE to full clinical notes system). We grouped time differences on the basis of users, systems, and sampling unit as we could not assume that, for example, a 10% increase in time efficiency per patient would be the equivalent of a 10% increase for the total working shift. Different grouping approaches may yield different time averages, but the overall direction of results, time efficiency versus time inefficiency, should remain the same.
We recognize that papers included in this review cover a ten-year time period during which technology was rapidly evolving. Combining results of studies conducted in the 1990s with studies from the early 2000s may be debatable. However, our results did not identify a clear trend toward enhanced time efficiency despite the increased speed of computers, the availability of customized software, and the large array of user interfaces and input devices. The role of factors that are external to the information systems in contributing to the time efficiency of clinicians needs to be better understood. The methods used in the selection and review of these papers did not allow us to examine the impact of these factors. Further studies are required to examine the role of clinicians, professional practice, and organizational environment in facilitating or not the efficient use of EHRs.

Conclusion
Time efficiency is one of many benefits targeted by EHR implementers, but, conversely, time inefficiency is also recognized as a major barrier to successful EHR implementation. Our initial search of the literature in the area of workflow and time efficiency allowed us to identify that the benefits of the EHR are still widely assessed from a user's perspective, looking at single processes (e.g., documentation) rather than on its impact on the set of processes involved in care delivery. We learned that expectations of EHR implementation projects that documentation time will be decreased are unlikely to be fulfilled, especially with physicians. However, EHR and CPOE systems can generate time savings in other activities, such as accessing a patient chart 44 or maintaining patients' report forms. 22 Consequently, assessing the impact of EHR on an ensemble of work processes and outputs such as the effectiveness of communications across care providers as measured by patient outcomes (e.g., reduction in medication errors, lower readmission rates) could potentially generate favorable results that would then act as incentives to physicians. This suggests that a shift from the user's efficiency to the organization's or even the system's efficiency is needed. 66 Such a shift will require that the EHR be seen as a tool that can transform work processes and support innovation in care delivery. 67,68 Future research is required to examine whether the capacity of the EHR to improve the overall care delivery process of patients will likely outweigh the barrier associated with the additional time required to use the system. New methods to measure the impact of the EHR on time efficiency from an organization's or a system's perspective will have to be developed. Further research is needed to examine the impact of EHR on system efficiency and how this will influence adoption rates by all users, particularly physicians.

Abstract
Objective
Nursing time represents one of the highest costs for most health services. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the impact of health information technology on nurses’ time.
Materials and Methods
We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched 6 large databases for relevant articles published between Jan 2004 and December 2019. Two authors reviewed the titles, abstracts, and full texts. We included articles that included a comparison group in the design, measured the time taken to carry out documentation or medication administration, documented the quantitative estimates of time differences between the 2, had nurses as subjects, and was conducted in either a care home, hospital, or community clinic.
Results
We identified a total of 1647 articles, of which 33 met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-one studies reported the impact of 12 different health information technology (HIT) implementations on nurses’ documentation time. Weighted averages were calculated for studies that implemented barcode medication administration (BCMA) and 2 weighted averages for those that implemented EHRs, as these studies used different sampling units; both showed an increase in the time spent in documentation (+22% and +46%). However, the time spent carrying out medication administration following BCMA implementation fell by 33% (P < .05). HIT also caused a redistribution of nurses’ time which, in some cases, was spent in more “value-adding” activities, such as delivering direct patient care as well as inter-professional communication.
Discussion and Conclusions
Most of the HIT systems increased nursing documentation time, although time fell for medication administration following BCMA. Many HIT systems also resulted in nurses spending more time in direct care and “value-adding” activities.

INTRODUCTION
Nursing time represents the single highest cost for most health services. Healthcare services around the world are also experiencing a shortage of nursing staff, 1 with the National Health Service vacancies for registered nursing and midwife staff increasing by approximately 19% since October 2015 in the UK. 2 In the US, it is projected that the number of nurses in employment will increase by 15% over the next 15 years, with 7 states expected to have nursing shortages by 2030. 3 A report published by the Australian government predicted that the demand for nurses would exceed supply by approximately 85 000 in 2025 and 123 000 in 2030. 4 This highlights the need for healthcare organizations internationally to increase nursing efficiency to continue to deliver high quality patient care with limited resources.
Nurses use a wide range of health information technology (HIT), including electronic health records (EHRs), computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and barcode medication administration (BCMA) as part of their daily activities. 5,6 These systems have the potential to increase nurses’ productivity, for example, by reducing the amount of time that they spend carrying out documentation. 7 Productivity is defined as the output per unit of input; in nursing, this translates to how efficient the nurse is at carrying out their required activities and whether they meet the needs of their patients. 8 Recently, nursing productivity has been considered in terms of the amount of time nurses spend delivering “value-adding” care; this includes the time spent delivering direct patient care as well as inter-professional communication and other activities which have a direct benefit to the patient. 9 Techniques such as work sampling and time and motion studies have been used to measure how much time nurses spend performing various nursing activities. 10–14 The usability of HIT can have an impact on nurses’ workflow, and this can vary significantly between different systems. 15,16 Cho et al 17 compared the usability of 6 different electronic nursing records and found significant variation (of between 226.3 seconds to 457.2 seconds) in the time taken to complete certain tasks. It is therefore important to consider this when comparing across different HIT implementation studies. The number of empiric evaluations of the impact of HIT on nurses’ time has grown in recent years. For example, Bosman conducted an observational study using work sampling to evaluate the impact of an intensive care information system on the time that nurses spent on documentation. 18 They found that it reduced documentation thus allowing nurses to spend more time on patient care activities and, in particular, tasks which are often omitted, delayed, or unfinished—otherwise known as “Missed Care.” 18,19 Several studies have shown that missed care has an impact on both patient safety and satisfaction. 20–23
However, HIT may also bring about an increase in the time taken to perform certain tasks with changes in workflow. For example, Yeung et al 24 conducted a time and motion study to evaluate the impact of an electronic vital sign recording system on documentation workflow and found that nurses would often informally document results on paper before inputting the same information on the computer. The net result was that more time was spent on documentation due to duplication. 24 Similarly, HIT encouraged multitasking and interruptions to a nurse’s workflow. 25 Studies have shown that high volumes of alerts generated by clinical alarm systems were actually false alarms, with no clinical relevance, and resulted in users becoming desensitized to such systems. 26 Some nurses also found technology particularly stressful, especially when it malfunctions. 27 Burnout in physicians has been associated with spending large amounts of time documenting on EHRs and has been referred to as a potential reason for the increased number of physicians leaving the profession in the US. 28 One solution to this has been to improve the efficiency of documentation and work flows such that physicians have more time with patients. 28,29
OBJECTIVE
Poissant et al 7 conducted an important systematic review in 2005 that measured the impact of EHRs on the time efficiency of physicians and nurses and reported that EHRs did not reduce the amount of time that physicians spent on documentation but did for nurses. 7 This search was conducted over 14 years ago and focused specifically on EHRs with only 10 of the 20 included studies reporting on nursing activity. 7 Since this review was published, there have been considerable advances in technology, and more published studies have explored the many new technologies used by nurses (eg, BCMA). To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on the impact of health information technology on nurses’ time.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Information sources and search
We searched 6 databases: Embase, Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The key words were based on those used by Poissant et al 7 (see Figure 1 ).

The search was conducted in February 2018, updated in December 2019, and limited to papers published after 2004, as in the previous review. 7 We were particularly interested in the last 15 years, with $19.2 billion in funds committed to the incentivization of CPOE adoption in 2009 and the rapid advancement in technology that has taken place since then. 30
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included studies that examined the effects of HIT on nurses. Studies set in a care home, hospital, or community clinic were considered. Studies that had a comparison group, recorded the time taken to carry out documentation or medication administration, and documented quantitative estimates of the time differences were also included. We excluded papers that were not published in English or were opinion pieces.
Study selection
All studies were included regardless of the study design. Titles and abstracts were screened by 2 independent reviewers (EM and CT). In the case that the abstract was not available, the paper was put through to full text review. The full texts were then screened by the same 2 reviewers (EM and CT) against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were solved by discussion, and the reasons for exclusion documented. In accordance with the previous systematic review, terms such as “time charting” were interpreted as time documenting. 7 In the case that studies referred to “paper charting” and “electronic charting” separately, these were combined and interpreted as time documenting to allow for comparisons to be made across studies. We also collected data related to time in medication-related tasks, such as BCMA, where time administering medication was measured. Studies that did not specifically report on time documenting or time spent on medication-related tasks were reported separately. In the case that studies were carried out over more than 2 time points, the first and last time point were selected for inclusion in the analysis.
Evaluation process
Two methods were used to evaluate the studies in this review. We used the ROBIN-1 tool to assess bias in the included studies (Supplementary Material Tables 1 and 2 ). 31 The answers were combined to give an overall risk of bias assessment as either: low, moderate, serious, critical, or no information. The second method used a similar approach to that used by Poissant et al. 7 The study designs were ranked, with posttest control studies ranking most highly, followed by the multi-group pretest-posttest studies, and finally one-group pretest-posttest designs. 7 The data collection methodologies were also ranked, with time and motion observer methodology most highly, followed by work sampling techniques, and then self-reporting surveys. 7
Relative time differences were calculated for each study to facilitate comparison across the studies. This was calculated by taking the time to complete a task with a computer minus the time taken to complete the task on paper, divided by the time to complete task on paper. This was then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage, producing a negative value when the intervention was time efficient. In order to compare studies with different sized sampling units (observations, working shifts, number of patients), weighted averages were calculated. The articles were grouped according to the type of HIT investigated, the time measure used (documentation time or time in medication administration), or the type of sampling unit used. Weighted averages were calculated using the following formula:
Weighted average=∑ i+1 n[S W i*RTD i]∑ i+1 n S W(i)
Where sampling weight (SW) = (n group1 +n group2) and relative time difference = ((documentation time group2 – documentation time group1 )/documentation time group1) * 100. P values were used to assess the significance; if this was not available, then the author was contacted and the required information requested.
RESULTS
We identified 1647 articles in the initial search (see Figure 2 ). After removal of duplicates (n = 254) 1393 titles followed by 484 abstracts were screened against our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 113 full-text articles remained, which were then read and assessed. Thirty full texts met our inclusion criteria; we reviewed their reference lists for relevant articles, finding another 3 articles that met our inclusion criteria. In total, 33 articles were included in this review. Table 1 provides an overview of the included studies’ design and data collection methodology.

Study characteristics
Twenty-one papers reported the impact of 12 different HIT systems on the total time that nurses spent on documentation tasks (see Supplementary Material Table 1 ). 32,33,35–37,39,47–49,51–54,58–60,62–64 These included CPOE and electronic nursing documentation (n = 3), 35,53,54 EHRs (n = 7), 44,46,49,52,59,60,62 electronic medication administration records (eMARs) (n = 4), 32,37,39,55 electronic clinical information systems (n = 2), 58,64 a renewed nursing e-chart (n = 2), 47,48 an electronic intensive care information system (n = 1), 51 a patient data management system (n = 1), 63 and an electronic documentation system (n = 1). 36 Fourteen of these studies reported results in terms of the amount of time spent on medication administration or medication related activities, 2 of these studies reported time in medication administration, and 1 study on the time per prescription event (see Supplementary Material Table 2 ). 32,34,35,38,40–44,50,55–57,61 The remaining 6 studies each implemented a different intervention including barcoded vaccinations, 43 CPOE plus desktops in examination rooms, 42 an electronic medication management system, 34 a closed loop system (which incorporated electronic prescribing), ward-based automated dispensing, barcode patient identification and eMARs, 61 a system that incorporated an eMAR, CPOE and EMR, 35 and a CPOE system which is known as an Inpatient Medication Order Entry system (IPMOE) in Hong Kong. 45 Eighteen of the studies were conducted in the USA, Australia (n = 5), Taiwan (n = 2), Argentina (n = 2), and 1 study in Belgium, Germany, UK, Canada, Finland, and Hong Kong (see Supplementary Material Tables 1 and 2 for more information). The time from implementation to evaluation was reported in all but 6 studies (see Supplementary Material Tables 1 and 2 ). 35–37,43,45,47 We did not find a relationship between the time from implementation to evaluation and the impact on nurses’ time.
Quality appraisal
Risk of bias for each study is reported in Supplementary Material Tables 1 and 2. Overall, 11 studies accounted for some confounders, such as the nurse’s level of education, level of experience, patient characteristics, the number of patients under the care of a nurse, and the number of nurses on the unit. 34,36–38,40,45,49,56,57,62,64 However, no study controlled for all confounders. For example, many studies did not collect data during a night shift, and therefore none were classified as having a low or moderate risk of bias. Table 1 summarizes the results of the second method of evaluation. Time and motion was the most common data collection method, accounting for 64% of included studies compared to work sampling (n = 27%) and survey or self-reporting (n = 9%). Fourteen studies used one-group pretest-posttest, 12 used multiple group pretest-posttest, and 7 used posttest control.
We found a large range in the time between the implementation and when evaluation measurements were taken, from 2 to 24 months (see Supplementary Material Tables 1 and 2 ). Increased familiarity with a system may affect the time taken to complete certain tasks, which should also be considered when interpreting these data.
The following sections present the findings grouped according to studies that reported the time spent on (1) documentation, (2) medication administration, and (3) other tasks. Although there are a range of nursing task lists available in the literature, the activities included may differ according to division of work performed depending on the country or setting. 65 There is therefore a lack of consensus about which task list to use and therefore we opted to group our findings according to 3 key areas of interest, where HIT may have impacted on nursing time.
Time spent on documentation
Twenty-one studies investigated the impact of various HIT interventions on the time that nurses spent on documentation. Seven of these reported a decrease in time spent documenting, including 2 studies that implemented a nursing e-chart and analyzed the same dataset, 47,48 2 studies that implemented an EHR, 49,59 1 study that implemented a patient data management system, 63 another an eMAR, 32 and a study that evaluated 2 electronic clinical documentation systems: auto-filling (ie, insertion of complete blocks of text to be edited) and computer assisted (ie, data selection with semistructured documentation). 36
A further study that evaluated the impact of an electronic medication charting system at 2 different sites found a reduction in time at 1 and an increase in time at the other. 39 When the average relative time difference of the 2 sites was calculated, there was a −1% change in the time spent documenting. 39 Of note, the authors reported that CPOE had been implemented at 1 of these sites but did not specify which one. 39 A further study involving the implementation of a patient data management system, found an overall decrease of −34%, which was primarily due to reductions in both the time spent on documentation in daily activities and discharging a patient. 63 The relative time difference for studies that reported time saving ranged from −16% to −37%.
Eleven studies reported an increase in the time spent on documentation (see Supplementary Material Table 1 ). 33,35,44,46,51–54,60,62,64 One study conducted over 3 hospital sites investigated the implementation of eMAR, CPOE, electronic medical records, and electronic medication storage/cart storage and reported the largest increase in the time taken to complete medication documentation with a relative difference of +180% in the time taken to complete medication documentation. 35 The authors also found an increase in the time taken to retrieve and administer medication. 35 Hollingworth et al 33 investigated the impact of prescribing electronically on both desktop and laptop computers compared to prescribing on paper in a primary care setting. This intervention resulted in an increase in the total time that nurses spent on computer and writing tasks, although this was statistically insignificant. 33 Asaro and Boxerman and Banet et al both evaluated CPOE and electronic nursing documentation in an emergency department 53,54 and reported an increase of 7.9% (significant) and 3% (significance not reported) in the time spent documenting, respectively. 53,54 Banner and Olney implemented automated clinical documentation as part of an EHR and found a statistically significant increase of 52% in the percentage of time spent documenting postimplementation. 52 Munysia et al 60 implemented an EHR in a nursing home and reported a significant increase of 62% in the documenting time. Walker et al 46 conducted 2 studies: 1 on a surgical ward, which implemented a fully integrated EHR system; and 1 on a medical ward, which only implemented the medication support component of the EHR. A statistically significant increase in the time spent documenting during ward rounds was found in both wards, a 1.7% increase on surgical ward and a 72% increase in the median time spent documenting during medication rounds on the medical ward. 46 Schenk et al 44 also implemented an EHR and reported an increase in the time spent documenting of 3% (calculated by adding together the time spent documenting notes, documenting medicines, and transcribing/managing orders). Boeckx et al 51 were the only authors to implement an HIT system in a pediatric intensive care unit and found a statistically insignificant increase of 41% in the percentage of time that nurses spent documenting information. Saarinen and Aho implemented a clinical information system in an adult intensive care unit and reported a 49% increase in the time spent documenting nursing care. 64 Hakes and Whittington reported a 17% increase in the percentage of time spent documenting following implementation of an electronic medical record without CPOE in medical/surgical units. 62 Two studies did not report any change in the time spent documenting postimplementation of a new HIT system. 37,58
Time spent on documentation: Weighted averages
Weighted averages were calculated for studies that investigated the same HIT intervention and used the same sampling unit; these can be seen in Figure 3. CPOE and electronic nursing documentation resulted in an increase of +5.1% time spent on documentation. 53,54 EHRs were associated with an increase of +22% time spent on documentation, which was calculated from 3 studies (only the data from the surgical ward was used from Walker et al due to this being the most comprehensive). 46,49,52 These data are represented by “Electronic health record (1)” in Figure 3. A further 2 studies that focused on the implementation of EHRs—but used a different sampling unit—had a weighted average of +46%, represented by “Electronic health record (2)” in Figure 3.59,60 The 2 studies that implemented eMAR systems used different sampling units and measured the time in different activities, and so a weighted average could not be calculated. 32,55 Two studies examined the impact of a renewed nursing e-chart and analyzed the same dataset, so a weighted average was not calculated. 47,48

Time spent on medication administration related tasks
Seven studies reported on the use of barcode technology, 6 of which were BCMA, 38,40,41,50,56,57 and 1 referred to using barcoding to document vaccine administration (Supplementary Material Table 2 ). 43 Poon et al and Dwibedi et al each published 2 studies that reported on the use of a BCMA system based on the same data; 40,41,56,57 we included the most recent study in our analysis. 40,56 Three studies reported a decrease in the time spent in medication administration postimplementation of BCMA. 38,40,50 Huang and Lee found a statistically significant decrease, 50 and Poon et al 40 reported a reduction in medication administration time, although this was statistically insignificant. Tsai et al 38 reported the greatest time saving (−50%) resulting from the implementation of BCMA but did not report the significance of their findings. Dwibedi et al 56 reported a significant increase in the time spent on medication administration, although the authors categorized tasks differently than other studies. A study that reported on barcoded vaccinations found a significant decrease in the time spent recording information related to the vaccination postimplementation; this was the only barcode technology study to be conducted in a community setting. 43
Two studies reported results following the implementation of an eMAR, 32,55 and 2 further studies implemented a system which incorporated an eMAR alongside other HIT. 34,61 Qian et al 32 reported both time in documentation and the percentage of time spent on medication administration in a 3-hour medication round after the implementation of an eMAR and found no statistically significant change in the amount of time spent in either activity. They did, however, report a significant reduction in the time spent locating medication-related records. McComas et al 55 also implemented an eMAR and found this resulted in a statistically significant increase of +27% in the amount of time taken to complete the medication administration process. Franklin et al 61 implemented a closed-loop system incorporating electronic prescribing, ward-based automated dispensing, barcode patient identification and eMARs and reported how the amount of time spent on non-IV drug rounds decreased with a relative difference of −20%, However, a relative difference of +36% was found for the amount of time spent on medication activities between drug rounds, and both results were statistically significant. 61 Leung et al 45 implemented an IPMOE system and found a statistically insignificant increase (+14%) in the time spent on medication administration. The authors proposed that this increase was due to scanning medications, which was associated with increased patient safety. This study also reported a decrease in medication-related tasks (−25%), which may have offset the increased time spent in medication administration, overall resulting in time saved. 45 Westbrook et al 34 implemented an electronic medication management system, which included electronic prescribing and medication administration records. A statistically insignificant increase of +8.1% in time spent on medication-related tasks was reported. 34 Schenk et al 44 implemented an EHR and also found an increase of 3.2% in the time spent in medication administration tasks (calculated from the combined time spent preparing medication, administering medication, managing IVs, and explaining medication action to patients/family).
Time spent on medication administration related tasks: weighted averages
The weighted average for the time difference using BCMA calculated from 4 studies that used the same sampling units and HIT was −33% see Figure 2.38,40,50,56 The weighted averages for other interventions could not be calculated. 32,34,43,44,55,61
Studies reporting in terms of “other tasks”
We identified 2 studies that reported on “other tasks” and were therefore not included in the weighted average calculations. Westbrook et al 34 and Devine et al 42 both investigated the impact of a CPOE and electronic medication management system on efficiency. Westbrook et al 34 reported a statistically insignificant increase of +29% on time in direct care. Devine et al 42 conducted a study which examined the impact of CPOE and desktop computers on the time for prescribers to complete prescriptions and found a relative time difference of −8.4% in the time taken for nurses to complete a prescription event.
DISCUSSION
We performed a systematic review assessing the impact of HIT on nurses’ time. We found that most HIT systems increased nursing documentation time, although time did fall for medication administration following BCMA implementation. Our results also showed that HIT often caused a redistribution of nurses’ time, which in some cases was spent in more “value-adding” activities, such as direct care and communicating with other members of staff and patients’ relatives.
Previous work has shown that HIT can be used to enhance preventative healthcare delivery, decrease the frequency of adverse drug events, and contribute to a reduction in medication errors. 66–68 Despite these benefits, however, if HIT is not compatible with the existing workflow, it is unlikely to be successful. 69,70 One systematic review that investigated the barriers to and facilitators of the successful implementation of EHRs found that a lack of time and heavy workload reduced the probability of a successful implementation. 71 Many approaches are already available (eg, building interfaces which document data like vital signs without nurses having to input these) and could substantially reduce workload. Paying attention to human factors when nurses are entering data could also be helpful.
The implementation of BCMA has been shown to reduce medication administration errors. 6,72–74 Our review suggests that BCMA was associated with the greatest time savings (−33%), while EHRs, CPOE, electronic nursing documentation, and eMARs resulted in an increase in time spent on documentation. This contrasts with the previous review, which was limited to studies that only focused on EHRs and, overall, reported increased nursing efficiency. 7 Three of the 4 studies, which implemented BCMA reported a decrease in the time spent on medication administration/medication-related activities. 38,40,50 Poon et al 40 reported decreased time spent managing physician’s orders, the delivery of medicines to the patient, and inefficient tasks, such as travelling and looking for patients records. Poon et al 40 highlighted that some of the time savings reported were due to the context of BCMA implementation. For example, time spent travelling was decreased due to the implementation of bedside laptops, which had not been present pre-BCMA. This emphasizes the importance of workflow redesign. Time savings could also be made through HIT by removing the need to manually transcribe, verify, and renew orders. 38,50,75 Dwebedi et al 56 was the only BCMA study to report an increase in the time spent on medication administration. Although they found a decrease in the time taken to document medications, this was not offset by an increase in time spent on drug preparation, assisting physicians, universal precautions, and conversing with patients. 56 In particular, other factors, such as a difference in the types of patients (eg, more patients ≥ 65 years old) and medications encountered (eg, fewer solid oral dosage forms) between the pre- and postimplementation phases may have contributed to an increase in drug preparation time. 56 Studies should aim to control for such confounders in the future. 56 Wilbanks et al 36 evaluated 2 different electronic documentation systems, auto-filling and computer-assisted, compared to paper system. Both systems resulted in time savings, with the auto-filling system having the greatest impact. 36 However, auto-filling was associated with lower documentation accuracy demonstrating the need for a balance between the desire to save time while maintaining standards. 36
Over half of the included papers (n = 19) reported an increase in the time spent documenting or on medication administration-related activities, which was associated with a range of different HIT systems (eg, CPOE, automated clinical documentation, EHRs, etc). 32–35,39,44–46,51–57,60–62,64 Nurses continued documenting information on paper despite the availability of HIT, because this was quicker and the information was close “at hand.” 59 Duplication of information could increase the risk of transcription errors, with a previous study reporting how 56% (n = 310) of medication errors were due to transcription errors, 41% (n = 127) of which have potentially significant clinical consequences. 76 Cornell et al 39 reported no change in the amount of time that nurses spent making personal notes, an aspect that vendors could potentially identify new approaches for in the future. Another study suggested that the increase in documentation time was due to increased time spent finding relevant information on the electronic system. 60 However, it is possible that nurses became more familiar with the system over time and possibly used electronic approaches to share information with their colleagues. 60
The implementation of HIT often resulted in the redistribution of nurses’ time from activities, such as documentation/medication administration, to direct care activities or “value-adding” activities. 9 One study found that nurses spent an increased amount of time talking to relatives (indirect care), 39 and 3 described an increase in time spent in patients’ rooms and in personal interactions with patients (direct care). 44,49,59 Increased time providing direct care can also improve job satisfaction because nurses feel more valued and rewarded. 77 However, HIT can also be disruptive to nurses’ workflow and result in negative consequences, such as increased multitasking and interruptions. 25 For instance, false alarms can result in nurses becoming desensitized, leading to poor patient outcomes. 78 Malfunctions can also cause stress and lead to what is known as compassion fatigue, eventually contributing to burnout. 27,79 These positive and negative impacts are all important to consider at a time when there is a shortage of nurses and attempts are been made to increase recruitment and retention. 80
Poissant et al 7 previously found that studies that observed clinicians soon after implementation (defined as 3 months or less) showed a reduction in time spent documenting, and studies that waited longer tended to show increases. This review did not reveal a correlation between the time after implementation that the study took place and the impact of the HIT on nurses’ time, although some studies did support Poissant et al’s previous finding. 60 Munyisia et al, 60 for example, observed nurses at 4 different time points postimplementation (3, 6, 12, and 23 months after) and found that the percentage of time nurses spent documenting reduced at 3 months but increased to a higher percentage than before implementation at 23 months. Like Poissant et al, the authors reflected on how this might be due to nurses becoming more familiar with the system and, in turn, using more of its functions. 7,60 How well the system is designed can impact on the time that it takes nurses to conduct tasks. 17 None of the studies in this review carried out usability testing as part of their study, which makes it difficult to compare across studies including those that implemented the same type of HIT. Leung et al, 45 did acknowledge the potential impact of usability on their results, as they observed nurses having difficulty using the system due to problems with the interface between the software and hardware. Further studies that explore the impact of usability and optimized system design are needed. Such studies should also describe the contextual factors related to a particular implementation (eg, the organizational setting, users, tools used, etc) to help better understand the results.
The majority of our included studies employed a time and motion approach, which is considered to be the most precise and accurate method of assessing the time spent on activities in health services research. 81 However, these often had a one-group pretest-posttest study design, which are vulnerable to temporal changes such as an increase in the number of patients and severity of illnesses seen in the winter months. 82 Researchers should aim to use a control group to increase validity. Use of standardized methods for time and motion studies (eg, the suggested time and motion procedures [STAMP]) guidelines could improve the “consistency of design, conduct, and results reporting of time and motion research in health informatics” and would facilitate a more straightforward comparison between studies. 83 It is also important that studies categorize nursing tasks in a standardized way; this was not the case in this review which made interpreting the results more challenging. 56 Although the final number of studies included in this review was large (33 studies), these were split across numerous different HIT systems, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. The lack of studies that have explored the impact of the different HIT systems on nurses’ time might be due to the time-consuming nature of time and motion studies, since they are more labor intensive, requiring one-to-one observations. 81
It is also important to consider the statistical significance of results found in the studies before overall conclusions are made. Of the papers reporting time spent in documentation, less than a third (29%) showed a statistically significant change. 32,36,44,46,52,59,60,62 Four studies investigated BCMA/barcode scanning technology, 43,50,56,57 and only 2 of these reported a statistically significant decrease in time spent in medication administration. 43,50 Certain confounding factors (eg, a nurse’s experience and the number of patients a nurse was caring for) were controlled for in less than half of the included studies 34,36–38,40,45,49,56,57,61,62,64 and must be taken into account in future studies.
CONCLUSION
Nursing time is one of the single most expensive things in secondary care, and there are trade-offs between direct patient care and documentation specifically. We found that several interventions have been implemented with varying effects on nurses’ time. BCMA showed the most marked average relative time difference of −33% and was the only intervention to demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in time in more than 1 study. Other applications, including adoption of EHRs and CPOE, were associated with increased documentation time across multiple studies. A key need in informatics is more research on using HIT to improve efficiency, focused on finding new efficiencies, and using robust methods to enable comparisons between studies.

Abstract
Background
Objective
Electronic health records (EHRs) are linked with documentation burden resulting in clinician burnout. While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics.
Materials and Methods
Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Results
Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout.
Discussion
Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden.
Conclusion
Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use.

INTRODUCTION
Rapid adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) following the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has led to advances in both individual- and population-level health. 1 HITECH has improved healthcare quality, patient safety, and diagnostic accuracy through enhanced data management and timely reuse; interoperable systems have facilitated care continuity and monitoring of compliance metrics. 2–5 EHR-facilitated, guideline-based care has been associated with reduced redundancies 6,7 and streamlined billing administration. 8
Largely still in its infancy, the implementation of EHRs has also resulted in unintended consequences on clinical practice and healthcare systems, including significant increases in clinician documentation time. 9–13 Extended work hours, time constraints, clerical workload, and disruptions to the patient-provider encounter, have led to a rise in discontent with existing documentation methods in EHR systems. 6,14,15 This documentation burden has been linked to increases in medical errors, 3,9,16 threats to patient safety, 3,9,16 inferior documentation quality, 17,18 job attrition, and, ultimately, burnout among nurses and physicians. 3,9–11,14,16–22
In concert with Affordable Care Act (ACA) reimbursement models, Meaningful Use (MU) mandates, and a regulatory-rich environment, EHRs have drastically altered clinical documentation workflow and communication in routine healthcare. 13,15,23 Physicians have reported willingness to remain out of compliance with EHR incentive programs (eg, MU and the Physician Quality Reporting System 24) in favor of mitigating documentation burden (hereinafter referred interchangeably as “burden”). 15,25 Still, studies consistently demonstrate that physicians spend twice as much time on electronic documentation and clerical tasks as compared to time providing direct patient care. 14,26–30 Similarly, nurses devote more than half of their shift time to EHR data entry and retrieval 19,20 and report reduced direct patient contact. 31,32
While researchers have discussed the challenges of burden and its implications for clinician burnout due to EHRs over the past decade, 5,15,33 limited attention has been paid to discriminating the antecedent concept of burden (defined as a duty, responsibility, etc, that causes worry, difficulty, or hard work), 34 from burnout (defined as long-term work-related stress reaction marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a lack of sense of personal accomplishment). 35,36 Clinician burnout has been well-documented and widely quantified using surveys and psychological measurements throughout peer-reviewed literature. 37–40 Yet, to our best knowledge, there is a lack of consensus on approaches to measure burden. 15,37,41–45
While EHR dissatisfaction has been extensively studied and some clinician activity metrics have been proposed, 46 few empirically-based readily-available solutions to reduce burden exist. 11 Interventions to assuage burden have ranged from the utilization of scribes and remote transcription services 27 to text summarization and dictation software. 16,47 In March 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a report outlining 3 primary goals to reduce EHR-related clinician burdens that influence care: reduce the time and effort clinicians require to document health information, reduce the effort required to meet regulatory requirements, and improve EHR ease of use. 48 Evaluating the impact of interventions that target these goals will necessitate standardized, quantitative measurements.
OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this scoping review is to assess the state of science, identify gaps in knowledge, and synthesize characteristics of documentation burden measurement among physicians and nurses using EHRs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a scoping review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines. 49 A scoping review fit our objective to describe the breadth of methods used to measure documentation burden. 49
Search strategy and selection criteria
We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases for all English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, investigating documentation burden among physicians and/or nurses in ambulatory and/or inpatient settings from inception to April 20, 2020. We evaluated all relevant literature identified through in-text references among eligible studies. Burden is not specifically represented in Medical Subject Headings (MeSH); therefore, we explored both keyword and MeSH terms for 2 burden-related concepts outlined in the HHS report Strategy on Reducing Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs 48 documentation: (a) effort, and (b) time. We also focused our search on: (a) the EHR and (b) physicians or nurses. The finalized search strategy is summarized in Table 1.

Study selection and selection criteria
We selected inclusion and exclusion parameters a priori, and iteratively modified them to exclude studies involving niche clinical systems and those strictly comparing to paper-based documentation (Table 2 ). We included all peer-reviewed primary studies that focused on EHR utilization with an objective time or effort measure 48 (eg, EHR usage logs, which report time stamped documentation events) in the review.

The term “physicians” encompassed attending physicians, fellows, resident physicians, and interns; “nurses” referred to registered nurses. We focused on physicians and nurses given our aim of identifying interprofessional measurements of documentation burden. We excluded studies comparing EHR documentation to paper-based systems if they were not focused on measuring burden, but rather on EHR implementation evaluation.
After removing duplicates, 2 reviewers (AJM and JMS, AJM and RC, AJM and SS, or AJM and EL) independently screened article titles and abstracts for relevance using Covidence. 50 Two authors (with a third serving as a tiebreaker) reviewed each potentially relevant abstract for eligibility criteria in the full-text. We included full-text articles with concordant decisions by the 2 reviewers in the final analysis; for discordant decisions, all reviewers reexamined and adjudicated until a consensus was reached.
Data extraction and analysis
One author (AJM) performed data charting for all articles meeting full-text inclusion criteria (see online Supplementary Table ), which was reviewed by all authors and discussed. We extracted the following information: publication year, geographic location, time source, unit(s) of analysis, activity, sample size, sample characteristics, EHR system, provider role/specialty, clinical setting, study design and objectives, study type (eg, quantitative or mixed-methods), site type (eg, single or multisite), exposure and outcome measures, analytical and statistical methods, study limitations/bias, and major findings. We reported study limitations and biases such as threats to internal and external validity to appraise rigor. We used the HHS concepts to organize our reporting of measurement characteristics. 48 HHS does not elaborate further on definitions of: (a) time, (b) effort, and (c) outcomes assessed 48; therefore, we conducted purposeful thematic analysis to identify proxies and synthesize these 3 recurring concepts. 51 We iteratively combined themes until we achieved a consensus.
RESULTS
Sources of evidence
Our search strategy yielded 3482 potentially relevant manuscripts from MEDLINE (n = 507), Embase (n = 1143), Web of Science (n = 1007), and CINAHL (n = 825). Seven additional manuscripts were identified through in-text references. After eliminating duplicates, 1946 titles/abstracts were screened; of those, 166 were eligible for full-text review. Consensus was achieved for all disagreements concerning the inclusion of full-text articles. Thirty-five studies meeting criteria were summarized in the final analysis (Figure 1 ).

Study characteristics
Studies were conducted in the United States (n = 31), 13,14,22,27,28,43,52–76 Europe (n = 1), 29 and Asia (n = 3). 77–79 Studies included a mix of ambulatory (n = 22) 14,22,27–29,52–54,56,61–66,69,71–75 and hospital (ie, inpatient and emergency) settings (n = 11) 13,55,57,59,60,67,68,70,76,78,79 with 2 involving both. 58,77 A majority of those studies involved single sites (77.1%) and were affiliated with an academic institution/teaching hospital (80.0%). One third used Epic systems (n = 13), 13,22,27,43,53,54,56,57,64,66,69,72,73 followed by multiple/other/unspecified (n = 12), 14,28,29,52,63,67,68,75–79 Cerner (n = 6), 58–60,65,71,74 Allscripts (n = 2), 61,62 and Eclipsys (n = 2). 55,70
Articles were published between 2010 and 2020 with 2018 (n = 8) 13,14,29,56,57,63,67,76 and 2019 (n = 8) 22,54,58,69,72,74,6066 representing the highest volumes. Range of study sample sizes was expansive among the studies (4 ≤ n ≤ 154 719). Most studies exclusively focused on physicians (n = 25) 13–2942 as compared to nurses (n = 5) 58,67,76–78 or an interprofessional sample of providers (n = 5). 22,55,56,69,73 Clinician specialties were heterogeneous; over half the studies involved single specialties (general [n = 11], 14,27,52,53,61,62,64,71–73,75 emergency [n = 2], 57,79 intensivist [n = 2], 67,70 other [(n = 5] 13,54,56,74,78 ), while the remaining were multiple subspecialties (n = 13) 9,22,28,43,58–60,63,65,66,69,76,77 or unspecified (n = 2). 55,68 Across all studies, most involved general medicine (n = 17) 14,22,27,28,43,52,53,59–66,69,71–73,75–77 followed by surgical subspecialties (n = 8), 13,29,58,59,66,74,77,78 intensive care (n = 6), 58,59,67,70,76 and emergency medicine (n = 4) 57,58,60,79; 10 included other subspecialties. 22,28,29,54,56,58,60,63,65,66
Thirty were strictly quantitative studies. While purely qualitative studies were excluded, 5 studies employed mixed methods 28,52,55,61,62 (see online Supplementary Table ). Study designs varied, including time-and-motion (TM [n = 5] 28,61,62,67,68 ), validation of TM (n = 2), 27,70 cohort (n = 15), 13,27,43,54,55,57,59,60,63,64,66,72,74,75,77 experimental/quasi-experimental (n = 8), 14,22,29,53,56,58,78,79 and cross-sectional studies (n = 4). 69,71,73,76 Eight studies evaluated an intervention, 14,22,52,53,56,58,75,78 including scribes (n = 3), 14,52,53 documentation redesign (n = 3), 58,75,78 or EHR training programs (n = 2) 22,56; the remaining were descriptive studies on EHR activities and usage (n = 27)—2 of which involved the implementation of new EHR systems. 29,79
A diversity of analytical methods was employed. Most studies to which statistical testing were relevant (n = 23) applied parametric (n = 19) as opposed to non-parametric methods (n = 12). Qualitative methods employed in the mixed-methods studies involved informal interviews, 62 social network analysis, 55 thematic analysis, 62 focus groups, 52 and self-reported diary. 28 Few studies addressed validity or reliability of measurements in their studies (n = 11) 22,52,53,59,60,63,64,67,69,73,78; 2 examined interobserver reliability, 28,68 2 employed TM approaches to validate novel analytical methods to examine workflow 70 and the use of EHR usage logs to estimate workload, 27 2 examined correlations between self-reported and objective EHR usage log times, 22,73 and 1 employed video recording timers to validate EHR usage log times. 58
Characterization of effort
Seven overarching effort constructs emerged (Table 3 ): (a) general workload such as overall EHR usage (n = 4) 53,56,68,69; (b) clinical documentation/review (n = 15) 28,29,55,57–61,67,72,75–79; (c) excess workload including EHR usage after hours (n = 15) 13,22,27,52–54,59,63–66,69,71,73,74 and remote access (n = 1) 72; (d) administrative tasks, such as inbox management (n = 2) 69,73; (e) cognitively cumbersome work, such as multitasking (n = 3) 61,62,68; (f) fragmentation of EHR workflow (n = 1) 70; and (g) patient interaction/in-person visits (n = 7). 14,28,29,43,53,62,68 Several terms were employed referring to EHR usage afterhours including “work after work,” 66 “pajama time,” 66 and “Clinician Logged-In Outside Clinic” (CLOC) time. 22 For example, Cox et al proposed the “amount of EHR usage taking place after scheduled duty hours” specifically for surgical residents. 13

Measurement of time
Time spent documenting was assessed in all studies and was measured using 3 key data collection strategies: EHR usage logs (n = 28), 13,14,22,27,43,53–60,63–67,69,71–79 activity capture applications (n = 8), 27–29,52,61,62,68,80 and video recordings (n = 1). 58 Few studies triangulated these data through multiple data collection strategies (n = 2). 27,58 Time constructs identified (Table 3) include (a) average time spent (n = 20), 22,27,29,43,54,55,57,59–61,63–67,69,71–73,78 (b) proportion or percentage of time spent (n = 10), 13,28,53,56,62,68,70,72,74,75 (c) binary of timeliness of completion (n = 1), 77 and (d) activity rate (n = 2). 61,76 Units of analysis varied within and across studies (Table 3 ), including time reported per: (a) encounter (n = 5), 54,60,65,67,69 (b) provider (n = 2), 14,73 (c) patient (n = 3), 57,59,78 or (d) event/task (n = 28). 13,14,22,27–29,43,53–56,58,61–64,66,68,70–79 Units of analysis also included average hours per day, per week, or per month (n = 6) 22,29,43,63,71,72 and average minutes per day, per week, per shift, or per clinical full-time equivalent per week (n = 7). 27,55,61,64,66,73,78 We have organized these units of analysis into 2 levels for combination in individual measures: (a) a clinically oriented unit of analysis, such as “per encounter,” and (b) a temporally oriented unit of analysis, such as “per hour” (see Table 3 ). Operationalization of a shift and “active versus idle” time in the EHR also varied. Among the 15 studies that examined shifts, 13,22,27,54,56,57,59,64,65,68,69,71,73,74,76 9 distinct shift times were identified with 6:00 am–6:00 pm (n = 4), 13,65,71,74 7:00 am–7:00 pm (n = 3), 69,73,76 and 8:00 am–6:00 pm (n = 2) 22,27 representing the most frequently reported intervals. Meanwhile, only half the studies employing EHR usage logs explicitly operationalized active versus idle time in the EHR to account for the time a clinician is logged in but not actively using the system. However, determination of “active and idle” time were measured at different levels of granularity (ie, complete system time-out [n = 3] 13,43,73 vs “active versus idle” between tasks [n = 11] 22,27,56,59,60,64,65,69,71,72,74 ). “Active versus idle” activity time was largely vendor defined (n = 7), 22,59,60,65,69,71,74 relied on mouse clicks and keystrokes (n = 5), 59,60,65,71,74 and/or idle time between 30 seconds and 10 minutes of length (n = 5). 27,56,64,69,72
Outcome assessment
Less than half the studies assessed the impact of documentation burden on clinicians and/or patients (n = 16). Among those studies, authors referenced the temporal relationship between burden and burnout at a higher proportion (68.8%) compared to those that did not extend beyond measuring time and effort alone (50.0%). Outcomes measured included clinical process measures [n = 8 (ie, treatment time, encounter closure, length of stay) 14,54,57,69,79 ], clinician (n = 7) 14,22,52,53,75,78,79 and patient satisfaction (n = 4), 14,52,53,63 burnout/stress (n = 5), 22,64,69,73,75 patient census/mortality (n = 2), 59 response to messages (n = 1), 22 and team interactions (n = 1). 55 Primary predictors and outcomes of interest are summarized in the online Supplementary Table.
Limitations and biases reported
Two limitations were ubiquitous across included studies (Table 4 ): (a) threats to generalizability due to constraints in sample size (n = 19), 14,28,29,52–54,57,59–64,67,69,70,73,74,79 study setting (n = 21), 22,28,52–55,59–62,64,68–70,72–74,76–79 patient population, 57,77 EHR system (n = 6), 58,60,61,70,75,78,81 activity type, 76 clinician role or seniority, 57,59,61,69,70 early adoption, 43 and/or subspecialty; 62,64,70 and, (b) measurement error including the inability of logs to distinguish between “idle and active” time (n = 6), 27,43,55,64,73,80 uncertainty regarding the definition of “afterhours,” 59,73 incomplete measurement of tasks (n = 15), 13,27,29,43,56–58,65,68–71,76,78,80 imprecision of time capture, 27,43,55,73,80 information bias (n = 10), 27–29,56,61,68,70 and validity of measures. 53,54,64

Six studies cited selection bias derived from both the presence of self-selection and voluntary participation among high-performing subjects 27,28 and the presence of low response. 22,56,64,75 Eleven studies noted a lack of data triangulation, such as combining log data with direct observations, encounter information or qualitative data to offer contextual information corresponding to types of EHR interfaces used (eg, remote, inpatient, outpatient) for login timestamps, direct patient care, and other data. 13,14,52–56,60,63,66,76 Twelve studies identified the presence of potential confounding. 13,28,29,52,54,57,59,62,63,65,69,71,75
DISCUSSION
In this scoping review, we identified 35 studies that explored the measurement of documentation burden among physicians and nurses, underlining the overall paucity of research in the domain. As may be expected, all 35 studies were published post-HITECH Act. Seven effort constructs, 4 time constructs, and 11 units of analysis were uncovered. Our effort constructs—except workflow fragmentation and cognitively cumbersome work (eg, multitasking)—largely align with “proposed core EHR use measures (for practice efficiency)” published by Sinsky and colleagues which indicates burden may be quantified through existing metrics. 46 Generated with expert stakeholders, Sinsky’s core measures include total EHR time, work outside of work, time on documentation, time on prescriptions, inbox time, teamwork for orders, and undivided attention to patients. 46 Further efforts should examine these measures for validity and reliability. Fewer than half (n = 16) of the studies investigated the impact of burden on clinicians and/or patients. Methodologies varied across study design, suggesting there is no current consensus regarding best approach or standard to study burden, although it is possible an ensemble of methods coupled with the triangulation of multiple data sources will emerge as a best practice.
Historically, TM studies have been considered the gold standard for quantifying the effects of computer systems on task-based clinical workflow and duration. 82,83 Despite yielding valid results, 70,84,85 TM studies are costly and time-consuming to perform 83 and engage only a handful of participants per study. In addition to concerns regarding the generalizability of TM studies, prior research has identified widespread methodological inconsistencies in their design and conduct as well as in their quantitative analyses and reporting of results, making it difficult to synthesize findings across studies. 70,86 Readily accessible and scalable, and less subject to the Hawthorne effect, evidence may suggest that analyzing EHR usage logs is a more feasible alternative as these data were used in the overwhelming majority of included studies (80.0%). Nevertheless, research on the use of EHR usage logs to evaluate clinical activity has revealed a dearth of validation, cross-study analyses, and, most critically, defined terminology (eg, access log, audit log) and measures. 46,87 These inconsistencies parallel those found in TM studies, as described above. TM studies provide valuable contextual information on time and sequence of activities performed which can be triangulated with EHR usage logs to better understand burden in the context of clinical workflows. In recognizing that all methods have strengths and weaknesses, we anticipate that future work will identify the methods of measurement and triangulation of data that best align with different research objectives related to burden.
One major finding of this review was the absence of quantitative studies assessing the reliability and validity of time and effort measures. Of the 35 studies included, only 1 study intended to develop a measure of burden (ie, EHR usage outside shift), 13 while 2 studies individually employed TM studies to empirically validate proposed measures of workflow and the use of EHR usage log data in characterizing workload. 27,70 Interobserver reliability was reported in only 2 studies. 28,68 As described above, previous studies on quantifying physician EHR activity through EHR usage logs have noted similar challenges. 87 The lack of studies developing and validating burden measures confirms that limited efforts have been dedicated to formally and objectively quantifying and measuring burden, despite increasing references to it in public policy and lay literature. Researchers have often used unstandardized proxies to quantify burden which elucidates why no objective proxies exist. 6,13,14,25 Reinforcing the absence of empirical validation studies, there is a lack of an agreed-upon definition for burden and a plethora of definitions throughout the literature. 6,13,14,25,28,43,47,52,88–90 We found that many related—but different—concepts were used in the context of studies quantifying time and effort, such as workload, 27,78 workflow, 13,74 work disruption, 75 efficiency, 22,52 cognitive burden, 56 usability, 74 and productivity, among others. 69 In contrast, burnout is identifiable in controlled vocabularies including, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM) and MeSH. 91,92 Furthermore, validated measures of burnout, such as the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Mini Z burnout survey are often applied, 69,73 whereas no known analog for burden is currently available. Likewise, in a literature review conducted on the impact of EHRs on documentation time among physicians and nurses, Poissant and colleagues suggested that a lack of research evaluating EHR time efficiency is likely associated with the poverty of rigorous methods accurately capturing time. 12 We found that generalizability and measurement error issues were partially driven by the use of distinct EHR systems with some instances of proprietary and opaque vendor-defined time metrics for shift and active EHR time. 73 There was also imprecision in time capture among EHR usage log studies. Reported elsewhere in the literature, EHR usage logs have exhibited unreliable degrees of accuracy for both clinician activity and time durations captured. 87 Intended for troubleshooting technical problems and HIPAA compliance, EHR usage logs originate from many interconnected information systems and sources (eg, devices). 93 Vendor-defined time metrics may not be generalizable between, or within, institutions or provide precise estimates in real-world settings. Therefore, given the value in measuring clinician EHR time, researchers should explore novel algorithmic methods to validate these metrics and EHR usage log data. For example, Dziorny and colleagues developed an automated algorithm to quantify shift duration among physicians in an inpatient setting and internally validated it against scheduled shift-time. 83 Likewise, DiAngi et al proposed the “calculated EHR time outside of clinic” (CLOC) metric for ambulatory settings to measure after clinic hours using EHR usage logs and were able to correlate their findings with self-reported time spent in the EHR after clinic hours. 22
The HHS Report— Strategy on Reducing Burden Relating to the Use of Health IT and EHRs —aims to evaluate the clinical impact of burden (ie, time and effort) on clinicians and/or patients; 48 however, fewer than half the studies reviewed investigated an outcome of interest (n = 16). Of those studies (note: outcomes were not mutually exclusive), the majority examined clinician satisfaction and burnout (n = 12), while only half examined clinical process measures as an end goal. Half evaluated patient satisfaction and health indicators. Research questions and study objectives were widespread across included studies.
In this review, scribes represented 1 of 3 areas of study concerning proposed interventions to mitigate burden (n = 3); 14,52,53 however, associated costs and high turnover rates among scribes suggest that this solution may not be broadly feasible or sustainable. 47 In the context of reducing documentation burden, implementing and measuring the impact of scribes does not solve the higher-level information processing issues that informatics research should be investigating (eg, reduction in data entry requirements, improvement of system usability) and possibly diverts resources away from more sophisticated biomedical informatics approaches. Other identified interventions, such as training on EHR use (n = 2) 22,56 and documentation redesign (n = 3) 58,75,78 also have their strengths and weaknesses. Training may represent a lower cost method of mitigating burden than scribes, while documentation redesign may be more costly but likely more effective at solving information processing and usability concerns. Moreover, lack of standardized measures leads to the inability to conduct comparative effectiveness studies on design modifications within EHR systems 15 or across distinct burden-alleviating interventions.
In summary, our findings identified distinct, but not necessarily comprehensive, characteristics of measuring burden: 7 effort constructs, 4 time constructs, and 11 units of analysis (see Table 3 ).
Limitations
While this study sought to investigate literature on the operationalization of documentation burden and the development and/or validation of quantitative burden measures, research in this domain has not yet matured. Despite employing broad search terms and queries, the majority of the literature retrieved did not detail how to conceptualize and/or measure burden. We extracted manuscripts using keywords, as extant MeSH terms were unable to capture the phenomenon of study interest; in fact, no term for burden used in this specific context exists. It is conceivable that some articles were not captured because: (a) our keywords were limited, and/or (b) our queries were not sufficiently broad or narrow.
Future directions
Future research should build upon existing burden evidence, focusing on strengthening objectivity and generalizability. Proposed quantitative measures of burden such as the after scheduled duty hours measure described by Cox and colleagues should undergo rigorous testing and validation across settings and specialties. 13 Additionally, HHS links time and effort concepts to clinical impact; 48 therefore, research should directly connect measurement of these concepts with specific outcome measures to be able to accurately evaluate documentation burden over time. This remains a difficult undertaking as studies have shown that neither burden nor task value in the clinical context are identical across all EHR interactions or across different roles and specialties. 10,20,25 Examining tradeoffs between specific tasks within the EHR, Rao and colleagues discovered that EHR functionalities are not equally burdensome. 25 They also found that settings are not equally burdensome, reporting that shift-based work may be associated with less burden and that ambulatory clinical documentation is rated equally valuable and burdensome. 25 Perceptions of distinct documentation types among nurses have also been studied, yet no objective criteria have been established to evaluate value. 19 We found that only 1 study investigating EHR work afterhours (ie, “pajama time”) included nurses. 77 While “pajama time” connotes remotely accessing the EHR from home to document, few inpatient nurses do so given the immediacy of their documentation. Thus, data entry rates may be more suitable for measuring nurse burden. 76 Because physicians working in general medicine were most represented in our findings, future work should be dedicated to characterizing and measuring burden among understudied professions and settings (ie, nurses and subspecialties).
However, promisingly, burden measures identified were not strictly unique to individual professions and workflows, supporting the opportunity for defining interprofessional measures of burden in future work. We propose that burden be examined as a global composite measure, indicative of magnitude and directionality, consistent with the characteristics uncovered in this review. This would require: (a) developing a universally agreed-upon inventory for key EHR tasks and activities weighted for relative value according to burden (ie, a taxonomy) that could be linked to clinical outcomes such as “quality, financial or professional satisfaction” 15,27,28; and (b) quantifying the relationship between “pain points” and specific features in the EHR with more granularity. This furnishes the examination of task value, as indicated by task relationship with burden, a high priority area for future research. Such research would allow the identification of tasks that are of high burden but low value so that EHR design and intervention efforts may target the elimination or mitigation of these tasks.
CONCLUSION
Documentation burden among interprofessional clinical roles remains understudied and under-measured in both inpatient and ambulatory settings. This review suggests that concrete, validated measures of burden in research are lacking, which pales in comparison to burnout literature. 36 Moreover, this review demonstrates that the existing evidence is imprecise and fragmentary. While there is a multitude of measures for both effort and time among the included studies, the majority lack generalizability across study setting, patient population, EHR system, activity type, role, and subspecialty. In the absence of standardization, these studies additionally run the risk of measurement error including misclassification of idle and active time, completeness of task measurement, and precision of time capture. Hence, it would be prudent to further explore easily accessible, scalable alternatives, such as EHR usage log data. Targeting burden to evaluate the impact of quality improvement strategies and interventions requires quantifiable measures that are comparable and consistent across time, settings, professions, and contexts. We propose that burden should be examined as a global composite measure based on task value, consistent with burden measurement characteristics uncovered in this review. Further research is needed to reliably operationalize and standardize the concept of burden and to explore how it is best measured across clinical settings.

To alleviate EHR burdens, teamwork makes the dream work
A new study shows that primary care physicians who had greater documentation support from staff spent less daily time in the electronic health record.

A study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association sought to examine the relationship between electronic health record proficiency tools and time spent interacting with the EHR.
Researchers found that only one proficiency tool was associated with reduced time spent in the EHR.
However, they also found that primary care physicians who had greater support from their care team in writing notes spent less time in documentation-specific activities and less total time in the record per day.
"These findings suggest that PCPs may experience reductions in EHR-related burden and documentation burden by decentralizing documentation responsibilities," wrote the research team.
WHY IT MATTERS
Given EHRs' potential role in clinician burnout, researchers are increasingly turning their attention to factors that may increase (or decrease) time burden.
In the JAMIA study, the researchers sought to investigate whether reduced time in the Epic EHR was associated with several proficiency tools and behaviors, including QuickActions, NoteSpeed buttons, NoteWriter macros, QuickFilters and SmartPhrases.
Surprisingly, many of the proficiency behaviors were associated with more time in the EHR – namely, QuickActions and SmartPhrases.
Only NoteSpeed buttons were associated with reduced EHR time.
"The findings could indicate that PCPs who spent more time in the EHR may be more likely to use these EHR features as well as create longer notes," observed the researchers.
"Indeed, prior studies found the use of documentation tools … were associated with longer notes," they added. "Alternatively, the findings may suggest that such features may only be truly useful for limited types of clinical encounters."
Meanwhile, the study did find that team-based documentation models could reduce EHR-related burdens for PCPs. Organizations could implement such models by using nursing staff, medical assistants, medical students or scribing programs.
"Although the care team can offload some documentation burden from physicians, healthcare organizations could amplify these benefits by enabling patients to assist in documentation tasks," observed the researchers.
They also pointed to potential training opportunities for EHR workflows, especially as interfaces are updated.
"Clinicians may benefit from practicing new EHR skills in a training environment as scenario-based training and simulations have been shown to improve educational outcomes with EHR use," they wrote.
THE LARGER TREND
Several studies have sought to examine the relationship between EHRs and clinician burnout, pointing to usability, message volume and patient-generated data as potential culprits.
But EHRs aren't always to blame. Recent research shows that chaotic workplaces, after-hours workloads and bureaucratic tasks are major contributing factors to burnout – and COVID-19 has only made matters worse.
ON THE RECORD
"The present results … highlight the need for future qualitative research on the reasons for use or non-use of documentation support tools, as different interventions may be required based on the predominant reasons discovered," read the JAMIA study.
"These studies could also identify types of clinical encounters when certain tools may be more useful," it continued.
