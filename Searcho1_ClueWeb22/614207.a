So I've got this question: "How can today's college students future-proof their careers?" It sounds like it's asking for advice on what current college students can do now to make sure they're prepared for the job market in the future, right? Future-proofing a career probably means making choices that will keep their skills relevant and valuable even as technologies and industries evolve over time.

First off, I think it's important to understand what kinds of changes are likely to happen in the workforce in the coming years. There's a lot of talk about automation and artificial intelligence taking over certain jobs, so maybe students should focus on developing skills that are hard to automate. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look into some reports or articles about future job markets.

Let me consider doing a quick search to get some insights. Maybe something like "future job market trends" or "skills needed in the future job market." That could give me a better idea of what's projected to be in demand.

How New Technology Will Change Labor Market in the Future

How New Technology Will Change Labor Market in the Future

There is no doubt that technology has made our lives better and easier. However, it has also complicated them and caused some huge shifts in the global job market. Several decades ago, visions of the future included machines doing our jobs for us, while we took part in leisure activities. In reality, automation technology, robots, as well as AI have cost many people their jobs. On the other hand, modern technology has also given way to the era of digital marketing, thus creating new jobs that didn’t exist before, such as SEO specialists, link builders, bloggers, and social media experts.
For example, the demand for developers and other IT workers is only going to grow, as there will be 1.4 million computing jobs available by 2020, and only 400,000 computer science graduates to fill those positions. If we were to look at things in simple terms, we would realize that technology both displaces and creates new jobs. While there may be less work for factory workers in the future, other skills, such as creative thinking, custom paper writing services, or decision making, which cannot be done by machines, will be in high demand.
But, such a simplified view on things doesn’t tell the whole story, so let’s take a more detailed look into how new technology will change the labor market in the future.
Men Might Face More Job Displacement than Women
Perhaps the biggest way in which automation and technology will affect the workforce in the future is not through a sheer number of employees, which might remain the same. However, it will affect certain categories differently. For i nstance, men could face higher job displacement than women in the future. How so? Well, they tend to dominate jobs such as machine operations and mechanical repairs, all of which will be facing automation at some point in the future
Women, on the other hand, will have more job opportunities when it comes to nursing and personal care, all of which are too difficult to automate, or there is no profit to be made from introducing automation. Another category which is most likely to suffer are workers without a college degree, which make up about two-thirds of the workforce in the US. Since modern technology and automation requires highly educated people, it could lead to an even larger disparity in education, wealth, and income between different employee categories.
Digital Talent Platforms Will Improve Worker-Job Matching
We are constantly reading about how the world has gotten smaller thanks to technology and digital communications. It’s only logical that such a development will have a similar effect on the labor market. How so? Well, since new technologies may lead to higher job displacement, the only real solutions include workers switching careers, or simply moving to where there is a demand for their skill set. However, only a small percentage will decide to make such huge changes. But, they may not even have to, at least when it comes to jobs which don’t require them to be on location.
The number of remote workers and freelancers is growing every year. If you add to that the powerful algorithms that online talent platforms use, it could result in finding just the right people for the job, regardless of their location. It could also be used in higher productivity and GDP, especially in developing countries. For instance, workers who have found their dream job are willing to work longer hours. Also, stay-at-home moms would also benefit from working part-time jobs online. All of this could reduce unemployment and output per worker, even if they are only working a few hours per week.
Things Will Become More Difficult for Low-Paid Workers
Since new technologies will require workers who are highly skilled, low-paid workers will face more uncertainty when it comes to their careers. They could lose their jobs, which would then result in immigrants and minorities taking on those jobs, which could lead to increased pressure on wages. According to a paper from the Bank of England, a 10% increase in the proportion of immigrants in the sector leads to a 1.88% reduction in pay.
But, seeing as the demand for low-skill jobs is going to continue to diminish, even those workers and/or immigrants willing to work for less will have fewer and fewer employment opportunities. Also, we also need to take into account that not all sectors will be affected equally.
Unequal Chances for Further Education
Another way in which technology might create a gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers is through further education. While it would make sense that more education opportunities should be given to low-paid workers, the exact opposite happens to be the case. High-paid workers enjoy greater job security and full-time jobs, and the companies they work for providing them with more chances to improve their skills and knowledge, which is not something that can be said for low-paid workers, entrepreneurs, and part-time employees.
In other words, those who have more will have a better chance to generate even more, while those with less will have even less in the future. The solution would be to introduce a more fair approach, one which would make the gap smaller, and provide more opportunities for everyone. But, even if that was the case, it wouldn’t solve the problem completely, because not everyone has a preference for or the necessary mindset to become a worker in IT.
Artificial Intelligence Will Make a Massive Impact
While visions of the apocalypse we tend to associate with technology and AI are overblown for the most part, AI will make a huge impact when it comes to employment. The introduction of AI could lead to tens of millions of workers being displaced in the next decade, and that’s just the UK alone. Transportation and storage workers are highly at risk, especially with the emergence of autonomous vehicles. Also, manufacturing and retail have a lot to worry about. For example, it’s not difficult to imagine a scenario where Amazon is using AI and robots to handle everything from sorting and packaging to transportation, either via self-driving vehicles or drones, which is already happening.
But, will AI create jobs? Yes, but again, those which can look forward to new jobs are programmers, developers, engineers, and other skilled technical workers and experts. However, there is a potential scenario where even those workers can lose their jobs, provided that AI has developed to such a level that it can program other AI, or create one of its own. AI can be a great tool, but it can also create a whole myriad of other problems if we are not careful.
People Will Always Be Better Where Flexibility Is Required
The automotive industry is the most cited example of automation out there, however, it might not be the best one. While huge robots have cost plenty of people their jobs, they are still helpless when faced with complex tasks that have a lot of variety in them. For instance, a manager could simply walk into the factory and tell their employees that they are making something entirely different today (different trim levels, for example), and employees would be able to adjust in no time. Also, even though huge robotic arms are used to move cars and heavier parts, such as engine or transmission, people are used for finer tasks, such as applying custom paint, inspecting the quality of the cars, and
putting the fine bits and pieces into place.
Conclusion
As you can see, new technology is never going to replace us completely, but there will be some bumps along the way which we will have to endure while we adapt to new circumstances. The future looks exciting, but it does come with its own unique set of challenges we may not be aware of just yet.

55 Future Jobs of the Future
55 Future Jobs of the Future
by Thomas Frey | Nov 11, 2011 | Business Trends
“There is no future in any job. The future lies in the person who holds the job.” – George W. Crane
One of my primary complaints with higher education is that they tend to prepare students for jobs of the past. The way a Midwesterner would phrase it, “they are constantly shooting behind the duck.”
Similarly, whenever a column is written about the best paying jobs of the future, jobs like civil engineers, registered nurses, and computer system analysts, they are all jobs that currently exist today.
Yes, many of these jobs will still exist in the future, but every one of them will morph and change as technology and communication systems make their impact.
As an example, technology research firm IDC predicts the amount of data businesses will have access to will grow 50-fold over the next decade. As data becomes cheaper, faster, and more pervasive, the nature of our work begins to change as well.
The first wave of baby boomers has now turned 65. As this generation greys, their needs will change. Their growing numbers and increasing medical needs will require a different kind of health care professionals to take care of them.
As a rule of thumb, 60% of the jobs 10 years from now haven’t been invented yet. With that in mind, I’ve decided to pull together a list of 55 jobs that will be in high demand in the future.
Jobs Before 2020
Many of the changes we see today will cause new jobs materialize quickly. This first section deals will new positions that will likely be spawned within the next 10 years.
1. Augmented Reality Architects
Much like the paint we put on houses and the flavorings we add to food, the future will seem boring if our reality hasn’t been augmented in some way.
2. Alternative Currency Bankers
According to Javelin Strategies, 20% of all online trades are already being done with alternative currencies. The stage is being set for next-gen alt-currency banks.
3. Seed Capitalists
In the startup business world there is a huge gulf between initial concept and fundable prototypes. This dearth of funding options will require an entirely new profession. Seed capitalists will specialize in high-risk startups. Counter to todays investment-world thinking, if they get more than 100% return on their investments, they will be docked for not taking enough risk.
4. Global System Architects
Our systems are transitioning from national systems into global systems. Architects of these new global systems will play a crucial role in future global politics.
More details: Global System Architects – Tomorrow’s New Power Brokers
5. Locationists
People who specialize in adding the relevance of “place” to our global online communities.
6. Waste Data Managers
To insure data integrity in today’s fast evolving information storage industry, multiple redundancies have been built into the system. Achieving more streamline data storage in the future will require de-duplication specialists who can rid our data centers of needless copies and frivolous clutter.
7. Urban Agriculturalists
Why ship food all the way around the world when it can be grown next door. Next generation produce-growing operations will be located underground, often below the grocery stores where the produce will be sold directly to customers.
More details: The Coolest Profession on Earth – Next Generation Agriculture
8. Business Colony Managers
The average person that turns 30 years old in the U.S. today has worked 11 different jobs. In just 10 years, the average person who turns 30 will have worked 200-300 different projects. Business colonies are an evolving new kind of organizational structure designed around matching talent with pending work projects. The operation will revolve around some combination of resident people based in a physical facility and a non-resident virtual workforce, with some opting to forgo the cost of the physical facility entirely. People who can effectively manage this type of operation will be in high demand.
More details: Business Colonies: A study of structure, organization, and the evolution of work
9. Competition Producers
One of the hottest new trends will be to design incentive-based competitions to solve some of the world’s biggest problems. Paving the way has been X-Prize Foundation’s Pete Diamandis and the success of the Ansari X-Prize. In the future, every major corporation will have their name on a major prize competition. Similar to buying the naming rights to a stadium, a well-orchestrated competition has far-reaching branding potential.
10. Avatar Designers Manager
Next generation avatars will become indistinguishable from humans on a two-dimensional screen. However, avatars will only live in the computer world for a short time longer. It is only a matter of time before they emerge from the computer and appear as visual beings, walking around among us. Once an avatar goes through the radical metamorphosis from an image that we see on a screen to a three dimensional being that joins us for dinner, carries on conversations with our friends, and serves as a stand-in for us at meetings, we will see work start on an even more realistic avatar, one that we can touch.
More details: 6 Trends to Watch in 2010 – The Turing Test for Avatars
11. Avatar Relationship Managers
As the foibles of humanity enter the realm of autonomous, freethinking avatars, people will find it necessary to both manage and limit the often dangerous relationships that avatars get themselves into.
12. 3D Printing Engineers
Classes in 3D printing are already being introduced into high schools and the demand for printer-produced products will skyrocket. The trend will be for these worker-less workshops to enter virtually every field of manufacturing, stemming the tide of outsourcing, at the same time, driving the need for competent technicians and engineers to design and maintain the next wave of this technology.
13. 3D Food-Printer Engineers
Pushing the envelope for 3D printer technology even further, will be the coming age of food printers. Converting 3D printers to work with cartridges containing food-stocks will prove difficult and demanding on a number of levels. Those who can solve this kind of problem will be in high demand.
More details: The Coming Food Printer Revolution
14. Book-to-App Converters
Over the coming months we will begin to see a form of competition brewing between books and apps. With both being information products that we interface with differently, we will begin to see a large scale effort to convert existing books and literature into an interactive app, similar to the current effort to convert popular literature from print to audiobooks. More details here.
15. Social Education Specialists
We learn from each other. But what is it that we learn from others that is valuable? And how do we structure a circle of friends, as a highly influential group that we rely heavily on, to give us a constant stream of truly valuable information and advice.
16. Privacy Managers
If you think you have lost most of your privacy already, we’ve only scratched the surface. We are all terminally human, and as such, we do not always make good decisions. Striking the perfect privacy-transparency balance will require far more than amateur insights. It will require a privacy professional.
More details: The Coming Transparency Wars
17. Wind Turbine Repair Techs
The proliferation of windmills around the world will dramatically drive the demand for repair techs who are not afraid of heights and can solve whatever new problems this fledgling new industry blows their way.
18. Data Hostage Specialists
Holding people as hostages is very messy. But holding data hostage is a less-risky crime that can be done remotely, and has the potential for far greater rewards. This is especially true if the country you’re living in condones your actions. This type of activity will give rise to the likes of data-hostage negotiators, data-retrieval specialists, and damage-control analysts.
19. Smart Dust Programmers
In it’s simplest form, smart dust consists of a sensor combined with a wireless transmitter and some kind of power source. Many are envisioning the power to come from wireless RF signals. The reason it is referred to as “smart dust” is because the technology is shrinking in size until it reaches the particle size of dust. Future designs for smart dust involve detecting everything from moisture content, to soil temperature, to chemical composition.

20. Personality Services
Talking back and forth to a computer that has a machine-like voice is boring. But being able to download specific “personality packages” will add an entirely new level of engagement for basement-dwellers everywhere. The hottest personalities to download will be offshoots of existing characters or celebrities such as being able to download a David Letterman personality, a Homer Simpson personality, or perhaps even a Darth Vader personality.
21. Smart Contact Developers
The idea of “smart” contact lenses, the kind that can superimpose information on the wearer’s field of view has been around for a while. But the first iteration of smart contact lenses is already on the market and industry execs are beginning to generate a wide array of possible applications.
22. Nano-Medics
The medical problems most people have can be traced to a single cell or a small group of them. Health professionals capable of working on the nano-level, both in designing diagnostics systems, remedies, and monitoring solutions will be in high demand.
23. New Science Philosopher-Ethicists
Every new technology creates its own set of unintended consequences, and people who can ask the tough questions and demand deeper introspection will be in high demand. Industry sages will serve as both a conscience and a guide for decision-makers everywhere.
24. Organ Agents
The demand for transplantable organs is exploding and people who can track down and deliver healthy organs will be in hot demand.
25. Octogenarian Service Providers
As the population continues the age we will have record numbers of people living into their 80s, 90s, and 100s. This mushrooming group of active oldsters will provide a demand for goods and services currently not being addressed in today’s marketplace.
26. Elevated Tube Transport Engineers
The next big infrastructure project on planet earth will be a human and cargo transport system designed around a network of vacuum tubes with maglev tracks. Operating at less than 2% of the cost of today’s car, truck, jet, ship, and train systems, this emerging tube transport system will be a massive undertaking that demands talented new-age thinkers for decades to come.
More details: Ten History-Altering Breakthroughs in 2020
The Dismantlers
Over the coming years will see a number of industries dismantled requiring a skilled workforce of talented people who can perform this task in the least disruptive way. Most of these industries have been built around aging facilities and infrastructure that will become unnecessary and unsustainable in the future. These will include:
27. Prison System Dismantlers

More details: The Future of Education and Curiosity-Driven Education and Accomplishment-Based Education
32. College and University Dismantlers
More details: Charting a New Frontier for Colleges and Universities and Competing for Status and The Future of Colleges & Universities – Part One
Jobs in 2030 and Beyond
A number of technologies currently on the drawing board will require a bit longer lead time before the industry comes into its own. Here are a few examples of these kinds of jobs:
33. Drone Dispatchers
Drones will be used to deliver groceries and pizzas, deliver water, remove trash and sewage, monitor traffic and pollution, and change out the batteries on our homes. Skilled dispatchers for future drones will be high demand. More details here.
More details: The Day of the Drone is Upon Us
34. Brain Quants
Where the stock market manipulators of the past meet the brain manipulators of the future to usurp control of Madison Avenue.
35. Tree-Jackers
Plant and tree alteration specialists, who manipulate growth patterns, create grow-to-fit wood products, color-changing leaves, and personalized fruit.
More details: Inventing the Rocking Chair Tree
36. Plant Psychologists
An entire profession dedicated to undo the damage caused by the Tree-Jackers
37. Extinction Revivalists
People who revive extinct animals.
38. Robotic Earthworm Drivers
The most valuable land on the planet will soon be the landfills because that is where we have buried our most valuable natural resources. In the future, robotic earthworms will be used to silently mine the landfills and replace whatever is extracted with high-grade soil.
39. Gravity Pullers
The first wave of people to unlock the code for influencing gravity.
40. Time Hackers
If we think cyber terrorists are a pain, it will seem like nothing compared to devious jerry-riggers who start manipulating the time fabric of our lives.
41. Clone Ranchers
Raising “blank” humans will be similar in many respects to cattle ranching. But once a clone is selected, and the personality download is complete, the former clone will instantly be elevated to “human status.”
42. Body Part & Limb Makers
The Organ Agents listed above will quickly find themselves out of work as soon as we figure out how to efficiently grow and mass produce our own organs from scratch.
43. Memory Augmentation Therapists
Entertainment is all about the great memories it creates. Creating a better grade of memories can dramatically change who we are and pave the way for an entirely new class of humans.
44. Time Brokers
Time Bank Traders – Where do you go when you run out of time? Naturally, to the time-bank, and take out a time-loan.
45. Space-Based Power System Designers
At some point, the burning of earth’s natural resources for power will become a thing of the past. Space-based systems will capture and transmit power far more efficiently than anything currently in existence.
46. Geoengineers
Weather Control Specialists – We are moving past the age of meteorology and climatology to one where the true power-brokers will wield the forces of nature.
47. Plant Educators
An intelligent plant will be capable of re-engineering itself to meet the demands of tomorrow’s marketplace. Plant educators will not work with lesson plans or PowerPoint presentations, but the learning process will be even more effective.
More details: Tapping into the Secret Language of Plants
48. Nano-Weapons Specialists
Many of the weapons of the future will be too small to be seen by the human eye. And naturally, these will be the most dangerous.
More details: Nano-Weaponry: Entree to a Twisted Reality
49. Lip Designers
If you could have any lips in the world, what would they look like?
50. Mass Energy Storage Developers
As a society, we have become very good at generating electricity, but are still terrible at storing it from one day to the next. Once mass energy storage systems are developed and installed, our total energy needs will drop precipitously.
51. Earthquake Forecasters
Everything we know about the inside of the earth has been developed through indirect evidence. We have no maps of the center of the earth. We have no accurate diagrams, no understanding of motion, fluidity, or changes happening with any degree of accuracy. While scientists are developing skills to work with nanoscale precision on the earth’s surface, the best we can muster below the surface is blindfolded guesswork done with 100-mile precision. What we don’t know is literally killing us – over 226,000 killed in 2010 alone. But that will change over time as we begin to understand the inner working of the earth and accurately forecast when the next big quakes are about to hit.
More details: Prize Competition #1: The Race to the Core
52. “Heavy Air” Engineers
Compressed air is useful in a wide variety of ways. However, we have yet to figure out how to compress streams of air as they pass through our existing atmosphere. Once we do, it will create untold opportunity for non-surface based housing and transportation system, weather control, and other kinds of experimentation.
53. Robot Polishers
If we are going to have robots, they will invariably need to be polished.
54. Amnesia Surgeons
Doctors who are skilled in removing bad memories or destructive behavior.
55. Executioners for Virus-Builders
In the future, virus-builders who get caught will have a choice. They can either go to the electric chair, or spend some quality time with the Amnesia Surgeon.
Final Thoughts
The jobs and occupations listed above are just scratching the surface. This list is intended to help stretch your imagination and start you down a path of imagining your own future.
But I’d love to hear your thoughts. What am I missing? Where have I gone off the reservation and missed the big picture entirely? Are there better names for these professions? And most importantly, how can someone today prepare himself or herself for the changes to come?
Yes, this column includes far more questions than answers. But when it comes to understanding the future, it all begins with asking the right questions.

National and local job trends are part of most employment news. It's a good idea to keep up with employers and hiring trends, especially if you are currently switching careers or looking for a new job.
But keeping an eye on an even bigger picture-global developments, trends and their implications, e.g., ramped up job out-sourcing, creation of overseas tax havens for large-scale employers, labor-shuffling trade agreements, or spikes in workplace-robot exports from Japan-is a big part of being job smart.
Just as smart is understanding a trend after identifying it, because whatever causes one trend is very likely to cause another, e.g., aging population as cause of demand for healthcare workers is also likely to reduce demand for snow-boarding coaches, nursery school teachers and nightclub DJs.
Job trends encompass more than hiring and resource trends - the very nature of work is changing. Rapid technological changes are uprooting entire industries and changing the way we interact in the workplace. The savvy job-seeker and employer will follow the trends on both sides of their key supply and demand equations, with a close eye not only on quantitative changes, but also qualitative changes in the attributes of jobs, workers, management, workplaces, their goals, constraints and resources.
For example, developments such as virtualization dramatically shape career paths and our daily experience of work. In this example, work has been changed because many employees now work remotely. However, the process of virtualization not only shifts employees' physical interaction, but also the very nature of work. The shift away from personal interaction has accelerated the use of project and scheduling tools, which have then shaped the very concept of employment. Because of this workplace development, employment itself is now often more project-based and has also shifted towards greater reliance on contingent labor.
Job trends such as the above-mentioned example are important to follow, and not only from an academic standpoint. In planning one's career, it is important to consider these developments to ensure the long term marketability and vitality of your skill-set and experience.
The last thing you want is to identify and try to follow or ride a positive trend only after it is over. The best is, of course, to be among those who create it when it's good and escape it when it's bad.

Job Trends by 2040
The next two decades promise a full-scale revolution in our careers. In the next 20 years, we see that, beforehand, take a quick look at the present time – and some seem to be contradictory for the future job trends.
We’re already living in an age of many robots – and many works. Workplace robots have reached the record level, it is notable that the global unemployment rate of the 008 decreased 5.2% in a report last month – the lowest level of 38 years.
In other words, high technology and high employment will not be mutually exclusive. There is numerous proof on it today.
Given this consistency between employment and craftsmanship, we can predict that for the next several decades, there are reasons to be hopeful that jobs are more accessible, more flexible, and more liberated.
Significant changes by 2040
Here is a list of five significant changes that are predicted to be significant by 2040:
• Robotics and Artificial Intelligence will eventually work less, create more jobs. Today is very good
There is no shortage of jobs – but if we do not take the right steps – we lack the skilled talent to fill them.
• Remote work will become the norm, future talent will enter cities of the war. Neutral work from the place is going to give people new geographical independence wherever they want and compete to attract new mobile laboratories in the city and metropolitan areas.
• Based on the rate of increase in workers’ freelancing in America in 2017, most of the workers will freelance by 2027.
• Technical changes will continue to increase, so learning new skills will be the ongoing need for life.
The most constructive discussion will not change or change, but what should we do to ensure the best, most inclusive results?
Stephane Kasriel CEO, Upwork, recommended some suggestions that can help us in the positive future of work:
Suggestion # 1: Change academic curriculum
Rapid technological change means that people who constantly develop machine-learning skills will have to learn new skills – fast Our current education system changes very slowly and operates very effectively for this new world.
We will have an education system for education in our lifetime – and the culture that promotes it. The system should review with the pre-kindergarten level, which should be free and compulsory when education should be equally accessible to anyone’s working life.
The skills of the descendants of the college will be important for future workshops – so we must make sure that the college is affordable, we will be sure that higher education is still worth the price, or it will have to take full advantage of the complete progress of reconsidering and skill training.
Skill-based vocational programs, as well as other ways of climbing skill stairs (such as beginner), should be widely accessible and affordable in the future of work trends.
Furthermore, in our education system, people need to be equipped with expertise that the machines are not yet (yet). It means meta-efficiency such as entrepreneurship, teamwork, curiosity, and adaptability.
The government adjusts to the changed workshop at all levels, businesses will also take a little over the load.
And, businesses like the government have to invest in their workshops today and they will need tomorrow. This means that they spend more resources to open new jobs and invest more in their current staffing skills.
Tax policies can encourage these steps to take effect. For example, governments can tax companies whose former employees end up with unemployed or under-pay – both of which invest in their workplace investment.
Such a policy can have positive-cumulative results throughout the working world: Labor pools are attracted to the jobs available, businesses achieve the necessary goals for achieving their goals, and due to the strong growth in the work, the government sees an obstacle on a tax basis.
Suggestion # 2: Transform worker safety
Our taxes, health care, unemployment insurance, and pension systems were made for all industries, and in the future, if we can not make significant reforms, they will not serve future work trends.
Flexible Employment is a growing trend across the world. For decades, the system was assembled with the system that was assigned to minority workers.
But since it has changed, and in fact, it is sending us quickly, all parties should discover ‘decoupling benefits and protections’ from full employment status and should be distributed equally in production workshops. “White paper.
Innovations and technological advances can also help this place to deliver such benefits. To secure future security, it needs to embrace technology.
For example, Edtech offers low-cost ways to provide skill training. It must be designed by its stakeholders – not only citizens are trained, businesses, trade unions, and other groups, who also rely on this reskilling and upskilling, to ensure they can meet their goals with the pipeline workers.
Foreign policy policies are already being tested to alter the benefits – such as “flexicurity”, Denmark’s model, which provides government benefits such as unemployment protection and widely paid skills training.
Others are equally valuable to continue testing as “Portable benefits” and a Universal Basic Income, or UBI, for their utilities. And we should challenge ourselves to continue to innovate in this region – and while working on today’s workshop as well as considering the needs of tomorrow, governments work to create sandboxes for these ideas.
Suggestion # 3: Unleash freedom and flexibility of work
Acting together, making the government and business more intuitive can make life easier. They may begin to do remote work, flexible schedules, and platform power.
It is often not possible for new parents, single parents, disability or many people in our society to work in the office, not really, but to provide alternatives to house schedules or to schedule their schedule, many are able to earn an income, many are able to earn a return. And many already.
Between 20%-30% of the working force in the United States and the EU-15, today are performing independent work, and the ratios in most growing markets are even higher.
The platforms, such as my company, help make the trend faster by creating more quickly and better ways to connect with the business, buyers, and sellers.
And for millions of people around the world, through our sites and other hosts, it is already providing new opportunities for flexibility to earn their living and living.
So today’s message to the government is: “At first, do no harm.” to meet the future of work trends; but more importantly, encouraging the policies of the government, which does not frustrate independent work, along with freelancing, lets more people work, which can not otherwise be competent.
In fact, McKinsey, worldwide consulting, estimates that “by 2025, they could add $ 2.7 trillion to global GDP and most of the problems in the labor market of the world begin to cause problems.”
Women’s participation in workshops may increase due to the promotion of remote work and flexible schedules, and some economists reduce sex discrimination with the future of work trends.
The idea of ​​a major company provides important proof. In the mid-1990s, after learning about Ernest and Young’s (EY) consultation, they started promoting their “flexibility” efforts. EY women employees exceeded their company by 10-15 percent more than their male counterparts.
Eighteen years later, in a report, “In addition to other formal efforts including formal flexibility, reduction, and part-time schedules and informal day-to-day flexibility … hold men and women at the same rate and they have achieved the goal of promoting women partners. Women make up about 30% of new partners each year. “
Local communities can make work easier by creating more virtual workspaces and tools to complete the work. This will help in expanding opportunities in new communities, due to the opening of new capital cities in the cities, decentralized workplaces will also be available at a small level even in the basic.
Future of work trends
Regardless of the final notion of linear development and a speedy blitzkrieg of change, there’s something fairly comfortably cyclical in regard to the rise and fall of traits.
Although the way forward for work might typically appear murky now, it’s assuring to know that most of the current elements of labor that we’re so used to at this time have been as soon as mere predictions…or science fiction!
If the world of labor collectively had the facility to adapt, evolve, and try forward then, it may possibly accomplish that now too.
1. What’s the Way forward for Work?
The way forward for work is a ubiquitous subject of debate and dialogue and never without motive. It’s all the time vital to ask “ The place are we headed?” particularly in an atmosphere as change-centric as ours, which is the future of work trends.
Deloitte’s International Human Capital Tendencies report for 2019, as you’ll be able to see under, gives a fascinating slice of perception into traits to be careful for over the ten years to come back.
The report, primarily based on a longitudinal survey of 10,000 contributors throughout 119 nations, is predicated on what professionals at this time are assigning worth to and what they really feel are and could be the most important alternatives and challenges to rise to within the subsequent few years.
With these international perceptions setting the context, let’s dive into the ten key future of labor traits to be careful of within the subsequent ten years.
The way forward for work could be born out of the current panorama at work – an amalgamation of the necessity to change, the will for peace, and the demand for augmented experiences. Listed here are the ten key traits that organizations ought to put together.
2. A Treasure Trove of Knowledge
In the present day, our knowledge universe defines who we’re, and each digital expertise that comes to our manner is predicated on and tuned to our knowledge identification, which of the future of work trends.
Even firms like Twitter use algorithms to make exact assumptions about our gender for instance merely primarily based on our exercise on the platform. All, this, simply to expertise a world that’s extra customized – extra us.
What implications do improvements corresponding to these have on the work-worker-workplace ecosystem?
Staff additionally search individualized interactions from each side of labor. We search for immersive experiences in what’s “ now not an Internet of Things (IoT) however moderately an Internet of Me (IoM)”, as Shawn DuBravac, Founder & President of the Avrio Institute places it.
“The interface of knowledge is altering how we work together with expertise ,” provides Shawn. As we transfer from a digitized atmosphere to a datafied one, organizations want to have the ability to sustain this abundance of information in order to keep away from a shortage of knowledge.
That is what companies of the near-future would want to mine intelligently to the deep-dive right into a prepared, on-demand pool of knowledge to make higher selections, create happier workplaces and result in higher enterprise success.
3. New behaviors
Ten years in the past, if somebody had advised you that you’d have all these details about yourself public for the world to learn, see and listen to, you’ll have mentioned they have been loopy, which is the future of work trends.
Now have a look at the place we’re: we’re a lot extra comfy dwelling extra public lives, we construct communities, share, talk, collaborate, enter data, and form our private experiences.
All these new behaviors are cascading over organizations, which is forcing them to make adjustments.
4. Applied sciences
Huge knowledge, the cloud, the web of issues, robots, automation, video, collaboration platforms, and different applied sciences are altering the best way we work and stay, which is the future of work trends.
The cloud places the facility of expertise into the arms of workers; robots and software programs are forcing us to rethink the roles that people can and will do; massive knowledge provides us perception into how we work and the way prospects transact with us; and collaboration platforms give us the flexibility to attach our individuals and data collectively wherever, anytime, and on any system.
5. Learning to Learn, Unlearn and Relearn
Change presupposes adaptation. With the bigger atmosphere and its smaller shifting elements present process digital and technological tectonic shifts, is it not a shock that professionals throughout the globe understand studying as a very powerful pattern to arrange for.
Hawley Kane, Head of Organizational Expertise and Management Growth at Saba Software program says, “ Palms down we see the connection of studying to efficiency as being the a-ha second for L&D.
Right here ’s the crux of it: For top -performing organizations, studying just isn’t the result – it’s the habits that drive efficiency .”
Hawley provides that studying and efficient administration doesn’t merely co-exist – they’re depending on each other, which is the future of work trends.
To ship studying experiences that transfer the needle on efficiency, expert leaders have to empower workers to drive their very own growth with studying that’s aligned to the person, the staff, and relatable enterprise objectives.
Heide Abelli, Senior Vice President, Content material Product Administration at Skillsoft feels that a large pattern to be careful for in organizational studying is “the rising sense of urgency to deal with gaps within the readiness of the workforce to execute on the digital agenda.
With the introduction of the latest roles, the elimination of outdated roles, the elevated scope of accountability in key roles, and the elimination of administration layers, the problem round expertise readiness are big .”
Studying is inextricably linked to the workings of any group, extra so at this time than ever earlier than and the best way organizations are taught is altering.
6. Quicker, Higher, Easier HR Expertise
With AI and ML making inroads into core and subsidiary HR features, the longer-term calls for higher integration.
Prithvi Shergill, Co-Founder, Co-create Tomorrow states, “60 to 70 % of organizations at this time say that they use AI to boost valuation.”
He provides, “ having the ability to undertake expertise just isn’t all the time a couple of mindset shift or reluctance however moderately a problem of funds and authority.”
With HR tech turning into a pattern that organizations have to undertake and adapt successfully, each enterprise mindset and fund planning must be in favor of the smoothest transformation. This is applicable to the choice of the best human capital administration (HCM) instruments and suites as properly.
Sallyann says, “HCM’s at this time should be predictive in nature deciphering and making connections with knowledge, straightforward plug and playable and competency-centric, which is the future of work trends.
By predictive, it ought to have a worker engagement bot that talks to a studying and growth system (as a result of one of many stickiest measures of engagement is how a lot somebody thinks they’re studying) and ship off warning indicators when both ones go haywire.”
A superb HCM system also needs to enable straightforward plug-and-play options. That’s the place the way forward for HR tech wants to steer organizations – in the direction of work that’s straightforward, sensible, and interesting.
7. Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication
The way forward for work calls for that organization spends money on making a tradition the place creativity thrives, collaboration is facilitated and communication is inspired, which is the future of work trends.
The present pattern of main by instance requires this cultural shift to be pushed top-down with the efficient involvement of C-suite workers.
Collaboration not solely refers back to the cooperation between groups and features but additionally between enterprise leaders and HR heads.
Engelbert Camasura, President & CEO of Asia Choose, Inc. pointed to the significance of the function of HR in making the AI revolution and the digital transformation a twin success.
He says, “CHROs have to take a bolder stand and be true enterprise leaders as a substitute of being service supply executives and even simply enterprise companions .” The onus of enterprise transformation thus wants not solely to be partnered by but additionally co-led by HR.
Being part of the AI revolution is an energetic resolution to make and to stay by. Englebert additionally spoke of how knowledge must be regarded not as a problem but moderately as an enabling software.
Companies thus have to make a shift and deal with the resources-mindset-data triangle to reap the advantages of the revolution that’s close to.
8. From Wellness to Happiness at Work
Dr. Rajiv Kumar, President & Chief Medical Officer of Virgin Pulse, states that the three most vital causes for organizations to embrace workforce wellness are:
Staff count on and demand that their place of employment supply this profit. Millennials, which comprise the biggest share of our workforce at this time, select the place they work primarily based on an organization demonstrating that it cares for them. A vital approach to present that care is by providing a complete wellbeing program.
Backside -up wellbeing applications are important software to foster workforce collaboration and cohesion, which ends up in robust, vibrant company cultures, which is the future of work trends.
When carried out appropriately, wellbeing applications can save organizations some huge cash in healthcare prices, decreased absenteeism and presenteeism, and even decreased worker attrition.
The significance of psychological and emotional well-being at work is gaining rising traction and never without motive.
With AI-enabled instruments to watch and information worker well-being higher, the pattern of making a more healthy and happier workforce is actively guiding organizational selections.
9. The Rise of “Superjobs”
Anand Shankar, Accomplice, Chief – HR Transformation, Deloitte, speaks of “super job” because of the pure end result of our collaborative transformation, which is the future of work trends.
Organizations want to start out making ready for the skill requirements of tomorrow and be certain that their workers are able to rise as much as the problem.
Creating an adept and agile expertise pipeline rests on an adequately expert workforce that may collaborate with the newest expertise.
As AI gears as much as increases jobs, human roles have to be augmented as properly. Organizations might want to relook on the implications of the transactional elements of labor being completed away with and even strategic selections being aided.
Thus, with jobs evolving to super jobs that set the context for skill-development, fundamental processes and our understanding of them would predictably undergo some tweaks as properly.
This can be a pattern that’s separate from the extra widespread updating in studying and growth processes as a result of this has to do with the modification of jobs, duties, and roles as we all know them.
10. Millennials within the office
By 2020, millennials are anticipated to make up about 50% of the workforce, and by 2025 this quantity is projected to be 75%, which is the future of work trends.
The vital factor about millennials just isn’t the truth that they could deliver new approaches, concepts, values, or kinds of working, it’s that there are going to be so many of them.
They’re, by all accounts, going to be the biggest technology ever to enter the workforce. This can be a technology of workers with technological fluency who’re prepared to stay at residence longer till they discover a firm they really need to work for.
In different phrases, organizations should shift from creating an atmosphere in the place they assume that folks have to work there to 1 the place individuals need to work there.
11. Mobility
In the present day, the place you might be situated in is beginning to matter a lot much less in the case of having the ability to do your job, which is the future of work trends.
So long as you’ll be able to hook up with the web, the possibilities are that you would be able to enter the identical individuals and data as in case you have been working in workplace construction.
12. Globalization
That is basically the flexibility for organizations to work in a world the place boundaries don’t exist. The world is turning into a similar one-to-one massive metropolis, which is the future of work trends.
The language you communicate, the forex you transact in, and your bodily location are beginning to matter much less and less.
You possibly can work in San Francisco but have shoppers in Beijing or Melbourne, and the identical goes for workers. Boundaries to working with anybody, wherever are disappearing and this pattern can solely proceed.
13. Profitable with a range
With knowledge analytics and AI-enabled instruments striving to create decision-making as prejudice-free as attainable, a mature dialog on range seems to be a rapidly evolving pattern. Extra firms at this time are coming ahead to acknowledge the necessity for correct range schooling and never simply sensitization.
With that, the dialogue has shifted from having a laundry record for range and inclusion (DI) initiatives to extra significant and actionable plans that might really make a distinction.
14. Driving Worker Expertise
We stay experientially. The rising significance of the person interface has prolonged the office as properly.

Alright, I've got this question: "How can today's college students future-proof their careers?" Okay, so future-proofing a career probably means making choices now that will keep their skills relevant and valuable even as technologies and industries change in the future. It's like building a house that can withstand different kinds of weather— you want it to be sturdy and adaptable.

First, I need to understand what kinds of changes are likely to happen in the workforce in the coming years. I remember hearing a lot about automation and artificial intelligence taking over certain jobs. So, maybe students should focus on developing skills that are hard to automate. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look into some reports or articles about future job markets.

Let me consider doing a quick search to get some insights. Maybe something like "future job market trends" or "skills needed in the future job market." That could give me a better idea of what's projected to be in demand.
