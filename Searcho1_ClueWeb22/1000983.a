As an HR professional, I've noticed a significant shift in how we approach employee development over the past few years, especially with the rise of virtual training methods and technology. I need to understand how these changes have impacted HR's role in employee development. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should define what virtual training methods and technology entail. Virtual training likely includes online courses, webinars, e-learning platforms, and maybe even virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) experiences for training. Technology in this context could also involve learning management systems (LMS), artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized learning paths, and mobile learning applications.

Now, considering HR's traditional role in employee development, it typically involves designing training programs, ensuring compliance with regulations, facilitating career growth, and measuring the effectiveness of development initiatives. With the introduction of virtual training and advanced technology, I suspect that HR's role has evolved in several ways.

Let me consider the benefits of virtual training. It's often more accessible, as employees can participate from anywhere at any time, which is particularly useful for remote workers or those with flexible schedules. It can also be more cost-effective since there are fewer expenses related to physical facilities, travel, and materials. Additionally, virtual training can offer a wider variety of courses and resources, allowing for more personalized development paths.

Given these advantages, HR professionals might now focus more on curating and selecting the right virtual training resources for their employees. They may need to become more tech-savvy to effectively utilize LMS platforms and other digital tools. Moreover, with the abundance of online courses, HR might play a greater role in ensuring that the training selected aligns with the organization's goals and develops the skills that are most needed.

Another aspect is the measurement of training effectiveness. With data analytics embedded in many e-learning platforms, HR can now track employee progress more closely, identify knowledge gaps, and adjust training programs accordingly. This data-driven approach allows for continuous improvement in employee development strategies.

On the other hand, virtual training might present some challenges. For instance, maintaining employee engagement can be harder in an online environment compared to in-person sessions. HR may need to find creative ways to keep employees motivated and ensure they are retaining the information presented. Additionally, not all employees may have equal access to the technology required for virtual training, which could lead to inequities in development opportunities.

Furthermore, the role of HR in facilitating mentorship and leadership development might change with virtual methods. While virtual mentoring is possible through video calls and online platforms, it may not fully replicate the benefits of in-person interactions. HR may need to find ways to supplement virtual training with other development activities to foster holistic growth.

I also think about the impact on HR's time and resources. While virtual training can save costs in some areas, it may require more effort in others, such as managing online platforms, providing technical support, and ensuring that all employees are comfortable using the technology.

Let me see if I can find some research or articles that discuss this topic in more detail. Maybe there are specific studies or industry reports that can provide insights into how HR roles have changed due to virtual training technologies.

The Benefits Of Virtual Employee Training
2nd Jun 2015
In the world of business, expeditiousness is the key to staying ahead of the competition. This rule applies to everything from manufacturing to training. In respect to swift training for HR departments, virtual training capabilities are giving businesses the advantage. Through the use of training portals and classrooms, your HR struggles of maintaining efficiency with employee training are dissolved.
Resolving issues of traditional classroom training
Before the explosion of digital technology, the only way to conduct employee training was to host classes, lectures and workshops for staff, in person. This required coordinating logistics and employees’ schedules and costs for renting or maintaining a separate area for training programs — viewed as a necessary evil.
Additionally, paying employees to leave the office in order to complete mandated training required extra work for HR through expense reporting and payroll calculation. Most mid- to large-size businesses would reimburse employees for transportation and meals while in training sessions.
HR struggled with keeping classes on track, up to date and in compliance with business needs. After all, to update a training program meant reprinting all training materials and retraining the person conducting the session. A simple change could not be made efficiently, forcing HR to wait until a major overhaul of a training program was permissible.
Solutions offered by virtual training services
Today, HR departments boost training abilities with the use of virtual training. Skip the logistics of finding a place to host a workshop, a move that also saves the company in rental fees or transportation expenses. Employees no longer have to leave the office to conduct training — thanks to virtual training portals.
Training programs can be updated efficiently, and training material costs of printing and distribution are slim to none. Employees can tackle training sessions at their convenience. This frees them to effectively organize the tasks they are hired to handle without disrupting their workweek with out-of-the-office training programs.
Staying in the office throughout the workday is the best way to conduct a business. The use of virtual training allows employees to take a training workshop within the comforts of their office, pausing the training as needed to handle daily office demands. Streamlining the training program through virtual training creates an even better expeditious business.
Increasing learner engagement
One of the biggest threats to the efficiency of in-person training is learner engagement, the ability to reach every person in a classroom setting. However, virtual training programs offer a bevy of tools targeted at a variety of learning styles. The learner can utilize the tools, such as video lectures or online quizzes, to help him/her remain attentive and engaged throughout a training session.
Given that every individual learns at his/her own pace, having virtual training allows employees to return to fuzzy topics for a refresher or pause for self-imposed breaks. This would not be possible in a traditional training session.
Virtual training programs are set up via content compression, which allows for a steady stream of valuable content to be passed to the trainee. Employees can cover the same topics as their colleagues, using tools to increase their engagement, in a much shorter time frame compared to the traditional training environment.
What to expect with virtual training platforms
When shopping for a virtual training platform for your HR needs, consider an all-inclusive platform. This will include everything you need to get your virtual employee training up and running with ease. Start by looking for technology that provides an instructor-led classroom, which allows you to create real-time training sessions via distance learning.
By way of technology, the training platform needs to provide power for both audio and visual needs. Look for state of the art high-definition, two-way capabilities that will work for the most demanding virtual learning labs. Unless you are high-tech savvy, you will want to choose a company that offers unlimited tech support from startup to routine maintenance. Also, search for a virtual training program that requires low levels of training for the students and the facilitators.
In terms of infrastructure, the cloud is the optimal method for transmitting and storing training materials. Opt for a secure and well-managed cloud computing system, and you will not have to house any hardware or software in office. Save on storage space and technology updating costs, while minimizing your IT department demands.

The High Impact of Digital Technologies on Employee Training
By Gerald Jackson - Published on January 17, 2018
Tags : Training eLearning
Modern training requires a new approach to learning and employee engagement.
How emerging digital technologies, such as social networks and virtual platforms, can serve your modern human resource management (HRM) training and development strategy.
Employee training and development remains a vital function of any HR department. Depending on the size and mission of a company, training can become a major concern as well. Questions regarding the training process, training and development methods, and material delivery become paramount in large corporations with hundreds of employees.
This article will cover how technology impacts your training and development processes, no matter what your company size. Whether its innovation in delivery, expanding continuing learning initiatives, or effectively providing training at high volumes, you must have a solid grasp on the use of technology in training and development.
The Use of Technology in Training and Development
Technological training methods continue to evolve. Even basic entry-level jobs have video packages and tests employees can take to learn the basics and demonstrate their knowledge. But what about large companies with complex or evolving job requirements and protocols? This is where modern technology shines.
For example, you might be familiar with online training modules and videos. These have become a standard part of many training methods in HRM for distance learning. Did you know that some companies are looking to go back to the days of in-class teaching? Classroom training is sometimes the best approach for learning complex information. New advances in training and development programs allow large companies to implement virtual classrooms that allow such training across multiple remote sites without loss in quality.
Another effective training and development strategy is simulation training, where employees work on seemingly real-life problems through virtual interfaces. With advancements in technology, training processes in HRM can incorporate simulation training remotely, sometimes on site (for example, through a computer at a point of sale in a retail environment) to give employees concrete, hands-on experience.
How Technology Changes Training in the Workplace
One big change to HR training and development in the workplace is that job education becomes more engaging and relevant for employees. With virtual training, access to classroom teaching, and more options for simulation or role-playing, employees can take advantage of a variety of learning methods that potentially match their learning styles.
For example, new advances in e-learning have emphasized “gamification,” or using gameplay concepts to encourage learning. And new advances in virtual and augmented reality are providing HRM specialists with new ways to present information and training materials to users, including classroom lectures and tests.
New technologies provide a positive impact on employment and development by providing a larger variety of options to reach employees. Young employees especially expect training that engages them in ways that help them learn more, and new technologies provide the training development environment that can match their learning style perfectly.
Improving Employee Engagement Through Technology
Your employee engagement is simply a way to ensure that your employees are emotionally invested in your company. Engagement not only helps to keep employees happy but helps them stay productive as well. The manner in which employees are trained plays a big part in the engagement process. Do they feel supported? Are they receiving the information they need to do their jobs? Are training processes interesting, interactive, and fun?
Modern technology can facilitate engagement in multiple ways. First, it provides the mix of approaches and learning styles that can keep an employee engaged and interested. A solid training and development program, using mixed learning styles and media, connects with employees in multiple ways so they get the most out of it.
Second, it improves the potential types of engagement you have with your employees by providing multiple, flexible feedback channels. Surveys, questionnaires, and performance data are all available through modern training technologies to help you better assess the needs of your employees. Furthermore, with the increasingly social nature of technology, you can communicate with employees during their training to help them retain and act on the information they receive.
Third, new technologies provide multiple ways to incorporate training into a group or workgroup style of organization. So, instead of simply providing basic training completed by an individual employee, you can also build team exercises that tie together remote participants, or leverage simulations to get trainees thinking and working through more collaborative means.
Training and development is not a one-stop shop for employee learning. With emerging social media technologies, VR and augmented reality platforms, and new responsive online interfaces, you can better engage your employees through cutting-edge training methods. This kind of training can improve employee engagement upon hiring or on an everyday basis. With staff training and development methods that engage different learning styles and media—and keeps things fun—your company will have a staff that is productive, well-educated, and invested in the future of your business.

Summary: Virtual Reality has applications that go beyond the world of gaming. In the HR realm, VR is proving to be an effective solution to some of its toughest challenges. Are you thinking about adopting VR into your HR solutions? In this article, learn 5 ways that VR training can improve your HR endeavors.
Virtual Reality Training: 5 Benefits HR Managers Need To Know
HR professionals are incorporating Virtual Reality (VR) into many facets of their work—from recruitment and hiring to onboarding and Learning and Development. It has been conservatively predicted that 1 in every 3 businesses will be using Virtual Reality training by 2021, with some estimates even reaching a 50% adoption rate. Virtual Reality training has an expansive potential to enhance HR processes. Here are just a few of the many ways:

1. VR Trains More Effectively Than Video Or Text-Based Materials
VR has been proven to successfully teach a wide range of topics vastly ranging in complexity—from surgery to making a burger to handling dangerous chemicals. All training programs share a common goal: to create the desired change in behavior. The key to creating that change is providing training in a way that makes a lasting impression. In a recent study, participants experienced either a 360-degree VR video or a 2D video of a motorcycle ride. Two days later, the participants completed a memory test in which the VR group recalled twice as much information about the ride than the video group. In exploring the participants' experiences, researchers found that VR created memories that felt like something that actually happened to them (referred to as an autobiographical associative network), while video creates a memory of something that happened to someone else (termed an isolated episodic event). VR experiences become a part of a person’s collective memory, while videos create an isolated episodic event that has been proven to be far less impactful. Experts agree that VR creates a strong emotional reaction, thus creating a stronger memory. A joint YuMe/Nielsen study found that VR creates emotionally engaging experiences. They compared VR, 2D, and 360-video on a flat surface. It was found that VR received a 17% higher emotional reaction than 360-video and a 27% higher reaction than 2D.
2. Safely Train Employees For Dangerous And Stressful Situations
Keeping employees safe is every company’s primary duty, but traditional training methods are limited to theory when addressing workplace safety. Virtual Reality training gives participants the opportunity to learn in a virtual work environment and see simulated realistic consequences when a mistake occurs. The aviation and healthcare industries were among the first to adopt VR in training, and given the high stakes associated with even routine mistakes in these fields, it was a logical application of the technology. Workplace hazards are not confined to these fields, however. Workplace hazards occur in just about every sector of the workforce. The type of scenarios that adequately demonstrate safety issues are nearly impossible to create by using a textbook or even a classroom, and live training is expensive. Exposure to tough and atypical scenarios that Virtual Reality training can provide forces a learner to refine their reasoning and become good decision makers under stressful situations. NORCAT, a company that provides skilled labor training, uses Virtual Reality training for job roles involving dangerous situations and equipment. Among their catalog of training, they offer a multi-player VR simulation in which teammates perform life-saving measures inside of mine conditions. It is next to impossible to train in actual mine rescue situations, which only come into existence in the face of a disaster or unexpected situations and have life-threatening implications. Participants in the simulation must factor components like engineering specifications, oxygen, and timelines as they work together to perform the rescue. The participants of this training leave the exercise with deeply ingrained, life-saving knowledge that could not happen without the use of VR.
3. Employees See VR As A Benefit
Employees see a company’s adoption of VR as evidence that they are working with a company committed to innovation. This proves to be especially true among Millennials, who tend to be less interested in routine work than prior generations. When a company utilizes VR, they change the perception of even a low-level job to be viewed as working for a forward-thinking technology company. VR increases employee engagement and satisfaction when it helps them to improve quickly and make their jobs easier. The fast-food chain, KFC, has implemented a VR escape room training game titled The Hard Way that teaches new employees chicken-frying basics in 10 minutes. The game proved to be both fun and effective, decreasing the time it takes to master the process by over 50%. Even more importantly, the employees have reported that training via VR makes them see their job in a more positive light.
4. VR Training Lowers Employee Turnover
Feeling ill-prepared is among the top reasons that employees say they have quit a job. If an employee doesn’t feel adequately trained, they are very likely to seek employment elsewhere. It is important to build training programs that instill confidence in employees from the start.
The restaurant chain, Honeygrow, provides all new employees with two VR experiences—a tour of their restaurants and a food-safety game, within the first 2 days of training. These realistic activities created an understanding of expectations from both sides—presenting the restaurant’s expectations of the employee as well as giving the employee concrete insight into the role they are preparing for. Employees appreciated the foundational training they received in the supportive VR environment and reported feeling as increased excitement about their new career as they advanced in their training. The restaurant has increased employee retention since the roll-out of the program, and VR helps set the restaurant apart from other brands.
5. Get More Out Of Your Candidate Screening Process
Virtual Reality training can provide an opportunity for hiring teams to see candidates perform in the role they are seeking to fill before any decisions are made. By providing a controlled environment for a candidate to showcase their capabilities, measurable metrics are produced that aid in hiring decisions. This data provides a picture of a candidate’s capabilities, and this extends well beyond a resume or first impression.
Jaguar has implemented this strategy of gateway candidate testing via a free mixed reality app that invites candidates to learn about electric vehicles and play code-breaking puzzles. According to Jaguar, it attracts candidates that have an aptitude for problem-solving skills, and those that perform exceptionally well are accelerated through the hiring process.
From the candidate’s perspective, VR offers opportunities for them to explore a position and company more closely to be sure it is a good fit. Deutsche Bahn encountered a need to attract new employees due in part to a large percentage of their current workforce nearing retirement. The company began taking VR headsets to career fairs that gave potential candidates a virtual experience of their available positions. By using VR, the company began receiving not only higher-quality applicants from career fairs, but also at a rate 10 times higher than their previous hiring efforts.
With these benefits in mind, it is evident that implementing Virtual Reality training into your HR developments can bring many new opportunities for your business.

4 Ways Virtual Reality Training (VR) Changes L&D
By John-Carlos (JC) Lozano
November 27, 2018
7 minutes to read
Comments: 1
Summary: Virtual Reality training (VR) has been shaping how we learn and how we design so that others can learn, for decades. And the future looks even more virtual. Find out how Virtual Reality will continue to transform the L&D field.
Virtual Reality Training: How It Affects L&D
Virtual Reality (VR) training is taking the Learning and Development (L&D) industry by storm. Instructional Designers across the globe are in awe, delighted by the possibilities that VR offers. Each day, more and more learners get to experience strapping on a VR helmet and losing themselves in a memorable virtual environment.
Do a quick Google search of "Virtual Reality training (VR)", and you’ll find dozens of articles calling it "the future of L&D". It could be argued, however, that this description is not entirely accurate. The fact is, VR training has been a big part of L&D for quite a while, and it’s been changing the field for years.
"I think VR training is a learning modality, not the only one. It certainly is one of the most impressive I’ve ever seen, though", says Mary Gannon, Ph.D., Senior Learning Strategist at SweetRush. "I’ve never witnessed any other technology as effective and immersive as this. It may not be the future of L&D, but it’s a big part of it."
It’s true. VR training is changing the way we learn and the way we design learning, for the better. VR has been transforming learning since its inception and will likely continue to do so for years to come. VR has changed the past, is changing the present, and will change the future.

The question is, then, how is it changing it? How is VR training transforming the way we develop training and learning programs?
Here are 4 possible answers:
1. VR Immerses Learners In The Training
In "The WIRED Guide to Virtual Reality", Peter Rubin defines VR as "a technology by which computer-aided stimuli create the immersive illusion of being somewhere else". [1] That immersive illusion is, perhaps, VR’s greatest strength.
No other medium can give users the feeling of "being there" better than VR can, and that makes VR training such an exciting tool for workplace learning. No other training modality can provide the immersive experience: VR fully captures learners’ attention and, in doing so, boosts their retention of information.
"When you use VR, you only see the virtual world", Gannon says. "You don’t see emails coming in, you don’t see instant messages, you don’t hear people talking behind you. VR lessens distractions."
2. VR Teaches Skills Through Simulation
Back in 1966, professor Thomas A. Furness III developed the first visual flight simulator, which was used to train US Air Force pilots. This was the very first step into VR training.
According to Daniel Fraga and Christophe Mallet, both of the immersive tech agency Somewhere Else, "[Furness] built head-mounted displays so that trainees could experience real-world scenarios too costly or dangerous to recreate in reality. Pilots repeated key tasks and learned incident management tactics in simulated conditions". [2]
For a technology that is often seen as futuristic, 1966 seems like ancient history. But many learning elements of that primitive simulator still hold true.
"VR transports learners to a different world, and it allows people to do something that might be too dangerous, too expensive, or too difficult to repeat in real life", says Justin Mitchell, a Creative Engineer at SweetRush.
And regardless of how "dangerous" or "difficult" the VR training scenario is, learners will likely develop physical memory and retain new information through the repetition of practical skills.
"People feel like they’re really there and they’re really doing it", Gannon says, adding that the more a course mirrors a learner’s work environment, the stronger the recall that course will have.
With VR, people can receive firsthand skills training on demand and on location. In this way, VR training can reduce costs and risks for companies and learners.
3. With VR, Learners Acquire Knowledge Through Interaction
In an article published by Training Industry, W. Todd Maddox, Ph.D., says that training’s true goal is retention: "The brain is hardwired to forget. For training to be retained and guide long-term behavior, it must be stored in long-term memory." [3]
Related to this line of thinking is the Cone of Experience theory, developed by Professor Edgar Dale in 1969. Dale argued that the medium in which we learn is intricately related to how much we retain: We remember 10% of what we read and 20% of what we hear. Yet we remember 90% of what we do. [4]
As you can probably conclude, VR training has a huge advantage over other training methods. This modality allows learners to interact with a spatial representation of the information they’re receiving. Instead of just reading about an experience, learners can live that experience in a controlled environment.
"In VR, learners acquire knowledge through interaction", Gannon says. "It is as close to being in the real world, having a firsthand experience, as we can possibly do."
The numbers support this claim. Researchers in the University for Maryland performed a memory test on a group of people using VR and compared their results to those of a group that used a two-dimensional display on a personal computer. 40% of the participants who used VR scored at least 10% higher in recall ability than the participants who used the PC. [5]
4. VR Training Can Alter Behaviors And Create Empathy
There’s a song by Depeche Mode that goes: "If you try walking in my shoes, you’ll stumble in my footsteps." Back in 1993, when Martin Gore wrote it, walking in someone else’s shoes was nothing more than a metaphor. Today, things are a bit different.
Thanks to VR, we can simulate another person’s experience. You can experience what it’s like to do what that person does, or you can see how others interact with that person in any given environment.
"In the latest wave of VR training, the service industry has started training retail, customer service, and insurance staff with basic social simulations," Fraga and Mallet write. [2]
SweetRush recently partnered with Hilton to create a VR training program that allows learners to experience working in a hotel and dealing with the physical challenges and complex tasks that Hilton employees face every day.
And not only can behavior-altering VR training create empathy for service industry workers, but it also can address larger societal issues, such as discrimination and bias.
"Imagine strapping on a VR headset and suddenly not being able to hear all that well while someone interacts with you. That can give you a pretty good idea of what it’s like every day for people with hearing disabilities", Gannon says. "Imagine a simulation in which you are a person of color, and a police officer approaches you unfairly, thus making you understand firsthand what racial bias is like".
Through simulation, interaction, and immersion, VR can challenge our understanding of the world and make us more empathetic.
***
We’ve come a long way since 1966. VR has since transformed the field of L&D, and it continues to do so. As Gannon says, "VR may not be the only future, but it is definitely a path that will continue to take us forward".
Download the eBook Top Emerging Technology Trends And Their Impact On L&D to see how the emergence of virtual reality and augmented reality can open up new ways of working for L&D professionals. Learn why they are new powerful tools in teaching and affecting behavioral change and how they can help you achieve your business objectives.

Five Ways HR Plays a Role in Employee Training & Development
Make Sure All Training Materials Are Provided
Facilitate Meetings Between Company Leaders and Employees
Help Employees Apply for Open Positions Within the Company
Keep up With Training & Development Trends
Encourage the use of employee development plans
The Value of having HR Involved in Employee Training & Development
Highly engaged employees are usually the most productive, positive, dedicated ones. They’re willing to go above and beyond their job expectations and immerse themselves in achieving company goals. They also display deep loyalty to the companies they work for so long as they’re being provided what they need to be happy at the workplace.
One of those workplace needs revolves around being challenged and nurtured into the highest version of self. The top talent in your industry is primarily attracted to employee development and training initiatives. They’re insistent about adding value to their respective roles and the company culture by constantly growing personally and professionally.
Let’s explore your role in facilitating employee development and training and why your involvement in these aspects is valuable.
Five Ways HR Plays a Role in Employee Training & Development
A survey found that “only 29% of employees are ‘very satisfied’ with their available career advancement opportunities. 41% marked those opportunities as ‘very important’ when it comes to job satisfaction, engagement, motivation, and employee retention.”
This means that the right opportunities for career growth can keep employees at your company longer, motivate them to perform at a high level, productively engage them, and keep them satisfied with their role.
Here are five ways you can deepen your influence in employee training and development.
Make sure all training materials are provided
Not having what you need to complete training can take the air right out of the development balloon. One way to positively influence employee training and development is to ensure that everyone receives the training materials they need on time.
For example, if your company uses virtual or e-learning services for its training or development activities, make sure that your employees are briefed on how to use these services responsibly. Give them information on browser security, privacy measures, and how to use the system. You could also make sure their training schedule is set and that they have a quiet workspace to ensure a productive e-learning training experience.
Audit your training materials. Make sure they’re the most current and safely discard those that aren’t. You could also make sure any software, technology, or services used for training is up to date and in top condition. Keep track of everyone who is training and check in with them throughout the process to make sure they have everything they need.
Employee-Centric Engagement, Internal
Communications, and Recognition
Start Free Trial
Facilitate meetings between company leaders and employees
HR professionals are often labeled as the bridge between leaders and workers. It’s not often that company leaders interact with those on the frontline of their companies and vice versa. But for training and development to be successful, company leaders and employees need to work together .
You should be scheduling and facilitating regular meetings between company leaders and employees. These meetings could be between managers and workers, CEOs and managers, even shareholders and top-performing employees. It’s highly beneficial for company leaders to hear what employees need in training and development straight from their mouths.
You may not be asked to lead or attend the meeting, but ensure you’re reaching out to company leaders to connect with employees on the frontlines. Offer to set up these meetings, send out emails regarding the request for them, or take notes on behalf of an attendee. Ensure you’re also responding promptly to company leaders that reach out to you with requests for information.
Help employees apply for open positions within the company
When an employee expresses interest in moving up in the company, it’s best to work with them immediately. This helps ensure they don’t look elsewhere for a higher position or feel devalued because they didn’t receive any guidance on moving forward with this request. Be intentional about helping employees apply for open jobs within the company.
Not all employees express their interest in moving up in a company out loud. But for the ones that do, you can work with their managers to see how to best support them in their next steps. This could mean sending them information on what to do if they’re applying for a position internally and how to fill out an application as an existing employee.
It could also mean offering any resources on bettering their resume by effectively showcasing the hard, soft, and transferable skills learned through their current position. Any classes, resources, or events on how to write a cover letter or brush up on interview skills would be suitable to share as well.
Keep up with training & development trends
Each business owner, manager, employee, and so on have their unique strategies for successful employee training and development. We’re able to draw from a massive pool of thoughts, methods, techniques, and plans that influence training and development. Because workplace culture is changing so rapidly, it’s essential to keep up with training and development trends.
For example, one trend that’s surfaced is personalizing the training and development process to each employee. Personalizing the training process is highly dependent on understanding the way each employee learns. Whether they’re self-directed learners who would instead plan, carry out, and evaluate their learning experiences or experiential learners who lean on their own experiences to understand the information at hand, you should construct an individualized training program based on this information.
Ensure that you’re using all of your platforms to stay engaged with training and development trends. When new concepts, programs, or solutions are introduced that could better your company’s efforts, share them with leadership and push to explore them fully.
Encourage the use of employee development plans
We’re getting further and further away from the days of training in groups and offering employees “one-size-fits-all” development methods. Each employee has their individual career goals, thoughts on where they feel they can make the best impact, strengths, weaknesses, and potential. Creating a detailed employee development plan can honor the individuality in your workforce.
An overall professional development plan that details how your company is committed to providing opportunities that meet your employees’ aspirations, long-term strategy, growth goals, and leadership training is essential. Using employee-specific development plans is an excellent strategy to ensure each person is being supported based on their individual needs.
If employee development plans aren’t being used in your company, encourage leaders to begin implementing them. If they are being used, ensure that managers and employees create them together and follow along with steps laid out. Ensure you also can explain your company’s overall commitment to nurturing employees to new levels in their careers.

Alright, so I have this question: "How have virtual training methods and technology impacted HR's role in employee development?" Okay, let's see. I need to think about this step by step.

First off, I need to understand what virtual training methods and technology are. From what I gather, virtual training includes things like online courses, webinars, e-learning platforms, maybe even virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) for training purposes. Technology in this context probably also includes learning management systems (LMS), artificial intelligence for personalized learning paths, and mobile learning apps.

Now, traditionally, HR's role in employee development involved designing training programs, ensuring compliance with regulations, facilitating career growth, and measuring the effectiveness of development initiatives. With the advent of virtual training and advanced technology, I suspect that HR's role has evolved significantly.

Let me consider the benefits of virtual training. It's more accessible; employees can participate from anywhere at any time, which is great, especially for remote workers or those with flexible schedules. It's also often more cost-effective since there are fewer expenses related to physical facilities, travel, and materials. Additionally, virtual training can offer a wider variety of courses and resources, allowing for more personalized development paths.

Given these advantages, HR professionals might now focus more on curating and selecting the right virtual training resources for their employees. They may need to become more tech-savvy to effectively utilize LMS platforms and other digital tools. Moreover, with so many online courses available, HR needs to ensure that the training selected aligns with the organization's goals and develops the skills that are most needed.

Another aspect is measuring the effectiveness of training. With data analytics embedded in many e-learning platforms, HR can now track employee progress more closely, identify knowledge gaps, and adjust training programs accordingly. This data-driven approach allows for continuous improvement in employee development strategies.

However, there are also challenges. Maintaining employee engagement can be harder in an online environment compared to in-person sessions. HR may need to find creative ways to keep employees motivated and ensure they are retaining the information presented. Additionally, not all employees may have equal access to the technology required for virtual training, which could lead to inequities in development opportunities.

Furthermore, the role of HR in facilitating mentorship and leadership development might change with virtual methods. While virtual mentoring is possible through video calls and online platforms, it may not fully replicate the benefits of in-person interactions. HR may need to find ways to supplement virtual training with other development activities to foster holistic growth.

I also think about the impact on HR's time and resources. While virtual training can save costs in some areas, it may require more effort in others, such as managing online platforms, providing technical support, and ensuring that all employees are comfortable using the technology.

Let me see if I can find some research or articles that discuss this topic in more detail. Maybe there are specific studies or industry reports that can provide insights into how HR roles have changed due to virtual training technologies.
