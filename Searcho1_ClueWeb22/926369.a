So I've got this question about how managers can plan effectively when the external environment is always changing. Hmm, planning is important for any organization, but when things are constantly shifting outside, it must be tough to make solid plans. I need to think about what strategies managers can use to handle this.

First off, I should probably understand what constitutes the external environment. I think it includes things like market trends, competition, economic conditions, regulations, and maybe even social and political factors. All these elements can change rapidly, and managers need to adapt their plans accordingly.

I recall that in management studies, there's something called environmental scanning. That's where managers monitor the external environment to anticipate changes and trends. So, perhaps one way to plan effectively is to invest more in environmental scanning. By staying informed about what's happening outside the organization, managers can adjust their plans proactively rather than reactively.

Another concept that comes to mind is scenario planning. This involves creating different possible futures based on various assumptions and then planning for each scenario. It helps managers prepare for a range of possibilities and make their plans more flexible. Maybe incorporating scenario planning into the managerial planning process could be beneficial in a dynamic external environment.

Also, I think flexibility and agility are key in such situations. Managers need to be able to pivot quickly when necessary. Perhaps adopting a more agile approach to planning, similar to Agile methodologies in project management, could be useful. Instead of sticking to a rigid plan, managers could break down their plans into smaller, manageable parts and review and adjust them regularly based on current conditions.

Moreover, involving more people in the planning process might help. By getting input from various stakeholders, including employees, customers, and partners, managers can gain a broader perspective on potential changes and incorporate that feedback into their plans. This collaborative approach could lead to more robust and adaptable plans.

I should also consider the role of technology in planning. With advances in data analytics and artificial intelligence, managers have access to more data and predictive tools than ever before. Utilizing these tools to analyze trends and make forecasts could enhance the accuracy of their plans despite external changes.

Another aspect is risk management. Identifying potential risks and having contingency plans in place can help managers mitigate the impacts of unexpected changes in the external environment. So, integrating risk management into the planning process is probably crucial.

Perhaps setting short-term goals along with long-term objectives would be wise. This way, even if the external environment changes significantly over time, the organization can achieve its immediate goals and stay on track towards its overall vision.

I should think about real-world examples too. Are there companies that are particularly good at planning in volatile environments? Like tech companies that have to adapt to rapid technological changes. Maybe studying their strategies could provide some insights.

Wait, maybe I should look up some management theories on this topic. There might be specific approaches or models that address planning in dynamic environments. For example, I've heard of strategic management frameworks that emphasize adaptability and responsiveness.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the concept of dynamic capabilities. That's when organizations have the ability to adapt and reconfigure their resources in response to environmental changes. Developing dynamic capabilities could enable managers to plan more effectively in fluctuating external conditions.

It might also be useful to think about the time horizon for planning. In a stable environment, longer-term plans may be more feasible, but in a changing environment, shorter planning horizons might be more appropriate. Managers could focus on immediate and midterm goals while keeping an eye on long-term objectives.

Furthermore, continuous learning and improvement within the organization can help managers stay ahead of external changes. Encouraging a culture of learning and innovation can make the organization more resilient and better equipped to handle unforeseen challenges.

I should probably organize my thoughts and see if I can summarize some key strategies for managers to plan effectively in changing external environments. Let me list them out:

1. Environmental scanning: Monitor external factors to anticipate changes and trends.

2. Scenario planning: Prepare for different possible futures to make plans more flexible.

3. Agility and flexibility: Adopt agile approaches to planning and be ready to adjust plans as needed.

4. Collaborative planning: Involve various stakeholders to gain diverse perspectives.

5. Leverage technology: Use data analytics and AI to inform planning and forecasting.

6. Risk management: Identify risks and have contingency plans in place.

7. Set short-term and long-term goals: Balance immediate achievements with overall vision.

8. Develop dynamic capabilities: Enhance the organization's ability to adapt and reconfigure resources.

9. Adjust planning horizons: Focus on shorter-term planning in volatile environments.

10. Foster a learning culture: Encourage continuous learning and innovation within the organization.

This seems like a comprehensive list. Maybe I can group these strategies into broader categories to make it easier to understand.

First category: Information gathering and analysis

- Environmental scanning

- Leverage technology (data analytics, AI)

Second category: Planning approaches

- Scenario planning

- Agile planning methods

- Setting short-term and long-term goals

Third category: Organizational capabilities

- Agility and flexibility

- Dynamic capabilities

- Risk management

Fourth category: Stakeholder engagement

- Collaborative planning

Fifth category: Organizational culture

- Foster a learning culture

By categorizing them this way, it's clearer how these strategies interrelate and support effective planning in changing external environments.

I should also consider potential challenges managers might face when implementing these strategies. For example, environmental scanning can be time-consuming and require significant resources. Similarly, adopting agile planning methods might necessitate a cultural shift within the organization, which can be difficult to achieve.

Managers also need to strike a balance between being adaptable and maintaining focus on long-term goals. Too much flexibility could lead to lack of direction, while too much rigidity could make the organization inflexible in the face of change.

Additionally, in a rapidly changing environment, predictions and forecasts may be less accurate, which could make planning more uncertain. Managers need to be comfortable with a certain level of uncertainty and be prepared to make decisions with incomplete information.

Perhaps another strategy is to build resilience into the organization. This means creating buffers and redundancies that can absorb shocks from external changes without derailing the organization's plans.

For instance, maintaining financial reserves, having diverse supplier relationships, or developing versatile products that can adapt to changing customer needs are all ways to build resilience.

Moreover, managers could focus on building strong relationships with stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, and partners. These relationships can provide valuable insights into external changes and may offer support during turbulent times.

Communication is also crucial. In a changing environment, clear and timely communication within the organization can help align everyone's efforts and ensure that everyone is aware of any adjustments to the plan.

I should also consider the human aspect. Change can be stressful for employees, so managers need to manage change effectively, providing support and training to help employees adapt to new circumstances.

Maybe including change management as part of the planning process would be beneficial. By anticipating potential resistances and planning how to overcome them, managers can smooth the transition when changes occur.

Another point is to encourage experimentation and acceptance of failures. In a dynamic environment, not every plan will succeed, and managers need to create an environment where controlled experiments can be conducted, and lessons can be learned from failures without severe penalties.

This fosters innovation and helps the organization stay ahead of changes.

I should probably look up some academic resources or articles on this topic to see what experts recommend. Maybe there are specific frameworks or models that managers can use to plan effectively in changing external environments.

Let me try to search for some information.

Strategic Planning in Unstable
Environments
Peter Brews and Devavrat Purohit




This article draws from a multinational survey of 886 firms to show that as environmental
instability increases so does planning. However, certain planning dimensions are more
strongly associated with environmental instability: in particular generative planning and
transactive planning. The two other planning dimensions e Symbolic and Rational Plan-
ning e are more strongly associated with firm size than with environmental instability.
Planning dimensions might therefore serve different purposes. The implications for man-
agers and academicians, and a case study illustrating how they are being implemented at
General Electric in the US, conclude the article.

Introduction
Ask managers about the state of their competitive environment and most will confirm that prod-
uct life cycles are shortening, technology is changing faster and faster, customers are becoming
more demanding and competition is intensifying. Simply put, environments are not getting
more stable or any easier to compete in, and therefore an important question is how should
planning adjust in the face of these more challenging contexts? This article sheds light on this
question. Strategic planning is decomposed into four dimensions and the effect of environmental
instability on each is tested. To identify factors other than environment that explain differences in
firm-level planning we also find that planning duration, planning decentralisation and firm size
can have an impact. How each planning dimension correlates with firm performance is also
explored, and the article concludes with implications for managers and suggestions for further
research. Finally, to provide insights into how some of our findings are being implemented,
we report on some recent changes at General Electric (GE), one of the world’s best-managed
companies.
   Our findings are important to managers for many reasons. We show that planning increases as
environmental instability grows. However, we also show that factors within management’s control
(the extent of time that planning has been underway and the decentralisation of planning) are str-
onger at explaining increases in planning than external environmental conditions. Further, two

fplanning dimensions in particular are strongly associated with environmental instability (Generative
and Transactive Planning), indicating that of the four dimensions these are the most sensitive to
environmental instability. In addition, Firm Size more strongly associates with the other two plan-
ning dimensions (Symbolic and Rational Planning), suggesting that these dimensions are better at
providing structure and stability as firms grow than they are as tools to deal with environmental
instability. Planning dimensions might thus serve different purposes. Finally, we find that three
planning dimensions associate with improved performance. Unexpectedly Symbolic Planning
does not.
   Some early clarification is warranted. We do not investigate planning capabilities per se directly but
only whether planning increases/decreases as environmental instability, planning decentralisation,
firm size etc. change, and then whether better performance is associated with increases in planning
levels. Though the positive planning/performance correlations do indicate superior performance is
associated with higher planning levels, whether the planning of our sample firms correspond to the
highest standards of planning is not evaluated. Nevertheless, that an improvement in the levels of three
planning dimensions associates with enhanced organisational performance suggests these are behav-
iours adopted by high-performing firms in unstable environments, regardless of the absolute levels of
planning noted among our sample.


Strategic planning and environment
Though planning is unequally distributed across firms, the reasons for this remain mostly un-
known.1 Environment has long been suggested as a moderator of planning, but initially its role
was controversial: early studies rejected formal planning in favour of incrementalism in unstable
environments, and concluded that environment moderated the type of planning that firms should
conduct: in stable contexts formal planning was recommended; in unstable contexts incremen-
talism was preferred.2 More recent studies found both formal and incremental planning present
in unstable environments, and provided evidence to reject the hypothesis that environment
moderates planning type on an either/or basis. An alternative hypothesis that planning in un-
stable environments includes both formal and incremental planning, and possibly other types
of planning too, was thus supported.3 To test this proposition we measured four dimensions
of planning and investigated how environmental instability impacted each. Our hunch was
that in stable environments less planning would be observed, and that in unstable environments
the opposite is true: more planning across multiple dimensions would be noted. Our findings
show this to be so.
   Below we explain how our four dimensions originated and why each should positively associate
with performance. Study methodology, results and limitations follow, and GE’s planning changes
implemented over the past few years and the study’s implications for managers and academicians
conclude the article.


Strategic planning dimensions
Conventional wisdom now accepts strategy formation involves a complex and diverse set of
processes that incorporate a wide range of organisational behaviours and capabilities. Contradic-
tory and paradoxical organisational competences are involved: broad vision and attention to de-
tail; bold moves and incremental adjustment; decisiveness and reflection.4 Hart captured this
complexity in five modes, each representing unique elements of strategy formation.5 Our mul-
tidimensional conceptualisation of strategic planning was based on this framework, but with
amendment.
   Hart’s strategy-making modes were reconceptualised into strategic planning dimensions owing to
the composition of Hart’s framework and measurement protocols.6 Though purporting to model
strategy formation, only one of Hart’s five modes (the Rational Mode) directly measured planning,
and his Generative Mode fell outside the ambit of planning altogether. Hart’s Generative Mode was

Long Range Planning, vol 40   2007                                                                    65
fdependent on autonomous employee initiative occurring outside the strictures of planning. Idio-
syncratic experimentation in ‘‘skunk works’’ units e developers who are separated from the rest
of the corporation to work on special projects e was considered the driver of innovation. More-
over, two of the remaining three modes (Command and Symbolic) measured CEO behaviours
and top management aspirations regarding new goals and dreams, while the Transactive Mode,
though endeavouring to capture the iterative nature of planning, failed to specify whether strategy
‘‘that is made on an iterative basis’’ is done so through planning or through other unspecified pro-
cesses. This mode also included whether ‘‘people have input into decisions that affect them,’’ thus
embodying a construct potentially unrelated to strategic planning. As our construct of interest was
firm-level planning, we measured the extent to which planning was symbolic, rational, transactive
and generative.
   Strategic planning was thus evaluated across four dimensions: whether plans contained a compel-
ling, long-term, enterprise-wide vision/mission (Symbolic Planning); whether plans were formally
constructed and comprehensive in their formulation of specific goals/objectives, action plans/
programmes and budget-based implementation routines (Rational Planning); whether plans were
formed iteratively and on an ongoing basis, based on continual adaptation and market feedback
(Transactive Planning); and whether plans encouraged innovation (Generative Planning). Exhibit 1
outlines what each dimension represents and communicates the role each plays in the strategy for-
mation process.

f   The four planning dimensions provide a more fine-grained coverage of planning processes and
outputs than ever captured in a single study, and this diversity underscores that planning goes
beyond formal versus incremental planning and includes planning that promotes or encourages
innovation, as well as processes that make planning adaptive, iterative and flexible. However, the
only planning dimension that has not been explicitly investigated before is Generative Planning;
this dimension was included because, unlike Hart, we did not believe generative processes only
took place outside the domain of planning. Here we make a threefold contribution: first, we inves-
tigate whether planning that encourages innovation is present in practice; second, we explore
whether increases in Generative Planning associate with increases in environmental instability;
and third, we investigate the performance effects of Generative Planning.
   Finally, our multidimensional conceptualisation of planning also provides the means to capture
both planning content and process when evaluating planning regimes. Symbolic and Generative
Planning underscore planning’s visionary and innovative content, while Transactive Planning
captures planning’s incremental/iterative nature and indicates that in addition to being a force
for stability and control (a core function of Rational Planning, see Exhibit 1) plans should not
be considered fully formed once written but open to adaptation/change as implementation pro-
ceeds. The message here is that both the content of plans and the processes used to form and reform
plans are important. Moreover, measuring multiple dimensions of planning and comparing the
performance effects of these relative to each other, permits a more fine-grained analysis of plan-
ning’s performance effects.

Planning Dimensions and Performance
Early research mostly investigated the impact of formal planning (i.e. Rational Planning) on firm
performance. Though findings were initially controversial, decades of cumulative work identified
many methodological and substantive factors that explained the inconsistencies such that with
proper construct measurement and with the appropriate controls in place positive formal plan-
ning/performance relationships have been consistently noted.7 Moreover, Hart found high perfor-
mance was associated with multi-modal strategymaking capability; we expected planning
dimensions would relate similarly. Though extensive coverage of the literature relating to why
each planning dimension should positively associate with performance is unwarranted here, we
summarise below why a positive association between each planning dimension and firm perfor-
mance was expected.

Symbolic Planning and Performance
Symbolic Planning revolves around the presence of a mission/statement of strategic intent. Mission
statements have long been considered a vital first step in the strategic planning process, and most
texts on strategic planning make reference to their virtues while many studies attest to their positive
effects.8 Symbolic Planning was first thought to inform about an organisation’s ‘‘grand design’’ or
fundamental business purpose/mission, and later enactments alleged such planning would provide
vision/direction to organisations, even a sense of profound destiny. Finally, statements of strategic
intent were expected to revitalise corporate performance. Accordingly firms with missions and/or
statements of strategic intent were expected to outperform those without.

Rational Planning and Performance
Of all the dimensions Rational Planning (also known as formal planning or synoptic formalism) has
by far been the subject of deepest investigation. Though the path to our understanding of the for-
mal planning/performance relationship has had a rich and controversial history, recent studies con-
sistently report a positive formal planning/performance relationship.9 Essentially a deliberate and
linear process, Rational Planning facilitates precision in organisations by providing an ability to in-
tegrate business operations in a tightly coupled fashion. Detailed attention to objectives, operational
plans and budgets provide structure and control; we thus expected Rational Planning and firm per-
formance would positively correlate.

fTransactive Planning and Performance
Cognitive limits and ‘‘bounded rationality’’ render plans incomplete or miss-specified from incep-
tion, and organisations unable to adapt their plans as circumstances warrant are likely to encounter
difficulty during implementation.10 Moreover, organisational learning is considered by some as the
only sustainable competitive advantage, and processes that imbed or enable organisational learning
have the potential to remedy many of the shortcomings of rigid formal planning.11 Further, Hart
alleged transactive processes promote adaptability and facilitate learning instead of the pre-or-
dained implementation of inflexible plans; thus we expected Transactive Planning would positively
correlate with performance.


Organisational learning is considered by some as the only sustainable
competitive advantage
Generative Planning and Performance
The era of hyper competition requires the ongoing reinvention of products, services, processes,
firms and even industries through the implementation of non-linear ideas.12 Innovation is recog-
nised as a primary means of corporate renewal and product development and is described as a dy-
namic capability through which firms create, integrate, recombine and shed resources.13 Innovation
has long been considered fundamental to competitiveness; planning that seeks to encourage or
stimulate innovation must thus be valuable in environments becoming more competitive or unsta-
ble.14 Accordingly, firms promoting product, service or process innovation through planning
should outperform those that do not.

fOverall Research Model
Figure 1 details the research model guiding the study. Environment is specified as a key external
contingency that impacts the extent of firm level planning, but Firm Size, Planning Duration
and Planning Decentralisation are also suggested as internal organisational variables that influence
planning levels. Finally, planning is predicted to associate with firm performance. If the data sup-
ports the model’s specification our interpretation is that environmental conditions set up the need
for enhanced planning, while Firm Size, Planning Duration and Planning Decentralisation are three
organisational variables that impact development of the planning needed in the face of more de-
manding environments. Moreover, and presuming greater environmental instability requires
more planning, organisations with higher levels of planning should perform better.
   We must again underscore that it is likely that for organisational performance to be affected in
the way as specified in the model more than the level of planning should be controlled for. The
quality (as opposed to the quantity) of planning is also important. Possibly, an intermediary vari-
able capturing how planning activities become planning capabilities (which in turn contribute to
superior performance) should be included. This more fine-grained, two-stage model of how plan-
ning impacts performance (Planning behaviours /Planning capabilities / Firm performance) is
more detailed; however, such granularity was not necessary for the purposes of this study.15 As ac-
knowledged above, our study design presumes organisations displaying higher planning levels
would implicitly possess higher planning capabilities, which in turn would produce superior
performance.

Methodology
The study was executed in three steps. First, we investigated whether environmental instability as-
sociated with the four planning dimensions; second, we established how planning duration, plan-
ning decentralisation, and firm size associated with each dimension; and third, we tested the
performance effects of the planning dimensions. The Appendix explains how the key study variables
(Environmental Instability, Planning Dimensions and Firm Performance) and the three planning
predictor variables (Planning Duration, Planning Decentralisation, and Firm Size) were measured.
Details on the sample, respondent characteristics and the sampling procedures employed are also
provided.
  Because measuring environmental instability was an important task, respondents also provided
data on the industries their firms operated in. To validate our measure Environmental Instability
score means across 19 industry categories were compared. These varied widely; most importantly
industries expected to be stable were, as were those expected to be more unstable. Travel and Tour-
ism was the most stable industry in our sample (Environment Instability Score ¼ 35.50, all scores
obtained before any 911-volatility), followed by Pump Manufacturing (score ¼ 36.67) and Agricul-
ture and Farming (score ¼ 38.47). Most unstable was Telecommunications (score ¼ 52.50), fol-
lowed by Consulting Services (score ¼ 48.15) and Financial Services: banking (score ¼ 47.79).

Results
Multiple regressions tested the relationships under investigation and the impact of environment
and the three other planning predictor variables on planning dimension accumulation was assessed
in four models d to determine the effect of environment and the other planning predictors on
planning these four variables were regressed against each planning dimension individually. Then,
to ascertain the performance effects of planning, Firm Performance was simultaneously regressed
on the four dimensions. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations, while
Table 2 conveys in four models the regression results relating to how environment and the three
other planning level predictors associate with each planning dimension. A quadratic term was
included for Planning Duration (Planning Duration Squared) to control for potential non-linear
effects. Table 3 shows the performance effects of each planning dimension.
   As indicated in Table 2, a strong and significant positive environmental instability/planning di-
mension association is noted in every model. As environmental instability increases, planning

across all dimensions grow. However, and notwithstanding environments’ positive association with
each planning dimension, Planning Duration is the strongest planning dimension correlate of all
the predictor variables, though over time its effect is subject to diminishing returns. Thus, the re-
lationship between Planning Duration and planning dimensions is not linear; all planning dimen-
sions increase with respect to duration but eventually at a decreasing rate. Further, all the planning
decentralisation/dimension relationships but one (Symbolic Planning/Ends Decentralisation) are
positive and significant. Moreover, some of the planning predictor variables associate more strongly
with some planning dimensions than with others. Environmental instability more strongly associ-
ates with Transactive and Generative Planning; Planning Duration associates more strongly with
Rational and Transactive Planning; and Firm Size correlates most strongly with Symbolic and
Rational Planning, and only weakly with Generative Planning, and not at all with Transactive

Planning. Finally, and as seen from the range of R2s reported in Table 2, explanatory power differs
widely across the four models: the most Transactive and least Symbolic Planning variance is ex-
plained; the remaining two dimensions fall in between.
   With regard to the planning/performance associations, and as seen in Table 3, while Rational,
Transactive and Generative Planning positively associate with Firm Performance, unexpectedly
Symbolic Planning displays a negative association. In addition, the relative strengths of the dimen-
sion/performance associations are also of interest. Generative Planning exhibits the strongest per-
formance association followed closely by Transactive Planning. The Rational Planning/performance
association is the weakest positive association, and the Symbolic Planning/performance association,
though negative, is also the weakest of all the planning/performance associations. In the aggregate
the collectively positive performance effects of three of the planning dimensions far outweigh the
negative effect noted from Symbolic Planning. However the low R2 of Model V indicates that plan-
ning explains little of the variance in overall firm performance. This is typical for planning/perfor-
mance research: many factors other than planning explain overall firm performance and these are
not captured in this study. However, that planning in general positively correlates with performance
is important information, regardless of how much variance in performance it explains.

Study Limitations
Though providing many valuable findings, some study limitations must be acknowledged. First,
subjective perceptual data measure all study variables. This is most concerning with regard to
the measurement of planning dimensions, as prior research has indicated subjective measures of
environment and performance correlate with objective measures.16 While content analysis of exist-
ing planning documents or the actual observation of planning processes would potentially provide
more accurate measures of each dimension, such a methodology is impractical over such a large
sample. Moreover, the high internal consistency of all measures (seen in the Cronbach’s Alphas
in Table 1) attests to the internal validity of our multi-item measures. Second, the use of a single
instrument to collect all variables presents the threat of common method bias. To ensure our plan-
ning measures captured dimensions not related to a single underlying construct we tested two
structural equation models: a one-factor model where all measures loaded on to one latent variable;
and a four-factor model where all dimensions loaded on to four variables (Symbolic, Rational,
Transactive and Generative Planning). The one-factor model poorly represented the data, while
a four-factor model, though not perfect, provided a better fit.17 Finally, the use of regression to
identify relationships among data is also limited as regression shows correlation and not causation. Typically theory is relied upon to establish causality, and our findings support prior studies that
have noted the presence of both formal and incremental planning in the planning of firms

Long Range Planning, vol 40   2007                                                                   71
f(equivalent to Rational and Transactive Planning in this study), and some of our positive planning
dimensions/performance associations are consistent with theory and other study findings. Never-
theless, we still do not ‘‘prove’’ the relationships noted in our data.

Implications for Managers
A number of important managerial implications flow from our findings. First, in more unstable en-
vironments planning is more present, confirming planning is an important mechanism employed in
practice to deal with environmental instability. This study is based upon the notion that environ-
ment is a key contingency that moderates planning; our findings show this is indeed the case, but
possibly even more than was initially thought. That planning across every dimension increases
with environmental instability indicates that when the going gets tough, the tough go planning.
   Understanding why planning grows as environmental instability increases can best be explained
by considering the opposite question: why is less planning present in stable environments? Arguably
this is so because in stable environments there is less need for planning; either the status quo is suit-
able, or less adjustment (and therefore less planning) is required. It is only when environments be-
come unstable that the need for more (and better?) planning arises. Given our findings, firms
emerging from stable environments should be especially wary. As our data show that one outcome
of operating in stable contexts is less planning, the learning curve faced when more sophisticated
planning becomes necessary may be steep. This applies for example to firms emerging from regu-
lated environments, such as those in the airline, banking, telecommunications or utility businesses
after deregulation. However, and notwithstanding the initial disadvantages that firms operating in
more stable contexts might encounter, our study’s findings also show that the time devoted to plan-
ning and the decentralisation of planning (both within management’s control) rather than environ-
mental conditions (mostly beyond management’s control) are predictors of greater significance.
This is good news for managers: managerial/organisational actions trump environmental
determinism.


When the going gets tough, the tough go planning

   Second, our findings also give insight into the type of planning most relied upon in unstable con-
texts. Though planning aimed at developing high-level visions/missions (Symbolic Planning) and
planning that results in more specific and detailed goals with action plans/programmes that link
behaviours and outcomes in a tightly coupled fashion (Rational Planning) do increase with envi-
ronmental instability, processes that render planning more iterative and amenable to ongoing
incremental adjustment (Transactive Planning) and planning that stimulates innovation (Genera-
tive Planning) are the most sensitive to environmental instability. Moreover, that all four planning
dimensions are closely correlated (see Table 1) also indicates that these dimensions co-exist in the
planning regimes of firms. Finally, our findings also show that strategic planning goes beyond for-
mal planning processes to include procedures for adaptation, and procedures to establish the infra-
structure that stimulates innovation in a structured fashion. Apparently both adaptive flexibility
and innovation are present in the planning done in unstable environments; planning regimes
should seek to encourage both.
   The planning diversity we note in unstable environments should also make managers more aware
of the range of planning behaviours needed when environmental instability increases. Consistent
with theory that calls for a balancing of exploitation and exploration, evidence of both opera-
tional/implementation control (Rational Planning) and incremental adjustment (Transactive
Planning) as well as innovation (Generative Planning) is noted in the planning done in unstable
environments.18 Further, that environmental instability strongly associates with Transactive Plan-
ning (i.e. the need for planning to be adaptable and flexible) is logical and accords with those
who argue incremental planning is appropriate in unstable contexts.19

72                                                               Strategic Planning in Unstable Environments
f   Third, our findings empirically corroborate the thesis that effective planning requires a balancing
of opposing or paradoxical forces, e.g. the precision/specificity of Rational Planning coupled with
flexibility/adaptability in Transactive Planning and the innovation implied in Generative Planning.
Further, our data support a ‘‘planned emergence’’ model which holds that strategy formation is not
only about planned strategy (i.e. strategy reflected in a plan, or deliberate strategy) but also about
realised strategy (otherwise described as emergent strategy), which represents strategy different
from that which was initially planned and emerges from experience as the reality of implementation
and planned intent collide.20 The higher sensitivity of Transactive Planning to environmental insta-
bility when compared with Rational Planning indicates that an increase in emergent over deliberate
strategy is more likely in unstable environments.
   Moreover, as the performance effects of Generative and Transactive Planning exceed those of Ra-
tional Planning, organisations intent on improving their performance would do well to concentrate
on these dimensions. What is perhaps most surprising is that this is the first study to indicate that
Generative Planning does occur and display significant performance effects. However, caution is
warranted. We neither measure directly whether more innovation happens among our sample
nor do we determine precisely how innovation is actually managed at respondent firms. Our
data shows that if plans contain ends that require or encourage innovation, performance is en-
hanced. We can only assume that innovation is higher in firms with higher Generative Planning.
   Fourth, managers intent on implementing high-level missions/statements of strategic intent
should be wary. The unexpected Symbolic Planning/performance negative effect indicates not all
planning enhances performance. The symbolism captured in statements of mission/strategic intent
apparently detract from performance, and based on our findings the time devoted to high-level for-
mal missions/statements of strategic intent might be better devoted elsewhere. Fortunately, our neg-
ative Symbolic Planning/performance association is not unprecedented. Though a number of past
studies have noted the positive performance effects of missions, others have found the opposite.21
Even the usefulness of mission statements has been questioned on the grounds that they represent
either empty public relations exercises or pious platitudes developed ‘‘by semi-literate, underem-
ployed posers who should be given proper jobs requiring measurable results.’’22 Our findings
join the studies that have concluded that missions/statements of strategic intent do more harm
than good.
   However, the baby must not be thrown out with the bath water. Hart and Banbury measured the
Symbolic Mode differently and found positive Symbolic Mode/performance associations. Our find-
ings taint the symbolism captured in high-level missions/statements of strategic intent alone, and
only pertain to the specific characteristics of such statements: organisations that possess mis-
sions/statements of strategic intent that set a future target extending the firm beyond its current
position; that excite and capture the imagination of employees; and that set a target which required
a sizable ‘‘stretch’’ which creates a wide gap between the firm’s current resources and its ambition as
expressed in the mission/statement of strategic intent, perform more poorly than firms without
statements that possess such characteristics.
   Fifth, our findings also offer new insights into factors that explain differences in firm-level plan-
ning. The relative impact of the four predictor variables on planning levels is most notable here.
Though environment associates with all planning dimensions, two internal variables more strongly
explain the actual planning levels attained. As noted above, one interpretation of this finding is that
while environmental instability establishes the context for more sophisticated planning, variables
such as Planning Duration and Planning Decentralisation (and potentially others) enable firms
to develop the planning clearly demanded by increased environmental instability. Instability sets
up the conditions for more comprehensive planning; decentralisation and experience promote
the development of the planning required to cope with more challenging environments. In addi-
tion, these predictors explain more of the variance in some planning dimensions than in others.
   Further, our findings indicate that Rational and Symbolic Planning are more a function of firm
size than they are of environment; our interpretation here is that as firms grow, structure in the
guise of formal planning becomes increasingly necessary. This finding also adds weight to the

Long Range Planning, vol 40   2007                                                                   73
fargument that missions/statements of strategic intent in particular might be more bureaucratic
responses of senior managers in larger firms than they are responses to environmental instability
per se. Moreover, the positive Generative Planning/Firm Size relationship, though the weakest effect
noted in the study, at the very least shows that size per se does not preclude planning for innova-
tion. That Firm Size is not associated with Transactive Planning is also logical e if anything bigger
firms should find Transactive Planning more challenging, probably because more stakeholders are
involved, and the challenges of co-ordination and integration are greater.
   The more centralised Symbolic Planning/ends formation association indicates that mission/top-
level goal formulation is mostly done centrally, in accord with conceptualisations that hold top
management responsible for broad direction/vision or the provision of overall strategic direction.23
Moreover, as our predictor variables explain so little of the variance in Symbolic Planning we can-
not conclude with much certainty which factors explain the accumulation of planning in this
dimension. All we can conclude is that Symbolic Planning is more centrally done than any other
dimension (a conclusion congruent with the underlying make-up of missions/statements of strate-
gic intent, which also confirms the face validity of our measure of Symbolic Planning), and that
larger firms possess more comprehensive missions/statements of strategic intent than do smaller
firms. However, this more central formation of Symbolic Planning might be one explanation for
the negative performance effects noted from Symbolic Planning. Possibly, the Symbolic Planning
we capture is done in isolation by senior managers who are out of touch with the environment
and competitive conditions their organization’s face.


Larger firms possess more comprehensive statements of strategic intent
than do smaller firms

   Sixth, Planning Decentralisation’s vital role in fostering planning underscores the importance of
participation in planning, and strongly supports those who champion wider stakeholder involve-
ment in strategy formation.24 Based on this finding, managers should realise that planning decen-
tralisation is crucial, especially (and understandably so) with respect to Transactive Planning, but
also with respect to Rational and Generative Planning.
   Last, for firms new to strategic planning the importance of Planning Duration cannot be over-
emphasised. Persistence is vital to planning and, similar to most activities, planning apparently
improves the more it is done; more than likely initial efforts will be inadequate and off the
mark. That the Planning Duration/planning dimension relationships are uniformly curvilinear is
indicative of the fact that diminishing returns eventually set in with regard to planning. This is log-
ical: it is unrealistic to expect that planning continues to expand at a linear rate over time, especially
when the extent of our measure of planning duration is considered: after 8e15 years, or after more
than 15 years of planning, incremental enhancements must slow down to some degree.

Strategic Planning in practice: GE’s Imagination at Work
Though our findings permit managers to benchmark, evaluate and improve their organisation’s
planning in the face of unstable environments, how any changes might be implemented remains
an important issue to consider. The box: ‘‘GE: From Bringing Good Things to Life to Imagination
at Work’’ describes recent changes introduced by Jeff Immelt at GE. Our findings underscore the
primacy of Generative Planning as environmental instability grows, and coverage of how such pro-
cesses are being promoted at a prominent global firm provides insights into how these are now be-
ing developed in practice. The case study also confirms that a leading global company has recently
realised innovation is crucial to competitiveness, validating what we see in our data empirically.
Moreover, insights into Transactive and Symbolic Planning can also be drawn from the changes
implemented at GE.

74                                                                Strategic Planning in Unstable Environments
f  Case study: GE: From Bringing Good Things to Life to Imagination at Work
  Jack Welch, the legendary manager who led GE over decades of record-breaking growth, re-
  tired in 2001 and left stewardship of the massive, multi-business conglomerate to his succes-
  sor, Jeff Immelt. Welch, famous for his ability to cull underperformers, pioneered innovations
  such as Six Sigma but considered new technology investment at best a ‘‘wild swing’’, and left
  Immelt a culture that favoured operational control over innovation. However, lacklustre per-
  formance from mid 2000 to 2003 prompted Immelt to introduce change, returning the com-
  pany to its Edison-style, start-up roots. Rather than emphasising operational efficiency and
  performance as was done during Welch’s tenure, Immelt is seeking to stimulate ‘‘out of
  the box’’ radical innovation throughout GE. Instead of emphasising the statistical dogma
  of Six Sigma, Immelt is setting targets that require the generation of almost $10bn in new
  revenue annually, organically.
     To achieve these ambitious organic growth goals, and to turn GE into an aggressive, new-
  idea-generating machine, Immelt is following four principles: 1) Chase Big Change e focus
  only on markets facing transformation, e.g. energy, healthcare, security for billion-dollar
  opportunities; 2) Re-purpose Everything e GE managers have been instructed to find new mar-
  kets/extensions of existing products; 3) Sell Like Crazy e Immelt reinstated the post of Chief Mar-
  keting Officer (eliminated by Welch), assigned a marketing leader to each of GE’s 11 major
  business lines and hired of thousands of new salespeople; and 4) Unleash the Mad Scientist
  e GE’s much storied House of Magic (now more formally known as the Global Research Center
  in Schenectady, NY, which was established in 1900 and hosted among others Albert Einstein,
  Nobel Laureates and produced inventions such as X-Ray tubes and synthetic diamonds) has
  been reinvigorated and hundreds of new scientists have been hired to work on groundbreak-
  ing innovations. New dedicated GE research centres have also opened in Europe and in Asia,
  and the corporate R&D budget has been substantially increased. But R&D has also been focused
  on around 100 projects (down from more than 1,000) and top managers and marketers now
  regularly cycle though the House of Magic to learn about the latest advances being made at
  GE’s research facilities. Moreover, and in addition to funding centres devoted to ongoing
  R&D, ‘‘Imagination Breakthroughs’’ are also encouraged at business units to promote em-
  ployee-generated ideas. Business leaders are asked to submit three ‘‘Imagination Break-
  through’’ proposals a year, and more than $5bn has been invested in more than 80 projects,
  each of which must take GE into either a new line of business, geographic area or customer
  base. Immelt is also focusing GE’s culture more on innovation and risk-taking.
     Further, an important part of employee development is identifying individuals who are pas-
  sionate about their businesses and who are experts in their industries, rather than was the
  case in the Welch era where generalists more concerned about profits and the bottom
  line, or more excited about pursuing a Six Sigma black belt than understanding where a par-
  ticular market is going, were favoured. Staying in one place longer and building strong rela-
  tionships with customers and markets, is now also encouraged.
     Rather than ‘‘bringing good things to life’’, long the phrase articulating corporate branding
  at GE, Immelt hopes GE will soon exemplify ‘‘imagination at work’’ instead!


   The steps taken at GE provide numerous pointers for organisations wishing to upgrade their gen-
erative planning. First, the case reveals that improving planning at even the best-managed organisa-
tions often goes further than upgrading planning behaviours alone. In the case of GE, changes in
the organisational culture as well as adjustments to employee development and staffing were necessary.
Innovation requires human capital that is deeply imbedded in the industry/competitive context in-
volved, and those with mostly generic skills who have spent a few years here and a few years there
are unlikely to possess the experience and industry knowledge to drive innovation. GE is now betting
that the preferred combination is more focused leaders equipped with dedicated market knowledge

Long Range Planning, vol 40   2007                                                                      75
fcoupled with idea generation/entrepreneurship skills. Managers with fingers closely on their industry’s
pulse will better sense what the future market demands/needs/likes are likely to be.
   However and perhaps the most important change imbedded in GE’s desire to achieve ‘‘imagina-
tion at work’’ rests in the content/substance of plans that might emerge as innovation becomes cen-
tral to planning. Innovation essentially represents doing something that has not been done before.
Thus for any strategy document to contain innovation it must at conception be a work of creative
fiction; under such conditions the strategy process represents a cycle from creative fiction to a work-
able prototype which only becomes profitable reality once the innovation is captured in a product/
service/solution adopted by customers despite competitor endeavours to prevent this.


Managers with fingers closely on their industry’s pulse will better sense
what the future market demands are likely to be

   Though not reported in the box, such creative fiction is imbedded in GE’s current innovation
activities: for example, a cross-disciplinary group of GE scientists is working on organic light-
emitting diodes (OLEDs) which they hope will eventually permit cheap, flexible lighting surfaces
to be printed on plastic and incorporated into wallpaper or furniture. Although this product is
expected to take years to accomplish, the goal of this innovation is to replace the invention of
GE founder Thomas Edison d the long-life lightbulb. A similar example is seen in GE’s $10bn ac-
quisition of Amersham in 2004. Amersham was acquired chiefly because of its vision to personalise
medicine and to bring medical diagnosis and research to the cellular level d the company’s tech-
nologies hope in time to predict disease before symptoms are present, and tailor remedies to fit
a person’s unique genetic profile. Immelt even appointed the head of the diagnostics-and-biosci-
ence giant to lead GE’s $15bn Healthcare Division. Thus, leaders with clear and substantive visions
of where they wish to drive their industries are now at a premium, apparently regardless of whether
these visions were formed inside or outside GE. The fictional nature of the OLEDs and Amersham’s
vision to change its industry might also be examples of Symbolic Planning that enhances value. Our
findings show that Symbolic Planning more typical of the high-level, generic missions/statements of
strategic intent is unhelpful; goals stated in the currency of the goods/services/solutions that are to
be developed might have better results.
   A third lesson drawn from GE’s experiences is that to foster innovation a portfolio approach is
probably best. Related to conceptualising plans as works of creative fiction, the idea here is that
a strategic portfolio should be considered a collection of risky bets; if funding permits, multiple
projects in multiple arenas is probably the best way to ensure visionary breakthroughs do emerge.
Because innovation is risky and failure is likely, having eggs in more than one basket is advisable;
Immelt is relying on both divisional and corporate-led R&D initiatives to foster innovation at GE.
Moreover, the portfolio can also be balanced with regard to innovation that extends existing prod-
ucts/services/solutions versus path-breaking/radical innovation. In addition to allocating resources
to new product development and R&D, Immelt has mandated managers find new markets for and
extensions of existing products as well. Not all innovation is equal, and at GE differentiation of in-
novation depending on its intensity/characteristics is done, and diversity in the type of innovation
under way is also sought.
   Related to promoting innovation at different locations and levels is the need to ensure that the
research conducted at the centre by the ‘‘unleashed mad scientists’’ is eventually incorporated into
products/services/solutions that customers buy. Resolving this tension between basic versus applied
research is another challenge organisations may face in their drive to innovate, and practices at GE
provide ideas into how such tension might be resolved. Rotating business unit executives through
centralised R&D facilities so they become familiar with and contribute to the work being done there
is one mechanism GE uses; appointing managers to act as liaisons between business units and

fcentralised/corporate research centres is another. Letting R&D engineers themselves spend time in
the field meeting customers and learning about the context where their R&D might eventually be
applied is a third. These three steps also provide useful examples of how Transactive Planning might
be promoted in practice. As the core of Transactive Planning revolves around learning and itera-
tion, forcing R&D engineers to meet customers, or ensuring line executives spend time in R&D
might foster the transactive planning our findings indicate occur as environments become more
unstable.
   Further, at GE how innovation is categorised can also determine where it is located and who con-
trols it. Currently, innovation projects are classified as either big bets or as breakthroughs e the
development of OLEDs is still considered a breakthrough and this programme is accordingly as-
signed to corporate R&D. However, once the technology becomes viable it will be reclassified as
a big bet and its funding and technical development will be handed over to a business unit, which
will be responsible to form a division to bring any potential OLED products to market. Here, ap-
plied Generative Planning is performed by market-facing entities that know the most about the
context in which the innovation is to be deployed.
   A final question organisations might face as they seek to increase innovation relates to the assign-
ment of the human capital to accomplish the process. As the GE experience illustrates, innovation is
resource-intensive, but not only with regard to the financial resources required to sustain the R&D
budget. The most talented employees who possess the deepest knowledge of customers, markets and
competition must also be involved. In many cases this requires assignment of line managers who in
times of cost cutting, down sizing and right sizing are already overstretched to quell the daily
operational fires that arise in the ordinary course of business. One question organisations will
inevitably face is whether innovation is important enough to be assigned dedicated resources?
Regrettably, over-committed line managers who are expected to be innovative while simultaneously
meeting the demands of daily operations are unlikely to devote the time and attention required to
engender successful innovation. If Generative Planning and innovation are really that important,
dedicated line managers should be assigned to drive the effort, full-time, free of the tyranny of
the urgent.
   These, and no doubt many others, are the types of challenges organisations face as they move to
build the planning needed to cope with the rigours of unstable environments. GE’s experiences re-
cord how one organisation is rising to this challenge, and as the company’s actions illustrate, all
must do so in a manner that takes into account their culture, context, resources and abilities.

Avenues for further research
Our findings suggest many avenues for further research. After being trapped for years in the formal
versus incremental planning debate, our study shines a more sophisticated light on planning di-
mension accumulation and its performance effects, and also signals the necessity for change in re-
search direction. Rather than investigating whether environment moderates planning type, more
extensive examination of how firms accumulate the multidimensional planning needed in unstable
environments is now warranted.
   Our study is the first to highlight the importance of Generative Planning. However, and despite
the widespread acceptance of the need for innovation, little is understood about how to foster in-
novation through planning. Some even worry that many of the routines developed to control or-
ganisations in the context of 20th Century industrial capitalism might inhibit innovation; the holy
grail in strategy research might now be to determine more precisely how innovation is planned
for.25 Possibly, less restrictive processes and structures independent of the controls implicit in for-
mal/Rational Planning are best when applied to the task of planning for innovation; one planning
size might not fit all dimensions. More fine-grained insights into how innovation is accomplished
through planning is now required, and research directed towards this end would be invaluable.
   Second, clarifying how Transactive Planning occurs in practice would not only focus on a plan-
ning dimension that displays important performance effects; a vital element of any organic model
of strategy formation (i.e. how plans remain in continuous alignment with environment and other

Long Range Planning, vol 40   2007                                                                  77
fcontingencies) will also be more definitively explained. Moreover, though our findings indicate that
multidimensional planning is present in unstable environments, little (if any) research into the re-
cursive relationship that might exist between the dimensions has been done. How Rational and
Transactive Planning interact as operational plans are formed and reformed also warrants attention,
as does the interaction between Transactive and Generative Planning. We presume that the outputs
of both Rational and Generative Planning are likely to evolve as implementation proceeds, however
planning aimed at innovation (especially the ‘‘breakthrough’’ innovation envisaged at GE) will
probably experience greater variation and adaptation than planning which controls the ongoing
business operations of organisations. Insights into how both Rational and Generative Planning
are affected by Transative Planning are also needed.
   Third, as we are the first to show the absolute and relative performance effects of Generative and
Transactional Planning, replication of these findings (relative to each other as well as to Rational
Planning) would be welcome. According to resource-based theory, competitive advantage rests
upon firm-specific, hard to imitate valuable resources, and the more complex the resources are
the greater the advantage they are likely to bestow. Such theory can explain the superior perfor-
mance effects of Generative and Transactive Planning relative to Rational Planning noted in our
data. As this study shows Transactive Planning is strongly associated with decentralisation and
the empowerment of multiple stakeholders, and might involve complex, distributed processes
that take time to establish. Moreover, organisational learning (a key element of Transactive Plan-
ning) is known to be complex and challenging to accomplish. Further, Generative Planning focuses
on innovative behaviours and outcomes that seek to differentiate products, services and processes
from competitors. In contrast, Rational Planning represents by now well-understood and non-
unique planning behaviours that were widely disseminated more than a decade ago, and these
have already been shown not to associate with performance in ‘‘planning equilibrium’’ industries.26
Planning that promotes differentiation or innovation and planning that involves complex, hard to
replicate, iterative processes should deliver greater value than generic, more easily replicated, and by
now possibly more widely disseminated formal planning.
   Fourth, our findings with regard to Symbolic Planning also warrant further research. Though not
without controversy, the balance of received wisdom holds that high-level missions/statements of
strategic intent are tools to be used in particular by leaders of organisations. Our findings at the
very least place Symbolic Planning under question, and further clarification of whether this widely
promoted element of planning enhances or diminishes performance would be helpful. We speculate
here that substantive visionary planning such as that seen in GE’s OLEDs example or Amersham’s
vision to change medicine is the sort of Symbolic Planning that might lead to positive performance
effects. Possibly our data mostly reflect the performance effects of ‘‘bureaucratic’’ generic mission
statements. We do not explore the content or substance of the Symbolic Planning done by firms in
our sample.
   Finally, and in addition to whether the substance/content of Symbolic Planning might explain
why some Symbolic Planning destroys rather than enhances performance, is the question of how
the various planning dimensions are sequenced relative to each other. It could be Symbolic Plan-
ning frames an organisation’s substantive, long-term vision, while Generative Planning then con-
trols and represents the steps taken to accomplish the vision, one experiment at a time.
Symbolic Planning might thus set the overall vision while Generative and Transactive Planning con-
trol and guide experiments as prototypes are built and tested towards that end. Finally, Rational
Planning might be best employed once a prototype is ready for introduction. Research establishing
when and how planning dimensions take place over time would now be valuable.

Conclusion
Our findings shine a new and more complete light on strategic planning and its accumulation, and
emphasise the multidimensionality of the planning deployed in unstable environments. They also
emphasise that planning does have the potential to produce positive performance effects, and as
environments are unlikely to become more stable anytime soon, at the very least three of the

78                                                               Strategic Planning in Unstable Environments
fplanning dimensions we describe provide a useful template for managers to benchmark the plan-
ning of organisations under their purview. Our findings also indicate in general (and discounting
our findings relating to Symbolic Planning) that planning is a value-adding activity for firms to
pursue, contrary to the condemnation of formal planning by some theorists over the past decade
or so.
   In the face of unstable environments, incremental over formal planning, and especially the gen-
erative content of plans, are the dimensions of most importance. How inclusive and decentralised
planning is, and how adaptable and flexible plans prove to be, and more notably the extent to which
plans stimulate product, service or process innovation, are the planning behaviours organisations
most rely on to deal with environmental instability. Importantly, these are also the dimensions
that most strongly associate with superior organisational performance. Finally, our description of
the changes implemented at GE under Jeff Immelt provides a tangible, on the ground example
of how one prominent organisation has moved to upgrade its planning in the context of 21st
Century global competition. In today’s fast-changing competitive markets planning at this level
of granularity is vital, as our findings clearly indicate that in such conditions all should move to
increase their imagination at work!


Appendix
Key Construct Measures
Environmental Stability/Instability To ascertain environmental stability/instability, 10 statements
were rated across a seven-point Likert type scale where 1 ¼ Very low or none and 7 ¼ Very high. In
very unstable environments high volatility in annual sales and earnings is experienced; a high rate of
technological change and technological volatility is encountered; and a high rate in change in gov-
ernment regulation is seen. Moreover, a high rate of product obsolescence and pressure to research
new products/applications, and considerable pressure from current/prospective competitors is pres-
ent. Finally, in such contexts forecasting industry/market trends is difficult, and strategic decision-
making is complex.
   Symbolic Planning Four statements, each eliciting a ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ response scored on a 1 or
0 basis measured Symbolic Planning. Respondents first indicated whether or their firm had a mis-
sion statement/statement of strategic intent, and if so, the composition of the statement was cali-
brated. Firms with high Symbolic Planning possessed statements that set a future target or vision
which extended the firm beyond its current position; that set a future target or vision that excited
and captured the imagination of employees; and that set a target which required a sizeable ‘‘stretch’’
for the firm, creating an apparent wide gap between the firm’s current resources and its ambition as
expressed in the mission/statement of strategic intent.
   Rational Planning Rational Planning was measured by nine multi-item scales that captured how
specific and formal the ends and means in strategic plans were.i For example, in one scale respon-
dents selected one of five statements that best described their firm’s strategic plan, ranging from
‘‘No specifically developed strategic plans of any substance’’ (scored 1) to ‘‘A comprehensive, writ-
ten, detailed, complete statement of firm plans and policies, containing specific action plans and
programs which are continually referred to to direct firm activities or monitor/measure firm per-
formance’’ (scored 5). In a second scale, respondents were asked to indicate which types of ends
were typically included in their firm’s strategic plan. Choices in six boxes were provided and re-
spondents indicated on a yes (scored 1) or no basis (scored 0) whether each choice was present
in their plan. Three of the six choices included were: 1) A statement of your firm’s mission or fun-
damental business purpose; 2) Statements of specific financial targets to be achieved either annually,
or over the foreseeable future, for example ROI targets, profitability targets, or other targets of
financial performance; and 3) Statements of specific key result areas/objectives for many/all
   i
     Ends and means are the building blocks of strategic planning, and were used throughout the survey instrument. Careful
definition of each was provided at the beginning of the questionnaire.


Long Range Planning, vol 40     2007                                                                                   79
ffunctions/operations of the firm, providing key measurement of vital firm activities. Achievement
of these key results/objectives is considered important, and part of employee compensation is based
on such achievement.
   Transactive Planning To measure Transactive Planning three items were scored on a seven-
point Likert type scale where 1 ¼ Very low or none and 7 ¼ Very high. Firms with high Transactive
Planning capability form ends and means on an iterative basis, involving managers, staff and exec-
utives in an ongoing dialogue; form ends and means on an ongoing basis, involving everyone in the
process to some degree; and continually adapt ends and means based on feedback from the market.
   Generative Planning To measure Generative Planning four items were scored on a seven-point
Likert type scale where 1 ¼ Very low or none and 7 ¼ Very high. Firms with high Generative Plan-
ning capability set ends that require/encourage innovation/change and/or the introduction of new
products or services; set ends that promote the identification of new or more innovative approaches
in the internal operation or management of the firm; possess ends that set new goals or aspirations
for the firm; and possess ends that communicate to employees future ‘‘visions’’ for the firm.
   Planning Decentralisation As ends formation is typically more centralised than means forma-
tion, the locus of ends were measured separately from means. Two identical scales (but for the in-
sertion of ends or means) were employed. First, the diversity of employees involved in planning was
calibrated, with choices ranging from ‘‘only the CEO/Senior management of the firm’’ (highly cen-
tralised) to ‘‘multiple firm members including junior, middle and senior employees’’ (highly decen-
tralised). Then, an estimate of the percentage of employees who are/have been involved in planning
was obtained, ranging from less than 5 per cent (highly centralised) to greater than 50 per cent
(highly decentralised). Summing the two item scores produced an overall centralisation/decentral-
isation measure for each construct.ii
   Planning Duration Five choices with regard to how long strategy formation had been progress-
ing in the manner indicated in responses were provided: Less than 1 year (scored 1); 1e3 years (2);
4e7 years (3); 8e15 years (4), and Greater than 15 years (5).
   Firm Size Firm size was quantified according to employee numbers, in four categories: <100;
100e500; 501e1000; and >1000, scored 1e4.
   Firm Performance To measure firm performance data relative to competitive peers and to mar-
ket share change over the most recent 5e10 years was gathered. In the industry peer data respon-
dents ranked their firm’s performance relative to peers in their firm’s primary industry across three
items: 1) Overall profitability or financial performance; 2) Stock price performance; and 3) Overall
firm performance/success. Five choices were given to rank each item: Lowest 20 per cent of industry
peers (scored 1); Next 20 per cent of industry peers (scored 2); Middle 20 per cent of industry peers
(scored 3); Next 20 per cent of industry peers (scored 4); and Top 20 per cent of industry peers
(scored 5). A ‘‘Not applicable’’ box was also provided for firms that did not have publicly-traded
stocks/shares, and when this box was checked the average of the other two scores was substituted. In
the market share data respondents indicated how their firm’s market share had changed over the
most recent 5e10 years. Ratings were indicated in one of seven boxes: Decreased by more than
30 per cent (scored -3); Decreased by 16e30 per cent (scored -2); Decreased by 0e15 per cent
(scored -1); Unchanged (scored 0); Increased by 0e15 per cent (scored 1); Increased by 16e30
per cent (scored 2); and Increased by more than 30 per cent (scored 3). Thus a firm scoring 18
ranked in the top 20 per cent of its primary industry in overall profitability/financial performance;
stock price performance; and overall firm performance/success; and its market share over the most
recent 5e10 years increased by more than 30 per cent. A firm scoring 0 ranked in the bottom 20 per
cent of its primary industry in overall profitability/financial performance; stock price performance;
and overall firm performance/success; and its market share over the most recent 5e10 years de-
creased by more than 30 per cent.
   ii
      The data on ends and means centralisation/decentralisation validated our separate measurement: the Ends Decentralisation
mean of 4.83 differed from the Means Decentralisation mean of 5.87 (t ¼ u000213.62; p < .001; n ¼ 886). Also, the negative decentral-
isation/firm size associations (see Table 1) shows smaller firms involve more employees on a percentage basis in planning than do
larger firms. This accords with logic and thus adds to the face validity of our decentralisation measures.

fSample Characteristics and Sampling Procedures
Senior and mid-level executives attending 48 executive education programmes offered at three busi-
ness schools and senior executives affiliated with two private organisations provided data for the
study. In total, a multinational, multi-industry sample of 886 firms was gathered. Thirty countries
are represented, though American (44 per cent) and South African (44 per cent) firms make up the
majority. Controlling for country of origin (US versus South Africa) no significant differences in
findings were noted. Respondent employment tenure at the firms they were reporting on was
also impressive: 85 per cent had been at their firm four years or longer, 69 per cent indicated ten-
ures of longer than seven years and 54 per cent reported more than 10 years of service. Though firm
size and age varies, our findings are most relevant to large organisations in business for long periods
of time e 72 per cent of firms employed more than 500 people and 59 per cent more than 1,000.
Finally, 93 per cent of firms were more than seven years old, with 88 per cent older than 10 years.
Our findings thus mostly pertain to the planning done in large, well-established businesses that
have been in business for a considerable period of time.
   Respondents were either mailed questionnaires before their executive programme, or handed
questionnaires once in attendance and requested to complete and hand back the instrument by
the end of the programme, always at a minimum one week ahead. At distribution, three points
were stressed: that participation was entirely voluntary; that strategy formation at the business
unit, divisional or SBU level was the focus of the study, and that ideal respondents were thus members
of a firm/business unit/division who were familiar with the strategic plans and strategy formation
processes utilised by their firm/business unit/division; and that there were no correct or incorrect
answers to any questions d the desired response was the one which best described the practices
or situation in the respondent’s firm/business unit/division.

      associate with first order planning capabilities (Output Variables) which in turn associate with second or-
      der firm level performance.

    planning might inhibit innovation.

Introduction to Managerial Environments
Principles of Management
Introduction to Managerial Environments
A manager's environment is made up of constantly changing factors — both external and internal — that affect the operation of the organization. If a new competitor appears in the marketplace, the managerial environment is affected. If key clients take their business elsewhere, managers feel the impact. And if technological advances date an organization's current methods of doing business, once again, the managerial environment has to adapt.
    
    

    Although managers can't always control their environments, they need to be aware of any changes that occur, because changes ultimately affect their daily decisions and actions. For example, in the airline industry, deregulation opened up the market to new airlines, forcing existing airlines to be more competitive. Managers in existing airlines couldn't afford to ignore the cheaper airfares and increased service that resulted. Not only did managers have to identify the new challenge, but they also had to act quickly and efficiently to remain competitive.

    This book is carefully designed to meet the needs of undergraduate stu-
dents, as well as those of practicing managers. It provides an in-depth analy-
sis of strategic management concepts substantiated with real-world exam-
ples to enrich the discussion. Business policy and strategic management, as
a subject, has become a required course in undergraduate and graduate busi-
ness curricula. It has also become a vital part of the corporate environment.
“Almost all organizations of any reasonable size have some kind of strategic
plan.”1
    The issues presented in this text directly face the managers of today and
those of the future. They apply to all types of organizations, whether large or
small, profit or not-for-profit, domestic or global. In addition, this text
should provide helpful insight into today’s strategic management decision
making and should be a key to the development of successful organizational
effectiveness. For the purpose of this book, strategic management is defined
as the process of assessing the corporation and its environment to meet the
firm’s long-term objectives of adopting and adjusting to its environment
through exploitation of opportunities and reduction of threats.
    Instructors have used a variety of approaches in teaching this course, but
the critical issue is to expose the student to a theoretical framework. This
strong foundation will in turn enable the student to function effectively in
the business world. This book develops in detail a framework for the formu-
lation, implementation, and control of strategies for all types of domestic
and global organizations.
    For any company to succeed in today’s global market, it must develop a
competitive advantage. The market is going global, and increasing competi-
tion will affect every business, no matter how small or large, public or pri-
vate the firm is. The increasing globalization of business has created a need
for effective overseas managers. Protected markets no longer exist any-
where in the world. Successful global managers need to be capable, devise
creative strategies, have effective communication skills, and possess self-
awareness together with an understanding of foreign cultures, languages,
and customs. The international marketplace is highly competitive and oper-
ations are managed in widely varying economic, social, political, and cul-
tural environments. It must be noted that successful domestic managers do
not necessarily become effective global managers unless they are well
                                                                             ix

trained and open-minded. This book examines how companies expand their
operations abroad and the need for appropriate strategies.
   History and business literature is replete with evidence showing that vi-
sion, efficacious planning, and realistic goal setting can positively influence
organizational performance. It is also evident that business organizations,
both small and large, that employ strategic planning outperform their coun-
terparts who operate without any formal planning.
   In the present turbulent, globalized, and rapidly changing business envi-
ronment, organizations can easily lose a sense of mission and direction.
Strategic management is an instrument for controlling an organization’s
destiny. It has a lighthouse effect and forces members of an organization to
think futuristically, highlights new opportunities and threats, and enables
organizations to refocus on their mission. Strategic planning enables firms
to remain proactive, be competitive, and develop calculated methods to re-
solve interrelated sets or problems and issues from an eagle-eye perspective.
   Organizations of the twenty-first century will have to make fundamental
changes in their operations and strategies. For many companies, poor-
quality change has caused their downfall. “Forty-seven percent of the com-
panies that appeared on the Fortune 500 a decade ago have disappeared
from today’s list.”2 CEOs must become the leaders of change. They must
leave the traditional organizational system behind and become more pro-
gressive and flexible with the changing times. Objectives need to be re-
defined to meet the challenges of global competition. The role of employees
and managers must change as well to better accomplish organizational
goals in quality improvement and efficiency.
   The past fifteen years have seen dynamic environmental changes. For-
eign companies are proliferating and are stronger. The increased competi-
tion is fierce, product life cycles are shorter, product development cycles are
faster, domestic and world economies are less stable, technological ad-
vances are faster, change occurs more often, and deregulation and economic
liberalization abroad are common. Faced with declining profits and loss of
market share, businesses today can no longer rest complacently on their lau-
rels. Strategic planning is a process of thinking through myriad choices and
developing appropriate alternatives to resolve issues and problems.
   Planning also has a coalescing quality. It brings innovative leaders to-
gether and enables them to share and promote their vision. Good planning
promotes teamwork, improves knowledge of the organization, fosters better
communication across functions, and improves managerial skills. It estab-
lishes a pattern of success and growth and helps firms to influence and con-
trol their environment. The twenty-first century will bring dramatic ad-
vances and changes in technology and will usher business organizations
into a globalized economy, with no governing body to smooth the transfor-

mation, which will require firms to adopt appropriate strategies to align
themselves to the new shifts in the paradigm.

Characteristics of a Dramatically Changing Global Environment

   The nature of strategic management today is seen in the environment-
driven strategies of successful firms competing in a diverse market. The fol-
lowing are some of the characteristics of the dramatically changing global
environment:

   1. Change is an important constant factor, and therefore its effective
      management will require constant monitoring of the firm’s internal
      and external environments. We can know neither the outcome of this
      change nor the direction, but we can be aware of the nature of our cir-
      cumstances. Change will also necessitate employee participation, em-
      powerment, and total quality management.
   2. Strategic management is a necessary process for gaining competitive
      advantage, requiring the active participation of all functional areas.
   3. The environmental, ethical, product quality, and integrity aspects of busi-
      ness practice are a critical concern requiring active support, commitment,
      and involvement of top management. In essence, all things must be con-
      sidered, known and unknown, sins of commission and omission.
   4. Environmental turbulence will dictate strategies to be constantly eval-
      uated from a stakeholder’s point of view.
   5. Development of international strategies is a complex process because
      of the existence of trade blocks such as the EU, ASEAN, and NAFTA,
      and the likely emergence of new integration between China and the
      Soviet bloc countries, along with the African continent, the Middle
      East, and South America.
   6. Restructuring the traditional organization into multifunctional, flexi-
      ble teams is reforming the traditional hierarchical organization.
   7. Strategies increasingly involve interorganizational teams and strategic
      alliances on a global scale, redirecting the company focus on customer
      and global competition.

    We must understand that (1) faulty assumptions and false information
can result in the formulation of poor or even disastrous plans, and (2) change
is constant and continuous—that yesterday’s good plan may not be relevant
or of any value today. Consequently, firms need to continuously monitor,
evaluate, and control their strategic plans if they are to result in positive goal
achievement.

   In short, the world of business and competition is in a vortex of dynamic
change that will destroy those who do not carefully chart their course of
action through the maelstrom. Those who remain proactive and adapt and
adjust to the changing environment will succeed. We have to realize that we
live in a changing world and business organizations, governmental units,
and other entities, just like people, have to adjust and adapt to survive.
Through strategic planning and strategic thinking we can anticipate the fu-
ture, and through proactive efforts we can manage change to our advantage.

The Text

   This book is an important educational tool for undergraduate business
students. It is intended to assist students to integrate and apply their knowl-
edge in different business functional areas. The book will assist students in
learning the different analytical tools applied in the practice of strategic
management. It is also intended to provide an answer to the many chal-
lenges business organizations face. Among these challenges are (1) the
acutely competitive environment in the domestic as well as international
markets, (2) the changing nature of the workforce and organization, and
(3) the advances in technology and information systems that have trans-
formed the market from an industrial to a knowledge-based society.
   Included are the following distinctive features that separate this book
from the traditional texts:

      • Managerial applications. I have tried to treat the content as compre-
        hensibly as possible while using a simple writing style that enables a
        student to form a clear picture of the topic area. The tone of the book is
        simple yet succinct. The real-world examples help students see how
        theory relates to practice and add relevance to the analysis presented.
      • International aspects. While international and globalization aspects
        are included in different chapters, a separate chapter is devoted solely
        to discussing the strategic management aspects of the international en-
        vironment.
      • Contemporary focus. Current concepts such as total quality management,
        ethics and social responsibility, corporate governance, reengineering,
        globalization, international strategies, etc., are used and their relationship
        to strategic management is shown.
      • Content organization. Each chapter presents an overall framework of
        the topic area, e.g., assessing the environment, international strategies,
        implementation, corporate culture, and the general manager. Subse-
        quent sections analyze the impact of strategic management on this di-
f                                     Preface                                   xiii

      mension, raise policy implications, and consider management tools
      and mechanisms.

    The book is suitable for academics (with footnotes and references) and
practitioners and students (no esoteric jargon or abstruse statistical analysis).
The content is designed for undergraduate business students. It is a summary
of experience gathered from my work expense, students, the books I have
used, and the class notes I have prepared over numerous years.
    Chapter 1 presents a broad overview of strategic management to prepare
the reader for the remaining chapters. Chapter 2 begins by presenting the stra-
tegic management process and discussing its characteristics. It is imperative
that students in business administration recognize the components of the
strategic management process and be able to recognize and understand mis-
sion statements, strategic objectives, and organizational policies. This chap-
ter also discusses the relationship between strategic management and total
quality management.
    Chapter 3 presents an in-depth study of the external and internal forces that
affect the strategic plan and the importance of accurate and timely information
to the organization. This chapter discusses the SWOT analysis in some detail.
    Once the mission, goals, and objectives have been set for the organiza-
tion and the environmental forces have been assessed, the corporate, busi-
ness, and functional strategies must be developed and applied. This is the
topic of Chapters 4 and 5. Global aspects of designing strategy have been in-
tegrated into many of the chapters. However, the specific focus of Chapter 6
is managerial strategies as applied to organizations that operate in a global
environment.
    Chapters 7 and 8 provide the student with a framework for implementing
a formalized strategy. They discuss the structure, culture, and leadership re-
quirements for successful implementation. Chapter 9 discusses the evalua-
tion and control process, including the types of evaluation available.
    Finally, strategic management in not-for-profit organizations is discussed
in Chapter 10. This chapter shows the importance of developing strategy for
not-for-profit organizations and how they are different from their for-profit
counterparts.
    Section II of the book is devoted to cases that illustrate various principles.

                             Strategic Management


    The twenty-first-century realities of globalization, rapid changes in tech-
nology, increasing competition, a changing workforce, changing market
and economic conditions, and developing resource shortages all increase
the complexity of modern management. Whereas strategic planning was a
competitive advantage in the past decade, it is a necessity of global thinking
in this century. Planning strategically is certainly a new requirement in the
global business world. In order to survive the new business challenge, global
thinking and practice must permeate all corporate activities. Successful
companies are, of course, the first to consider the global marketplace as
their arena for competition. In addition, recent studies have concluded that
organizations engaged in strategic management have outperformed those
who do not.1 According to John Peter, strategic management has become a vi-
tal part of most, if not all, organizations. “Almost all organizations of any rea-
sonable size have some kind of strategic planning.”2

                   WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO STUDY
                    STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT?

   Traditional business disciplines—accounting, economics, finance—have
been recognized for centuries. Management per se first appeared in the
patriarchal familial structures of earliest civilization, with records of man-
agement following soon after. Hammurabi’s (2123 B.C.) Codification of
Law mentioned accounting practices; Sun Tzu (600 B.C.) recognized such
management techniques as division of labor, specialization, and the benefits
of sound planning; Confucius (552 B.C.) advocated competition through
merit systems while bemoaning the inherent problems of bureaucracy. In
India, Kautilya (332 B.C.) wrote extensively about public administration
techniques and the necessity of job descriptions.3 However, strategic man-
agement and business policy are relatively “foreign” concepts. Why? First,
the subject matter is relatively new compared to traditional business topics.
Second, strategic management and business policy integrates the traditional

                                                                                3
f4                       STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

subjects with the main purpose of providing a practical, real-world view of
business management.
   The study of strategic management and business policy is a capstone
course designed to integrate all prior learning into one subject suited for ap-
plication in the modern business environment. Further, strategic manage-
ment is designed to develop an awareness of the processes by which organi-
zations can achieve synergies of the whole through the effective cooperation
and interaction of the many departments within an organization. Today’s
managers must have and/or develop the ability to see the interdependent and
interrelated nature of organizations. In addition, managers must develop the
necessary skills to closely interact with people from differing backgrounds.
Therefore, the study of strategic management is designed to prepare current
as well as future managers to meet the challenges of today’s competitive and
ever-changing environments.


             HISTORY OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
                    AND BUSINESS POLICY

   The study of business policy is relatively new, and the discipline finds its
roots in the early American business colleges. Harvard started a course sim-
ilar to Business Policy in 1911 and, by the 1920s, required it for second-year
students. Harvard hoped to demonstrate how the internal and intradivisional
functions of business were closely interrelated in practice and how top man-
agement had to recognize and manage these interrelationships to work ef-
fectively and efficiently.
   In 1959, a Ford Foundation and Carnegie Corporation-funded study indi-
cated that business school curricula resulted in various disciplines with
course content that students understood only in isolation. The study found
that when students were presented with problems requiring integrated sub-
ject matter, they had trouble applying the individual course content to the
business as a whole entity.4 In reaction to this study, the American Assem-
bly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) launched the business pol-
icy course as an organized capstone course intended to provide an important
and lasting role in schools of business. Subsequently, the field of business
policy passed through an evolutionary process and today business policy
course content is again evolving into the study of strategic management.5
This new field contributed to other business disciplines such as manage-
ment, marketing, accounting, and finance, among others.
   According to Gluck, Kaufman, and Walleck, strategic planning and stra-
tegic management evolve through four consecutive phases.6 Increasing
change and complexity in the corporation’s external environment most likely
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                   5

cause the development of these phases. The first phase involves developing
the annual corporate budget. This is called financial planning. At this stage
the company collects information internally, such as this year’s sales and
next year’s e xpectations. Also collected is information about personnel,
production capacity, raw materials, and other related matters.
   The second phase is similar to the first except the plan covers a longer pe-
riod, three to five years. This type of planning is called forecast-based plan-
ning. This stage involves collecting information from outside the organiza-
tion but on limited scale.
   The third phase of planning, called externally oriented planning or
strategic planning, is developed mainly by top-level management with the
help of consultants. At this stage the company collects information about
the external environment and the changes in its competitive market. The
main criterion of this stage is the top-down approach to planning. This
type of planning does not focus on implementation, which is left for lower-
level management and employees to discuss. The third phase also features
long-period forecasting, five years or longer.
   The final phase is the strategic management approach, in which all man-
agement and key employees participate to develop a sequence of strategic
plans to achieve the various objectives of the corporation. At this stage a
comprehensive analysis of the corporate external environment takes place.


             PURPOSE OF BUSINESS POLICY COURSE

    To understand why Business Policy is taught, one needs to examine what
is learned in the course. Business Policy provides practice in decision mak-
ing (DM) because it primarily covers the job of the general manager and an-
alyzes potential problems from the perspective of the business as a whole. It
provides decision makers with the needed information to pursue clarity, ac-
curacy, greater consistency, and speed in the DM process.
    The course offers the views of general management. Therefore, instead
of getting a functional or operational point of view, the student receives an
overall point of view, from the top of the corporation. The course enables the
student to develop an eagle-eye perspective that a chief executive officer
(CEO) requires in order to be successful. During the course, the student will
analyze a wide range of business policy cases, which will help the student
acquire a much broader general knowledge about business practices domes-
tically and internationally. Because of this wider view, the student’s creativ-
ity and imagination will be additionally stimulated when faced with real
problems in working situations.
f6                        STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

    The central theme of the business policy course is corporate strategy.
Strategy is not a theory but is the corporation’s general approach to achieve
its mission and objectives. The strategic management process is important,
not only for top-level management, because it filters down to the middle and
operating levels as well as the shop floor employees and their supervisors.
An understanding of domestic and international competition is important to
everyone involved in the organization. Understanding the strategic process
can provide employees with direction as well as the needed incentives to
work hard and be more competitive.
    The course stresses the development of the top manager’s ability to relate
the processes of management to the common problems that top managers
face. This is probably the reason that most of the exercises completed by the
student consist of case analyses. Analyzing cases enables the student to uti-
lize processes and theories learned in earlier courses to strategically solve
problems from an organizational standpoint.
    Business Policy has been designed to create an awareness of and an inter-
est in the strategic problems of a business and its relationship with society. It
is hoped that students will learn to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative
evidence when conflicting points of view are encountered. This course will
teach a student to become proficient at decision making, while learning all
the basic concepts in the field of business policy and strategic management.

Strategic Management Models

   Scholars feel that the strategic management process is best understood
and applied using models. Therefore, several strategic management models
have been introduced. Each model has several components that are inter-
related, dynamic, and continuous. A change in any of these components may
result in a change in other components. For example, the company’s objec-
tives and strategies may change if it obtains a new technology or other capa-
bilities that improve its competitive advantage. Therefore, the four major
elements of strategic management (environmental analysis, formulation,
implementation, and evaluation and control) should be considered inter-
related and continuous. These models do not guarantee success. However,
they do represent a clear and practical approach to formulating, implement-
ing, and evaluating control strategies. Although different models exist, they
do have common elements. Almost all of the models focus on the environ-
mental analysis of the organization. Most of them start by identifying an
organization’s mission, goals, objectives (hierarchy of purpose), and the
various levels of strategies (hierarchy of strategies). Understanding the or-
ganizational environment and its hierarchy of purpose will help the com-
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                      7

pany to adopt or avoid certain strategies in order to take advantage of the op-
portunities in its environment. By understanding the previous strategies of
the organization and assessing its current position in the market, manage-
ment can better forecast the future.
   Most scholars present a clean picture of how these various elements
relate to each other and how they should work. It is important to understand
that the strategic management process is more complex than a simple draw-
ing of a relationship. To ensure success in the formulation and implementa-
tion of any strategy, everyone in the organization must be involved. Operating-
level management and employee involvement and feedback are essential to
any strategy. Since competitive position is dynamic and ever changing, the
means to support the competitive position of today’s organization must
be comprehensive and relevant because the organization must deal with the
global aspects of the business environment. Relevancy involves the analysis
of current and potential competitors inside and outside the industry. Strat-
egy needs to be developed by talented individuals who are familiar with cor-
porate internal and external realities, who should consider the global mar-
ketplace as the proper domain of analysis. You cannot have an effective
strategy unless each of the other managers and employees of the organiza-
tion participates in his or her capacity.
   In this book, the strategic management framework consists of four con-
nected, dynamic, and continuous elements: environmental analysis, strategy
formulation, strategy implementation, and evaluation and control. Although
each of these strategic management elements can be considered individually,
they are all interrelated and must build upon one another to form the overall,
integrated process. This model (see Figure 1.1) is shown in more detail at the
beginning of Section I and will not be repeated in the other chapters.

The Elements of Strategic Management

   Three terms are prominent in almost all business organizations today:
business policy, strategic planning, and strategic management. All of them
deal with management efforts to confront situations that arise in the organiza-
tion’s daily routine while trying to achieve the organization’s goals and objec-
tives. Thus all of the terms are related, but each has its own unique definition.

                            BUSINESS POLICY

    Business policy guides certain continuous actions in the organization to
assist managers in ascertaining corporate objectives and to support and en-
hance corporate strategies. In other words, business policy is the set of rules
designed by the organization to confront a recurring situation that threatens
the organization’s mission. It is a supporting instrument to aid in accom-
plishing the company’s objectives and formulating, implementing, and con-
trolling strategy. Business policies are usually the last resort for the organi-
zation in confronting problems that have occurred frequently. An example
of a business policy is the refusal of convenience stores to accept any cur-
rency larger than a $20 bill after 10 p.m. Another example of business policy
is a company commitment to distribute a certain percentage of net earnings
(i.e., 50 percent) as a dividend to shareholders. Other examples include
these:

    • A company will not consider any cost reduction options if it means
      compromising quality.
    • A company decides to grow only through retained earnings.
    • A company will not consider adding new products with less than
      10 percent return on investment.
    • A company sells exclusively on cash terms.
    • A rental company charges a deposit for rented material.
    • A rental car company charges extra money for delivering the rented
      car in another location.
    • A company hires personnel with experience only.
    • A company prepares guidelines on how to collect debts from its cus-
      tomers.
    • A company will not question customers’ returns of items purchased
      earlier.
    • A company responds to 50 percent of customer inquiries within three
      working days.

   Strategy refers to the method or route a company chooses to achieve its
objectives after careful assessment of its resources and environment. Strat-
egy therefore refers to the determination of long-term corporate objectives
and the methods along with the functional policies proposed by the com-
pany to realize these objectives. Strategy is a comprehensive, long-term
plan indicating how the corporation will achieve its missions and objectives.
Alfred Chandler defined strategy as the “determination of the basic long-
term goals and objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of ac-
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                    9

tion and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out those goals.”7
Planning is the end result of strategy design.

Policy versus Strategy

   From a conceptual standpoint, the terms strategy and policy have differ-
ent and distinct meanings. However, on the more practical level of day-to-
day usage, their distinctiveness often becomes blurred. Frequently, these
words are erroneously used as if they were interchangeable.
   In general, policies are drafted to be used as broad guidelines by the orga-
nization’s decision makers. These general guidelines indicate how an orga-
nization should deal with recurring problems in its routine operation. By
providing a prescribed path for handling repetitive matters, they save time
and effort. Thus, policies streamline and help focus the decisions made and
the consequent actions taken by an organization. In theory, these guidelines
are used to help organizational leaders make all other decisions; they repre-
sent a framework for decision making.
   In contrast, strategies represent an organization’s specific plans of action.
Strategic planning permits the organization to chart a course of action into the
future that coordinates and balances all the contributions made by the entire
organization, yet strategic planning must be flexible enough to absorb and
respond, drive the organization forward, and adapt to the current business envi-
ronment.8 Strategies denote a general program of action to achieve long-
term objectives of the companies, the deployment of resources to attain
these objectives, and major policies to be followed in using these resources.
We can say that all strategic decisions and subsequent actions of the organi-
zation should revolve around and occur in accordance with the guidelines

   The strategic plan is the result of strategic design and it includes a state-
ment outlining the company’s mission, future direction, performance tar-
gets, and strategy selection. The strategy will change when the following
events take place:

    1. When the company attempts to strengthen its long-term competitive
       position and secure competitive advantage
    2. Through any actions intended to improve profitability, customer ser-
       vices, and products
f10                        STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

      3. Because of any actions of expansion, change in leadership, and
         change in ownership
      4. Through any action that responds to changes in industry conditions
         (i.e., change in demand, globalization of competition, government
         regulations, or new entry or exit in the industry)
      5. When company resources and capabilities change
      6. When a company moves to counter imitation by rivals and new de-
         mand for quality in product and services at a reasonable price
      7. Through actions to capitalize on new opportunities, such as new tech-
         nology, product innovation, the purchase of a new company, new op-
         portunities that open up, new markets, or a change in market condition
         (free market)
      8. When the company goes through restructuring, mergers, and buyouts
      9. When defensive action to counter the moves of rivals and to defend
         against external threats is taken
     10. Any time the organization does not accept its current strategy

Measuring the Effectiveness of Policy

   The effectiveness of a policy can be measured by determining how closely
the company comes to achieving its goals and objectives. Is the company
surviving as an entity? Is the company making an acceptable rate of profit?
Objectives can be measured and, therefore, one can determine if their out-
come is positive or negative. Companies impact a large part of our economy.
They utilize much of society’s resources, such as land, labor, capital, and
technology. We must learn to be efficient in the allocation of resources to
benefit society. We must learn how to plan wisely.
   Formal planning is increasingly necessary in today’s society with accel-
erated technology, rapid social change, and turbulent organizational envi-
ronments. Guidelines are set in terms of broad parameters of strategic plan-
ning. More effective strategic planning probably represents one of the
greatest profit improvement opportunities for business organizations today.
One valuable lesson worth mentioning at this early stage is that a strategic
plan is only of use when it can be implemented. Strategy is based on policy,
and both play an important role in assuring the success of the organization.
They deal with functional elements of how a company intends to reach its
objectives.
   A good example of strategic failure is the strategy designed by Disney
executives to establish Euro Disney in April 1992 north of Paris. Euro Dis-
ney is the fourth Disney amusement park in the world. The first two parks
were created in the United States and the third one was established in Japan.
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                   11

Those three parks have proven to be very successful. When the company ex-
panded to the European market it experienced many difficulties during the
first two years of operation. An insufficient number of visitors and huge in-
vestments, which mounted to more than $3.68 billion, resulted in huge
losses for the company. The strategy established in 1995 to rescue the com-
pany was partially successful.
    Another example is the failure of the U.S. automobile makers to plan
strategically, which allowed the Japanese and others to gain U.S. market
share in the 1970s and 1980s.


                         STRATEGIC PLANNING

   Strategic planning is a management tool to look at the future and see tomor-
row’s opportunities or challenges to gain competitive position. Managers who
think in terms of today are behind the times tomorrow.9 Competitive strategic
planning not only predicts future events but also influences them and energizes
resources and activities. The evolutionary process integrates decisions and ac-
tions into a vision of where the organization wants to be in the future, rather
than allowing daily demands to determine the organization’s future direction
and position in the marketplace. While the mission represents the concept of the
business, the vision refers to the future direction of the company. Sometimes
they are combined in one statement, although they may have separate state-
ments.
   Strategic planning, the result of strategy formulation, requires strategic
thinking, which is a continuous process that deals with corporate events in a
comprehensive manner. Strategic thinking refers to the question, “Where do
you want to go?” How to get there is the planning. Strategic thinking leads
managers to successful strategy planning now that corporations must com-
pete in an expanded marketplace. Understanding the driving force in such mar-
kets enhances the firm’s global competitive position. Strategic thinking, there-
fore, is the matching of opportunities with corporate resources in order to
envision the future direction that leads to improved corporate performance and
enhanced competitive advantage.
   Strategies are essential ingredients for success in a global market. Com-
panies learn from each other through benchmarking (comparing your com-
pany to others in the market and learning from the best practices). A number
of studies indicate that companies that formulate strategic plans outperform
those who do not. Strategic planning helps organizations to be more focused
and to successfully pursue desired results.10 Successful companies are, of
course, the first to consider the global marketplace as their arena for competi-
tion.11 Companies without strategic planning are no longer guarded. Strate-
f12                        STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

gic planning is the company’s road map to see where it is now, how it got
here, where it wants to be in the future, and how they plan to get there. Stra-
tegic planning has four main purposes:

     1. To find, attract, and keep customers
     2. To ensure that the company is meeting the needs and wants of its cus-
        tomers, which is a cornerstone in providing the quality product or ser-
        vice that customers really want
     3. To sustain a competitive position
     4. To utilize the company’s strengths and take full advantage of its com-
        petitor’s weaknesses

   In planning, management is in need of reliable and relevant information
about the company’s internal environment (skills, equipment, financial ca-
pabilities, etc.) and its external environment (position within its industry,
and the overall opportunities and threats). Environmental information is im-
portant in forecasting the future, which is often unpredictable.
   To build competitive advantage in business today, organizations are turn-
ing to strategic management technologies. Early systems focused primarily
on support functions such as accounting and record keeping. These activi-
ties contributed to the firm’s competitiveness only indirectly, with insignifi-
cant reductions in costs. Today, systems are integrated throughout all levels
of the organization and have become essential tools for the business to sur-
vive.12 This includes all technologies such as information systems and ad-
vanced manufacturing technology that keeps a company on the cutting edge.

The Mission Statement

   A key component, critical to any strategic plan, is the organization’s mission
statement. A firm must have a stated mission from which it sets goals and
objectives (see Figure 1.2). The mission statement must include the following:
Who is the company? What does it want to accomplish? What type of commit-
ments does the company provide its customers and employees?13 A mission
statement is a clear definition of the organization’s business. It involves stat-
ing the business’s overall strategy, and may include what strengths the com-
pany has, what areas it wants to be in, who it is, and what it is trying to do. A
mission can be described as an organization’s raison d’être, or reason for be-
ing. It reflects the organization’s purpose and should describe its major ar-
eas of interest or intended actions. A mission should also include methods
used to satisfy market needs.

                     SUBJECT: The Nutrition/Dietetics Department
Mission Statement
     The basic purpose of this department is to use its resources to promote good nutrition.
This, of course, must be done in cooperation and coordination with other hospital depart-
ments. All activities must take place under the auspices and within the greater framework of
the hospital organization as a whole. Attention must be given to total patient care, as well as
to financial matters, as is appropriate for a profit-oriented health care center.
     Promoting good nutrition is a multifaceted task. It extends from providing nutritious, ap-
pealing, in-hospital food (for both patients and staff) to educating patients about the proper
diet to follow at home. It includes nutritional screening of incoming patients to determine if
nutritional intervention is necessary and the further assessment of those found to be at risk.
It includes making nutritional recommendations and consulting with nurses, physicians, and
other professionals. It also includes continuous training and education of the dietetics staff.
     Resources of the department include the expertise of a competent, caring staff of regis-
tered dietitians, and a well-trained complement of technicians, food service employees, and
other workers. Supplies, equipment, and financial resources provided by a multimillion-dollar
budget, as well as support and goodwill contributed by the parent hospital organization, also
assist the department in successfully fulfilling its mission.
Goals
 1. Timely delivery of patient meals that are both nutritious and appealing
 2. Successful operation of a convenient cafeteria that serves nutritious and appealing meals
    to employees
 3. Operation of an effective program of nutritional screening and assessment
 4. Operation of an educational program to benefit patients, the dietetics staff, other hospital
    staff, and the community
 5. Operation of the department in a financially responsible manner
 6. Operation of the department in a manner that complements overall hospital goals
 7. Operation of a comprehensive quality control program
Objectives
 1. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner tray service will commence precisely at 7:30, 11:00, and
    4:30 respectively at least 95 percent of the time.
 2. A staff dietitian will evaluate patient menus for nutrition and value with computer-assisted
    programs. Menus will be published in advance.
 3. Responses on patient questionnaires regarding food acceptability will increase from
    65 to 75 percent positive.
 4. Improvements in cafeteria food quality and convenience will promote a 25 percent in-
    crease in cafeteria revenues.
 5. A dietetics chart note will be placed in the medical record of 97 percent of the patients
    who are admitted on restricted diets.
 6. At least fifteen complete nutritional assessments will be performed by the department
    each week.
 7. A new, department-sanctioned, nutritional assessment worksheet will be developed and
    in use by July 31.
 8. A continuing education meeting will be held for registered dietitians once each month.
    Ninety percent attendance will be attained.
 9. Food service supervisors will conduct in-service programs at least two times per month.
10. Availability of community nutrition services will be advertised in the local media once
    each week.

12. A report from each area supervisor indicating compliance with the budget will be submit-
    ted each month.
13. Two hundred patient questionnaires regarding food quality will be collected and evalu-
    ated each quarter.
14. A system of peer evaluation will be developed by September 1 and in use by December 1.
15. A representative from the Dietetics Department will attend 90 percent of the hospital
    meetings and functions to which the department is invited.


   Stone advocates that for a mission statement to be effective it must be
simple to comprehend, relevant, and reliable, and that it should set the com-
pany apart from its competitors, as well as the fact that it should be written
in a positive tone to encourage commitment and energize all employees to-
ward fulfilling the mission. The mission statement should also be enduring
and adapted to the target audience. The target audience has a “bearing on the
length, tone, and visibility of the statement.” It is important to know who
you are writing for before you decide what to write.14
   Some of the important elements of the mission are the corporation’s
goals and objectives, philosophy, and its basic values, ambitions, and be-
liefs. The goal provides, in general terms, the basis for implementing its pol-
icies, objectives, strategies, and planning. The mission must be carefully
worded to provide proper direction. It should be designed with the participa-
tion of all members of the organization. Top-level management sets the vision
and acts as a mentor, leaving the details to the various levels of management
and/or committees. People involved and participating from the beginning are
more responsive and supportive of strategic planning and the change it brings.15
   In formulating strategic plans, management must encourage productive com-
munication. Many well-intentioned ideas are counterproductive without the
direction of a strategic plan. Since its inception in 1975, Microsoft’s mission
has been to create software for the personal computer that empowers and
enriches people in the workplace, at school, and at home. Similarly, Saturn
Corporation has done well even though it is a relatively new car company. It
has established itself as a different kind of company with a different kind of
car. The company’s mission statement follows:

       Saturn was created with one simple idea: to put people first. In the be-
       ginning, the focus was on creating a different kind of company, one
       dedicated to finding better ways for people to work together to design,
       build, and sell cars. . . . Saturn believes in taking better care of their
       employees and paying more attention to their customers’ needs. Today
       the company is dedicated to designing vehicles that complement cus-
       tomers’ daily lives.16
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                   15

Saturn’s main purpose is to focus on the small-car niche market, which
wants to buy a small, inexpensive, and reliable car.
    The mission statements of both companies strongly emphasize commit-
ment to providing the customer with a quality product through enthusiastic,
productive teamwork. This should enable these firms to remain strong and
continue to grow. Both companies have reached a high degree of success for
many reasons, but chiefly due to excellent employees, continuous improve-
ment, and dedication to achieving worthwhile goals. This dedication bene-
fits customers, the company, and employees’ personal lives.
    The mission of a financial institution could be to meet the financial ser-
vice needs of its customers (individuals and businesses). The institution
pursues a leadership position in the markets where it chooses to compete by
providing high-quality, differentiated products and exceptional customer
service. The institution seeks to penetrate existing markets, deliver products
and services to new geographical markets, and strategically manage the
business mix to achieve superior results. Notice that the goals of this institu-
tion are directed to its customers, future expansion, and industry domi-
nance. It plans to meet customer needs by providing superior customer ser-
vice and by offering different types of products and services. The institution
plans to dominate the industry by expanding market share in the current
market and expanding into new geographical areas. It also plans to maintain
stability while doing this by the use of strategic management.
    Every organization must have a purpose and stated mission. Peter Drucker
asserts that even though the question “What is our business?” is simple, it is
one that causes the most “frustration and failure” in an organization. Drucker
said that the answer to “What is our business?” begins by investigating cus-
tomers’ needs and wants.17 Derek Abell expanded this idea by using three
dimensions: “(1) customer groups, or who is being satisfied, (2) customer
needs or what is being satisfied, and (3) technologies, or how customer
needs are satisfied.”18 A clear and concise mission statement is invaluable. It
will give the company a firm foundation on which to stand.

Objectives and Goals

   The company’s mission must be turned into objectives and goals, the sec-
ond step in strategic planning. Goals are broad statements that present what
needs to be pursued in certain areas. Most businesses express their main
goal as maximizing stockholder wealth. The focus on maximizing short-
term return on investment (ROI) will overlook corporate competitiveness.
American managers are accused of focusing on short-term results rather
than a company’s long-term survival as a vital entity. They tend to establish
f16                        STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

strategies that expand the size of the company rather than profitability and
stockholder satisfaction. An organization’s goals depend on the nature of its
business and will stem from its mission. The organization’s market share,
technology, productivity, and profitability are all components of a desired
goal. Saturn’s goal is to infiltrate and dominate the market. They want to sell
cars at a very affordable price from extremely well-staffed and maintained
showrooms, with the auto industry’s best after-sales service. They also plan
to keep things simple and easy for their customers. Microsoft’s main goal is
to produce a product that customers want.
   A company always has a large number of objectives, which are stated in a
hierarchical fashion, from the most to the least important. They indicate the
desired result of planned activity. Not-for-profit organizational objectives
might not be specific or measurable. The objectives of for-profit organiza-
tions are the specific intended results. They are measurable and have a time
frame. There are three levels of objectives within an organization:

     1. Strategic or long-term objectives are usually set for the entire organi-
        zation and broadly stated.
     2. Intermediate objectives are usually more specific and increasingly
        complex and detailed. They are set for various strategic units or func-
        tions.
     3. Operational or short-term objectives are more specific than the previ-
        ous two and should be done on an individual or group level.

   Objectives and strategies are formed from strategists’ consideration of
mission, strategic policy, and appropriate information. When a firm oper-
ates outside its parent country, the objectives and other strategies might be
different. While the strategic management process is the same for domestic
and international management, the environment is often different. For ex-
ample, companies must adhere to different rules when operating abroad.
Therefore, strategies must be altered. Many multinational companies de-
pend on the superiority of some resources abroad such as capital, labor, or
technology. These organizations capitalize on advantage in order to over-
come weaknesses at home.
   Corporations conduct business abroad to achieve economies of scale, in-
crease market share, and reduce overall cost. Operating abroad may impose
limitations on organizations in setting objectives and designing strategies
because the host country’s needs and priorities may be different from those
of the parent country. For example, the host government, because of extra
cost, may limit efficiency levels. The utilization of certain resources may be
set at specified levels. Growth may be legislatively set, etc.
f                      Introduction to Strategic Management                  17

Corporate Philosophy

    Corporate philosophy is an important element of the corporate mission
statement. Corporate philosophy represents the basic beliefs, values, and as-
pirations of the chief executive officer and top-level management. It shows
how the company proposes to conduct business in the future as well as its
priorities. A philosophical creed is often developed to reflect the company’s
corporate culture. The creed usually describes a company’s responsibility to
its stakeholders (i.e., stockholders, employees, customers, management, and
communities at large). For example, a company’s responsibility to its stock-
holders can be to provide them with a fair return on their investment, to in-
troduce a new product, to purchase new equipment, etc. A company’s re-
sponsibility to its employees can be to provide them with a sense of security
on the job, give them safe working conditions, honor their dignity, appreci-
ate their merit, and provide fair compensation. Delivering immediate and
quality service, continuing to reduce costs, and maintaining reasonable prices
are good examples of corporate responsibilities toward customers.
    The learning-curve theory stipulates that efficiency (and thus cost sav-
ings) results when people continuously repeat a task. This applies to man-
agement decision making, as well as to assembly-line labor. There is evi-
dence, however, that the learning curve has limits—the significance of the
learning curve effect is greater in complex tasks and tends to decrease over
time.19

The Learning Organization

   Organizations need to continuously learn from their past experiences and
need to be willing to adapt a new position if they are to survive and prosper.
The learning organization is relatively a new trend in business that empha-
sizes systematic problem solving. This means that everyone in the organiza-
tion is engaged in identifying and solving problems, enabling the organiza-
tion to continuously improve and increase its capability. The interacting
systems that make up the learning organization resemble a network in which
each group communicates to and influences every other group. While top-
level management provides the vision for the development of strategies, em-
ployees assist in scanning the environment for critical information that is vi-
tal to the process. Information sharing requires adjustments on the part of
managers for the inclusion of employees, suppliers, and customers. Em-
ployee empowerment will encourage participation in the process of design-
ing strategies as well as in implementation. Transformational change in-
volves redesign and renewal of the total organization in which horizontal

Abstract
Strategic planning plays an important and key role in the success and survival of all kinds of business organizations. More specifically in the small and medium enterprises which are considered as the back bone of any economy in the present world. Though in current complex world the strategic planning is essential for any organization success in business arenas but the research from the perspective of constituent components of strategic planning is just at the starting point today. Similarly the research from strategic planning perspective in developing countries is very limited. Thus the literature of strategic planning at present is demanding more empirical studies to be conducted and more specifically in the context of small and medium enterprises of developing countries.

... However, although there are studies examining the direct relationship between strategic planning capability and firm performance (Charles, 2014;Grimmer et al. 2018), it is limited.Since the strategic planning capability is the ability of the firm to create strategic plans by considering the external environment (Yam et al., 2004), the firm should be as knowledgeable as possible about the external environment. Getting knowledge about the market, competitors, and customers is of great importance in terms of the strategic planning process and also plays a key role in determining the strengths and weaknesses of the organization as well as recognizing the opportunities and threats in the environment (Khan and Khalique, 2014).

Abstract
Purpose
This paper seeks to investigate the influence of the external environment on the choice of strategic management activities, from a chaos and complexity perspective, since a business environment is a complex adaptive system.
Design/methodology/approach
The study in this paper was of an exploratory nature, using the qualitative techniques of case study, depth interviews and document analysis to collect data from two companies each in the IT and packaging industries, namely, more successful/less successful companies.
Findings
The paper finds that first, it was proposed that more successful companies in turbulent environments would use radical, fast and disruptive strategies. Furthermore, strategy making should be a democratic, bottom‐up process and should be organic, self‐organising, adaptive and emergent. The results confirmed these propositions. Second, it was proposed that more successful companies in stable environments would use more traditional management and strategies and more formal strategy planning activities. The findings did not confirm this proposition, probably due to the fact that in reality a truly stable environment does not exist in South Africa.
Originality/value
This paper is of benefit to managers and strategists by emphasising a new way to consider the future management and strategies of their companies.
