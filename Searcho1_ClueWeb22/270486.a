So I've been asked whether dress codes are a good idea for schools. Hmm, this is an interesting topic. I need to think about this carefully and consider both sides of the argument.

First off, what exactly is a dress code? It's a set of rules that schools制定 for students to follow regarding what they can wear. These rules might include things like requiring uniforms, banning certain types of clothing, or specifying colors and styles.

I guess the main idea behind dress codes is to create a consistent and professional atmosphere in the school environment. Some people argue that dress codes can help reduce distractions, promote equality among students, and even improve academic performance. On the other hand, there are those who believe that dress codes stifle individual expression, can be unfair or discriminatory, and may not actually lead to better educational outcomes.

Let me start by looking into the potential benefits of dress codes.

One of the claimed benefits is that dress codes reduce distractions in the classroom. The idea is that if everyone is wearing similar clothing, there's less emphasis on fashion and appearances, which can help students focus more on their studies. I can see how that might make sense—less variety in attire could mean fewer opportunities for students to judge each other based on what they're wearing, which could lead to a more conducive learning environment.

Another advantage often cited is promoting equality. By requiring all students to wear the same type of clothing, dress codes can help minimize differences in socioeconomic status. If every student has to wear a uniform, then those who can't afford designer clothes aren't singled out or feel inferior. This could foster a sense of unity and belonging among students.

Additionally, some people believe that dress codes can improve academic performance. The theory here is that when students dress professionally, they feel more serious about their studies and are thus more likely to perform better academically. There might be some psychological basis to this; appearing more put-together could boost confidence and motivation.

Now, let's consider the potential downsides of dress codes.

One major criticism is that dress codes restrict personal expression. Clothing is often a way for students to express their identities, interests, and creativity. If schools impose strict dress codes, students may feel like they're not able to be themselves, which could lead to dissatisfaction and disengagement.

Moreover, there have been concerns about dress codes being enforced in a discriminatory manner, particularly against certain groups, such as girls or students of color. For example, rules around skirt lengths or hair styles might disproportionately affect female students or those with natural hairstyles. This can lead to feelings of injustice and may even have legal implications.

Another issue is that enforcing dress codes can be time-consuming and divert resources away from more important educational priorities. Teachers and administrators might spend significant time addressing dress code violations instead of focusing on teaching and student support.

Furthermore, there's debate about whether dress codes actually lead to improved academic outcomes. While some studies suggest a correlation between uniforms and better performance, others find no significant effect. It's possible that other factors, such as overall school culture and quality of education, play a bigger role in student achievement.

Let me see if I can find some data or research to support these points.

Does the Way Your Kids Dress Affect How They Do in School?
What kids wear to school is a source of angst for many parents and teachers. Revealing attire, low-riding jeans and T-shirts with slogans are often the choice for teens and even preteens, while schools try to enforce dress codes or even mandate school uniforms. Evidence as to whether a strict dress code that mandates school uniforms can affect grades, however, is mixed.
School Uniforms
School uniforms have some distinct benefits, according to a November 2009 article in the “Pacific Standard” magazine 2 ⭐. Uniforms decrease gang aggression, as all students are wearing the same styles and colors. For the same reason, the issue of students using clothing as a status symbol is less of a problem, and the uniforms foster a more business-like approach to academics. Trespassers on the school grounds are easily identified, and the uniforms have helped foster community identity and school spirit.
Dress Codes
Schools that adopt uniforms typically mandate styles and colors. Dress codes, on the other hand, are more likely to ban certain styles of clothing without dictating that students wear a particular color or style. One of the main reasons to implement dress codes, according to a November 2007 article in the "Fresno Pacific University News," is safety. The article notes that dress codes can reduce crime and make it less likely that students will bring weapons to school.
Effects of Uniforms
A study by the University of Houston, "Dressed for Success: Do School Uniforms Improve Student Behavior, Attendance and Achievement?" suggests that school uniforms can have an impact on students’ grades, attendance and behavior 3 ⭐. The study authors reviewed data from 160 schools in a large urban district. Although the biggest improvement was among female students, benefits were apparent for both genders in middle and high schools. Girls missed one day less of class in the school year and the schools were more likely to retain female students at all grade levels.
Uniforms and Academic Performance
In Long Beach Unified School district, one of the first to mandate uniforms, school crime decreased 36 percent, student fights dropped 51 percent and sexual offenses decreased 74 percent, according to “Pacific Standard.” Research is mixed, however, on whether uniforms improve academic performance, according to an article on the GreatSchools.org website 4 ⭐. In one study at Youngstown University, the researchers found uniforms improved attendance and graduation rates while decreasing suspension rates. The study did not show any improvement in academic performance. In another study at the University of Missouri, there was no correlation between uniforms and academic prowess.
Data is Mixed
A study reported in the 2009 “Educational Policy” analyzed data from two other studies from the National Center for Educational Statistics. Reading scores for students in the eighth and 10th grades were higher in schools that mandated uniforms. In all other respects, uniformed students in one study performed worse than students who did not wear uniforms. In the second study, students from private schools that mandated uniforms scored poorly in math and reading compared to schools that did not require uniforms. In public schools, uniforms made no difference in mathematics achievement. Catholic schools that mandated uniforms had lower scores in reading, science and history than comparable schools that did not require uniforms.

Dress code: Does it affect a student’s overall performance in school?
Ali Azad October 10, 2016
2 minutes read
For teens who love strutting around in their low-riding jeans or ultra-miniskirts, the strict dress code enforced by schools, is, at times downright oppressive. Though not all, there definitely are many students – irrespective of which country they hail from- who resent school uniforms.
Does school uniform affect your grades?
While enforcers argue that school uniforms have definite impact on students’ behavior and academic performance, students fail to actually fathom the “connection”. Let us find out what the truth is. In fact, instead of drawing an arbitrary conclusion, we will try to substantiate our claims with the help of results of a few studies, brought to light from time to time.
See also Students: Don’t let stress affect your performance
Right at the onset, we will try and bring the very basic function of school uniforms to the fore. A school generally has students hailing from diverse financial backgrounds. With the absence of a dress code in school, students flaunting more expensive clothes will unwittingly turn out to be a constant source of envy for those who can’t afford equally expensive clothes. Think about it! That’s not really a good space to be in – not for the one envying or the one being envied!
What do the studies have to say?
School uniforms do have distinct benefits. As per an article published in a famous magazine way back in 2009, uniforms play a major role in reducing gang aggression – primarily because every student of a particular school sports the same hue and style. Plus, there is no room for students using their dresses as status symbol. It renders an ambience conducive to harmony. Students can approach studies in a more serious way.

Mandate clothing can actually keep certain fashion out of the school premises without really “spelling out” a ban on the same. For instance, a student knows that he will have to comply with the dress code of the institution no matter how badly he wants to sport a pair of ripped jeans or pajamas. The school hasn’t officially banned them but has spelt out its mandatory dress code clearly.
Studies have even gone on to suggest that school uniforms do impact students’ grades, behavior and attendance. Around 160 schools in an urban district were surveyed and it was established that both male and female students demonstrated improvement in middle and high schools. Though girls in general showed higher rate of improvement, both the genders showed some kind of betterment nonetheless. In an academic year, girls missed one day less in school.

Should school students wear a uniform? Students' image via www.shutterstock.com
In a growing number of school districts across the nation, students must wear a uniform.
This is not the stereotypical school uniform associated with Catholic schools – pleated plaid skirt with a blouse for girls; a button-down shirt, a necktie and dark pants for boys. Instead, these are mostly khaki and blue or khaki and red shirt/blouse and skirt/pants uniforms.
According to the US Department of Education, wearing a uniform can decrease the risk of violence and theft, instill discipline and help school officials recognize intruders who come to the school.
As a former teacher, principal and superintendent and now a policy and law scholar, I am skeptical about such claims.
Research on the effects of school uniforms is still nascent. And the findings on the impact of school uniforms on student behavior, discipline, connection to the school, attendance and academic gains is at best mixed.
Lawsuits, protests, individuality
About half of schools around the country have dress codes policies. A dress code identifies what clothes cannot be worn to school.  A school uniform policy defines what clothes must be worn to school. Dress codes limit clothing options while school uniforms define clothing options.
Schools claim that when students come in uniforms, it improves discipline and leads to academic gains. The Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana enacted a uniform policy in 2001 in order to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems.
However, such mandatory policies that decide what students can or cannot wear to schools, have led to free speech violations lawsuits. Students allege such policies are unconstitutional, as they restrict their freedom of expression.
There have been nine lawsuits up to 2014. School districts have won almost all the cases, except one, where an appeals court found the uniform policy of a Nevada school unconstitutional. The school required students to wear shirts emblazoned with the school motto, “Tomorrow’s Leaders,”  which the court found to be a violation of students’ free speech rights.
In addition, students have protested in their schools as well.
An example of student and parental reaction to school uniforms is found in my home state of New Hampshire when Pinkerton Academy, a private secondary school, considered adopting a “uniform dress code” (a school uniform).
Students in an online protest wrote:
[A school uniform] takes away individuality. Also, [it] will not change study habits of students. [It means] too much money [needs to be spent] for each child. Parents do not have that type of money, especially in this economy. We have the right to freedom of expression and would like to keep it that way.“ [And] "its [sic] my right to wake up in the morning and have my own unique individuality.”
Mixed impact of school uniforms
A more important question is whether there is any evidence to show that mandatory uniform policies can lead to improved student outcomes.
Research shows mixed results: it’s true that some studies show a reduction in the incidence of misbehavior. But then, there are others that show an increase in student suspensions. A few others show no significant change in student misbehavior.
Research shows mixed results of the  impact of school uniforms on student behavior. Student image via www.shutterstock.com
For example, a 2010 study in a large urban school district in the Southwest found that asking students to wear uniforms did not result in any change in the number of suspensions for elementary school students.
In fact, middle and high school students experienced a significant increase in suspensions.
By contrast, a 2003 study that used a large national data set concluded that elementary and middle schools with school uniforms had fewer student behavior problems.
But, again, it found that high schools had a greater frequency of misbehavior.
Interestingly, even when evidence is available, educators’ perceptions could be at odds with it. For example, a study of educators in 38 North Carolina high schools found that 61% of the responding principals and assistant principals believed that there was a reduction in cases of misbehavior on campus when school uniforms were introduced. In reality, the data showed no change in incidents of crime, violence and suspensions.
Similarly, research on the efficacy of school uniforms on increasing student attendance and achievement is conflicted. For example, one study concluded that school uniforms resulted in increased student achievement and increased attendance.
However, another study found little impact on academics at all levels and little evidence of improvement in attendance for girls and drop in attendance for boys.
Implications for policy
So, what does lack of consistent research mean for policy?
In my view, it does not mean that schools should not implement such policies. It does mean, however, that educators must be clear about the goals that they hope to achieve with mandating school uniforms.
There is often a cost associated with mandatory school uniform policies. Lawsuits and community reactions can take up scarce resources of time and money.
Decreased discipline problems, increased attendance and increased academic achievement may not be achieved just by wearing khaki and blue. But there may be other benefits, such as, it could help a school promote its brand through a uniform look. School uniform may also serve as symbol of commitment to academic achievement.
The point is that clarity of purpose and outcome is necessary before students don their uniform in the morning.
I believe school uniforms may be part of a broad array of programs and approaches that a school may adopt to bring change. However, as a standalone measure, it implies that schools are simply trying to find an easy fix for difficult and complex problems.
School uniforms alone cannot bring about a sustained or large-scale change.

Email Address:
Over the past decade, the school dress code has become an increasingly common policy in many communities worldwide. As opposed to the requirements of students to wear specific clothing in the form of uniforms, dress codes provide guidelines through which students are allowed to wear any clothing that meets the school's requirements, whether they pertain to the color, style or cut of the clothing. Consequently, school dress codes are designed to create a certain atmosphere in a school while providing students with a bit of freedom of expression through their wardrobe.
And yet, while many parents applaud the demand of school dress codes as a way to ensure that their children are dressed properly, others question whether the requirement of dress codes in school eliminates their child's individualism.
Experts claim that there are many benefits of school dress codes. Here are some of the most important advantages:
1) A dress code promotes a more serious school atmosphere which emphasizes academics and promotes good behavior.
2) Dress codes have proven to increase student achievement by encouraging students to concentrate more on their studies and less on their wardrobe. A de-emphasis on clothing can also save money, as there will be less pressure to keep up with expensive trends and fashions.
3) Dress codes in school settings reduce social conflict and peer pressure that may be associated with appearance.
4) Studies indicate that a school dress code can reduces the prevalence of certain behaviors which are often expressed through wardrobe such as violence or promiscuity.
5) As opposed to uniforms, dress codes still allow students to wear what they want which leaves students with a sense of choice and expression.
While teenagers will always find a way to express themselves, imposing boundaries can prevent them from resorting to extremes that can sometimes lead to undesirable consequences. School dress codes are a way to teach students the importance of a respectable appearance which is a lesson that can positively impact their self-respect and self-esteem.

Do School Uniforms Really Improve Student Academic Performance?

Why should students wear uniforms? And why not? The school uniforms debate continues. Unfortunately, the benefits of school uniforms and reasons why students should not wear uniforms are hopelessly trapped in a complicated draw, and it looks to be the case for the foreseeable future, with neither side gaining a definitive advantage over the other. Do school uniforms improve student academic performance? Not necessarily. Do school uniforms infringe on students’ rights? Maybe.  Granted, student academic performance is not reliant on uniforms, but the pro-uniform argument also holds water.
By expounding on the advantages and disadvantages of school uniforms, this article takes a more incisive look at the issue:
Student safety
It’s true that student achievement does not depend on school uniforms. But student safety is, at least, partially dependent on it. It does not require expert researchers, like those of CustomEssayMeister, to conclude that serious incidences involving students are significantly less in schools that have uniforms. Uniforms, along with strict identification measures, ensure that strangers on campus can easily be spotted and apprehended. Naturally, unpleasant incidences are averted.
Verdict: Advantage
Additional cost
Should schools have uniforms? In private school uniforms, that’s the norm, especially parochial ones, and parents understand and are capable of shouldering the cost. What about in public schools where not all students can pay? Even if a drastic measure is implemented to make uniforms as cheap as possible, it will still be a burden to financially-strapped families.
Verdict: Disadvantage
Photo Credit: Deposit Photos
Inclusivity
Uniforms arguably foster a sense of inclusivity and promote among students healthy school pride and community spirit, especially when representing their school colors. Due to “uniformity” and a “sense” of equality at least in clothing, uniforms can curb instances of victimizations based on dress sense or absence thereof. In the same manner, if provided free of charge in public schools, prejudices appertaining to perceived socioeconomic differences might not be realistically eradicated, but they at least can be curtailed. Undeniably, less bullying and victimizations on school grounds easily translate to increased self-esteem. Increased self-esteem in students, combined with discipline stemming from uniforms, in turn, results in more harmonious school life.
Verdict: Quite an advantage
The truth is obvious
The “inclusivity” is judged as only quite an advantage because it gets debunked by the truth. In schools wherein students belong to more or less the same socioeconomic bracket, the notion could be true.  But in public schools where students are from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, uniforms are ineffective. Wearing of uniforms cannot conceal students who come from poorer households. No student can deny that he only has one blazer or pair of pants and has to wear them all the time. In this respect, uniforms are not conducive.
Verdict: Disadvantage

Borders on authoritarian
It is plausible for parents to view uniforms as a way for schools to restrict the students’ freedom of expression and individuality. Indeed, the school uniforms debate is such a politically contentious one. While there are obvious benefits to students, the likelihood of an authoritarian implementation of uniforms remains, which poses a legitimate threat to the overall efficacy of the teaching and learning process. In what manner? One might ask. Firstly, it must be noted that educators view uniforms differently than students do. Students opposed to school uniforms are likely to strategize to deviate from the school uniform policy. Thus, mild alterations or changes in the way uniforms are worn (e.g., shorter ties in males, skirt length in females) could negatively influence the approach of teachers. As a result, they might place unnecessary emphasis on the proper wearing of uniform rather than on actual teaching and learning.
Verdict: Disadvantage
The absence of hard evidence
Do school uniforms improve students’ grades? While there is evidence that there is indeed a positive impact of school uniforms on student behavior, proving a direct correlation between student uniforms and excellent student academic performance is a daunting task, simply because there is no solid supporting evidence. A case in point, a research conducted in the United Kingdom in 2018 assessed that even though non-uniform schools comprised only 20% of the 100 top-performing schools across the country, an alarming 40% of “ties-and-khaki-pants-and-blazers” schools disappointingly failed to reach the government’s requirement of 30% of students exhibiting exemplary performance in languages and sciences, demonstrating a huge gap in learning among their students. On the other hand, while the non-uniform schools did not massively outdo their uniformed counterparts, they were much more consistent and collectively better – nobody lagged miserably.
Verdict: Disadvantage
Do school uniforms improve student academic performance? No. Do they affect student behavior as it were? Partly, in some cases. For such an uncomplicated question, there is no clear answer. This stalemate shall likely remain until a concrete causal relationship between school uniforms and sustained academic excellence is duly established. Uniforms have advantages and disadvantages, but the decision to implement it should depend on schools alone, and not be treated as a must. The grave mistake that educators all over the world still commit to this day is to attribute academic excellence and good behavior of students to uniforms, failing to realize that the trademark of a good academic institution is holistic learning, both in academics, ethics, and morals. Uniforms, ideally, should only be for aesthetic purposes.

Alright, so from these articles, it seems like there are arguments both for and against dress codes in schools. Let's try to summarize the main points.

First, the benefits of dress codes:

1. **Promotes a serious school atmosphere:** Dress codes can create an environment that emphasizes academics and good behavior.

2. **Increases student achievement:** By reducing the focus on clothing, students might concentrate more on their studies. It can also save money for families since there's less pressure to keep up with fashion trends.

3. **Reduces social conflict and peer pressure:** When everyone wears similar clothes, there's less opportunity for bullying or teasing based on appearance.

4. **Curbs certain behaviors:** Some studies suggest that dress codes can reduce instances of violence or promiscuity expressed through clothing.

5. **Allows some freedom of expression:** Unlike uniforms, dress codes still give students some choice in what they wear.

On the other hand, there are drawbacks to consider:

1. **Cost:** Implementing dress codes, especially in public schools, can be an additional financial burden for families who may already be struggling.

2. **Ineffectiveness in some cases:** In public schools with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, dress codes might not eliminate all forms of discrimination or bullying based on appearance.

3. **Restriction of individuality:** Some argue that dress codes infringe on students' rights to express themselves through their clothing.

4. **Potential for authoritarian enforcement:** There's a risk that schools might become too rigid in enforcing dress codes, leading to conflicts between students and educators.

5. **Lack of direct evidence linking dress codes to academic improvement:** While there are some studies suggesting positive impacts on behavior, there isn't concrete evidence that dress codes directly improve academic performance.

Given these points, it seems like dress codes can have some positive effects, but they're not a silver bullet for improving education. Schools need to consider the specific needs and contexts of their student populations when deciding whether to implement dress codes.

Maybe I should look into some specific examples or case studies to get a better understanding.

31 Top School Dress Code Examples & Ideas (2022)
31 Top School Dress Code Examples & Ideas
By Chris Drew, PhD /  July 17, 2021
School dress codes should give a clear set of rules and guidelines to students and parents about what is (and is not acceptable) to wear at school. It should be simple, gender-neutral, and enforced evenly across the school.
The dress code needs to be devised with community and student consultation to ensure the community’s views are respected. If you are in a community with a lot of religious or cultural minority members, it’s worth consulting them so their concerns and standards are included.
Furthermore, many dress rules can be considered discriminatory against girls and forcing girls to change their behavior to avert the ‘male gaze’. So, consult your community thoroughly.
Disclaimer: I’m not recommending you follow all of these dress codes, or endorsing any of them personally. But they’re all worth looking at to decide for yourself whether you should or should not put them in your school dress policy based on your own school’s and community’s values. Depending on your circumstances, there might be some laws that you need to think about. For example, in the United States, there are rulings by the Supreme Court allowing students freedom of expression (See Point 6). Furthermore, many states require gender-inclusive uniforms (Listed in Point 22).
School Dress Code Examples
1. Exceptions and Respect for Religious and Cultural Attire
First and foremost, your dress code policy will have to have clear and respectful exceptions for religious and cultural attire.
For example, if you have students in your school that need to wear something on their head for religious reasons, this should be respected, even if you have a general no hats policy.
Another example where exceptions might be made is in allowing Sikh students to wear kirpans (ceremonial knives) as with most schools in Canada.
These exceptions may need to be looked at on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with your local community.
2. Girls can wear Shorts
Another tough issue many schools have come afoul of in recent years is the right for girls to wear shorts. Many elite schools used to force girls to wear skirts and not allow them to wear shorts.
Today, this is increasingly unacceptable. And it appears the charge is led by girls themselves who believe that wearing shorts can help them to:
Participate more fully in Physical Education.
Be more comfortable sitting at desks.
By allowing girls to wear shorts, you’ll give them more freedom and comfort, and avoid potential future conflicts.
3. Cover your Thighs
Dress codes should insist that shorts and dresses should be of a certain length. If this is not clearly stated in the dress policy, there will inevitably be problems with outfits that are too sexualized for a school context.
One rule is the ‘closed fist rule’. The student should be able to hold their arms straight down their site with a clenched fist. The bottom of the shirts or skirt should be below (longer than) the extended arm with a clenched fist.
You could also add 2 – 3 inches to this policy by adapting it as the ‘extended finger rule’.
4. Keep Underwear Hidden
The hidden underwear rule is one of the key foundations of all school dress codes. This applies to underwear pointing out above (or below) pants and shorts, as well as to bras for girls.
This rule should also apply to wearing longer clothing that is designed to be underwear, such as thermal underwear (aka Long Johns) and girls’ nightslips.
5. No Offensive Logos, Images, and Text
T-shirts that state anything that could be seen as offensive on them (toward minorities, political affiliations, etc.) could be banned by a school. This can extend to both written text and logos that are known to be associated with known hate groups.
Images may also be offensive, such as depictions of deities (particularly offensive in Islam) or cartoons that may be interpreted as offensive.
6. No Clothing with a Political Affiliation (Beware: US First Amendment Rights Rulings)
A blanket ban on clothing with political affiliation may sound like a good idea, but if you’re in the United States, this is a complex issue.
In 1969, the Supreme Court ruled students were allowed to wear black armbands to protest the Vietnam law. This court ruling found that freedom of expression was a protected first amendment right, even within school grounds.
Similarly, a Seventh Circuit ruling affirm a student’s right to wear a T-shirt that read: “Be Happy, Not Gay.”[1]
And according to the Rhode Island ACLU, students have a protected right to wear clothing with political slogans on it, including clothing that is critical of politicians.
However, in a conflicting finding, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling found students do not have a constitutional right to wear homophobic and anti-gay clothing.[1]
So, it’s complicated and a tough issue for schools to navigate!
In other countries, and potentially also in private schools, it’s likely that clothing with political affiliations may be banned.
7. No Brand Names
A school may also choose to ban brand name clothing. This is very common in Waldorf schools, where commercialization is considered corruptive to children’s freedom and innocence. Such schools embrace the idea of a clean aesthetic that removes distractions and the ‘adult world’ from children’s lives, freeing them up for their own play.
As the Eugene Waldorf School in Oregon states on their dress code:
“It is asked that children be sent to school in clothes that are free of large commercial logos and any characters so that the child’s own being can shine, without the distractions and commercial consciousness such logos and characters are so apt to bring into the classroom.”
8. No Exposed Midriffs
It’s common for students to want to expose the midriff (the area between chest and waist) to stay up to date with fashions of pop stars. In some subcultures, it can also be common for students to display a belly button piercing.
Depending on the age of the students and school ethos, you may choose to ban exposed midriffs.
One common way to achieve this is to create a rule: coverage from collar bone to thigh (following the closed fist rule for the thigh length).
9. Jewelry must not Dangle (Studs Recommended)
This rule is primarily for student safety. Loose and dangling jewelry can cause serious damage to students. Earring that can catch on clothing or even excessively large necklaces can cause safety problems.
However, beware that some people may choose to wear jewelry for religious or cultural purposes, which may need to be respected.
Annesley Primary School’s jewelry policy provides some good guidelines:
Discourage the wearing of jewelry except for religious or cultural requirements.
Only allow stud earring.
Taping over jewelry for non-contact sport.
Removing jewelry for contact sport.
10. Hats must not be Worn Indoors
Some people consider wearing a hat indoors to be a sign of disrespect. Furthermore, wearing a hat indoors seems impractical – hats are for protection from the sun!
However, this can be tough. Many girls integrate novelty headwear into their hairstyles, which they cannot easily remove. So, it’s worth discouraging headwear that cannot be removed.
Furthermore, many religions require head coverings, including:
Islam – Hijabs, Niqabs, and Burqas.
Judaism – Yarmulkes and Tichels
Sikhism – Dastars
I’m sure there are many others, so a blanket exception for genuine religious headwear may be required.
11. Hats must be Worn during Lunch Breaks
While we discourage the wearing of hats indoors, you may require students to wear hats during recess and lunch.
In fact, this is an overwhelmingly common requirement in Australian primary schools where the sun can cause serious damage to children. In fact, melanoma cancer (a cancer caused by sun exposure) is one of the most common cancers in Australia.
While less common in the Northern Hemisphere, mandatory hats (and sun block) can be a good way for your school to instil in students positive safety and sun awareness habits, particularly during the warmer school months.
12. No Gang Affiliation Insignia
Gang presence in schools is a threat to student safety and can make students feel very uneasy. The threat of gang recruitment in schools is very real in many parts of the United States.
To counteract the influence and visibility of gangs in schools, you can put in place a rule banning gang colors and brands. This study highlights that school principals believe uniform policies can decrease gang presence in schools.
I’ve also found reports of banning of brand names that gangs affiliate with, such as banning Dickies clothing in a school in Georgia because gangs started using Dickies as a sign of gang affiliation.
13. No Reference to Illegal or Controlled Substances
Illegal and controlled substances include illicit drugs as well as substances children are not allowed to consume, such as alcohol and tobacco.
Banning reference to these substances is common sense. If it’s illegal for children to consume these substances, then of course it makes sense that they should also not advertise them on their clothing.
14. No Pyjamas
Pyjama day at school can be a whole lot of fun, but wearing of pyjamas outside of the novelty of PJs day could cause some problems.
It could be argued that wearing pyjamas is a sign of disrespect and doesn’t uphold community standards. These are clothing for lounging and sleeping rather than working and studying.
But, others might argue that what you wear has nothing to do with how well you study. It could seem like an arbitrary rule.
This is a rule worthy of a debate!
15. No Shoulders
More common in private and religious schools, the ‘no shoulders’ rule is still around. It’s nowhere near as common as it used to be, and many parents and students are protesting that this rule still exists.
If you insist on ‘no shoulders’, make sure you community is on board with the rule and you’ve got clear consent before implementing it.
16. Tops must have Shoulder Straps
In the past, it was considered unacceptable for girls to show their shoulders or knees in public. As society has liberalized, it’s now generally seen as okay for girls to show their shoulders and knees in most parts of the world.
But many people draw the line at ‘tube tops’ that don’t have straps holding the top up at the shoulders. A key concern here is that the tops will too easily fall down, especially during sports lessons.
17. No Cleavage (‘Armpit to Armpit’ rule)
Your community may expect you to uphold a standard where cleavage is not shown.
For this, the ‘armpit to armpit rule’ helps. The student should be able to draw a line from one armpit to the other and have anything below those points to be covered by clothing. It ensures low-cut V-neck shirts are banned.
18. Winter Coats Must be Carried Between December 15 and February 15
Colder places should consider a winter dress code that ensures students are dressed for the conditions. This can include ensuring all students wear winter coats to school between certain dates, depending upon the climate where you are.
In particularly cold areas (including schools I’ve taught at in Canada), you may even insist on full winter gear, including waterproof winter pants, and beanies.
19. No Makeup
Elementary and middle schools more commonly have this rule than high schools, but it is a known policy across several different types of schools. This Catholic school, for example, allegedly forced girls to take out their fake eyelashes so they were compliant with the school’s no makeup policy.
A key reason for this policy is to de-emphasize vanity that can occur when students choose to wear makeup. Childhood is a short period of life, and it should be protected from adult activities such as wearing makeup.
But some people have expressed concern that a no makeup policy can be harmful to students. Students who are bullied for pimples or acne scars may feel more comfortable if they are able to apply makeup to their faces.
If you choose to accept moderate amounts of makeup at the school, you could create rules around the more visible features, such as simply banning excessive lipstick and fake eyelashes while allowing students to still use foundation.
Similarly, you could provide age limits (e.g. no makeup before Year 10).
20. Covered Shoes at all Times
Covered shoes is a safety measure more than anything. Usually, we would consider covered shoes to be shoes that cover the whole foot up to the ankle. This would effectively ban sandals and flip flops.
There are two safety-related reasons to ban non-covered shoes.
Firstly, it is hard to participate in sports when wearing shoes that don’t grip fully around your feet. In games like soccer and football, students may also have their feet stepped on from above, so covered shoes will protect the top of the feet as well.
Secondly, covered shoes are often required for science lab classes to protect the feet from potential spills during experiments.
21. No High Heels
High heeled shoes can be perceived by some community members as inappropriate for children.
Firstly, they are not appropriate for some activities in the classroom and school ground such as playing games during the lunch break.
Secondly, they may be considered to be inappropriately speeding-up the end of childhood. High heels are, by and large, adult attire. Some could argue that children should be discouraged from aspiring to be adults too soon.
And thirdly, it may even be bad for the feet to wear high heels before the foot is fully grown. This is why Dr. Ramona Brooks of the American Podiatric Medical Association recommends in this article that children don’t wear high heels until about 16 years of age.
22. Gender Neutrality
In an age where we are increasingly acknowledging gender identity expression, as defined by gender self-identification and not biological sex, many schools and teachers will come across situations within their classrooms where they will be working with trans and gender non-conforming students.
A modern school dress code is likely going to want to develop a gender-neutral dress code that allows boys and girls the same freedoms to dress in ways that make them feel comfortable.
Schools should be aware of this potentially difficult (and highly political) issue when creating the dress code. Solutions could include:
Choosing not to refer to ‘boys and girls’ in their dress codes.
Explicitly stating that dress codes are for both
Explicitly affirming children’s rights to dress according to their gender expression.
Furthermore, it’s important to note that the following states require by law that you affirm the right to self-identified gender expression within a school dress code: California, Connetticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Washington, and District of Columbia.
23. No Tattoos
While you wouldn’t think too many school-aged people would have tattoos, it appears some schools do explicitly ban visible tattoos.
This is one of the dress codes that I would classify as a ‘preserving (western) childhood’ dress code. In many cultures, it’s not inherently offensive to be tattooed as a child (Maori tattoo their children with traditional Ta Moko tattoos from age 15 ).
However, western culture preferences the delaying of ‘adult activities’ such as getting tattoos until your early 20s. By banning tattoos, schools are reaffirming their commitment to drawing a clear line between childhood and adulthood, where students remain ‘children’ at least until graduation.
24. No Hair Dye
This is a rule that I think is common enough that you see it around, but is also in less than 50% of school dress codes in my estimation.
Many children like to experiment with hair dye and many parents don’t have a problem with this. But, schools that like to keep a clean and professional image may consider dying hair to be undermining the school’s brand.
Pink and purple hair dying is often also associated with the alternative punk music subculture, which similarly is seen as anti-authoritarian and runs against the culture of some more conservative schools and their communities.
Some schools also explicitly allow natural hair dye colors, but disallow non-natural colors like blues, purples and pinks.
25. Bring a Separate Sports Outfit for Physical Education Classes
Some schools insist on a separate sports dress code. This helps for a number of reasons.
Firstly, it ensures students are dressed in clothing that will allow them to do strenuous exercise without the clothing getting in the way. Sports clothing should usually be loose fitting and allow you to stretch your limbs in directions that non-sports clothing (such as skirts) does not.
Secondly, it means students can change out of their sweat-drenched clothing, which spares everyone the discomfort of sitting in a room full of sweaty, smelly teenagers.
Sometimes, it’s possible to create a specialized uniform for sports lessons, which can even be sponsored by local community businesses.
26. No Non-Prescription Sunglasses Indoors
Sometimes students believe it’s cool to wear sunglasses indoors. As a general rule, it’s considered rude to wear sunglasses indoors. Not only is there no sun inside, but it also prevents you from being able to look one another in the eyes.
One small complication is that some students wear prescription glasses that have a dark sun-blocking lens. These students will need an exception to allow them to use the glasses for prescription purposes.
27. No Distracting Hairstyles
This is a dress code policy that I see a lot and find quite vague. I assume it relates to hairstyles such as:
Mohawks
Spikes
Beehives
Extreme Afros
Clearly, mohawks and beehives can be overly distracting for students in a classroom because it can block other students’ view of the teacher and front of the classroom.
But the problem with this rule is that it often comes into conflict with the hairstyles of minority cultural groups. For example, cornrow and dreadlock hairstyles are commonly associated with people of African heritage (including African-Americans). By banning this hairstyle, you are facing the risk of being accused of suppressing minority cultural expression in the school.
28. No Body-Hugging Clothing
Tight body-hugging clothing can include:
Yoga pants.
Muscle shirts.
Tight dresses.
This clothing may at times be considered unacceptable by community standards. Parents may consider them to be emphasizing adult behaviors, such as body-building to ‘show off your muscles’ at school.
Similarly, tight-fitting dresses and pants may be considered overly sexualized for children to wear.
29. Jeans and Pants to be worn at the Hips
In the early 2000s, there was a sub-cultural fashion trend of wearing your jeans very low around the waist. It would often lead to exposure of underwear and (according to parents) being an untidy look.
At this time, many schools instigated bans on pants being worn low and began insisting on having them worn at or above the hips. I recall my school had spare belts in the front office to lend out to students contravening this policy!
30. No Tears or Holes in Clothing
To preserve the clean look of a school, you could also insist on clothing that isn’t torn or ripped.
This allows the school to insist that children with torn shirts throw those shirts away and but fresh shirts that aren’t likely to hook onto obstacles (or tear further) during sporting activities.
Some jeans are sold with holes and rips in the knees as a fashion statement. So, this rule would need to be put in place with fair warning to parents so they can make purchase decisions well in advance.
You could also loosen this rule by saying jeans can’t have tears above the knees, allowing for the torn fashion to be tolerated in a more modest way.
31. No See-Through Clothing
Summer dresses and light tops can be see-through in the wrong light.
See-through clothing can cause parents and community members to be offended. It may also embarrass the person wearing the clothes (especially if they weren’t aware that it was see-through!).
So, it’s worth banning see-through clothing in order to avoid embarrassment for students and prevent a potential community backlash to students’ outfits.
Conclusion
As you can surely realize, school dress codes are incredibly controversial. You will be laying out what your school’s values are and how traditional you’re planning to be. There’s potential to insult religious groups, cultural minorities, and LGBTQI+ people, who all should be consulted in order for an inclusive policy to be put into place. Furthermore, some policies that used to be commonplace may now be seen as oppressive toward women, so women must be central to the consultation process.
Personally, I belive gaining the consent of the community is essential. If your school is private, founded on certain values, or of a stated religious persuasion, it can be easier to both devise and enforce a dress code because you have a basis on which you can rely for the founding of the policy.
As you can see, school dress code policies are highly dependent on the type of school and the community setting in which the school is situated.

While there are a plethora of problems within the American school system, in this paper we will focus on the growing issue of how dress codes disproportionally target female students and the negative effects this has on their self-view. The first ever school dress code was established in “1969 by the U.S. Supreme Court case Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District” (School Dress Codes). This historical court case permitted schools to limit student expression, so long as there is a legitimate reason behind it. States today have utilized that decision to mandate their own laws that permit schools to create dress codes to “promote a safe, disciplined school environment, prevent interference with school work and discipline, and to encourage uniformity of student dress” (School Dress Codes).
The intended purpose of dress code, in of itself, is a positive one meant to further prepare students for the workforce and its expectations. However, the problems come along when schools decided what attire is considered a distraction and how to go about punishing dress code violations. In order to explore the harmful effects of school dress codes, we will analyze it from a sociological perspective rather than a traditional psychological one. In sociology, there are three major paradigms when it comes to sociological thinking and understanding. To further discuss the harmful effects of school dress code on both male and female students we will view it from the sociological perspective of Symbolic Interactionism. In a general sense, Symbolic Interactionists analyze the world by dissecting “how people act on the basis of meaning they attribute to others” and how “people continuously reinterpret and reevaluate their knowledge and information in everyday encounters” (Benokraitis, 19). Moreover, when talking specifically about education, Symbolic interactionist focus on “individual and small group issues, such as teacher-student interactions and the self-fulfilling prophecy” (Mooney, 339). With both of those bits of information in mind, the issue of dress code policies will be analyzed one the same level, in that, the negative affects school dress code can have on female students self-fulfilling prophecy.
The main way this issue will be dissected within Symbolic interactionism will be with labeling theory. A theory developed by Howard Becker that states, “society’s reaction to behavior is a major fact in defining oneself or others as deviant” (Benokraitis, 132). The whole issue of school’s dress code boils down to labeling theory because by design, the whole purpose of dress code is to define clothing considered deviant and punishing students who violate the rules of dress. In most American schools, any clothing that shows a considerable amount of skin is liable for a dress code violation; this includes tops that expose shoulders, ripped jeans, any dress, skirt or short that is above the knee, jeggings, and more extremely, coming to school in excessively tight clothing. This type of clothing, specifically, is determined to be a distraction to the learning environment and thus students face, suspension, detention, or a disciplinary write up for wearing them. Clothing that qualifies as a dress code violation disproportionally targets female students as “many dress codes are explicitly gender specific or are at least selectively enforced such that they impact female students disproportionately” (Meredith). And it is this that is the heart of the problem with school dress code. By continuing to tell girls their body and how they decide to dress their body is under inspection and scrutiny presents a problematic message, “one in which women are frequently sexualized and portrayed as ―sex objects” to both male and female students. (Meredith). As it can safely be assumed, female students do not buy clothes and get dressed for school with the sole purpose of disrupting the learning environment and arousing their fellow classmates.
However, some school administrators uphold attitudes that lead us to believe otherwise based off their behaviors displayed toward female students. When parents approach schools with their concerns with updating current dress code policies, “A common thread among school justifications for sex-specific dress codes is that provocative clothing will distract their male classmates or make male teachers feel uncomfortable” (Meredith). One example of this line of thinking can be found at Honesdale High School where Kate Wilson was removed from class after she was told that her outfit of a baggy T-shirt and leggings was “making the teachers uncomfortable” and her principle stated how “distracting it was to see [Wilson] walk upstairs” (Lakritz). Another, perhaps, a more condemning example can be found at a Forest Hill high school where a female was given an in school suspension for wearing ripped jeans and told: “that she needed to consider the guys in her class and their hormones when choosing her wardrobe” (Lakritz). While these may just be two examples, the message sent by some school dress codes and their administrators is very clear: a female student’s right to education is beneath male right to comfort.
A secondary message that dress code implies to female students, is one of body shaming. In most American high school dress codes, there are rules against clothing that is considered “excessively tight or form fitting”. While this rule is fine in of itself, the grievances come along when girls with specific body types become targets. It is largely unreasonable to believe that all adolescent girls will have the same body type and that all clothing will fit them the same; which is why many people believe: if you will not permit one student to wear it, there should be no exceptions to the rule. However, a South Carolina principle seems to think differently; as he was reported telling a female student, “unless you are a size zero or two and you wear something like that, even though you’re not fat, you look fat” (Lakritz). This statement was brought on as the reasoning behind her dress code violation when wearing leggings and it is very easy to see how damaging that line of thinking can be on a girl’s body image. Another example of this ideology is shown when seventeen-year-old Kelsey Anderson was allegedly told she violated dress code by being “busty” and “plus size” and forced to leave the room. (Lakritz). In both instances, the student was clearly told that her body, and not the clothes directly, were the problem and that they deserved to be punished for it. In both cases, girls of smaller sizes were permitted to wear the same outfits, but because they had larger bodies, under dress code it became a problem of form-fitting clothing. By openly telling students that one body type is acceptable while the other is problematic, administrators present an environment open to body shaming. This is especially concerning when you consider the tendency of young girls to “internalize cultural perspectives on their physical selves, conceiving of themselves in sexual terms preoccupied with physical attractiveness” (Meredith). This toxic line of thinking can easily lead to a girl developing a harmful self-image which later could give way to the development of eating disorders. Outside of school dress code teaching girls that their bodies are sexual, this toxic attitude towards young girls and their choice of dress teaches male students that “girls’ bodies are inherently sexual, provocative, dangerous, and that harassment is inevitable” (Meredith).
By siting male comfort as the reason behind why girls should cover up and labeling certain clothes and by extent girls who wear those clothes as deviant, school dress codes are further perpetuating the idea that “boys will be boys” and clothes dictate consent. If male students are constantly shown and told that girls who dress “provocatively” are the problem, it can lead to a man who holds and later imposes those same beliefs. Often time in rape cases, what a woman was wearing is used as justification behind the crime, as many people believe that “women dressed in provocative clothing invited sexual advances and placed themselves at risk of sexual assault” (Johnson). The type of clothing that is considered provocative in adult life, is often the exact same type of clothing that was considered deviant and a distraction by school dress codes during childhood. As when asking men what clothing is considered provocative and an invitation for sex, they commonly refer to clothing such as shirts with “low necklines, short skirts, and tight and clinging clothes” (Johnson). When you take this attitude towards the way women dress and place it back in the place that created it, schools, it creates a toxic and unsafe environment for women seeking education. Statistics show that “an estimated 20 percent of women on campus […] will be sexually assaulted while in college” (Mooney, 263). While there are many different factors into what causes a person to rape, by modernizing school dress code and removing its toxic ideology, it could help reduce the number of men who view women’s dress in that manner and hopefully reduce the amount of victim blaming. In conclusion, while American school dress codes does a serve a vital purpose in preparing students for the expectations of the workforce, it is outdated and perpetuates a negative ideology about women and the way they choose to dress.
The negative effects it has on young girls include but are not limited to: teaching them that their body is a sexual object, their right to education is beneath a male’s comfort, and that they should be ashamed of their bodies. In comparison, a negative effect it has on male students is that it teaches a very toxic message to young boys that a woman’s worth is based off of how she is dressed, therefore, you treat a woman based from her clothing choice. The solution to combat these issues with dress codes is a simple one of: updating current dress code policies to reflect modern attitudes towards dress. While the issue of dress code is not seen as the most important problem with American schools, it has just as much of an impact on shaping the minds of students as traditional schooling.

Outfits That Violated Dress Codes in US Schools

9 outfits that violated dress codes in American schools

In 1969, the US Supreme Court ruled that when it comes to school dress codes, "Students don't shed their constitutional rights at the school house gates." But the struggle between school administrators' policies and students' individuality continues.
Students and parents are pushing back against dress codes that disproportionately affect female students, who are often told that their manner of dress is too distracting to boys and miss class time to face disciplinary action.
Here are nine outfits that schools said violated their dress codes — and how the students wearing them responded.
Mallory Johnston was suspended when she broke her school's dress code, which bans visible bra straps, in protest.

Mallory Johnston and Grace Wood, students at Essex District High School in Essex, Ontario, protested their school's policy of suspending girls whose bra straps were showing.
Both students encouraged others to dress the way they wanted. Johnston hung posters up around the school with messages like, "Stop objectifying women," which were swiftly taken down by the vice principal. She was then suspended for breaking the dress code in protest.
Mike Hawkins, the school's principal, told the CBC that "anyone needs approval to post anything around the school."
Johnston stood by her demonstrations.
"I spoke out because it was very degrading to keep getting pulled out of my education for something so silly. I knew going forward with this would get backlash, but it was a risk I was willing to take because I believe that something should be changed," she said. "I believe in equality and women's rights. I should be able to speak my opinion without being disciplined."
A 17-year-old said she was told to put Band-Aids on her breasts while wearing a long-sleeved T-shirt after school officials said her nipples were distracting male students.
The shirt Lizzy Martinez was wearing when she said she was pulled out of class.

Lizzy Martinez, a junior at Braden River High School in Bradenton, Florida, went to school wearing a long-sleeved gray T-shirt without a bra because she didn't want straps to irritate a bad sunburn. She said she was then pulled out of class for distracting male students when a boy laughed and told his friends that she wasn't wearing a bra.
"I decided not to wear a bra today and got pulled out of class [because] one of my teachers complained that it was a 'distraction to boys in my class,'" she wrote on Twitter. "My school basically told me that boys' education is far more important than mine and I should be ashamed of my body."
Braden River High School issued a statement in response saying that Martinez violated the district's Code of Student Conduct, which prohibits students from wearing attire that distracts others.
"It is undisputed that this matter should have been handled differently at the school level," Mitchell Teitelbaum, general counsel for the School District of Manatee County, previously wrote to INSIDER in a statement. "Corrective measures have been taken to prevent a recurrence in the way these matters will be addressed in the future."
A high school senior was told to retake her yearbook picture because she wore a sweater that exposed her shoulders — but she started a petition instead.

Maine South High School senior Grace Goble wore an off-the-shoulder top for her yearbook photo and was told she would have to retake the photo because she had violated the dress code.
She started a petition called "Maine South High School: end the over-sexualization of young women's bodies" on Change.org in response.
Her school principal then told her that she wouldn't have to retake her photo and asked her to be on a team of students who would revise the dress code.
"I was pleasantly surprised [by] how willing my principal was to take actions and hear my thoughts. He's new to the school this year, so I had only briefly met him before this," she previously told INSIDER. "I'm proud that I was able to make a change, even if it was just at my school. I hope that others see the power of an individual standing up for what they believe in and do the same."
A teen was reportedly told she violated her high school's dress code by being "busty" and "plus size" while wearing a blouse and jeans.

Kelsey Anderson, 17, was wearing a red blouse and jeans when she was reportedly told to leave class after her teacher said she violated her school's dress code by being "busty" and "plus size."
"I was mortified by my teacher, of all people, saying something like this in front of my class," Anderson said in a press release provided to INSIDER by her and her mother's attorney.
Anderson and her mother are seeking legal action to prevent other students from being body-shamed.
Joplin High School did not respond to INSIDER's request for comment.
A teen said she was taken out of class twice for breaking her school's dress code by wearing the wrong type of crew-neck T-shirt.

Tori Taylor, a senior at Dickson County High School, said that she was told to leave class twice because of shirts she was wearing.
The school's dress code states that "All students must wear a collared and/or crew neck top with sleeves," but Taylor was told "it wasn't the right cut of a crew neck top," according to News Channel 5.
The school released a statement to Yahoo Style saying that, "The purpose of our dress code is to assure students will dress and groom in a clean, neat, and modest manner in order not to distract or interfere with the educational environment of the school. For the most part, 99% of our students have come to school within our dress code guidelines."
A middle school student wearing ripped jeans was allegedly forced to put duct tape on her bare legs for violating her school's dress code.

A seventh-grader at Benjamin Stoddert Middle School told Fox 5 DC that school officials made her cover her ripped jeans, which violated the dress code, with duct tape. The student told her mother that the tape was burning her skin, but her mother said the school didn't contact her to tell her to bring a change of clothes.
The school's interim principal, Marvin Jones, apologized for the incident.
"Our practice is to communicate with the parent before a student covers the holes with tape; however, that protocol was not followed today, and I apologize for that," he said in a statement, also promising to review the proper dress code violation procedures with staff.
A 17-year-old student wore a long-sleeved, striped T-shirt dress to school and was reportedly told to call her mother to bring a change of clothes.

The vice principal at Tom C. Clark High School in San Antonio, Texas, reportedly told 17-year-old Sophia Abuabara to call her mother to bring a change of clothes because her T-shirt dress violated the school's dress code, which requires no more than four inches between the end of a dress and knees.
When her mother, Rosey Abuabara, arrived, she had a conversation with the principal that ended with her getting escorted off campus — though Sophia was allowed to stay at school.
"What is more important here? My daughter's skirt length, or her PHYSICS AP TEST SCORE?" Abuabara captioned a photo of her daughter wearing the outfit in question on Facebook. "She also had an [Advanced Placement US history] test, and a LATIN 3 test, back to back. Don't understand how this is a dress code violation. She's 5'9". It's hard to find anything that fits longer."
High school senior Tori DiPaolo called out her school's sexist dress code in her yearbook quote.

Victoria DiPaolo used her yearbook photo to share some choice words about her high school's dress code, which she said penalizes female students more often than male students.
For senior portraits, female students wear black, off-the-shoulder tops, so she captioned the photo, "I'm sorry, did my shoulders distract you from reading this quote?"
"Over the past four years, myself and many of my friends have received dress code violations for clothes that were nowhere near inappropriate," she told Yahoo Style. "I became a bit infamous around school for fighting the administration about dress code, so I figured I'd use my senior quote as one final jab."
She also told the outlet that both teachers and students loved the quote.
A 16-year-old girl said she was reprimanded for wearing leggings and a T-shirt to school.
The outfit Kate Wilson was wearing when she said she was called into a meeting with the vice principal.
Kate Wilson/Facebook
Kate Wilson, a student at Honesdale High School in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, said her vice principal called her outfit of a baggy T-shirt and leggings "inappropriate.
"I was told that my pants were making the teachers uncomfortable, and my vice principal made a point of how distracting it was to see me walk up stairs," Wilson told INSIDER.
According to the Honesdale High School's student handbook, the dress code states that "Female students will not be permitted to wear skin tight clothing, objectionable form fitting blouses, or short tops to expose a bare midriff," but does not specifically address leggings.
Wilson wrote a Facebook post from the nurse's office about her experience. The post quickly went viral.
"Today, I was told that the discomfort of a middle aged man who seemingly can't keep his eyes off of a sixteen year old's rear end takes precedence over my education," she wrote. "I was called disrespectful for defending myself. The only disrespect that occurred in that office was the blatant disrespect of my rights over my body, my education, and my rights as a human being."
A representative for Honesdale High School didn't immediately return INSIDER's request for comment.

Students are waging war on sexist and racist school dress codes — and they’re winning   - Vox
Students are waging war on sexist and racist school dress codes — and they’re winning
Traditional dress codes punish marginalized students disproportionately, but this anti-racist, anti-sexist dress code could fix that.
By Nadra Nittle Sep 13, 2018,  7:10am EDT
Emma Stein was just a freshman when she was cited for a dress code violation at her school, suburban Chicago’s Evanston Township High School. A security guard said her dress was too short, so Stein had to pull a pair of sweatpants over her clothes. She was not punished for the infraction, but it was still a really upsetting experience.
“It added a level of insecurity to this already stressful time,” Stein recalled.
Stein wasn’t the only one troubled by the dress code at the 3,700-student school. In 2016, students staged a protest demanding a new policy that didn’t discriminate along gender or racial lines.
And the school’s administration listened.
“We needed to look at getting a new dress code, and we wanted to make sure it was body-positive and didn’t marginalize students,” the school’s principal, Marcus Campbell, said.
In 2017, Evanston Township High School debuted its new dress code, which permitted tank tops, leggings, hats, and other previously banned items. The policy also stated that students were not to be marginalized based on race, class, gender, sexual orientation, or other identity markers.
The story of Evanston Township High School’s dress code is an increasingly common one. As dress code controversies sweep the education system, parents and students are fighting back against policies that they see as sexist, racist, or both. And more and more schools are listening to these protests, adopting guidelines that reflect a new understanding of what constitutes “appropriate” student dress.
Oregon NOW’s model dress code has had an international impact
Adopting a new dress code isn’t easy when most existing policies are several years old and contain many of the biases schools are edging away from now. So, the Oregon chapter of the National Organization for Women devised a model policy for Portland Public Schools that took effect in 2016 and has since spread across the country.
School districts such as Evanston’s District 202 and California’s San Jose Unified have either borrowed heavily from the dress code policy or adopted it outright. Praised for being inclusive, progressive, and body-positive, the Oregon NOW model may be the foundation for the dress code policies of the future.
“Boys can dress like girls, and girls can dress like boys. You can be trans. You can be cis. ... You can wear whatever you want.”
“Boys can dress like girls, and girls can dress like boys,” explained Oregon NOW president Lisa Frack about the code. “You can be trans. You can be cis. Part and parcel on our mind is whoever you are, you can wear whatever you want.”
Within reason, that is. Clothing featuring images of drugs, alcohol, or obscenities is out, as is gang attire. Still, the dress code affords students a great deal of freedom to present themselves how they see fit. The main dictate is: “You have to cover your parts,” Frack said. But how students do so is up to them. They can wear short clothing, leggings, and tank tops — all garments that have been the source of school dress code conflicts.
Oregon NOW turned its model into Portland Public Schools’ official policy by approaching the school board about it during a 2015 meeting where students raised complaints about the existing code, Frack said. The board quickly agreed to form a working group, a mixture of Oregon NOW members and educators, to develop new guidelines. A few months later, the board agreed to implement the model for the 2016–2017 school year. Frack calls the dress code “the fastest advocacy” she’s worked on to date.
The policy has sparked interest from school officials in both the US and Canada, Frack said. Administrators from Evanston’s District 202, which consists only of Evanston Township High School, reviewed the Oregon model after 300 students protested and asked for changes to be made to the previous policy.
The demonstration prompted Campbell, assistant superintendent as well as principal, to research alternatives online, leading him to the Oregon NOW dress code. He and four Evanston Township High School assistant principals looked over the dress code piece by piece to see if it aligned with the high school’s values. They agreed that it did, and so they presented it to the superintendent, who signed off on it. The new policy, along with an equity statement penned by District 202 administrators, took effect during the 2017–2018 school year.
“I remember last year, a Latinx-identifying kid wore a sombrero two days in a row,” Campbell said. “Seeing him signals that it’s a different kind of school where kids can be free to wear what they want to wear, to express themselves, as long as it doesn’t glorify hate speech or violence, those kinds of things.”
The Oregon model also allows students to wear their hair as they please, an ongoing issue for both African Americans and Native Americans in schools. As recently as August, two religious schools faced criticism for telling black children they couldn’t attend classes because of their hairstyles. At A Book’s Christian Academy in Florida, school officials turned away a 6-year-old black boy for wearing dreadlocks. His family ultimately withdrew him from the school. Later that month, an African-American girl at Christ the King Elementary School in Terrytown, Louisiana, was forced out of class for wearing her hair in braided extensions, a popular black hairstyle that school officials said they banned over the summer.
Hearing about these sorts of dress code scandals drove Oregon NOW to write its model policy. “There was no answer,” Frack said. “Everybody’s got the problem, but what’s the answer? We’re a super small organization, but we thought we could do something besides saying, ‘Doesn’t this stink?’ We could write a model code, and it could be progressive, feminist, and anti-racist.”
Historically, school dress codes in the US have been anything but. While many schools continue to impose dress codes shaped by outmoded race, class, and gender constructs, a growing number are addressing how their policies disproportionately affect certain groups of students more than others, and they are letting students dress mostly as they please.
Students are challenging schools to devise fair and equitable dress codes
Dane Caldwell-Holden, director of student services for the San Jose Unified School District, didn’t realize how dress codes targeted certain groups of students until his district came under fire for its policy. “I’ll be honest,” he said. “As a teacher and administrator, I never gave a thought about that.”
Then, in 2015, a female student was pulled out of class and told to change into a baggy pair of shorts because hers didn’t pass the “fingertip test.” (Many schools say that shorts, skirts, or dresses are too short if they don’t hang past a student’s fingertips.) Humiliated, the student decided to fight the dress code. She and her mother spoke to school officials about how the policy harmed girls, and the following year, her mother sent Caldwell-Holden a link to Oregon NOW’s model.
After he reviewed that policy, Caldwell-Holden consulted with SJUSD’s associate superintendent and rewrote the dress code guidelines in the district handbook based on the Oregon model. District officials and school principals reviewed and revised the policy over several months, and in early 2017, the superintendent presented it to the school board and community members. In June 2017, the board voted to approve the new dress code.
The new policy permits spaghetti straps, halter tops, and short shorts. The previous code in his district had been in use for about 15 years, Caldwell-Holden said, pointing out that’s the case for a number of California districts. Typically, the state develops some sample codes, and school districts adopt one.
“When you look at dress codes, they all look remarkably similar”
“Board policies tend to be replicated,” Caldwell-Holden said. “When you look at dress codes, they all look remarkably similar.”
The old San Jose dress code was never meant to body-shame girls, he said, but to prevent youth from wearing truly disruptive apparel to school. He considers such clothing to be gang attire or T-shirts with violent or profane messages. Rather than direct their attention to these sorts of violations, faculty members unevenly applied the dress code, citing girls nearly all of the time.
“That was completely unfair,” Caldwell-Holden said.
Since about 2010, the disparate impact that school dress codes have on girls and young women has received more attention, according to Todd DeMitchell, a University of New Hampshire professor of education and justice studies. He’s authored two books about dress codes: The Challenges of Mandating School Uniforms in the Public Schools and Student Dress Codes and the First Amendment. DeMitchell can’t point to any one event in the past decade that led to more focus on the discriminatory aspects of dress codes.
“It’s probably the accumulation of a number of policy streams,” he said. “And stories of female students disproportionately being singled out over male students started to be put into more of the popular press. It’s no one single thing, but we do see the news reporting a number of shaming incidents based on student attire.”
He recalled that in 2014, an Orange Park, Florida, high school student was forced to wear a “shame suit” consisting of a shirt and pants printed with the words “dress code violation” because the school considered her clothing too short. The story became national news fodder, complete with photographs of the student in the humiliating outfit. Protests and photographic evidence of rigid policies have driven the school dress code debate this decade, but DeMitchell also points out that social media has contributed as well. The rise of social media and video-sharing websites like YouTube has allowed student dress code complaints to reach critical mass.
Whether student complaints about dress codes go viral or stay local, they have the power to effect change. Carrie Truitt, a member of the Marion County school board in Kentucky, became interested in adopting a new dress code after a 5-foot-10 high school student, who was wearing business attire for Dress for Success Day, was told her dress was too short. The student’s father complained, arguing that male students who wear shorts the same length as his daughter’s dress do not receive citations. Truitt thought the parent had a point and began researching dress codes, leading her to Oregon NOW’s model.
“We have a little bit of bias in enforcement,” Truitt admitted. “I don’t know if we can go as far as Oregon NOW in Kentucky; you have to take into account perceptions and beliefs.”
For example, the idea that a tube top is acceptable to wear to school might rub some community members the wrong way, she said. But Marion County is a fairly liberal community, and school leaders will likely take an interest in a progressive new dress code if they know girls typically get the most citations, Truitt explained.
Not every school or district is open to changing its dress code. In fact, some schools continue to spark controversy with policies that shame female students and police their bodies.
Dress codes have consistently policed gender
In April, Florida teen Lizzy Martinez didn’t want her sunburned skin to get any more irritated, so she showed up to Braden River High School with a long-sleeved shirt and no bra. When she was abruptly pulled out of class, she was confused as to why.

Although the dress code at her school in Bradenton, Florida, did not specify that girls must wear bras, Martinez said that her teacher complained and had her removed from class for being a distraction.
“The dean asked me if I was wearing a bra,” she said. “They made me put a shirt on over my shirt, and band-aids over my nipples.”
But that’s not all. Martinez, 17, said that she was also asked to stand up, jump up and down, and move around, “so the dean could see the motion in my breasts.”
Mitchell Teitelbaum, general counsel for Manatee County School District, said that student privacy laws prevent him from getting into specifics about Martinez’s account of events.
“There is a dispute as to the underlying facts that transpired at the school that day,” he said. But Teitelbaum added that “this district was clear it could have been handled better.”
The ordeal resulted in Martinez missing two hours of class time that day, she said. Altogether, the teen estimates that she missed about a week and a half of school because of the stress of the situation. Teachers discussed what happened to her with students, and many misrepresented the facts, she said.
“I felt really, like, attacked, singled out,” Martinez said.
But she and her mother did not keep quiet about the incident, which became a national news story. Martinez took to Twitter to describe how she’d been treated, and she and her mother both spoke to the press. Her dress code infraction fueled more debate about how these policies sexualize young women.
I decided not to wear a bra today and got pulled out of class bc one of my teachers complained that it was a “distraction to boys in my class.” My school basically told me that boys’ education is far more important than mine and I should be ashamed of my body. @Manateeschools :)

“It crossed a line,” said Emma Roth, a fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project. “We have seen dress code enforcement problems pop up all across the country. School administrators disproportionately enforce dress codes against girls and subgroups of girls — girls of color, gender non-conforming girls, trans girls, girls with curvier body types.”
The ACLU has traded letters with Braden River High about Martinez’s treatment, but so far no resolution has been reached, Roth said.
“They claim they’ve taken some kind of corrective measures, but we don’t know what those corrective measures are,” she said. “We find their response completely unsatisfactory.”
The ACLU would like the school to train teachers to avoid such incidents from happening in the future. They also want the faculty to stop, as Roth put it, “harassing” students who violate the dress code. That means no requests for youth to make any physical movements because of dress code violations, Roth explained. The Oregon NOW model, for instance, prohibits staff enforcing these policies from ordering students to bend over, hold up their arms, or make other motions.
Teitelbaum disputes Roth’s characterization of the school district’s action. Since the controversy, he says Manatee County has provided staff trainings and clarified wording in the dress code about what constitutes distracting or disruptive attire.
Martinez wants schools to exercise more sensitivity when it comes to student dress. “Nowadays, there’s all these different genders or students who don’t conform to one gender,” she said. “It’s totally unfair to say to somebody, ‘Girls have to dress and act this way, and boys have to dress and act this way.’”
LGBTQ youth are vulnerable to school dress code policies
Schools nationally have tried to prevent LGBTQ youth from wearing their preferred attire to prom, homecoming, graduation, and other high-profile events. But choosing clothing for school can be a daily struggle for gender-nonconforming students because dress codes have historically served to make students heed traditional gender roles. And a scan of school dress codes from several decades ago make it clear how administrators viewed gender through a narrow lens. Policies dictated that girls wear skirts, dresses, or blouses.
But boys had to conform to strict gender roles, too. In the early 1960s, the dress code at Pius X High School in Downey, California, cautioned boys as follows:
“Two extremes are to be avoided: both a careless, untidy appearance, and a vain, effeminate use of extreme fashions. What the school seeks to promote in a student is a clean, neat, well-groomed, manly appearance.”
The expectation for a “manly appearance” is why boys, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation, continue to face school earring bans. Plus, some schools, such as North Carolina’s public K–8 Charter Day School, require girls to wear skirts.
Increasingly, students are challenging gender-based dress codes, and GLSEN (formerly the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network) is one of many organizations advocating for them. In 2015, it updated its model district policy for transgender and gender-nonconforming students. The policy includes guidance about student attire, stating that dress codes may not be based on gender and that students have the right to dress in accordance with their gender identity. Moreover, schools can’t use dress codes to target transgender and gender-nonconforming students.
Ikaika Regidor, GLSEN’s director of education and youth programs, said that he understands that schools have dress code policies to prepare students for adulthood and the workforce, but the enforcement of the policies is often problematic.
“We ended up getting into a place in which some groups of students end up getting hurt more than others,” he said. Students feel, “I’m coming to school. I’m being my authentic self,” only to be told they can’t, he continued.
Regidor said that schools need more training and need to streamline who enforces dress codes. Doing so ensures the staffers imposing these policies on students have the tools to do so fairly, properly, and sensitively to gender-nonconforming youth. GLSEN offers training to schools and educates students about their rights as well. The organization teamed up with the ACLU to give youth a wallet-sized card they can show to administrators who wrongfully cite them for dress code violations.

To avoid litigation, more school districts have implemented gender-neutral dress codes. In 2015, Puerto Rico, where students wear uniforms, changed its policy to permit boys to wear skirts and girls to wear pants. It’s a move GLSEN urges more school systems to make. Regidor said some school officials are ignorant about best practices for dress codes and LGBTQ youth. But once they’re educated, they stop enforcing discriminatory policies. Sometimes, though, the discrimination is intended.
“We could try to train them,” he said. “We could try to change hearts and minds, but we also know there are some administrators who have biases. There’s still work to be done by schools, by states.”
Disciplined for wearing braids to school
Deanna and Mya Cook object to how dress codes have long regulated both gender and race. The twins attend a Boston-area charter school that dictates skirt length, shoe color, nail polish, and makeup. But the girls never thought they’d get in trouble for wearing braided extensions. Last year, that’s exactly what happened.
Adopted by white parents, the girls said they got braids for the first time to connect with their African-American heritage. When they showed up at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School with the hairstyles, however, the school disciplined both girls, now 17. Mystic Valley did not respond to Vox’s request for comment about its dress code.

“When we came back to school, we were told braids were not allowed,” Mya said. “They were inappropriate, drastic, needed to be fixed. It really hurt me to my core. I didn’t know what to do because braids meant a lot to me, and they kept telling me to take them out.”
She thought she’d be expelled, and no one would be the wiser. But the school’s treatment of the Cook sisters garnered media attention, and the ACLU, the NAACP, and other groups advocated for the girls.
After a complaint was filed with the state accusing the school’s dress code of being discriminatory, Mystic Valley relented. The school now permits braids, but the twins say it has implemented new rules they believe are retaliatory. Black hair ties, the most common color available in stores, are forbidden; students must wear either navy blue or white hair ties to match the school uniform colors, they said. The girls are not allowed to accessorize their braids with clips, clasps, or beads either.
Similar incidents keep happening to black girls, who are disproportionately pushed out of school due to dress code violations, according to the National Women’s Law Center “Dress Coded” report. Their bodies, hair, and hair accessories such as head wraps are policed more, the study found.
“Many dress code policies include a lot of vague and subjective language that really rubs against our biases”
“Many dress code policies include a lot of vague and subjective language that really rubs against our biases,” said Nia Evans, NWLC’s manager of campaign and digital strategies for education. “They include words like ‘appropriate,’ ‘not distracting.’ Because of racism and sexism, I think there are black girls who have kinky, natural hair and are not perceived as clean or appropriate.”
She said rigid dress codes signal to female students that their bodies are a problem. Black girls are uniquely vulnerable because they’re already more likely than other female students to be suspended from school. Evans argues that forcing them out of class for any reason increases their chances of quitting school and entering the prison system. Accordingly, missing class because of dress code citations may have serious consequences.
Concerns about liberal dress code policies
As schools implement new dress codes in an effort to make these policies more equitable for students, they still contend with some doubts and concerns from community members. When San Jose Unified updated its dress code, some school officials and parents feared that a more lax policy would result in girls showing up to school in attire more fit for the nightclub than for school. Caldwell-Holden says that hasn’t happened. Instead, he rarely hears about schools issuing dress code citations and no longer receives complaints from students about the policy.
So far, the district has received just one nasty comment about its new code, he said. Sent in August 2017, it said, “I am just writing to say how disgusted I was to read … that halter tops, spaghetti straps, and short shorts will be allowed in school now. Seems to be that you are following in the new California tradition: slut everything up and dumb everything down.”
But there was a twist. The writer ended the comment by remarking, “I’m sure glad I don’t have kids in school.”
Actual parents have been highly supportive of the change, according to Caldwell-Holden. A few have worried that it might be harder to get kids to follow the rules they set at home about appropriate dress, but that’s it, he said.
Before Portland Public Schools adopted Oregon NOW’s policy, some community members expressed fear that students would abuse the policy and that girls in particular “would show up in bikinis,” Frack recalled. Concerns about the hypersexualization of girls in society are valid, but body-shaming students won’t solve the problem, she said.
“They’re just dressing the way they’re told to dress,” Frack explained. The answer isn’t “we’re going to correct our hypersexualized culture by blaming you.”
While some community members worried that students would dress provocatively, others feared that a less formal code would fail to prepare students for professional life.
“We’re not raising all of our kids to work in a bank. Some are going to have jobs where they don’t have a collar.”
But, Frack pointed out, “We’re not raising all of our kids to work in a bank. Some are going to have jobs where they don’t have a collar.”
Good school dress codes show compassion for students and begin with an equity statement, according to the “Dress Coded” report. Evanston’s District 202 dress code states that it “does not reinforce stereotypes and that [it] does not reinforce or increase marginalization or oppression of any group based on race, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, cultural observance, household income or body type/size.”
“Dress Coded” recommends that policies be culturally sensitive, gender-neutral, body-positive, and not shame students. The report also calls for all staff members who enforce them to receive training. Because most schools don’t collect data about dress code citations, the NWLC advises them to start doing so. A record of these citations gives the public an idea of which students are most often cited and why. Additionally, the organization urges schools to give students a say in dress code policies.
How District 202 changed after updating its dress code
Two years ago, Emma Stein protested outside the District 202 superintendent’s office in a bid to get Evanston Township High to change its dress code. An 11th-grader then, Stein remained at the high school after the Oregon NOW model went into effect her senior year. When the school transitioned to its new dress code, Stein realized that getting dressed in the morning was no longer stressful.
“The amount of anxiety I personally had about even wearing a skirt my grandmother bought me dropped,” she said.
Now in her first year at Northwestern University, Stein recalled how each morning at Evanston Township High, a security guard would scan the students entering campus for dress code violations. The day she received a citation, Stein had been excited to attend an assembly about racial equity. In the end, she found herself derailed by a dress code that framed her appearance unfit for school.
About five years have passed since then, but Stein said the day of her dress code citation is burned into her memory because it caused her such embarrassment. Still, she knew she wasn’t the only girl with the same experience. Stein said she routinely saw other girls pulled aside by female security guards and teachers because of their dress. The fact that so few boys ever received dress code citations made her question the fairness of the policy.
When the more liberal code took effect, “The attire of the students didn’t change very much,” Stein said. This was the outcome Marcus Campbell expected. He said he believed in his students enough to know they wouldn’t abuse the new policy.
“We’re happy people have found it affirming, so they can focus on learning,” he said.
Campbell and Stein described the first day of school under the new code similarly. Both remember the tension on campus dissipating.
“It felt so great,” Campbell recalled. “That feeling is still palpable. It’s so great to have the administration listen to some very reasonable guidelines.”
Now, it’s largely up to students and their parents to determine which attire works best for school, he said.
Stein said that when the current dress code rolled out, students appeared lighter, less burdened. “It was such a dramatic change,” she said. “The change was almost tangible. At least for me, when this policy was amended, there was this collective sigh of relief.”

School Dress Codes and Uniform Policies.
Anderson, Wendell
Policy Report, n4 Fall 2002
Opinions abound on what students should wear to class. Some see student dress as a safety issue; others see it as a student-rights issue. The issue of dress codes and uniform policies has been tackled in the classroom, the boardroom, and the courtroom. This Policy Report examines the whole fabric of the debate on dress codes and uniform policies through a collection of short reports; policy recommendations; and opinions by administrators, teachers, students, and civil libertarians. Topics of reports include background and history of dress codes and uniform policies in the United States, focusing on the past 15 years; arguments for and arguments against dress codes and uniforms; anecdotes from schools that have implemented dress codes or uniform policies; a recap of research  findings on the effects of dress codes and uniform policies; a roundup of legal actions and important court decisions regarding dress codes and uniform policies; and a state-by-state listing of policies on student dress. Guidelines for developing, implementing, and enforcing school dress codes and school-uniform policies are offered from a variety of sources. Also included in the report are a sample dress code and 51 references. (WFA)

From these examples, it's evident that dress codes can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can promote a sense of unity and professionalism in the school environment. On the other hand, they can be used to suppress individual expression and, in some cases, reinforce harmful stereotypes and inequalities.

Looking back at the initial points, the benefits of dress codes include creating a focused learning environment, promoting equality, and potentially improving academic performance. However, the drawbacks include restricting personal expression, possibly discriminating against certain groups, and not necessarily leading to better academic outcomes.

Given that, perhaps the key is to strike a balance. Schools could implement dress codes that are inclusive and respectful of all students' identities, while still maintaining a level of professionalism. It's crucial to involve students, parents, and the wider community in the development of these policies to ensure they are fair and acceptable to all.

Moreover, schools should focus on educating students about appropriate behavior and respect, rather than solely relying on dress codes to manage student conduct. By fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding, schools can create an environment where students feel valued and supported, regardless of what they wear.

In conclusion, while dress codes can have some positive effects, they are not a panacea for the challenges faced by schools. It's essential to approach this issue thoughtfully, considering the diverse needs and perspectives of the school community.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Dress codes can have both positive and negative effects on schools, and their implementation should be thoughtful and inclusive to balance professionalism with individual expression.}} \]
