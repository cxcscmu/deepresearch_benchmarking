So I've got this question: Should the government fight recessions with spending hikes rather than tax cuts? Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. First off, I need to understand what a recession is. I think a recession is when the economy isn't doing so well—there's less production, more unemployment, that sort of thing. So, when a recession happens, governments often try to stimulate the economy to get things going again.

Now, the question is about two different approaches to doing that: increasing government spending and cutting taxes. Both are ways to inject money into the economy, but they work differently. Let me see if I can figure out which one might be better.

First, let's consider government spending hikes. If the government spends more money, it could be on infrastructure, public services, or even just giving money to people or businesses. This directly increases demand in the economy because the government is buying goods and services, which can help businesses stay afloat and maybe even hire more people. It's like a direct shot of adrenaline to the economy.

On the other hand, tax cuts give more money back to individuals and businesses by reducing the amount they have to pay in taxes. The idea is that if people have more disposable income, they'll spend more, which again boosts demand and helps the economy. It's a bit more indirect because it relies on people choosing to spend their extra money.

So, which one is better? Well, that probably depends on various factors, like how deep the recession is, what the economy looks like, and maybe even political considerations. But from an economic theory perspective, there might be some arguments for one over the other.

I think in the short term, government spending might have a bigger impact because it's direct. The government decides to spend money on something, and that money goes straight into the economy. With tax cuts, there's a delay because people might save the extra money instead of spending it immediately. During a recession, you want stimulus as soon as possible, so spending might be more effective.

Also, there's something called the multiplier effect. When the government spends money, that money gets spent again and again in the economy, multiplying its initial impact. Similarly, when people get tax cuts and spend the extra money, there's a multiplier effect, but some studies suggest that government spending has a larger multiplier because more of the money is spent rather than saved.

Another consideration is targeting. With government spending, you can target the money to areas that need it most, like struggling industries or regions with high unemployment. Tax cuts are more broad-based and might not reach the parts of the economy that need the most help.

However, tax cuts might have longer-term benefits by incentivizing work, investment, and entrepreneurship. If people keep more of their income, they might be motivated to work more or start businesses, which can boost economic growth over time. Government spending might not have the same effect, especially if it's not invested wisely.

But during a recession, the immediate priority is often to stabilize the economy and get it growing again, so perhaps the short-term impact of spending is more valuable at that time.

Also, there's the issue of budget deficits. If the government increases spending or cuts taxes, it might lead to higher deficits, which some people are concerned about. But in a recession, when revenues are down anyway, and interest rates are low, maybe it's acceptable to run higher deficits temporarily to get the economy back on track.

I'm not entirely sure about this, though. Maybe I should look up some information to get a better understanding.

Let me try searching for some information on this topic.

Should Governments Fight a Recession With Spending Hikes Or Tax Cuts?
Posted by Econdeclassified on November 19, 2020
For Spending Hikes – Mehak Singh
A recession implies significant decline in overall economic activity, usually due to a drastic drop in spending and has widespread effects such as unemployment, lower wages, and lost opportunities.
So how exactly should the government wrap its head around these mammoth issues?
The very nature of recessions suggests that the economy is in dire straits and in need for a monetary boost to attain higher levels of economic activity, which will stabilise over a period, reaping economic growth. The government is a key player in such a situation as it is not led by a profit based motive, rather, overall economic welfare. Spending hikes, therefore, would be a perfect solution in battling recessions.
According to Keynes, fiscal stimulus and freedom from a state of economic slowdown in such a situation can only be achieved by an “injection” of government spending into the economy. He classified government spending under two heads: current spending, which relates to wages and raw materials that need to be renewed each year; and capital spending. This government spending could be in the form of structural government spending such as infrastructure, transport, education, public utilities, and so on, with a view that the investment will yield long term economic gain and overall economic growth.
This may lead to a controversial angle – where do we get the money from? While most economists have preconceived notions regarding spending hikes, let us break this down bit by bit.
Will real GDP rise if taxations and government spending are increased by the same amount? Yes. In a recession, consumers have already stopped spending which leads to an increase in private sector savings, due to which a rise in taxes will not affect the overall market spending. The government can use this opportunity to borrow from the private sector, and it can act as an expansionary fiscal policy to boost economic growth.
Tax cuts, on the other hand, are bad not only for the long-term fiscal outlook, but also the long term economic outlook, as stated by the Congressional Budget Office. Tax cuts would result in smaller domestically owned stock of capital, and there would be no guarantee of these savings being injected into the economy, leading to a further state of recession. To be exact, extending the tax cuts permanently could reduce GNP in 2020 by as much as 2% and anywhere from 2.5% to 11% by 2040. Further, tax cuts benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, as the services that will most likely get cut are beneficial to the poor; as seen with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate in America in 2018 after the implementation of tax cuts by the Republican government.
As stated by Ha Joon Chang, “Once you realize that trickle-down economics does not work, you will see the excessive tax cuts for the rich as what they are — a simple upward redistribution of income, rather than a way to make all of us richer, as we were told.” which reinforces the importance of governments opting for spending hikes in times of recessions.
Increased government spending causes a “multiplier effect”, which occurs when the initial injection into the economy ripples and causes a bigger final increase in National Income.  For instance, if the government spending is targeted at increasing job opportunities for the unemployed, it will generate income among that group, and their expenditure (in the form of consumer goods, transport – really, the list of human wants goes on) will benefit different sectors of the economy.
The largest ever increase in government spending as a percentage of GDP occurred during post war periods, when economies were plagued, and governments had to find a way out. In the UK, close to 70% of the GDP was spent to create the welfare state – NHS, which included welfare benefits and council housing. Today, the NHS is regarded as one of the best healthcare systems in the world.

The way the UK pulled itself out of their state of debt in post war periods due to an increase in government spending is a textbook case of how taking care of economic growth and unemployment play a considerable role in reducing debt to GDP ratios.
Source: UKpublicspending.co.uk
Through his book “The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”, Keynes explained that the government spending is a key component to increasing aggregate demand and maintaining full employment- translating to an increase in demand due to spending hikes. An increase in government spending would lead to added business activity due to an increase in aggregate supply, which would increase income, and thus, increase aggregate demand.
After the Great Depression in 1929, President Roosevelt eased the situation by spending on job creation programs; Barack Obama ended the Great Recession in 2008 with the introduction of the Economic Stimulus Act, which spent $224 billion in education and health care; American President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System during the recession that followed in the post war era.
Lastly, approaching something that we are currently living through – the Corona Recession.
According to a report published by the IMF, increasing spending by just 1% of GDP could create 33 million jobs. Kristalina Georgiva, the managing director of the IMF has called for governments to ramp up their public spending, and warned them against prematurely withdrawing the help they have provided, in fear of a “lost generation” from low income countries. While likening the Corona Crisis to The World Wars when governments “forged a better world in the worst possible moment”, she laid emphasis on the importance of support for those who have lost their jobs due to the recession, and pushed for increased government spending to create a more equitable, prosperous economic system.
According to a report published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, “Bold public spending is the only way to recover better from COVID-19”.
In conclusion, the Key(nes) to success during a recession based on our world’s past – are spending hikes!
– Mehak Singh (Writer, Econ Declassified)
For Tax Cuts – Anuj Khare
What are Tax Cuts?
Essentially, tax cuts are changes in the law that reduce the percentage of tax payment that citizens at large are required to pay. Governments primarily follow this measure as an expansionary fiscal policy, i.e.an economic stimulus that boosts the economy by putting more money into taxpayers’ pockets.
Most of the time, tax cuts are used to end a recession, like the 2008 financial crisis.
Stimulating the Economy, but at what cost?
Most economists agree that tax cuts boost the economy by putting more money into circulation.  Every worker, whether blue collar or white collar, sees an increase in his discretionary/disposable income. This extra money to spend ensures a rise in consumer spending at the macro-level.
A rise in said Aggregate Demand is nothing but overall economic growth for the nation.
However, the other effect of tax cuts is the reduction in tax revenue, forcing the government to borrow more and increase deficit spending. As a result, tax cuts improve the economy in the short-term but depress the economy in the long-term if they lead to an unmanageable increase in the federal debt.
Long-Run Multiplier:
However, the most important argument with this contention against tax cuts and increasing debt, is that in the long term, tax cuts pay for themselves. Economist Arthur Laffer explained that tax cuts have a multiplier effect on the economy. Many tax cuts, during the Recession, had a fiscal multiplier greater than one, i.e. they stimulated enough growth in the long run to eventually generate higher tax revenue when there was more overall money to be taxed.
For example, President Reagan cut taxes during the 1980s in the US and all projections were assumed for revenue shortfalls, or (if nothing else) no increase in overall taxation revenues. However, the taxation revenue from individual incomes nearly doubled from 244 billion USD to 446 billion USD between 1980 to 1989.
Increaser of Productivity:
Income tax cuts can also increase productivity, which offset this fall in revenue. Tax cuts can thus often offer the best of both worlds: lower tax rates, but yet result in higher tax revenues and increased economic growth.
This is an advantage of tax cuts that even spending hikes cannot offer.
The “ Laffer Curve “ argues that if you cut income tax rates, then the tax cut increases the incentive to work so much, that the government can actually gain more tax revenue. For example, lower-income tax rates may encourage people to work longer, and outsiders to move to that particular country. This is the substitution effect – work is more attractive with lower tax rates (when you keep more of your income).
Tax Evasion:
Tax cuts also deal with another problem that spending hikes are not equipped to solve: tax evasion and tax avoidance.  Under a recession, lack of revenue forces workers to adopt behaviours that avoid paying taxes, such as taking jobs that pay under the table and not reporting their income. This is counterproductive towards the aim of recovering the economy.
Lower tax rates always lead to a massive downfall in tax evasion and tax avoidance.
Consumer and Business Confidence:
Lower tax rates will increase confidence and general motivation, thus increasing investment, because the population at large feels less government intervention. The reduction in taxation also engenders loyalty between the government and its citizens, and through these abstract ways, encourages investment.
These are a few edges that tax cuts have overspending hikes while facing a recessionary situation in the economy.
Conclusion:
In a practical, real-world situation, recessions are never fought with one or the other; it is a combination of both tax cuts and spending hikes that is employed as an expansionary fiscal policy to overcome the recession.
After the Great Recession of 2008–2009, U.S. government spending rose from 19.6% of GDP in 2007 to 24.6% in 2009, while tax revenues declined from 18.5% of GDP in 2007 to 14.8% in 2009. The Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
It is only these forms of expansionary fiscal policy that got the economy back to functioning normally.

Government spending and taxes during recession.
Thesource
Jan 23, 2011
Government spending and taxes during recession.
During a recession, the private sector spending drops for a
variety of reasons.
Demand for goods and services drop. Private investors tend
to restrict their investments. Factories tend to drop production and lay off
workers.
Eventually more and more businesses will continue to lay off
more because less and less people have the money to spend.
Revenues of government, state and local communities will
also fall. These revenues usually come from taxes, which is a portion of
individual and corporate incomes.
Local communities will be forced to cut back on many
essential services like law enforcement, emergency services, education, and the
maintenance of infrastructure.
All this will lead to higher unemployment, bankruptcies,
hunger, homelessness, desperation, and crime. In addition, there will be social
issues such as loss of personal dignity and in extreme situations we have seen
political revolutions. If this downward spiral continues we can expect serious
consequences for everyone including corporations, the rich, the middle class,
and the poor. In extreme situations, faith in capitalism can erode and there
can be considerable social pressure to move away from capitalism.
We all know that in every business transaction for goods and
services there must be a buyer who will spend. Without a buyer or a spender
there will not be any economic activity.
To prevent the downward spiral there has to be spending. If
the ailing private sector cannot provide enough spending, we will need someone
else to resuscitate the economy during a recession.
Economists recommend injecting government funds into the
economy without increasing taxes. Recession may be one of the few exceptions in
which economists can justify deficit financing.
In order to do this right the spending should be big enough
to make an impact.  Ideally, spending
should be in labor-intensive projects that would benefit the community and
businesses.
It can include spending in construction, education,
communication networks, massive power-generation, and other major
infrastructure projects. For example during the Great depression of the 1930s,
the TVA was created. This not only created jobs, but it also helped us come out
of the economic depression. It also improved the quality of life by providing
cheap and clean electricity for millions. Industries who were heavily dependant
on large amounts of energy thrived. TVA also helped the US during the Second
World War by providing a huge amount of electricity needed to build the atomic
bomb that stopped the war with Japan.
With an effective stimulus package, such job creation will
start very quickly. With workers now having money, they will be able to create
a demand for goods and services. Businesses with capital will now begin to
invest in goods and services. This in turn creates more jobs and more demand
for good and services. More small business such as retail shops and restaurants
will sprout within many communities. There will be ample opportunities for the
masses to rise above subsistence. Self-esteem and consumer confidence of the
masses will improve. Human hardships, homelessness, crime and other social
issues will decrease.
Eventually, as the positive ripple effect continues, the tax
revenues naturally will go up and government’s deficit financing will not be
needed at some point. Eventually tax revenues will automatically rise due to
higher economic activity. This rise in revenues should now be used to reduce
the budget deficit. The justification for a budget deficit will not be there
anymore after the recession. Then taxes, fiscal policies, and interest-rates
should be adjusted to maintain the health of the economy and keep government
budgets balanced.
It has been argued that lowering taxes can help the economy.
It does up to some point.
The poor usually don’t pay much in taxes. Even though the
poor are likely to spend all they have, the relative small tax breaks will not
be significant enough to improve demand in goods and services. However, tax
breaks for them can still be justified due to human hardship.
During this time, with low consumer confidence, the middle
class may tend to hold back spending received from tax breaks. Some of them may
decide to spend more. Therefore, it is difficult to see if these tax breaks
alone to the middle class can be a significant factor in pulling the whole
economy out of recession.
During a recession tax breaks for huge corporations many not
be very helpful either.
A CEO once reported that even with corporate tax breaks there
is no incentive for his corporation to invest on adding jobs or increasing
production. This is because there is very little demand for his goods from the
masses during a recession.
For rich individuals, who make millions of dollars a year, a
tax break of $20,000 will not significantly change their spending habits
either. It is unlikely that Bill Gates or Warren Buffett would change his
personal spending habits just because of a $50,000 tax break. And since
millionaires are not as common as the rank and file these tax breaks will not
have the desired impact on the economy. To make things worse such tax breaks
would take a bigger toll on the federal budget. So the tax breaks for the rich
during recession puts the government in a deeper deficit with less positive
impact to the economy. Therefore, tax breaks for the rich are not likely to get
us out of recession.
Should the government spend more in areas such as
unemployment benefits by raising them or extending them during a recession, the
impact of every dollar would be quite significant. This segment of the
population is living near or below subsistence.
They are likely to spend all their benefits to make ends
meet.  Even then, a good portion of them
will not have enough to pay for all basic needs such as rent, mortgage, auto
repairs, and insurance premiums. Since they are likely to spend all they get,
every dollar spent on these entitlements has a good impact on the economy.  These entitlements also have a big impact in
reducing human hardships and stabilizing the community while the unemployed are
seeking employment opportunities that can provide a better income to maintain a
more desirable lifestyle.
In conclusion, it should be understood that deficit
financing by the government is appropriate when it comes when the economy is in
recession or depression. This is also considered to be a textbook solution by
many economists. It has been practiced in many countries including China, Japan
and parts of Europe and Asia. Deficit financing should not be abused just for
just tax reductions during normal times. Japan was one of the first nations to
successfully use deficit financing to reduce the impact of the economic
depression during the 1930s. It was so effective that they were out of that
depression as early as 1933.
Deficit spending by the government is advocated here in the
context of recession or depression.  It
is not applicable for individuals and corporations. They should exercise
caution when getting into debts.
Most of us are aware that there are good debts and bad
debts. There are two important conditions for a good debt. The first is that it
is needed for something critical and necessary or is a good investment. For
individuals it could be a primary residence, an automobile for basic
transportation to go to work, or a life- sustaining medical procedure. A good
investment can be funds for college or capital for a business. The second
critical condition for a good debt is that the borrower has the capacity or has
a reliable plan to repay the debt.
Deficit government spending during recession is a good debt.
It meets all conditions of a good debt. There is a vital need to get out of
recession. The resulting debt can be repaid by successful individuals and
corporations through taxes with relatively less pain because income and profits
and risen considerably. Increases in tax rates may not be necessary.
However, the government should not give in to pressures to
reduce taxes to cause deficits when there is no recession. This is a bad and an
unnecessary debt and would make the government less capable of reacting to an
impending recession.

It is time people realize that blind spending cuts during recession is counterproductive to the economy. Spending cuts are often the mantra of certain politicians who claim they are doing it for the interest of the economy. Please think again if you believe them.

Thank you to both blueorpurple and t20cook.
Some general rules are as follows:
Spending Increase(during recession)=> Creates jobs.
Some job creation => More Spending =>More job creation
Cutbacks => Job losses =>Bigger Cutbacks => More job losses =>Recession.
Tax breaks(especially for the rich) => Government Deficits.
Lay-offs => More Cutbacks =>More lay-offs.
Tax breaks for the rich => Negligible economic growth.
Tax breaks for the poor and the middle class => Bigger economic growth.

Thank you Johnny Bridges for your input. Essential services such as transportation or trucking would be less sensitive to recession. However, shipment of luxury goods, toys, building materials, clothing, electronic products and other discretionary items are likely to drop. This may affect truckers or the delivery business to some degree.
Johnny Bridges on March 18, 2011:
Thank you for this write-up on the recession.  One career which is almost recession-proof is trucking.  There are always products that have to be delivered, and truck driving jobs will be in demand.  Just a thought...

Thank you for your input Fay Paxton. We have always been told by our parents, teachers and elders to cut back on spending and be thrifty. I have often advised my children to do the same. However, spending and borrowing are not always bad when there are justifications. We have to spend money on food, basic clothing, college tuition, shelter, and medicine. In bad times we try to cut-back and sometimes in extreme situations we may justify borrowing to survive or overcome a disaster. This is wise in context of personal finance. In the case of government spending during recession, the government needs to spend more or invest more to create jobs. They could do this by increasing spending on labor intensive jobs like infrastructure, education, law enforcement, scientific research and so forth. This is one of the only few situations where the government is justified in deficit financing, if necessary. The other case could be defense of the nation in a wartime situation. Once recession is over they should move away from deficit and have a balanced budget. Then we should naturally move out of deficit due to the growth in the economy. Government could then fine tune to balance the budget by re-adjusting spending, adjusting taxes and fiscal polices.
Fay Paxton on February 22, 2011:
The government needs to inject money into the economy for the purpose of creating jobs.  Employment creates tax revenue and a demand for goods.  Businesses experience demand for goods, rehire and the economy grows.  Spending needs to be cut, but people still need to go to work!!!

Thanks, Roychoudhury for your comments.
In recession, generally it is not wise to increase taxes even when there is a deficit. This creates a situation call deficit financing which is appropriate. However, under normal situations when there is no recession, taxes should be adjusted to balance the budget and to prevent deficit. In such conditions, it is not wise to reduce taxes and cause a deficit. This is what happened during the Bush era in the US. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan further compounded the budget deficit.

The Economy during a Recession
The effects of the Great Depression revealed the weak areas with in the market system. There was little output from factories and many business’s were failing and shut down. This caused a depletion of available jobs. Around this era, the government played only a small role in the intervention of the downturn. There were few government assistance programs to help the people living in poverty. Many government programs today such as, unemployment compensation, welfare benefits and social security are inspired from the Depression era.
One the government issues a tax cut, it reduces government revenues, which create budget deficits. These tax cuts are a source of government spending that depend on the public needs and priorities.
Our economy went into a recession due to the decline in real GDP. The Obama administration passed legislation in the fall of 2008 to enact an $800 billion fiscal stimulus to be spread out of the course of two and a half years. Many economists believe this policy will not pull our economy out of a recession. Classical Economists believe that unregulated markets are self-stabilizing. They believe government intervention is more harmful than it is beneficial. Classical economists believed that our economy was either at or leading toward full employment. Keynesian economists are more in favor of government intervention to help balance out the market system. They dismiss the idea that the economy is self regulating and will by it self, return to full employment. The Obama administration favors the ideas of John Maynard Keynes.

Fiscal Policy
The government will use fiscal policy when the economy is not operating at full production and full employment. Fiscal policy helps to stabilize the economy and increase the level of aggregate demand. During the times of a recession, consumers will decrease their spending and increase their saving. Also, unemployment rises causing more and more people to rely on government transfer payments such as unemployment compensation. One way to increase the consumer purchasing power is to lower taxes in order for the private sector to have an increase in money, to be spent on goods and services.
Fiscal policy can level out business cycle fluctuations by expansionary public spending or tax cuts in recessions or contractionary policy in expansions (Weil).
This plan directs government spending and taxes to keep actual GDP close to the potential full employment GDP. The government collects taxes in order to finance expenditures on a number of public goods and services, which can cause a reduction in output.
Discretionary fiscal policy is the purposeful change of expenditures and tax collections by the government to encourage full employment, price stability, and economic growth.
The government uses Expansionary Fiscal policy to shift the AD curve rightward in order to expand real output. The expansionary fiscal policy increases government spending or tax cuts to push the economy out of a recession. It is a increase in government expenditures and or a decrease in taxes that causes the government’s budget deficit to increase or it’s budget surplus to decrease. Usually an expansionary fiscal policy will be needed when the economy is experiencing a recession(McConnell). An increase in unemployment accompanies a negative GDP gap because fewer workers are needed to produce the reduced output. When this happens, the economy is suffering a recession and cyclical unemployment. A sufficient increase in government spending will shift an economy’s aggregate demand curve to the right, ceteris paribus. Investment has a multiplier effect on production. When investment changes, there is an equal primary change in national amount produced. The multiplier represented as 1/(1/MPC) is any change in spending (C, I, or G) will set off a chain reaction leading to a multiplied change in GDP. On the other hand, the government can reduce taxes to shift the aggregate demand curve rightward. According to McConnell and Brue “Suppose the government cuts personal income taxes by $6.67 billion, which increases disposable income by the same amount. Consumption will rise by $5 billion (= MPC of .75 x $6.67 billion), and saving will go up by $1.67 billion (= MPS of .25 x $6.67 billion).”
The AD curve eventually shifts rightward by four times the $5 billion initial increase in consumption produced by the tax cut( McConnell). Real GDP rises by $20 billion, from $490 billion to $510 billion, implying a multiplier of 4. Employment will increase. The multiplier works upward or downward. A tax reduction increases saving, rather than consumption. The smaller the MPC, the greater the tax cut needed to accomplish a specific initial increase in consumption and a specific shift in the Aggregate demand curve. In order to stop the progression of demand-pull inflation, the government will use a contractionary fiscal policy. This policy entails reductions in government spending, tax increases, or a combination of both and will cause the aggregate demand curve to shift to the left. When the economy faces demand-pull inflation, fiscal policy should move toward a government budget surplus-tax revenues in excess of government spending. A reduction in government spending shifts the AD curve leftward to control demand-pull inflation. The government can use tax increases to reduce consumption spending.

If the economy has a MPC of .75, the government must raise taxes by $6.67 billion to reduce consumption by $5 billion. The $6.67 billion tax reduces saving by $1.67 billion ( = the MPS of .25 x $6.67 billion). This $1.67 billion reduction is not a reduction in spending.The $6.67 billion tax increase also reduces consumption spending by $5 billion (= the MPC of .75 x $6.67 billion). After the multiplier process is complete, the aggregate demand curve will have shifted leftward by $20 billion at each price level (= multiplier of 4 x $5 billion) and the demand-pull inflation will have been controlled. Leftward shifts of the aggregate demand curve are associated with downshifts of the aggregate expenditures schedule.
Automatic Stabilizers
Automatic stabilizers are programs such as unemployment insurance benefits and taxes that are already on the books to help alleviate recessions and hold down the rate of inflation. Over the course of the business cycle, government tax revenues automatically change in order to stabilize the economy. Transfer payments perform in the opposite way from tax revenues. Unemployment compensation payments, welfare payments, and subsidies to farmers all decrease during economic expansion and increase during economic contraction.
Tax revenues T vary directly with GDP, and government spending G is assumed to be independent of GDP. As GDP falls during a recession, deficits occur automatically and help improve the recession. As GDP rises during expansion, surpluses occur automatically and help counteract possible inflation. There are a number of problems that pertain with applying fiscal policy such as, time lags, political problems, expectations, and state and local finances (Geoff
Riley). One issue in particular is the crowding -out effect which is an increase in government public expenditure that has the effect of. The crowding-out effect increases real national income and output, thus increasing the demand for additional capital. This causes the equilibrium rate of interest to rise and reduces or crowds out the amount of private investment.
Conclusion
The main factors effecting consumer confidence are expectations of future income and employment, current interest rates, trends in unemployment, anticipated changes in government taxation and changes in household wealth. The economy will experience peaks and troughs. Economist’s can look at the history of recessions to evaluate what must be done to help keep the market balanced. The classical economist believed that the market system would be able to fix its self. The Keynesian Economists believe however, the government would need to step in to help boot the current economic downturn. The Obama stimulus package and government tax cuts help to enhance the economy in the long run.

Targeted government programs can spur jobs growth. Look no further than the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which contained a wide range of policies that resulted in between 1.4 million and 4 million jobs created or maintained by the summer of 2011, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.[1]  Not surprisingly, though, these policies varied in their impact and efficiency.
With policies as diverse as cutting taxes for middle-class families, providing unemployment insurance to those in need, helping state governments maintain critical education and other public services, and investing in upgrading transportation and other infrastructure, among other things, it’s not surprising that analyzing whether the Recovery Act “worked” requires more than a yes-or-no answer. The CBO analysis, as well as those from various academic and private-sector economists, proves the act worked overall, but not all parts worked equally well. With more still to be done for the U.S. economy and job creation, it’s important to look at what worked and what didn’t.
A number of economic studies measure the impact of various components of the Recovery Act on economic growth and job creation. In this issue brief we review and compare the evidence from these studies on:
Tax cuts
Transportation and infrastructure investment
Social protection programs such as unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and nutritional assistance
Financial aid to state and local governments
The studies we reviewed estimate each policy’s “bang for the buck,” or how much $1 of program spending increases overall activity in the economy.
Our analysis of the analyses
The most widely cited studies include those by the Congressional Budget Office, economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, and economists James Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote. These reports find a range of values for each program. In these studies, the “bang for the buck” value—what economists call the “multiplier,” or how many dollars of economic activity is fueled by one dollar spent—for overall social protection ranges from 0.8 to 2.31. Separately, Blinder and Zandi report a value of 1.61 for unemployment insurance and 1.74 for food stamps.[2]
Research by Urban Institute economist Wayne Vroman estimates that one dollar spent on unemployment insurance fuels between 1.7 and 2.1 dollars of activity in the overall economy.[3]  According to these studies, the value for a dollar of spending on infrastructure ranges from 1 to 2.5, while the value for aid to state and local governments ranges from 0.7 to 1.8.
The analyses value middle-class tax cuts, such as the Making Work Pay tax credit that gave tax credits of $400 ($800 for couples), as generating between 0.6 and 1.5 dollars of additional economic activity; the value of extending the Alternative Minimum Tax patch for high-income earners for an additional year ranges from 0.2 to 0.6 dollars of additional activity. And the analyses value the extension of the housing tax credit for first-time homebuyers, providing credits up to $8000, in the Recovery Act from 0.3 to 0.9.[4]
The economic impact of distinct programs within the Recovery Act can be seen clearly in the first accompanying chart. (see Figure 1) The bottom red line shows the path of GDP growth if the Recovery Act had not been passed, as estimated by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi.[5]  Using data on the costs of programs and the fiscal multiplier—the “bang for the buck”—for each program, we calculated how each contributed to GDP growth since implementation of the Recovery Act. Shaded areas above this “baseline” show the cumulative contributions of individual programs within the overall Recovery Act.
The amount each program contributed to the gain should be considered alongside its cost. The second accompanying chart (see Figure 2) depicts the relative cost and benefit of individual Recovery Act programs. Infrastructure spending accounted for 21.3 percent of the gain from the Recovery Act but only amounted to 18.8 percent of its cost. Social protection also punched above its weight, contributing to 39.9 percent of growth while only accounting for 34.6 percent of the cost. Aid to state and local governments contributed a similar amount to the gain and cost of the bill at 22.7 percent and 22.2 percent respectively.
In contrast to the spending provisions of the Recovery Act, tax cut provisions added up to 24.2 percent of the total cost but provided only 16 percent of the Recovery Act’s total benefit.
Conclusion
Clearly, the research shows that government actions can spur economic growth and job creation. But not all actions are created equal. Looking forward to address the ongoing slow recovery from the Great Recession, Congress and President Obama should stay focused on policies that yield the most bang for the buck: social protection programs and infrastructure investments.

Tax cuts, not government spending, are the best way out of recession
Because it is not possible to enter counter points for this debate below, I am going to make a brief statement here.
Tax cuts are not an independent variable that can effectively determine job growth or the general economic health of a market.
Recessions, completely disconnected from tax rates to a large extent, have a much greater effect on the ability of businesses to thrive. This argument is baseless and the analysis is unfounded. Friedman was a scam artist. There is no statistically significant evidence that lowering already competitive tax rates will incentivize adding additional jobs when companies can produce goods more cheaply with automated factories and ever fewer human beings.
Tax cuts for corporations are often put toward dividends for shareholders and sometimes CEO bonuses. This does not benefit the average citizen, but does serve the interests for the most wealthy members of society.
Tax rates for young families earning a lower level of income, and for small businesses should be eliminated. Taxes for wealthy people and corporations should be returned to adequate levels and only cut with contractual obligations to job creation and pension funds. People need to wise up to the writing on the wall. The plutocrats want working people on their knees and will sell narrative lies and scams without factual basis to convince common folk who haven’t taken the time to look at the historical and statistical relationship between tax rates and job growth.

Summary
All the No points:
Demonstrated Utility of Tax Cuts Contrasted With Increased Spending
Yes because…
During a financial crisis, it is important to create incentives for working toward economic recovery. Since normal situations of high taxation already “discourage work effort, saving, and investment, and promote tax avoidance and tax evasion,”[[http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm]] this can only be amplified in situations where people feel especially stretched thin during economic distress. Government coffers become stretched by the added burden of spending, and with economic downturn there is less revenue generated. This lack of government revenue is further aggravated by when workers are forced to adopt behaviors to avoid paying taxes (such as taking jobs that pay under the table and never report their income). This is counterproductive toward the aim of recovering the economy. This forces either deficit spending in order to cover the cost of whatever the government spending might be, or government spending being insufficient to cover the costs of its intended purpose. It lacks a guarantee that the government can afford to continue the spending it promises.
Taking a lower amount of taxes on a percentage basis is a short-term mechanism to stimulate economic growth that translates into higher taxes in the long term when there is more money overall to be taxed. President Reagan cut taxes during the 1980s in the United States, and all projections were assumed for revenue shortfalls, or if nothing else, no increases in overall taxation revenues. However, the taxation revenue on individual incomes increased from 1980 to 1989, nearly doubling, from $244 billion $446 billion. Similar measures from the 1920s and 1960s also showed growth in overall taxation revenues after their implementation rather than expected shortages.[[http://www.house.gov/jec/fiscal/tx-grwth/reagtxct/reagtxct.htm]]
In fact, when recession hit the United States in 1919, a series of tax cuts over the next nine years kept the economy stable, and the recession itself was over within two years. It was only after government spending increased in the 1930s in response to the 1929 Stock Market Crash that the economy plummeted into the true depths of its depression[[http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=334276867815560]]. Since it has been established that status quo taxation will provide incentives for citizens to subvert the legal norms of taxation payments, the reduction in taxation engenders loyalty between citizens their governments, and influences enough growth to more than pay for itself in a short time after implementation has occurred.
No because…
Government Spending is Inefficient
Yes because…
The government has no incentive or barometer for efficient allocation of resources. Rather than searching out arenas for profit growth, the government seeks to do damage control. Since the government does not seek profit, it has no way of telling how efficient it is in allocating resources. Unlike firms, the government cannot be allowed to fail, meaning there is no penalty for inefficiency and no competitive alternatives. Most importantly, the government is funding existing firms or projects, which are being funded because they have already failed or are on the brink of failure.
We often see government expenditure touted as the fastest way to improve GDP growth. With “each dollar of government spending” the GDP “increases…by only 1.4 dollars”.[[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/files/faculty/40_Is%20Govt%20Spending%20Too%20Easy.pdf]] The increase for endogenous tax cuts (i.e. tax cuts attempting to help a faltering economy) are estimated to show about 3 to 1 growth in GDP.[[http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~cromer/RomerDraft307.pdf]] Government spending and taxes are not separate issues. Governments can only pay off expenditures with tax hikes. The Romer study suggests that “an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real GDP by roughly three percent”, a phenomenon likely caused by the fact that “investment falls sharply in response to exogenous tax increases”.[[http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~cromer/RomerDraft307.pdf]] What seems like a way out of recession may actually be a step into another one.
A recent example would be JP Morgan Chase Bank’s 25 billion dollar bailout: a bailout they used to finance their own private acquisitions, not to make loans. They issued a statement that read “loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit”. JP Morgan took 25 billion but did not provide much-needed loans to small businesses, employers, and individuals which would have helped, among other things, to create jobs and improve the housing market. If JP Morgan felt they could make a profit from giving loans, they would. But all of their returns are heavily taxed to the point that making acquisitions is a safer and more profitable short-term goal, even though it does not improve the economy a bit.
No because…
Efficiency of Private Businesses
Yes because…
Tax cuts are more efficient because firms following their self-interest will seek investments that provide profit. With heavy corporate taxes, firms are forced to either take on too much risk to make profit which can lead to financial collapse, or they merely make safe moves and firms that make acquisitions profit more than those taking risk. This is less than desirable because too cautious or sparse of investment means that there is likely to be little growth. Additionally, the corporations that are able to acquisition are the larger which means an economy may see oligopolies and eventually monopolies form which will harm the competitiveness of the market.
In addition, tax cuts are preferable because the forces of supply and demand can more freely work on their own. Firms seeking profit are more sensitive to demand than governments seeking to employ and prop up. Thus they affect supply so that the market is cleared as supply and demand meet and wastefulness is minimized. This makes for a more efficient allocation of resources and a much more sustainable economy. Both are necessary to recover from a recession.
No because…
Job Creation/Stability
Yes because…
An increase in jobs is a fundamental part of getting out of a recession. Consumer spending needs to be increased in order to see tangible growth in the economy and consumer spending can not be increased as long as consumers remain unemployed. The most efficient way to create jobs is to decrease corporate taxes that create incentives to create new jobs. For example, the state of Michigan enacted policy that substantially decreased corporate taxes on companies that created new jobs in high-growth sectors such as green and bio technology.[[www.michigan.gov/documents/gov/Econ_job_223200_7.pdf]] The purpose of business is to profit and through corporate tax cuts, business will have the ability to profit easier while creating jobs. Employed consumers spend the necessary money to stimulate and grow the economy. This is proven in the example of Ireland, which adopted a 12.5% corporate tax in 1988 while having the second-lowest per capita income in Europe and now has the second-highest income in Europe.[[http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/04/tax-cut-stimulus-opinions-contributors_0204_peter_ferrara.html]]
Recently, the French government posted figures of 0.3% growth in GDP for the second quarter of 2009, an indicator it is coming out of the recession. Across the euro zone, only Germany matched this growth. This was unexpected by experts and while it does not mean the recession is over for France, it is encouraging. One of the key forces behind this was an increase in consumption. Consumption increased by 0.3% this quarter. This increase was the aim of the government when reducing VAT as part of its strategy to combat the recession. For companies such as restaurants and cafes, VAT was slashed from 19% to 5.5%, which industry bodies predicted successfully would lead to an increase in consumption.

Government spending can also create jobs but the question is are these jobs suitable for getting out of a recession? The answer is a resounding no. Let’s examine one of the largest attempts by government to create jobs, Roosevelt’s Public Works Administration which allocated $3.3 billion dollars for public jobs to stimulate employment[[http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/pwa.htm]]. The jobs created by it usually lasted only months allowing only short term employment and the unemployment rate remained above 9%[[http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110011064
]]. Many of the jobs consisted of building public structures and murals such as a mountain theater that were not done to grow the economy further but to grow political capital. After the expenditures stopped, so did the jobs.
Only private industry can provide the long term stability and job creation through new and improved investments which are vital economic necessities to get out of a recession. By providing corporate tax cuts to incentive this, governments will not fall in a pit of spending that only provides sparks and stifling the private industry that could make blazing positive changes in the economy.

Alright, so I've got these search results. Let's see what they say.

First doc is from some blog called "Economics Declassified." It seems like two people are debating whether the government should use spending hikes or tax cuts to fight recessions. One person, Mehak Singh, argues for spending hikes, saying that it directly injects money into the economy and can have a bigger immediate impact. She mentions the multiplier effect, where government spending leads to more spending in the economy. She also points out that tax cuts might not be as effective because people might save the extra money instead of spending it right away.

The other person, Anuj Khare, argues for tax cuts. He says that tax cuts put more money into people's pockets, which can boost consumer spending and stimulate the economy. He also mentions that tax cuts can increase productivity and might even pay for themselves in the long run through higher economic growth.

Both seem to agree that a combination of both strategies might be necessary, but I need to dig deeper.

The second doc is from HubPages, and it's titled "Government spending and taxes during recession." The author argues that during a recession, private sector spending drops, leading to less demand for goods and services, job losses, and a decrease in government revenues from taxes. The author suggests that to counteract this, the government should increase spending on labor-intensive projects like infrastructure, education, and communication networks. This, the author claims, can create jobs quickly, which in turn increases consumer spending and business investment, leading to economic recovery.

The author also mentions that tax breaks might not be as effective, especially if they go to the rich who might not spend the extra money, or to the poor who might need it but whose increased spending doesn't have as big an impact on the overall economy.

Doc three is from UK Essays, and it's an essay about tax cuts and the economy during a recession. The essay explains that during a recession, the government can use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, either by increasing spending or cutting taxes. The essay discusses the concept of the multiplier effect, where initial government spending leads to further rounds of spending in the economy.

The essay also mentions that tax cuts can increase consumer spending, but the impact might be smaller because some people might save the extra money instead of spending it. The essay cites different studies that estimate the effectiveness of various fiscal policy tools, such as infrastructure spending, social protection programs, and aid to state and local governments.

Doc four is from the Center for American Progress, and it's titled "Government Spending Versus Tax Cuts." The authors, Nick Bunker and Adam Hersh, analyze the effectiveness of different components of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

They look at various studies estimating the "bang for the buck" of different policies, such as tax cuts, infrastructure investment, social protection programs (like unemployment insurance and food stamps), and aid to state and local governments. They conclude that social protection programs and infrastructure investments have a bigger impact on economic growth and job creation compared to tax cuts.

Doc five is from DebateWise, and it's a debate on whether tax cuts, not government spending, are the best way out of a recession. The "yes" side argues that tax cuts are more efficient, create jobs, and are simpler to implement. They provide examples from history, like the Reagan tax cuts and the Irish low corporate tax rate, to support their case.

The "no" side counters that government spending can be more effective in stimulating the economy, especially during a recession when private spending is low. They argue that government spending can directly create jobs and boost demand, whereas tax cuts might not lead to increased spending if people choose to save the extra money.

Okay, so from these documents, I can see that there are arguments on both sides. Some people believe that government spending is more effective because it directly injects money into the economy and can target specific areas that need help. Others think that tax cuts are better because they put money back into people's pockets, which can then be spent and stimulate the economy.

Looking at the evidence, it seems that during a recession, when private spending is down, government spending can have a bigger immediate impact. The multiplier effect suggests that government spending can lead to more rounds of spending in the economy, amplifying its initial impact.

Tax cuts, on the other hand, might not have as big an impact because people might save the extra money instead of spending it. Especially during a recession, when people are uncertain about the future, they might choose to save rather than consume.

Moreover, government spending can be targeted to areas that need it most, such as infrastructure, education, or support for the unemployed, whereas tax cuts are more broad-based and might not reach the parts of the economy that need the most help.

There's also the issue of budget deficits. If the government increases spending or cuts taxes, it might lead to higher deficits, which some people are concerned about. However, during a recession, when revenues are down and interest rates are low, running higher deficits might be acceptable to get the economy back on track.

Looking back at the Center for American Progress report, they analyzed the Recovery Act and found that spending on social protection and infrastructure had a bigger impact on economic growth compared to tax cuts.

Similarly, the HubPages article emphasizes the importance of government spending on labor-intensive projects to create jobs quickly and stimulate the economy.

However, the Economics Declassified debate presents both sides, and the person arguing for tax cuts provides examples where tax cuts have led to economic growth, like during the Reagan administration.

I need to consider the context. In a severe recession, with high unemployment and low private spending, government spending might be more effective in providing a quick stimulus. Tax cuts might be more beneficial in milder economic downturns or as part of a longer-term strategy to encourage investment and growth.

Additionally, the distributional effects should be considered. Tax cuts might benefit higher-income individuals more, who may save the extra money, while government spending can be directed towards lower-income households or public services that have a higher marginal propensity to consume.

In conclusion, while both government spending and tax cuts can be used to fight recessions, government spending might be more effective in providing a quick and targeted stimulus to the economy during severe downturns. Tax cuts can be a part of the strategy but might have a smaller and less immediate impact.

\boxed{\text{Government spending is more effective than tax cuts in fighting recessions.}}
