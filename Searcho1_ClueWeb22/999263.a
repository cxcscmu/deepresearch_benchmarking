I'm trying to understand how the League of Nations contributed to the outbreak of World War II. I know that the League was established after World War I to prevent future conflicts, but somehow it didn't stop World War II from happening. I need to figure out what went wrong and how its actions or inactions led to the second world war.

First, I should recall what the League of Nations was supposed to do. It was an international organization founded in 1920, aimed at promoting peace and cooperation among countries. Its main goals included settling disputes through negotiation and arbitration, reducing armaments, and improving living and working conditions around the world. So, in theory, it should have helped prevent another major war.

But clearly, it failed in that regard. World War II started in 1939, and by that time, the League was still in existence, although it had already lost much of its credibility and power. So, what happened between 1920 and 1939 that allowed another world war to break out?

I think one of the key issues was the League's inability to enforce its decisions. It didn't have its own army, so it relied on member countries to carry out its sanctions or military actions. Often, countries weren't willing to get involved or commit their resources, especially if it meant going to war.

Let me think of some specific examples where the League failed to act effectively.

One prominent example is the Manchurian Crisis in 1931. Japan invaded Manchuria, a part of China, and the League did condemn Japan for aggression. However, when it suggested economic sanctions against Japan, the United States and some other countries didn't support them, so the sanctions were never really effective. In the end, Japan just left the League in 1933. This showed that the League couldn't do much to stop aggressive actions by powerful countries.

Another example is Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Mussolini's Italy wanted to expand its empire, and Ethiopia was in its sights. The League did impose some sanctions, like an embargo on arms sales to Italy, but crucially, it didn't include sanctions on oil, which was essential for warfare. Moreover, not all member countries enforced the sanctions strictly. Germany and Japan, for instance, continued to supply Italy with materials. This weakness encouraged Mussolini to proceed with his invasion, and the League was unable to stop him.

These examples illustrate the League's limitations in enforcing its will. Aggressor nations could defy the League without facing serious consequences, which emboldened them to take more aggressive actions.

Additionally, some key countries weren't members of the League, which weakened its overall effectiveness. Notably, the United States never joined, even though it was the idea of President Woodrow Wilson. Congress didn't ratify the Treaty of Versailles, which established the League. So, from the start, the organization lacked the participation of one of the most powerful nations.

Also, the Soviet Union was initially not a member, and when it was admitted in 1934, it was expelled in 1939 after invading Finland. But by then, the League's credibility was already severely damaged.

Another factor is that the League's decision-making process required unanimity in the Council. This meant that any single member could veto a decision, making it difficult to take decisive action. This flaw hindered the League's ability to respond quickly and effectively to crises.

Looking back, it seems that the League had structural weaknesses that made it ill-equipped to handle the rising tide of nationalism and aggression in the 1930s. The lack of teeth in its enforcement mechanisms, combined with the unwillingness of major powers to commit to collective security, undermined its purpose.

Moreover, the Great Depression in the 1930s created economic hardships and political instability, which fascist and totalitarian regimes exploited. The League didn't have the tools or the support to address these deep-seated issues.

In summary, the League of Nations failed to prevent World War II because it lacked the necessary power and commitment from its member states to enforce its resolutions and deter aggressive actions. Its weaknesses were exploited by ambitious leaders, leading to a series of destabilizing events that ultimately culminated in global conflict.

So, to answer the question, "How did the League of Nations cause WW2?" â€“ it didn't directly cause it, but its failures and shortcomings allowed the conditions that led to the war to develop unchecked.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The League of Nations failed to prevent World War II due to its inability to enforce decisions, lack of key member participation, structural weaknesses, and the rising tide of nationalism and aggression in the 1930s.}} \]
