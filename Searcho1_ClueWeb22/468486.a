As an AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information and analysis on the topic of whether the United States healthcare system is truly a free and market-based system.

First, let's define what a free and market-based healthcare system would look like. In theory, a free market system relies on supply and demand to determine prices and allocate resources. Consumers choose among competing providers, and competition drives quality and efficiency. There is minimal government intervention beyond setting regulations to ensure safety and fairness.

Now, let's examine the U.S. healthcare system against these criteria.

1. **Private vs. Public Involvement**: The U.S. healthcare system is predominantly private, with multiple private insurance companies and healthcare providers. However, there are significant public programs such as Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for low-income individuals. Additionally, the government plays a role in regulating healthcare through laws and agencies like the FDA and CMS.

2. **Price Controls and Subsidies**: While there is some level of market determination of prices, the government does influence pricing through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. These rates can affect what private insurers pay as well. There are also subsidies provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for those who qualify.

3. **Market Competition**: Competition exists among healthcare providers and insurance companies. However, many areas have limited competition due to market consolidation, with hospitals and insurers forming large networks. This can lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers.

4. **Consumer Choice**: Patients have the freedom to choose their healthcare providers and insurance plans, within the constraints of their insurance coverage. However, the complexity of the system can make it difficult for consumers to make informed choices about their healthcare.

5. **Regulation**: There is substantial government regulation in the healthcare sector, covering areas such as licensing of healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical approvals, and insurance mandates. These regulations can impact the operation and costs of healthcare services.

6. **Universal Coverage**: Unlike many other developed countries, the U.S. does not have universal healthcare coverage. While the ACA expanded coverage significantly, there are still millions of uninsured Americans.

Given these points, it's clear that while the U.S. healthcare system has elements of a market-based system, it also incorporates significant government involvement and regulation. The presence of public programs, price controls, subsidies, and extensive regulations suggests that it is not purely a free market system.

Moreover, the high costs and issues with access and quality in the U.S. healthcare system have led many to question whether the current mix of market forces and government intervention is effective.

In conclusion, the U.S. healthcare system combines aspects of both market-based and government-directed systems, making it a mixed model rather than purely free-market.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, the United States healthcare system is not purely a free and market-based system; it is a mixed model with significant government involvement.}} \]
