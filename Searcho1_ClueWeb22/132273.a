Alright, I need to figure out how pollution affects the East China Sea. I don't know much about this specific topic, so I should probably start by understanding what the East China Sea is and what kinds of pollution might be affecting it.

First things first, where is the East China Sea located? I think it's part of the Pacific Ocean, bordering China, Taiwan, and Japan. Yes, that sounds right. So, it's a semi-enclosed sea, which might make it more susceptible to pollution because pollutants can accumulate without much dilution.

Now, what types of pollution could be affecting it? Probably industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, sewage, and maybe oil spills. Let me think about each one.

Starting with industrial pollution. China has a massive industry, especially in regions like Shanghai and other coastal cities. Factories often discharge waste into water bodies, and if not treated properly, this can end up in the sea. What kind of pollutants are we talking about? Chemicals, heavy metals, sediments, perhaps even radioactive materials if there are nuclear plants nearby.

Next, agricultural runoff. Farmers use fertilizers and pesticides, which can wash off into rivers and eventually reach the sea. This can lead to eutrophication, where excess nutrients cause algal blooms that deplete oxygen in the water, creating dead zones where most marine life can't survive.

Sewage is another big issue. With such a large population living around the coast, human waste can be a significant source of pollution if not treated adequately. Sewage contains organic matter, pathogens, and nutrients that can harm marine ecosystems.

Oil spills are also a concern, especially with the amount of shipping traffic in the area. Accidental spills or deliberate dumping of oil can have devastating effects on marine life and habitats.

Moreover, I've heard about plastic pollution being a global issue. The East China Sea might be affected by plastic debris, which can entangle animals or be ingested, causing injury or death.

I should also consider air pollution. Some pollutants can fall into the sea through atmospheric deposition, adding to the water pollution.

To get a better understanding, I should look for specific examples or studies that document pollution levels and their impacts in the East China Sea.

Maybe I can search for something like "pollution in the East China Sea" or "environmental issues in the East China Sea."

Let me try that.

Pollution Rising Fast in China’s Seas
Pollution Rising Fast in China’s Seas

Rapid economic growth in China’s coastal regions has resulted in serious levels  of ocean pollution, damaging marine life and posing a threat to humans. As  much as half of China’s offshore areas are considered polluted.
Roughly 48,000 square kilometres of China’s oceanic territory is seriously polluted, an increase of  18,300 square kilometres from last year, according to a report by the State Oceanic Administration of  China (SOA). Of the 18 ecological zones monitored by the SOA, 14 were found to have unhealthy levels  of pollution.
After 30 years of explosive economic growth, China last year overtook Japan as the world’s second  largest economy. While that growth has improved lives for tens of millions, it has also left China as one  of the most polluted countries in the world, from sky to sea.
Booming coastal centres are dumping a growing amount of industrial and domestic waste at sea. About  147,000 square kilometres of China’s coastal waters failed to meet standards for 'clear water' in 2009,  a 7.3 percent increase from the year before, the SOA reported last year.
The new report, called the 2010 China Marine Environment Bulletin, found that 86 percent of China’s  estuaries, bays, wetlands, coral reefs and seaweed beds were below what the SOA considers 'healthy'.
China has up to five million hectares of estuaries and coastal wetlands, both of which are important  ecosystems. Since the 1990s, land reclamation and dam building has threatened these areas. Coastal  wetlands are disappearing at a rate of 20,000 hectares a year, and 337 of 457 discharge outlets in  China’s estuary areas were found to have excessive levels of pollution, according to a 2009 report by  the SOA.
In 2008, China had 13,380 square kilometres of reclaimed land, up from 8,241 square kilometres in  1990s, a Legal Daily story said last month.
Rapidly rising levels of oil, pesticides and other harmful pollutants are contaminating the country’s  marine life, including the shellfish supply, according to state media reports last year. Shellfish in  offshore areas were found to contain 'excessive harmful chemicals' such as lead, cadmium and the  insecticide DDT. Levels of lead detected in shellfish were 50 percent above normal, while cadmium and  DDT levels were about 40 percent higher.
Lead can cause damage to the human nervous system and cause blood and brain disorders if consumed  in unsafe amounts. The World Health Organisation considers DDT a 'moderately hazardous' pesticide.
Last year China’s coastal waters suffered 68 'red tides', or algae blooms, caused by excessive sewage in  the water, affecting 14,700 square kilometres, 3.4 times the area affected in the 1990s, according to  the report.  'Algae bloom seriously threatens fishing resources,' Yu Rencheng, a researcher at the Chinese Academy  of Social Sciences’ Institute of Oceanology tells IPS. Severely polluted areas include the northern Yellow Sea, Liaodong Bay, Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, the  Yangtze River estuary, Hangzhou Bay and the Pearl River estuary. Pollutants exceeding normal levels  include inorganic nitrogen, reactive phosphate and oil.  According to the SOA report, 50 percent of China’s offshore areas were facing problems with pollution,  and 48,000 square kilometres did not meet Grade IV standards — meaning they were seriously polluted.  Dangerous levels of pollution are generally found near areas experiencing rapid economic growth, Yu  explains. The main causes of coastal pollution include the discharge of untreated sewage, the discharge  of industrial and residential wastewater, and spillage resulting from shipping and marine accidents.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 733 shipping accidents in China’s ocean jurisdiction, which led to  massive economic and environmental losses, according to government figures.  In the 1990s the government tried to curb pollution in China’s major rivers, which drain into the ocean.  Along with national laws, local and provincial level governments have been encouraged to implement  their own laws and regulations to prevent and control water pollution in small and medium-sized  bodies of water, Yu says. In 2009, China’s State Council issued regulations to curb marine pollution caused by shipping. The  regulation, which included 78 new rules that came into effect in 2010, called on transportation  departments under the state council to develop emergency plans to deal with pollution caused by  shipping.
Government officials have admitted there is still a long way to go in tackling the problem of marine  pollution.
'Our environmental quality is only improving in certain areas, but overall the environment is still  deteriorating,' Vice Minister of Environmental Protection Zhang Lijun told state media.
Lan Hongyan, an expert on marine environment at Hebei Normal University, says a large part of the  problem is an uncoordinated approach to tackling ocean pollution. Several different government bodies  — including the State Oceanic Administration, the Marine Safety Administration and other national and  provincial departments — all oversee different aspects of regulating ocean pollution.
'We don’t have a powerful and coordinated system, which impacts law enforcement,' Lan tells IPS.

The largest algal bloom ever recorded in China has turned the Yellow Sea green and may be related to pollution from agriculture and industry.
Officials in the city of Qingdao had used bulldozers to remove 7,335 tonnes of the growth from beaches according to the Xinhua news agency.
The phenomenon has become an annual occurrence in the region over the past six summers. This year's incident has swathed 28,900 sq km (11,158 sq miles), twice as much as the previous biggest bloom in 2008.
The algae, called Enteromorpha prolifera, is not toxic to humans or animals.
However the carpet on the surface can dramatically change the ecology of the environment beneath it. It blocks sunlight from entering the ocean and sucks oxygen from the water suffocating marine life.

The algae thrives on an abundance of nutrients in the sea. University of Cambridge and EnAlgae Project researcher Dr Brenda Parker said that the Chinese bloom may well be linked to industrial pollution.
"Algal blooms often follow a massive discharge of phosphates or nitrates into the water. Whether it's farming, untreated sewage or some kind of industrial plant that is discharging waste into the water," she said.
The recent explosion of the algae pointed to a dramatic change in the ecosystem which was probably not natural.
"That would probably be an indicator that something is a little bit unbalanced," said Parker.
She said that the 2009 example algal bloom on the Brittany coast was a similar example of a human-induced algal bloom.

•
Land-sourced nutrients have caused severe eutrophication in coastal China.
•
Coastal eutrophication worsened rapidly from the end of the 1980s to the mid-2000s.
•
Control measures have curbed the worsening trend in the last decade.
•
Coastal eutrophication should slightly decrease in the China Seas in the near future.
1. Introduction
Eutrophication is the over-enrichment by nutrients in a water body causing an accelerated production of organic matter, particularly algae. In recent decades, various anthropogenic activities have substantially increased nutrient inputs to waters and changed the nutrient composition. This, in turn, has accelerated the accumulation of organic matter (especially algae) in waters and caused undesirable effects, such as harmful algal blooms, depleted dissolved oxygen, and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic fauna, thereby affecting seawater quality, ecosystem health, and human use (Bricker et al., 1999; Meyerreil and Köster, 2000 ). This phenomenon has been termed “cultural eutrophication” (Bricker et al., 1999 ). Coastal eutrophication has emerged as one of the major environmental problems that plague the coastal countries of the world, and it is also a focal point for scientific research on coastal ecosystems (Justic et al., 1995; Cloern, 1998; Scavia and Bricker, 2006; Andersen and Conley, 2009 ).
The coastal ecosystems of the China Seas provide important support for economic and social development. The four China Seas (the Bohai, Yellow, East China, and South China Seas) are adjacent to the edge of the continent of China, link to each other, and span the temperate, subtropical, and tropical zones, forming an arc from north to south (Fig. 1 ). They are marginal seas in the western North Pacific Ocean. The Bohai Sea is a shallow inland sea with an area of 77,000 km 2 and an average water depth of 18 m. Major rivers flowing into the Bohai Sea are the Yellow (Huanghe), Haihe, and Liaohe Rivers. The Yellow Sea is a semi-closed continental shelf sea between the Shandong Peninsula and the Korean Peninsula, which has an area of 380,000 km 2 and an average water depth of 44 m. The Yalu River and a small part of the Yangtze (Changjiang) River freshwater discharge into the Yellow Sea. The East China Sea has an area of 760,000 km 2 and mostly comprises continental shelves with depths less than 200 m. The main rivers discharging into the East China Sea include the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River. The South China Sea covers an area of approximately 3.5 million km 2, with an average water depth of 1212 m, and has an oceanic nature. The main river in mainland China discharging into the South China Sea is the Pearl (Zhujiang) River.

In 1978 China started to put into effect the policies of reform and opening up to the outside world, since then the whole of China has witnessed great changes in almost every field. For instance, China's GDP has grown by 75 times in 1978–2016, ranking it the second biggest economy in the world since 2010 (World Bank, 2018 ). However, like many other countries in the world, China's rapid economic and social development has also had consequences, namely environmental problems. In the last four decades, substantial changes have occurred in the coastal ecosystems of the China Seas as a result of multiple stresses. In particular, coastal eutrophication has become one of the major problems encountered in the coastal ecosystem of the China Seas (Wang, 2006 ), which severely restricts the sustainable economic and social development of coastal areas. Therefore, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up, the authors decided that it was necessary to systematically analyze the cause of coastal eutrophication, and to elucidate the historical evolution and future trends of its ecological and environmental effects in the China Seas. The purpose on the analysis was to identify controlling factors of coastal eutrophication as well as the relevant experience and lessons in marine environmental management over the past 40 years, so as to enable appropriate control and governance measures to be adopted in order to achieve and maintain a healthy marine environment in the China Seas, just like the “OSPAR Strategy to Combat Eutrophication” adopted by the European union (OSPAR Commission, 2010 ).
In this paper, we review the history of coastal eutrophication in the China Seas in the past 40 years with regard to the causes (i.e. stress, including terrestrial nutrient inputs and the levels and structure of nutrients in coastal waters), and ecological and environmental effects (i.e. state, including phytoplankton composition and biomass, harmful algal blooms, and depleted dissolved oxygen etc.). The likely future trends for coastal eutrophication are also investigated.
2. Long-term changes in the flux and composition of land-sourced nutrients input to coastal waters
Anthropogenic activities (e.g. industrial and agricultural production, urban living, and aquaculture) result in nutrient inputs to coastal waters directly or indirectly, accelerating the external inputs of nutrients to coastal waters. Terrestrial inputs, especially river inputs, are the most important external source of nutrients in coastal waters of the China Seas (Qu and Kroeze, 2010 ).
In the last four decades, changes in the flux and composition of nutrients from major rivers in China varied according to the different rivers and the different nutrients. The variation trend of various nutrients differed in the same river, while there were also differences in the trend of the same nutrient among different rivers. The sum of freshwater discharge from the three largest Chinese rivers, namely the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Pearl River, represents 73% of the total freshwater discharge from Chinese rivers into the China Seas (Cheng and Zhao, 1985 ). Changes in the concentration/flux of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from these major rivers to the sea can be roughly divided into four stages, namely slow increase, rapid increase, high-level fluctuation, and/or fluctuating decline stages. For example, the riverine concentration of DIN from the Yellow River increased slowly at the beginning of the 1980s, and then rapidly from the mid-1980s to the beginning of the 2000s; thereafter, it maintained high-level fluctuations and showed a trend of fluctuating declines (Fig. 2 a ). Since there were drastic changes in the freshwater discharge from the Yellow River in recent decades, changes in the riverine flux of DIN were different from changes in its concentration (Wang and Li, 2006; Liao et al., 2013 ). The riverine concentration and flux of DIN from the Yangtze River increased slowly from the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s, while it entered a rapid increase stage from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s and maintained high-level fluctuations afterwards (Fig. 2 b). Regarding the concentration of DIN from the Pearl River to the sea, its rapid growth stage lasted until the beginning of the 21st century, and maintained high-level fluctuations thereafter (Liu et al., 2009 ).

The riverine concentration and flux of phosphorus showed different trends compared with DIN. The riverine concentration and flux of dissolved phosphorus from the Yellow River increased from the end of the 1970s to the mid-1980s, and then changed in a W-shaped pattern from the mid-1980s (Fig. 2 a). The riverine concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) from the Yangtze River fluctuated around 0.5 μmol/L in the first two decades, and then increased rapidly to more than 2 μmol/L from the end of the 1990s to the end of the 2000s and maintained high-level fluctuations afterwards (Fig. 2 b). The riverine concentration of DIP from the Pearl River generally increased with large fluctuations in recent decades (Yuan et al., 2009 ).
The “artificial-lake effect” produced by human activities, such as river dam construction, has led to a general decline in dissolved silicate (DSi) concentrations in rivers around the world (Humborg et al., 1997; Christoph et al., 2000 ). The same is true for rivers in China. For example, the concentration of DSi in the Yangtze River water decreased by approximately 1/4 from the 1960s to the 1980s (Li et al., 2007 ), while it generally remained at around 100 μmol/L from the end of the 1980s (Li et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2014 ). The concentration of DSi in the Yellow River remained at a relatively stable level from the end of the 1980s, but there was a significant decrease compared with the mid-1980s (Ma et al., 2015; Ran et al., 2015 ).
Overall, changes in the nutrients from terrestrial sources to the sea were closely related to China's GDP growth rate, development pattern, population growth, as well as environmental protection policies and measures (Qu and Kroeze, 2010, Qu and Kroeze, 2012 ). During the first decade of the reform and opening up, the GDP had a high growth rate but was on a small scale, and the increasing rate of nutrient inputs to the sea was relatively low. During the subsequent two decades, from the end of the 1980s to the beginning of the 21st century, the GDP had a high growth rate and the average GDP was ten times higher than in the first decade, and the nutrient inputs to the sea increased rapidly. In the last decade, despite the continuous rapid increase in the GDP, there has been a transition of the economic development pattern from “quantity first” to “quality first”, and promotion of the green development concept (Xiao and Zhao, 2017 ), leading to the implementation of a series of control measures to reduce emissions from terrestrial sources, such as limiting the sources of industrial waste water, the construction of public sewage treatment systems, and comprehensive improvements to the drainage basin environment. These measures have effectively curbed the increasing trend in nutrient inputs to the sea, but a steadily decreasing trend is not obvious. It is encouraging that the amount of agricultural fertilizer application in China already achieved zero growth in 2017, and the utilization efficiency of agricultural fertilizer will be increased continuously in the future (Ministry of Agriculture of China, 2017 ), which will bring great benefits for decreasing nutrient inputs from terrestrial sources to the sea.
3. Long-term changes in the level and structure of nutrients in coastal waters
Substantial changes in the flux and ratio of nutrients discharged into the sea have led to significant changes in the level and structure of nutrients in coastal waters of the China Seas. In the Bohai Sea, the DIN concentration changed little from the end of the 1970s to the mid-1980s. Nonetheless, there was a rapid increase of approximately 5-fold from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but it decreased dramatically from the mid-1990s to the beginning of the 21st century (Wang and Li, 2006; Hong and Wang, 2012 ). In the Yellow Sea, the DIN concentration increased linearly from the mid-1980s to the mid-2000s (Fig. 3 a ), and there was an approximately 3-fold increase over the two decades (Wei et al., 2015 ). In the Changjiang Estuary, the DIN fluctuated at relatively low levels from the end of the 1970s to the 1980s, but increased rapidly from the mid-1990s to the end of the 2000s, and currently is fluctuating at high-levels (Fan et al., 2015) (Fig. 3 c). The DIN concentration in the surface water of the continental shelf of the East China Sea fluctuated at relatively stable levels over the last 20 years (Cao et al., 2013 ). The DIN in the Pearl River Estuary increased rapidly from the 1990s (Ma et al., 2009 ).

(2015); Data for the Changjiang Estuary obtained from Wang (2006) (hollow circles, triangles and diamonds), Xin (2014) (semi-filled circles and diamonds, and inverted triangles), and NSFC (2018) (dots, solid triangles and diamonds). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Compared with DIN, DIP followed a markedly different trend. In the Bohai Sea, the DIP concentrations varied in a W-shaped pattern from the 1970s to the 2000s, and reached a peak at the end of the 1990s (Wang and Li, 2006 ). In recent years, there was a slight decreasing trend (Wang and Li, 2006; Hong and Wang, 2012 ). In the Yellow Sea, the DIP decreased from the end of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s. After it rebounded in the 1990s, the DIP concentration generally remained stable (Fig. 3 a) (Wei et al., 2015 ). In the Changjiang Estuary, the DIP increased rapidly from the end of the 1990s, and it is currently fluctuating at high levels (Fan et al., 2015) (Fig. 3 c). The DIP concentration in the surface waters of the East China Sea generally remained at relatively low levels in recent decades (Hong and Wang, 2012 ). The DIP in the Pearl River Estuary remained at around 0.5 μmol/L in the 1990s, but abruptly rose to 1.5 μmol/L in the 2000s (Ma et al., 2009 ).
The average concentration of DSi in the Bohai Sea dropped rapidly from approximately 20 μmol/L at the beginning of the 1980s to approximately 7 μmol/L at the end of the 1990s, and has been fluctuating at this level since the beginning of the 21st century (Wang and Li, 2006 ). The DSi concentration in the Yellow Sea clearly decreased from the middle of the 1970s to the middle of the 1990s, but it returned to the level of the 1970s after entering the 21st century (Fig. 3 a) (Wei et al., 2015 ). The DSi concentration in the Changjiang Estuary slightly decreased from the end of the 1970s but seemed to slightly rebound in recent years (Fig. 3 c). The DSi concentration in the Pearl River Estuary increased from the 1990s (Ma et al., 2009 ).
Unsynchronized changes in the levels of different nutrients led to changes in the structure of nutrients in coastal waters, namely the N/P ratio generally increased and the Si/N ratio generally decreased. In the Bohai Sea, for instance, the N/P ratio fluctuated at around 3 in the mid-1980s, and then drastically rose (almost linearly) afterwards, and it had exceeded 25 by the 21st century, while the Si/N ratio showed a dramatically decreasing trend over the same period (Wang and Li, 2006 ). In the Yellow Sea, the N/P ratio rose rapidly from around 5 in the mid-1980s to around 20 in the mid-2000s, while the Si/N ratio dropped from around 2 to 1 over the same period, and the Si/P ratio changed in a V-shaped pattern with the lowest values in the mid-1990s (Wei et al., 2015 )( Fig. 3 b). In the Changjiang Estuary, the N/P ratio maintained high-level fluctuations around 40 from the 1980s, while the Si/N ratio dropped from around 4 to 1 over the same period (Fig. 3 d). However, the N/P ratio in the Pearl River Estuary decreased from the end of 1990s (Ma et al., 2009 ).
4. Ecological and environmental effects of coastal eutrophication
Because of increases in the level and changes in the structure of nutrients (N and P) in coastal waters, the biomass increased and the composition of the phytoplankton changed, which in turn caused other changes in the ecosystems, such as harmful algal blooms, oxygen deficits, and zoobenthos losses. For example, in the Bohai Sea, the phytoplankton biomass (indicated by chlorophyll a concentration) was 1.2 μg/L at the beginning of the 1980s and it had increased to around 2.3 μg/L by the beginning of the 21st century (Wang and Li, 2006 ). In contrast, the cell density of net-collected phytoplankton dropped dramatically over the same period, indicating that the phytoplankton composition had changed toward smaller individuals. The analysis showed that the dominant species of phytoplankton in the Bohai Sea were all diatoms in the beginning of the 1980s. However, several Ceratium species of Pyrroptata gradually became dominant from the 1990s to the 2000s, and the total number of species and their ecological properties, as well as the structure of dominant species, also changed (Wang and Li, 2006 ).
The annual average of phytoplankton biomass in the Changjiang Estuary (indicated by chlorophyll a) was approximately 1.5 μg/L at the beginning of the 1980s, and has currently increased to around 3 μg/L (Fig. 4 ). During the same period, the species composition of phytoplankton in the Changjiang Estuary also changed. The relative abundance of diatoms decreased gradually, while the relative abundance of dinoflagellates showed a gradually increasing trend (Jiang et al., 2014; Xin, 2014 ). Both the total biomass and species number of zoobenthos in the Changjiang Estuary and adjacent waters decreased, and the decrease in species number was particularly evident (Wang, 2006; Xin, 2014 ). In recent years, the proportion of polychaetes with small individuals, short life cycles, and high tolerance to environmental pollution increased, and gradually became dominant by replacing large, relatively long-lived echinoderms and molluscs (Xin, 2014 ).

Harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficits in seawater are the major undesirable consequences of coastal eutrophication. Research shows that eutrophication is one of the main causes of the increasing frequency of harmful algal blooms worldwide. Red tide occurred rarely in the coastal waters of the China Seas before the 1960s (Zhou et al., 2001 ), and it occurred on average only twice per year in the 1970s. The average annual frequency of red tide was less than ten in the 1980s, but it increased to several tens in the 1990s, with a significant increase in affected areas at the end of the 1990s. The annual frequency and area of red tide increased rapidly in the 21st century and peaked in the mid-2000s. In recent years, the annual frequency of red tide has decreased gradually, while the affected area has decreased dramatically (Fig. 5 ). The main species of red tide were dinoflagellates in coastal waters of the China Seas, where toxic and harmful organisms increased and the potentially red tide were dominated by dinoflagellate (Zhou et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2015 ). In addition to red tide, in the last decade there have been frequent occurrences of brown tide, with Aureococcus anophagefferens as the causative species in the Bohai Sea, and green tide with Ulva prolifera as the causative species in the Yellow Sea (Yu and Liu, 2016 ). These species indicate a diversified, harmful, and miniaturized evolution trend for the causative species of algal blooms in coastal waters of the China Seas (Yu and Liu, 2016 ).

Another eco-environmental problem closely associated with coastal eutrophication is oxygen deficit in estuarine and coastal waters. A severe oxygen deficit can cause the collapse of marine ecosystems and fishery resources (Rabalais et al., 2014; Breitburg et al., 2018 ). Although oxygen deficit in coastal water is a natural process and is affected by multiple factors, coastal eutrophication is undoubtedly the main cause of the increased area and increased oxygen deficit in coastal waters of the China Seas in recent decades. Studies have shown that the area of oxygen deficit has had a gradually increasing trend in the Changjiang Estuary over the past decades (Wang, 2009; Ning et al., 2011 ), and that its interdecadal variations were mainly controlled by eutrophication and hydrodynamic factors (Wei et al., 2011 ). The dissolved oxygen in the bottom of the Pearl River Estuary also followed a decreasing trend, leading to a marked increase in the abundance of hypoxia-tolerant foraminifera from 1970 (Ye et al., 2012 ), which were closely related to an excess of nitrogen inputs (Yin et al., 2004 ). In addition, the problem of bottom water acidification associated with bottom water oxygen deficit is one of the indirect adverse consequences of coastal eutrophication, and could also have adverse effects on coastal ecosystems (Zhai et al., 2012 ).
In addition to the problems of harmful algal blooms and oxygen deficit in water, eutrophication can also lead to ecological disasters at higher trophic levels. For instance, eco-environmental problems such as jellyfish blooms and a decline in fishery resources are also caused, to some extent, by coastal eutrophication. In recent years, jellyfish numbers showed an increasing trend in coastal waters of the China Seas, and jellyfish blooms occurred in consecutive years in local areas, and were considered to be closely related to coastal eutrophication (Sun, 2012 ). Moreover, coastal eutrophication may lead to other adverse consequences, such as the loss of submerged vegetation, change/death in zoobenthos and epiphyte problems. These issues are not further discussed in this article because of limited monitoring data.
5. Coastal eutrophication hotspots
The assessment of the status of coastal eutrophication should include, but is not limited to, the cause (i.e. stress) and the consequences (i.e. state) of eutrophication (Bricker et al., 1999; Scavia and Bricker, 2006 ). From the integral perspectives of its cause and consequences, the hotspots of coastal eutrophication in the China Seas will be broadly identified. From the 1980s to the 1990s, the hotspots mainly included the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent waters, the coastal waters of the Bohai Sea, and the coastal waters off Guangdong and Zhejiang Provinces (Fig. 1 ). From the beginning of the 21st century, the hotspots expanded to the coastal waters off northern Jiangsu and Liaoning Provinces in the Yellow Sea, and the coastal waters off Fujian Province in the East China Sea. Even the coastal waters off Guangxi Province, where water quality has always been good, are facing a certain degree of eutrophication stress (Yang et al., 2015 ).
It should be noted that the assessment methods for coastal eutrophication in the China Seas are still limited to the nutrient-based classification system of the “Phase I” approaches, namely various mathematical formulas for calculating the eutrophication index based on nitrogen, phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, and chlorophyll concentrations (Xiong and Chen, 1993; Lin, 1996; Guo et al., 1998 ). However, globally, the symptom-based, multi-parameter, assessment approaches, i.e. the “Phase II” approaches, have become the principal methods for assessing coastal eutrophication (Bricker et al., 1999; Scavia and Bricker, 2006 ). Some useful studies have been using the ‘Phase II’ approaches for eutrophication assessment and their applications in the China Seas (Xiao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012 ). However, these studies require the cooperative efforts of marine environmental workers to develop a scientific, universal, and practical eutrophication assessment method that applies to the ecological and environmental characteristics of the China Seas, to more accurately and comprehensively reveal the status and regional distribution of coastal eutrophication in the China Seas.
6. Summary and perspective
During the 40 years of reform and opening up, rapid economic and social development in China has led to increased fluxes of nutrients (N and P) and has changed the ratios of nutrients in the coastal waters, causing severe coastal eutrophication problems. In general, the process of coastal eutrophication was and is closely related to China's GDP and growth rate, the development pattern, and the environmental protection policies and measures in place. In the first decade of reform and opening up, the GDP had a high growth rate but was relatively small, and the nutrient inputs to the sea were low, and thus the problem of coastal eutrophication was not prominent. In the following two decades, however, the GDP showed a high growth rate and was relatively large, and the nutrient inputs to the sea increased rapidly, leading to a rapid worsening in coastal eutrophication. In the last decade, a series of control measures were implemented to reduce emissions from terrestrial sources and effectively curbed the worsening trend in coastal eutrophication in the China Seas, but the steady improving trend was not very distinct. On the one hand, this might be caused by a lag in the response of coastal ecosystems to changes in the input stress. On the other hand, it might be caused by the relatively long time period self-purification needs to relieve the inputted stress (nutrients) accumulated in the coastal ecosystem. Some researchers have predicted, based on model results, that coastal eutrophication would worsening in the China Seas in the future because of further increases in riverine inputs of nutrients (Strokal et al., 2014 ). However, the authors argue that it is very likely that the status of coastal eutrophication in the China Seas will remain stable and may even slightly improve in the near future. It is based on the fact that, on the one hand, the increasing trend of nutrient pressure (i.e., land-sourced nutrients input and the level of nutrients in coastal waters) and the worsening trend of the state of eutrophication (e.g., red tide events) has been curbed or even improved in coastal waters of the China Seas in the last decade; on the other hand, it is very likely that land-sourced nutrients input would decrease further in the near future through the on-going implementation of a series of control measures to reduce emissions from terrestrial sources. However, it will take a longer time for major improvements to take place.
Since the reform and opening up, China has made remarkable progress in the economic, political, cultural, and social fields, which have received attention from the international community and have been hailed as the “China model”. While drawing on the “China model”, other developing countries in the world could also learn from China's experience and lessons in marine environmental protection and management.

1. Introduction
The East China Sea (ECS) is one of the largest marginal seas in the world. It receives approximately 486 million tons of sediments annually from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and other rivers. As a result, large amounts of sediment as well as other particulate matter have accumulated on the seabed. Fine particles can be easily re-suspended from the bottom to the surface under the influence of tides, winds, ocean currents and other forces. In the coastal areas of the ECS, the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) can be very high with values over 5000 g m − 3 in some regions. In contrast, TSM concentrations are very low in the eastern part of the ECS, less than 0.1 g m − 3. The high concentrations can be due to the presence of suspended sediments or phytoplankton cells, or a mixture of both. Meanwhile, the colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM) vary from high in coastal areas to low over the outer shelf. The variety of water constituents in the ECS gives rise to very complicated optical properties of waters.
Suspended sediment has always been a great concern for coastal engineering management. It is an important consideration in the cost of port maintenance and the decision to develop new port sites. Suspended sediment is a good proxy for water quality in coastal waters due to its close relationship with other water quality parameters. It plays a key role in the ecological system of coastal waters because of its impact on phytoplankton productivity, nutrient concentration and pollutants (Doxaran et al., 2009 ). Sediment transport also plays an important role in the global carbon cycle since half of the terrestrial organic carbon exported by rivers is ultimately buried in marine sediment (Schlunz & Schneider, 2000 ).
Mapping TSM from satellite data is a useful way to investigate the distribution and variation of suspended sediment and chlorophyll concentration at the sea surface. In turbid waters, owing to the strong absorption and backscattering of sunlight by particles in waters, suspended particles have a dominant influence on the optical properties of waters, resulting in the poor performance of remote sensing algorithms for chlorophyll (Sathyendranath et al., 1989 ). The presence of TSM in coastal areas can lead to overestimates of chlorophyll concentration by 20–500% (Ahn et al., 2001 ). However, with improved knowledge of the optical properties of water constituents and more reliable observations of TSM concentrations, the effects of suspended sediment may be removed from remote sensing reflectance and the performance of the algorithms for chlorophyll concentration in Case 2 waters can be improved.
Many models of TSM have been developed using empirical methods or semi-analytical approaches. These models can be used to process satellite data efficiently, but some problems are encountered when they are applied to the ECS. For example, when the TSM algorithm developed by Tassan (1994) was used to process satellite data in the ECS, the values of the retrieved TSM concentrations were all less than 3 g m − 3. The two algorithms of Neukermans et al. (2009) gave the maximum concentrations of TSM in the ECS as 32 and 45 g m − 3, respectively. However, field measurements indicate a much wider range of TSM concentrations in the ECS, from <0.1 to >5000 g m − 3. The discrepancies indicate that the algorithms developed for other regions must be modified before they can be applied to the ECS.
Many TSM models based on empirical methods have been used in operational satellite remote sensing systems. These models were established on the basis of statistical relationships between TSM concentrations and single-channel or multi-channel reflectance. The band selection is critical for the establishment of a robust model. The Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images at Band 1 (0.45–0.52 μm) is sensitive to various concentrations of suspended solids (Baban, 1993 ), and has been used to map fluvial sediment discharge based on a linear relationship between suspended solid concentrations and digital number (Baban, 1995 ). Eleveld et al. (2008) used the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Band 5 (0.545–0.565 μm) for monitoring suspended particulate matters. Miller and Mckee (2004) established a robust linear relationship between the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra Band 1 (0.62–0.67 μm) data and in situ measurements of TSM. Ahn et al. (2001) argued that the best wavelength for suspended sediment was 0.625 μm while Ouillon et al. (2008) considered the reflectance at 0.681 μm as the best choice for remote sensing turbidity using a one-band polynomial relationship. These studies suggest that the reflectance at many different bands can be used to retrieve TSM. As the sensitivity of remote sensing reflectance is related to the wavelengths and the range of TSM concentrations, the combination of the reflectance at different bands may improve the performance of TSM models.
The sensitivity of the reflectance at a given band varies significantly with TSM distributions from clear ocean waters to very turbid coastal waters. It is thus difficult to apply one TSM model for all water types. To overcome this limitation, some models include two algorithms, and the computation is switched between the two algorithms according to the ranges of TSM concentrations (Neukermans et al., 2009, Pradhan et al., 2005, Tassan, 1994 ). These models can improve the accuracy of retrievals, but they may also introduce some pseudo-features in TSM imagery. Therefore, to develop a robust TSM model, it is necessary to find a proxy which has a linear relationship over the entire range of TSM concentrations.
Semi-analytical models have been established by many authors based on the relationship between the inherent optical properties (IOP) and water constituents (e.g. Gordon et al., 1988 ). The IOP parameters include absorption and scattering properties (coefficients and scattering phase function) of pure seawater, suspended sediments, phytoplankton and CDOM. There are several different approaches to retrieve TSM based on different IOP parameters. Since light scattered from suspended particles is generally the first-order determinant for variability in reflectance in coastal waters, the backscattering coefficients can be used to derive TSM (Babin et al., 2003, Volpe et al., 2011 ). Similarly, if the absorption coefficient of particles can be deduced from the reflectance spectra using an analytical inversion model, it can then be used to derive TSM distributions. TSM concentrations can also be derived from the reflectance spectra using simple bio-optical models (Fettweis et al., 2007, Nechad et al., 2010 ). Dekker et al. (2001) developed algorithms based on an analytical optical model in conjunction with the in situ IOP parameters. Doerffer and Fischer (1994) developed an inversion modeling technique using a two-flow radiative transfer approximation including the aerosol path radiance.
The performance of a TSM model is expected to improve if empirical and semi-analytical approaches are combined. In this study, the TSM model is established in two steps: Firstly, four indices are constructed from different combinations of the reflectance signal. One of these indices is derived from a simplified semi-analytical model, while the others are obtained using empirical methods. These four indices are then used to derive the complex proxy. In the second step, the relationship between the complex proxy and TSM concentrations is analyzed. Based on the results of the analyses, a new TSM model is established. The performance of the model is evaluated using both SeaWiFS imagery and in situ reflectance data. In the following sections, band selections and parameters in the TSM model are discussed, together with the sensitivity of the indices to the satellite imagery.
2. Measurements and data analysis
Four cruises were carried out to measure TSM concentrations and water-leaving reflectance for the development of the TSM algorithm. The cruises were conducted in the summer and winter of 2006 and in the spring and autumn of 2007. Each cruise employed two ships (Haijian 46 and Haijian 49) and took about 2 months to complete 514 pre-planned stations in the ECS (Fig. 1 ).

2.1. Measurements of TSM concentrations and turbidity
TSM concentrations were carried out using the weighing method, following the Chinese National Standard protocols (SAC, 2007 ). Briefly, water samples were collected at a depth of 1 m using a rosette Niskin sampler and filtered immediately onto 47 mm diameter dried and pre-weighed Sartorius™ acetate fiber filters on board. The filters were stored in a − 20 °C refrigerator until processed in the laboratory where they were repeatedly dried (> 4 h) in a thermal infrared dryer at 40 °C and weighed until the difference between the last two measurements was less than 0.01 mg. The inorganic fraction was separated by burning the filters in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for about 2 h and weighing the inorganic remains carefully. The organic fraction was then calculated from the difference between TSM concentrations and the inorganic fraction. During the operations, the adsorbed sea salts and the associated water of hydration were not removed from the filters. This may introduce some errors in measurements of sea water (Stavn et al., 2009 ).
The turbidity data were measured using a Seapoint Turbidity Meter (STM) equipped with a water quality instrument manufactured by Richard Brancker Research Ltd (RBR). This RBR instrument was installed on a conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) package. The instrument is easy to operate and can log a large amount of data automatically. In addition to turbidity, the RBR instrument can also incorporate other sensors, such as sensors for chlorophyll fluorescence and yellow substance fluorescence. The RBR instrument is very useful for measuring the vertical distribution of water constituents. Some pertinent information about the four cruises and in situ measurements is given in Table 1.

TSM concentrations were estimated using the weighing technique, while the Seapoint Turbidity Meter (STM) was used to measure turbidity in Formazan Turbidity Units (FTU). A total of 964 stations of TSM and 515 stations of STM turbidity data were included in the in situ dataset, of which 170 stations had both measurements. Some statistics of TSM concentrations and STM turbidity are listed in Table 2.

A wide range of TSM concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 8341 g m − 3 was obtained (Table 2 ). The minimum TSM concentration is 0.2 g m − 3 whereas the minimum turbidity value is 0.24 FTU. The maximum TSM concentrations from the spring and winter cruises (> 3000 g m − 3 ), are much higher than those obtained from the summer and autumn cruises. It should be noted that the values of STM turbidity are all less than 1000 FTU because of the saturation limitation of the sensor. The statistical values of turbidity are thus much lower than those of TSM. In addition, during the summer cruise, the turbidity data were only measured at 5 stations, all located over the outer shelf where waters were very clear.
To compare turbidity data with TSM concentrations collected in the ECS, the entire dataset (STM at 1 m and TSM at the sea surface) is plotted against the station number and is shown in Fig. 2. It is evident that the distributions of TSM and turbidity from the four cruises exhibit similar variations in the study area, indicating that the TSM values are comparable to STM turbidity measurements at the same sites during the four cruises. The TSM stations were evenly distributed in the entire ECS, while most of the turbidity measurements were made at stations 1 to 300 in the northern half of the ECS between latitudes 30 and 32.5°N. However, the turbidity measurements covered the Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay.

Fig. 2. Comparison between the STM turbidity (green crosses) and TSM (red dots) at the surface is plotted as a function of the station number. The sites of the stations are Hangzhou Bay (Stations 1 to 75), Yangtze Estuary (Stations 76 to 102), inner shelf (Stations 103 to 299), and outer shelf (Stations 300 to 514). The results are shown separately for (a) spring 2007; (b) summer 2006; (c) autumn 2007; (d) winter 2006.
Comparing TSM and turbidity in Fig. 2, we find that many TSM values in the Hangzhou Bay (stations 1 to 75) are much larger than the STM values. Surprisingly, the mean TSM concentrations of the four cruises in the Hangzhou Bay (741.6, 630.8, 603.2 and 803.9 g m − 3 for the spring, summer, autumn and winter cruises, respectively), are much higher than those of stations 76 to 102 in the Yangtze Estuary (81.2, 82.5, 135.1 and 151.3 g m − 3, respectively). This result is unexpected considering that the Yangtze River is the source of the bulk of TSM in the ECS and it is likely that the higher TSM concentration in the Hangzhou Bay is caused by re-suspension of sediment by the strong tidal currents.
The STM sensor measures turbidity by detecting light scattered by particles suspended in the water column at 0.88 μm. The output voltage is calibrated to turbidity in FTU. The relationship is linear with a relative error of less than 2% in the range of 0 to 750 FTU, but it becomes nonlinear for turbidity higher than 750 FTU. There are many stations with turbidity values higher than 750 FTU, all of which are located in the Hangzhou Bay or Yangtze Estuary. To improve the accuracy of turbidity at these stations, the simultaneously measured TSM is used to adjust the turbidity values higher than 750 FTU as follows: (1) Y=750+exp a ⋅ log x − 750 where x is the original turbidity, and Y is the TSM concentration or the adjusted turbidity. The parameter a is the coefficient of adjustment obtained from a nonlinear regression analysis between TSM and turbidity. The result is 1.45 obtained from 45 pairs of TSM and turbidity values from the four cruises in the ECS. We re-calibrated the values of turbidity according to Eq. (1) whenever the measured values were higher than 750 FTU (plotted as black dots in Fig. 3 ). It is apparent that the recalibrated turbidity improves the linear relationship with TSM. These pairs, together with the normal pairs (marked by red dots in Fig. 3 ), are used to establish the relationship between turbidity and TSM.

Fig. 3. Comparison between the STM turbidity and TSM at the same water depth at the same station. Turbidity values higher than 750 FTU are recalibrated using Eq. (2), marked by black dots. The pairs with turbidity twice as high as the TSM are marked by green dots and the pairs with less than half the TSM are marked by blue dots. The rest are marked by red dots. The number of pairs with red and black dots is 288 and the correlation coefficient is 0.954.
To combine turbidity and TSM datasets, the STM turbidity in FTU must be converted to TSM in g m − 3. Using data from all four cruises, there are a total of 170 stations which have measurements of both TSM and STM turbidity. These measurements provided a good opportunity to analyze the relationship between the STM turbidity and TSM. The STM sensor measures turbidity profiles at 6 Hz and the sampling rate depends on the lowering speed of the RBR package, typically, several times per meter. TSM was also measured at several water depths at some stations. To increase the number of match-up pairs, the turbidity and TSM at the same water depths are used to establish a match-up dataset. A total of 350 pairs of turbidity and TSM are available for inter-comparison (Fig. 3 ).
A reasonably good agreement is obtained between the STM turbidity and TSM measurements, with most of the pairs scattering around the 1:1 line (see Fig. 3 ). It is important to note that systematic bias between the two measurements is relatively small. Still, there are some outliners that fall away from the 1:1 line, indicating that the constituents of TSM are diverse in this region and that TSM values are highly variable. The time difference between the two measurements at each station is about 0.5 h. The discrepancies between the two sets of measurements suggest that TSM concentrations can change within this time interval as a result of tidal currents, sinking and re-suspending. To remove some obvious outliers, the pairs with TSM that is twice as high as the turbidity and the pairs with turbidity twice as high as the TSM were marked as the outliers in Fig. 3. These pairs were removed when analyzing the relationship between turbidity and TSM.
Doxaran et al. (2009) concluded from their investigation of turbidity and TSM that turbidity in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) could be converted to TSM in g m − 3 using a conversion factor of 0.9946. Boss et al. (2009) studied the relationship between turbidity measured by several kinds of turbidity sensors and TSM. In their study, the logarithmic function was used for both data sets to establish a linear relationship. Correlation coefficients were all higher than 0.95. We also found an improved linear relationship between the measured turbidity and TSM after the logarithmic function was applied as follows: (2) log TSM=a ∗ log FTU+b,where a and b are coefficients with values 1.0187 and − 0.0314, and standard deviations 0.023 and 0.005, respectively. The correlation coefficient of the regression of turbidity on TSM is 0.954. The high correlation suggests that it is appropriate to convert turbidity to TSM concentrations, which will increase the total number of TSM data significantly.
2.2. Measurement of remote sensing reflectance
In situ remote sensing reflectance was measured by two types of optical instruments: the hyperspectral spectrometer manufactured by Analytical Spectral Devices Inc. (ASD), and the Satlantic Profiling Spectrometer and Reference system (SPSR) by Satlantic Inc. The ASD instrument was operated following the protocol of the above-water method (Mueller et al., 2000 ). This instrument measures the downwelling irradiance (Es) incident on the gray plate, the water-leaving radiance (Lw) from the sea surface, and the sky radiance (Lsky). Each radiance measurement consists of a group of 20 continuous simultaneous spectra which can help to detect and remove contaminated spectra results from the changes in the measurement environment. The spectra of Es and Lsky can be contaminated by clouds while the spectra of Lw can be contaminated by sun glint or different reflections of surface waves. The integration time of the ASD was adjusted according to the magnitude of the sun light. The measurements were recorded in triplicate to obtain the mean value of the reflectance spectra at each station. The SPSR instrument has three sensors to measure the downwelling irradiance at the sea surface (Es), the downwelling irradiance in waters (Ed) and upwelling radiance in waters (Lu). The Es sensor was installed on the deck, while the Ed and Lu sensors were installed in a profiler. The SPSR instrument was operated following the protocol of the in-water method (Mueller, 2000 ). The measurements were repeated 2 to 3 times at each station and the one with the best data quality was selected as the reflectance of the station. The methods of Hooker et al. (2002) were followed to process the data.
The ASD instrument (wavelengths from 0.325 to 1.075 μm) was used to measure the reflectance at 132, 136, 143, and 48 stations during the spring, summer, autumn, and winter cruises, respectively. The SPSR (wavelengths from 0.35 to 0.8 μm) was used at 39, 20, 57, and 32 stations during the four cruises. Therefore, a total of 459 stations were measured using the ASD instrument and 148 stations using SPSR. The ASD and SPSR were both used at Station M2-3. The comparison of the two reflectance spectra is shown in Fig. 4. The shape and magnitude of the two spectra are very similar with relative differences lower than 5.0% at most wavelengths.

Fig. 4. Comparison of the reflectance spectra measured with the ASD and SPSR instruments at Station M2-3 (31.50°N, 122.37°E). These measurements were made on 13:20, Oct. 24, 2007. The wavelengths are from 0.4 to 0.9 μm for the ASD instrument and from 0.4 to 0.8 μm for the SPSR.
A total of 87 stations recorded by both instruments were used for the inter-comparison, with a relative mean difference of 4.5%. The reflectance measured by the ASD or SPSR instruments has hundreds of spectral bands. To make data comparable to satellite data, the reflectance spectra were processed in 8 spectral bands using the spectral averaging method according to the SeaWiFS response functions. The mean values of the two instruments at the SeaWiFS bands are also close to each other, with relative differences of − 4.7%, − 3.8%, − 2.4%, 0.14%, 4.6%, 25.8%, and 10.0% for the 8 spectral bands, respectively. The small relative differences suggest that the reflectance measured by the two instruments is in agreement and can be combined for the TSM model.
To provide an overview of the in situ reflectance in the ECS, the mean, maximum and standard deviation of the measured reflectances were calculated at the SeaWiFS bands, as shown in Table 3. The spectra of the ASD cover all 8 SeaWiFS bands, but the SPSR instrument can only measure the reflectance at wavelengths shorter than 0.8 μm, hence it cannot be used for SeaWiFS band 8 (0.845–0.885 μm).

Table 3 shows that large differences between the ASD and SPSR measurements occur in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The mean value of the ASD at 0.765 μm is 0.075 sr − 1, almost 5 times higher than that of the SPSR measurement. The maximum of the ASD at this band is 0.0671 sr − 1, which is 13 times higher than that of the SPSR. Standard deviations of the ASD reflectance at this band are 20 times higher than that of the SPSR. Large differences between the ASD and SPSR measurements are also apparent at Band 6. In contrast, the values of the ASD are close to those of the SPSR instrument for the blue-green bands.
Most of the differences in the reflectances shown in Table 3 can be attributed to the different locations of the ASD and SPSR measurements. The ASD instrument works well in very turbid waters but the SPSR can only be used in relatively clear waters and limited to shallow waters. The mean and maximum values of TSM concentrations of the ASD stations are 445 and 8341 g m − 3, while the values of the SPSR are 17 and 375 g m − 3, respectively. Turbid waters at many ASD stations result in large magnitudes of the ASD reflectance in comparison to the SPSR reflectance. Three times more measurements were obtained by the ASD (a total of 459 stations) than for the SPSR instrument.
2.3. SeaWiFS data
SeaWiFS data are generally processed using the SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System) software, but it often fails in coastal regions of the ECS confirming the need for development of a regional algorithm.
Atmospheric correction is crucial for retrieval of remote sensing reflectances at the sea surface. The main objective of the atmospheric correction procedure is to retrieve the water-leaving radiance from the total radiance received by the remote sensor. The standard procedure to derive aerosol parameters for estimation of the aerosol scattering radiance depends on the assumption of zero water-leaving radiance at the two NIR bands. Table 3 shows that the mean values of the water-leaving reflectance measured by the ASD at SeaWiFS bands 7 and 8 are 0.0075 and 0.0055 sr − 1, respectively, much higher than zero. The maxima at the two bands are 0.0671 and 0.0651 sr − 1, even much higher than those at visible wavelengths. As a result, the large values of the reflectance at NIR bands invalidate the assumption of the standard atmospheric correction.
A key step of the atmospheric correction is to derive the epsilon value and the aerosol optical depth from which the aerosol scattering radiance can be estimated. For clear ocean waters, both values can be derived from the two NIR bands. For turbid waters, these values can be estimated from two short wave infrared (SWIR) bands (1.24 and 1.64 μm) for MODIS data (Wang, 2007, Wang and Shi, 2005 ), or estimated from the reflectance at nearby clear waters (Hu et al., 2000, Mao et al., 2001 ), or based on the assumptions of spatial homogeneity of the two NIR band ratios (Ruddick et al., 2000 ). Here we develop a practical method to process SeaWiFS data in our operational processing system. Firstly, the SeaDAS software is used to process the SeaWiFS data to obtain the epsilon values for clear waters. The monthly mean epsilon values are computed and used for turbid waters in ECS. Secondly, the aerosol optical depths at two NIR bands are computed on the assumption of black waters. This assumption leads to an overestimate of the optical depth for turbid waters. The values are corrected using a logarithm function when the values at Band 8 are higher than 0.15. The basic equation is as follows: (3) τ ac=a ∗ log 10 τ a+0.85+0.15 where the τac is the corrected aerosol optical depth and τa is the original values. The parameter a is the coefficient obtained from a nonlinear regression analysis with in situ measurements. The epsilon and the aerosol optical depth are used to compute the aerosol scattering radiance using the look-up tables in SeaDAS. The reflectance of SeaWiFS after atmospheric correction is compared to in situ measurements in Fig. 5. The comparison to the ASD reflectance at Station N7-2 (30.45°N, 121.11°E) in Hangzhou Bay with a TSM concentration of 459 g m − 3 is shown in Fig. 5 a. The comparison to the SPSR reflectance at Station C20-7 (32.33°N, 126.33°E) is shown in Fig. 5 b, where the TSM concentration is 2.8 g m − 3.

Fig. 5. Comparison between SeaWiFS reflectance after atmospheric correction and in situ measurements. (a) The black line is the ASD reflectance from the spring 2007 cruise in turbid waters and the red asterisks are the SeaWiFS reflectance with a time difference of 0.6 h. (b) The black line is the SPSR reflectance from the spring 2007 cruise in clear waters and the red asterisks are the SeaWiFS reflectance with a time difference of 0.8 h.
Fig. 5 a shows that the spectrum of SeaWiFS after atmospheric correction is consistent with the ASD reflectance in turbid waters (relative difference of less than 5%). The comparison of the two spectra in Fig. 5 b indicates that the SeaWiFS reflectance is in general agreement with the spectra of the SPSR in clear waters. The atmospheric correction method described above can be applied to SeaWiFS data from turbid to clear waters with consistent results. The other advantage of the above method is that the reflectance at SeaWiFS bands 7 and 8 can be obtained. These two bands are particularly useful for retrieving TSM concentrations in turbid waters from satellite data.
To evaluate the accuracy of the atmospheric correction, a match-up data set was assembled using a time window of the satellite overpass of ± 2 h from in situ measurements. A total of 79 match-up stations were obtained for the ASD measurement and 20 stations for the SPSR from the four cruises. The reflectances of ASD and SPSR were processed in 8 bands using the spectral averaging method to compare with SeaWiFS results. The mean relative differences and the root mean square (RMS) between the in situ reflectance and SeaWiFS results were calculated and listed in Table 4.

Table 4 shows that the SeaWiFS normalized water-leaving reflectance is close to in situ measurements, with mean relative differences of around 10% at 8 bands. The total mean difference between the SeaWiFS results and in situ measurements is 9.46%. The RMS of the reflectance between SeaWiFS results and in situ measurements is relatively small (< 0.006 sr − 1 ), with a mean value of 0.004 sr − 1. These promising results suggest that the atmospheric correction procedure described above is a suitable method for processing SeaWiFS data in the ECS.
3. Development of the CPTSM model
Some bio-optical models can be used to study the relationship between the reflectance and IOP parameters, especially the absorption and backscattering coefficients of water constituents. TSM usually has strong absorption and backscattering properties in coastal regions, which allow one to establish a relationship between TSM and the reflectance. The semi-analytical approaches can overcome some limitations of the empirical methods (Nechad et al., 2010 ). Fettweis et al. (2007) deduced a TSM algorithm for coastal waters from a bio-optical model where TSM is computed from the reflectance using the following equation: (4) S=b+a ⋅ ρ w 0.187 − ρ w where S is the TSM concentration, a and b are the parameters to be calibrated for each band, b accounts for the TSM concentration and reflectance measurement errors, and ρw is the reflectance. Nonlinear regression analysis is applied to each band and the coefficients a and b for band 0.670 μm are 4.29 and 56.68 (Fettweis et al., 2007 ). Nechad et al. (2010) developed an algorithm with the following equation: (5) S=A ⋅ ρ w λ 1 − ρ w λ/C where A and C are the wavelength-dependent parameters related to the absorption and backscattering coefficients of particulates, and ρw(λ) is the wavelength-dependent reflectance. Their algorithms are modified in this work for use as the first of four indices, X 1, for the construction of the complex proxy as follows: (6) X 1=R r s λ/c 1 λ − R r s λ,where Rrs is the remote sensing reflectance at wavelength λ, and c 1 is the wavelength-dependent constant. The parameter c 1 can be set from the theory-derived values (Nechad et al., 2010 ). We find that the value of c 1 is closely related to the sensitivity of X 1 and correlation coefficients with TSM. The values should be adjusted according to in situ measurements. The values of c 1 are listed in Table 5 and discussed in Section 5.

The blue-green band ratio is widely used for estimation of the concentrations of chlorophyll in operational remote sensing systems owing to its ability to reduce the effects of magnitude variations of the reflectance in the algorithm. The reflectance band ratio is also highly correlated with TSM concentration with minimal influence by the sediment types. Doxaran et al. (2006) used a band ratio model to remove the effects of particle size distribution and the bi-directional variation of remote sensing reflectance. The second index (X 2) is the ratio of the reflectance in two bands: (7) X 2=R r s λ 1/R r s λ 2.
There are many candidate band selections for X 2. To determine an appropriate X 2, it is necessary to evaluate the relationship between X 2 and TSM from in situ measurements.
The combinations of visible bands and near-infrared bands will take into account the effects of different concentrations of suspended sediments on the reflectance (Tassan, 1994 ). The sum of the reflectances at different bands can therefore be used as the third index (X 3) as follows: (8) X 3=∑ R r s λ i.
Several authors have used the first and second derivatives of hyperspectral reflectance to discriminate specific bloom types (e.g. Lubac et al., 2008 ). The derivative of multi-channel data can also provide some useful information for TSM retrieval. The fourth index (X 4) is thus formulated from the combination of the slopes of the reflectance as follows: (9) X 4=∑ ∂ R r s λ ∂ W λ,where W is the spectral wavelengths of the SeaWiFS bands. The slopes are calculated from the derivative of the reflectance against the wavelengths at two neighboring bands. A complex proxy (CP) is constructed from the above four indices as follows: (10) C P=f 1 ⋅ X 1+f 2 ⋅ X 2+f 3 ⋅ X 3+f 4 ⋅ X 4/∑ i=1 4 f,where f 1, f 2, f 3, and f 4 are weights. CP is normalized by the sum of the four weights. Values of these indices can be obtained from in situ measurements according to Eqs. (6), (7), (8), (9). The derived complex proxy takes advantage of the different relationships between TSM and the four indices. The combination as given by Eq. (10) results in improved sensitivity and extends the range of TSM retrieval in coastal regions. The correlation coefficient between TSM and the proxy is 0.912, which is higher than the correlation coefficients from any individual index.
The proxy is designed to convert the non-linear relationship between the reflectance and TSM to a quasi-linear one over the entire range of TSM concentrations. It is hence a suitable choice for the TSM algorithm for the ECS. The equation for TSM concentration has two coefficients, f 5 and f 6, which can be determined from the regression analysis of in situ TSM data on CP:(11) log 10 TSM=f 5+f 6 ⋅ C P.
The correlations between the indices and TSM need to be analyzed to apply the TSM model to the ECS. The suitable band selections for four indices and parameters in the above equations are determined and discussed in Section 5. This model is developed on the basis of the complex proxy and its relation to TSM, and is hereafter referred to as the CPTSM model.
4. Evaluation of the CPTSM model
4.1. Evaluation of the CPTSM model by in situ measurements
The performance of a local TSM algorithm depends on several factors including sufficient stations representing different conditions in the study area and careful data quality control of in situ measurements. A large number of stations were occupied in the four cruises of the ECS. TSM was measured at 964 stations and turbidity was measured at 515 stations. The reflectance was measured using the above-water method at 459 stations and the in-water method at 148 stations. The stations cover most parts of the ECS, including many stations in the Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay. The stations represent different regions of the ECS, from very turbid waters in coastal regions to clear waters in the outer shelf. The range of measured TSM concentrations is from 0.2 to 8342 g m − 3. The four cruises were carried out in different seasons over the course of 2 years, to investigate the seasonal variations of TSM in the ECS.
TSM concentrations are retrieved from in situ reflectances using the CPTSM model and compared to the actual in situ TSM measurements (Fig. 6 ). There are two kinds of reflectances using the ASD and SPSR instruments and two kinds of TSM measurements (TSM concentration using the weighing method and the converted turbidity). A match-up data set was made from reflectances and TSM on the same stations. There are 205 stations measured using ASD reflectances and TSM (ASD–TSM in Fig. 6 ), and 136 stations using ASD and turbidity (ASD–STM in Fig. 6 ). A total of 67 stations were measured using SPSR and TSM (SPSR–TSM in Fig. 6 ), and 53 stations using SPSR and turbidity (SPSR–STM in Fig. 6 ).

Fig. 6. In situ measured TSM values versus retrieved TSM concentrations using the CPTSM model from in situ reflectance measurements. The in situ TSM concentrations include measurements using the weighing method and STM turbidity measurements. The reflectances include measurements using SPSR and ASD instruments. SPSR–TSM represents the results from the match-up data of SPSR reflectance and weighed TSM. SPSR–STM represents the results from SPSR and STM turbidity. ASD–TSM represents the results from ASD and weighed TSM. ASD–STM represents the results from ASD and STM turbidity.
Fig. 6 shows that most pairs scatter around the 1:1 line over the entire range of TSM concentrations. The correlation coefficients between the retrieved TSM and in situ measurements are 0.87, 0.93, 0.55 and 0.80, respectively, for ASD–TSM, ASD–STM, SPSR–TSM, and SPSR–STM match-up data sets. The mean relative errors are 22%, 18%, 29%, and 38%, respectively. The mean relative error is 23% for all match-up data and the correlation coefficient is 0.91. The retrieved TSM concentrations from the ASD reflectance range from 0.08 to 5136 g m − 3, while those from the SPSR range from 0.16 to 232 g m − 3. These results are consistent with the measurements by the two instruments. The ASD instrument was used at many stations in turbid waters, while the SPSR was used only at stations in relative clear waters.
The accuracy of the reflectance is one of the most important factors affecting the performance of the CPTSM models. The reflectance measured by the ASD and SPSR may have errors caused by instrument calibration, ocean conditions (sea surface roughness and wind speed), and data processing methods (Hooker et al., 2002 ). The in-water method is thought to be more accurate than the above-water method. However, the profiling instrument (SPSR) is more difficult to operate at sea. The data quality can be easily degraded by the presence of high turbid waters or strong currents. The accuracy of the above-water method can also be affected by factors such as reflection of sky radiance, sun glint radiance, and cloud distributions. It is important to check the data quality carefully and remove inaccurate measurements of the reflectance before the data are analyzed.
The CPTSM model can improve the sensitivity and correlation coefficients with TSM over a wide range of concentrations, but it still cannot remove the effects of other constitutes on the reflectance. The performance of the model is limited under certain extreme conditions, such as low TSM with high CDOM. Some semi-analytical models still need to be developed to improve our capability to monitor the water quality in the ECS by satellite remote sensing. It is crucial to separate contributions from different water constituents to the reflectance spectra and to improve the performance of bio-optical models in coastal regions.
4.2. Case study: comparison between one SeaWiFS image and in situ TSM
SeaWiFS data were collected over the ECS during 2006 and 2007, but unfortunately, the cloud cover was very high, with an average of 85% in 2006 and 84% in 2007. A cloud-free image from March 27, 2007 was selected to demonstrate the performance of our CPTSM model. Satellite data were processed to obtain the reflectance at the sea surface including atmospheric correction and geometric correction. The CPTSM model was then applied to the remote sensing reflectance to produce the TSM image (Fig. 7 ).

Fig. 7. TSM image derived from SeaWiFS data on March 27, 2007. The color bar represents the TSM concentrations from 0.1 to 3000 g m − 3. Line A at 32.5°N is used for Fig. 11.
As expected, the TSM values are low over the outer shelf and high in the coastal areas. TSM concentrations show a large variation in the study area ranging from 0.38 g m − 3 to 3000 g m − 3 with an average value of 114.5 g m − 3. The highest concentrations occurred in the Hangzhou Bay (area~8000 km 2) where concentrations over 1000 g m − 3 are frequently found. These high concentrations are caused primarily by re-suspension of sediment by strong tidal currents and other factors. The coastal zone (area~40,000 km 2) generally exhibits TSM concentrations in the range of 100 to 1000 g m − 3. The width of this zone decreases from north to south with a mean width of about 50 km. TSM concentrations from 10 to 100 g m − 3 are found in the northern part of the outer shelf regions (area~141,000 km 2 ), while the south part of the outer shelf (area~233,000 km 2) is characterized by low TSM concentrations (< 10 g m − 3 ).
Fig. 7 shows the complex structure of the TSM distribution with many tongue-shaped plumes. A sharp front between the coastal zone and the outer shelf area is clearly visible where TSM concentrations change from very high (> 1000 g m − 3) to medium (< 100 g m − 3) over a distance of a few kilometers. Many TSM plumes can also be found in the northern part of the shelf where TSM concentrations vary from 30 to 200 g m − 3. These plumes are possibly caused by the strong tidal effects in relatively shallow waters (the water depth is around 30 m). It is interesting to note that relatively low TSM values are found in a few pockets inside the Hangzhou Bay (the yellow areas in Fig. 7 ). Such pockets could be a result of the strong tidal currents interacting with the complicated bottom topography.
In the coastal regions, the high TSM concentrations (> 1000 g m − 3) significantly limit the light penetration, resulting in low phytoplankton productivity. Some in situ measurements indicate high temporal variability of TSM related to the tidal cycle in this region. The semi-diurnal variation of TSM is difficult to detect from satellite data because of the relatively long revisit period of SeaWiFS (1–2 days). Data from other satellites, especially geostationary satellites, could help to improve the spatial and temporal resolution. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool to investigate the light limitation in ecosystem processes in the coastal zones. The regions with TSM concentrations in the range of 5–50 g m − 3 in the central part of the ECS are known to have high productivity and are frequently associated with well-known fishery areas, most likely because the sunlight can penetrate tens of meters into the water in less turbid areas, and nutrient supply in this area is sufficient to promote the growth of phytoplankton.
To estimate the errors in the TSM image, we attempted to use in situ match-up data from the four cruises, but unfortunately no in situ measurements were conducted on March 27, 2007. For an overall comparison between in situ and satellite data, in situ TSM and satellite-derived concentrations from this image at the locations of in situ measurements are selected to establish a match-up dataset. A total of 1479 pairs are obtained from the 4 cruises. The field data include both TSM and STM turbidity. Histograms of concentrations are constructed from the two data sets and shown in Fig. 8. The black line is based on satellite TSM and the red line is from in situ measurements.

Fig. 8. Comparison of TSM concentration histograms between satellite data and in situ measurements. The red line shows the histogram of in situ TSM measurement from a total of 1479 stations during four cruises in 2006 and 2007. The black line is the histogram of satellite measured TSM at the locations of the stations.
The similarity of the magnitude and variation of the histograms from the two data sets in Fig. 8 demonstrates that the satellite-derived values are compatible with the in situ TSM. Both curves have two maxima around 10 and 1000 g m − 3. The first maximum exhibits a standard Gaussian distribution. The mean value of the satellite TSM is 10.8 g m − 3 with a standard deviation of 2.9 g m − 3 in the range of 1 to 100 g m − 3. The mean value of the in situ measurements is 10.2 g m − 3 with a standard deviation of 2.6 g m − 3 in the same range of TSM. Although, the temporal variations of TSM concentrations may be large in the coastal regions, the comparison of the spatial distributions indicates that the two measurements generally agree with each other.
4.3. Case study: comparison between two-year SeaWiFS images and in situ TSM
Validation of the CPTSM model for remote sensing satellite data is a challenge because of the difficulty in acquiring good quality data sets, especially in the ECS where the temporal variation of TSM is large. All SeaWiFS data covering this region were collected from Jan. 1, 2006 to Dec. 31, 2007 and processed using the CPTSM model. Although satellite data are available every day, the validation data are very limited. Only 15% of the satellite data in the ECS was cloud-free in 2006 and 16% in 2007. For the ship data, hundreds of in situ stations were occupied during the four cruises, but only a few stations were occupied within a time difference of plus/minus half an hour from the time of satellite overpass, and the area is frequently covered by cloud. When the time difference is set to 1 h, a total of 26 match-up points are found. When the time difference is set to 1 day, the number of match-up pairs increases to 770. Both 1-day and 1-hour data sets were used to evaluate the quality of the satellite TSM, as shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9. Comparison between in situ measurements and satellite retrieved TSM concentration using a match-up dataset. The black dots denote the match-up pairs with the criterion of the same site within a time difference of 1 day between the satellite overpass and in situ measurements. The red asterisks denote the pairs with 1-hour time difference.
Fig. 9 shows that most data points scatter along the 1:1 line over the entire range of TSM concentrations indicating that the SeaWiFS retrieved TSM is consistent with in situ measurements. A few points are located far away from the 1:1 line and treated as outliers (a total of 4 points with 1-hour time difference). The mean relative error is 25.5% for 1-hour and 24.5% for 1-day data sets. For the Hangzhou Bay, where the mean TSM concentration is higher than 1000 g m − 3, the mean relative error is 16.8%. For most of the coastal regions where TSM concentrations fall between 100 and 1000 g m − 3, the mean relative error is 18.1%.
The evaluation of the CPTSM model is affected by the quality of the match-up dataset, which is compiled according to the time difference between the satellite overpass and the in situ measurement. This time difference is the key factor affecting the construction of a satisfactory match-up dataset. The sediment dynamics in coastal waters are complex due to the great variety of processes involved: horizontal movement, re-suspension, mixing and settling under the influence of tide, current, waves and winds. In the ECS, the temporal variability of TSM is high and the range of the magnitude of TSM concentrations is extremely large. The concentration of sediment can vary by a factor of 50 within a 12-hour tidal cycle and the rate of TSM change is nonlinear during the tidal cycle. Therefore, the results of validation of satellite TSM at a particular site are strongly dependent on the time of in situ measurements. Ideally, the time difference should be as short as 5 min (Doxaran et al., 2009 ). In this respect, a dynamic TSM model may be helpful. Such a model can simulate the variations of TSM, which are primarily controlled by sinking and re-suspending of the sediment under the influence of various oceanic forcing (May et al., 2003 ). This model can be developed by merging satellite data and ocean dynamic model.
In addition, the validation of the CPTSM model is affected by the spatial resolution of satellite data. TSM in the Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay has a high spatial variability where the concentrations can change several folds within a distance of only 100 m. Such variations can be easily identified from satellite images with a high spatial resolution, such as Landsat imagery. Since the small-scale features are often much smaller than the size of a pixel (1 km 2) in SeaWiFS data, the TSM concentration from an image pixel can be considered as the average value within an area of 1-km 2. Discrepancies between satellite-derived and in situ TSM concentrations are thus expected, even under a perfect match-up condition (no time difference between the satellite overpass and in situ measurements). The validation presented in this paper can be considered as the first step toward a comprehensive effort to validate satellite TSM data.
5. Discussion of the CPTSM model
5.1. Analysis of the relationship between remote sensing reflectance and TSM
TSM can dominate the optical properties of backscattering and also contribute to the absorption coefficient in coastal waters of the ECS. Strong backscattering can increase the magnitudes of the reflectance, while the absorption coefficient can significantly reduce the reflectance. Since these IOP parameters are wavelength dependent, the relationship between TSM and the reflectance is non-linear. When the range of TSM is large, the reflectance spectra become very complex, thus it is essential to fully understand the relationship between TSM and reflectance.
Most satellite data have several spectral bands related to TSM retrieval, which can provide different band combinations for TSM models. The relationship between TSM concentration and reflectance changes with wavelengths. To obtain the optimal band combinations in the CPTSM model, it is necessary to examine the behaviors of the reflectance at different TSM concentrations in the ECS. The relationship between TSM concentrations and reflectance values at two SeaWiFS bands, 0.490 and 0.670 μm, are shown in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10. Relationship between the in situ reflectance and TSM concentrations at SeaWiFS band 3 (0.490 μm) and Band 6 (0.670 μm). The reflectance includes measurements of the ASD and SPSR instruments using the spectral averaging method for SeaWiFS bands.
It is clear that the reflectance at different bands exhibits different behaviors over the range of the TSM concentrations. The reflectance at 0.490 μm maintains a good relationship with TSM in the range from 1.0 to 60 g m − 3, but tends to saturate at concentrations higher than 60 g m − 3. On the other hand, the reflectance at 0.670 μm is close to zeros for TSM concentrations less than 10 g m − 3, but displays a stable relationship with TSM for concentrations higher than 10 g m − 3. The relationship between TSM and the reflectance at the other bands (not shown in this figure) shows that the reflectance at short wavelengths is sensitive to low TSM and is saturated at high TSM, while the reflectance at near-infrared bands is sensitive to high TSM and is close to zero at low TSM. The behavior of reflectance with changes in TSM concentrations has also been discussed in Dekker et al. (2001).
The behavior of the reflectance at different bands and at different TSM concentrations affects the performance of the TSM algorithm. The algorithm developed by Dekker et al. (2001) becomes less sensitive when TSM concentrations are higher than 40 g m − 3 due to the saturation of the reflectance. The saturation of the reflectance at the SeaWiFS band 5 (0.555 μm) causes the algorithm of Lahet et al. (2000) to be less reliable for TSM concentrations higher than 30 g m − 3. If the single band method is used, we need to select a suitable band on the basis of the in situ measured TSM range. To improve the performance of the TSM model, we take advantage of the different behaviors of the reflectance at different bands according to TSM concentrations and use combinations of the reflectance at different bands in the CPTSM model.
5.2. Analysis of correlation coefficients between the indices and TSM
To determine the bands or band combinations for the model, correlation coefficients between TSM concentrations and different indices at different bands were calculated. Table 5 lists the c 1 values in Eq. (6) and the correlation coefficients between index X 1 and TSM concentrations. B1 to B7 represent the corresponding SeaWiFS bands 1 to 7.
The values of c 1 are determined by the data distribution of X 1 calculated from in situ measurements. Small values of c 1 result in negative values of X 1, while large values reduce the sensitivity of X 1. Different sets of c 1 values can change the correlation coefficients and the sensitivity of X 1 according to the range of TSM concentrations. The c 1 values in Table 5 are determined from the relationship between X 1 and TSM calculated using in situ measurements in the ECS.
It is apparent that the correlation coefficients between X 1 and TSM become larger as the wavelengths shift from the blue to the near-infrared bands, except for Band 7. The correlation coefficient reaches the maximum at Band 6 (0.670 μm). Such variations are displayed in Fig. 10 where the reflectance at 0.670 μm has a better linear relationship with log(TSM) than the reflectance at 0.490 μm for TSM>5 g m − 3. The wavelength 0.670 μm (B6) is selected for X 1 since its correlation coefficient is the largest.
The correlation coefficient between TSM and X 2 for different band ratio combinations is given in Table 6. B2 to B7 in the first row of the table are the band for the numerator of X 2, and B1 to B6 in the first column are the band for the denominator of X 2.

According to Table 6, correlation coefficients for a two-band ratio are not larger than the corresponding values for single bands. In fact, the values decrease significantly for Bands 2 to 5 (columns 2 to 5 of Table 6 ), but the values increase significantly for Band 6 or Band 7. Band 7 is selected for X 2 because Band 6 has already been used in X 1. In the ECS, the absorption coefficients of CDOM at 0.443 μm are usually higher than 0.1 m − 1, which significantly reduces the magnitude of the reflectance at shorter wavelengths. Band 2 is used in X 2 as a denominator, reducing some effects of CDOM on the reflectance. This suggests that the ratio of Band 7 to Band 2 is the most appropriate for X 2.
Several band combinations for X 3 were selected for investigation (Table 7 ). Bi (i=1, 2 … 5) in the first column of the table represents Bands 1 to 5 in the first row. Correlation coefficients between the sum of bands and TSM are listed in columns 2–6. Comparing the single index in row 2 of Table 6 with rows 3 and 4, we find a significant increase in correlation coefficients when Band 6 or Band 7 is added. Correlation coefficients have similar values to the sum of the reflectance at Bands 6 and 7. They are also close to the values of the single reflectance at Band 6 (row 2 of Table 6) and Band 7. The sum of the reflectance at Band 4 (0.510 μm) and Band 7 (0.765 μm) is selected for X 3 because of the relatively large correlation coefficient and certain desirable features of Band 4. The reflectance at Band 4 is not sensitive to variations in chlorophyll- a concentration and a good relationship with TSM concentrations for TSM lower than 50 g m − 3, which can compensate for the limitation of the reflectance at Band 7 at low TSM concentrations.

From Table 8, it is evident that most values are positive, indicating that the magnitudes of the reflectance at longer wavelengths increase faster with increasing TSM concentrations, but the value of the single slope 6 is negative, indicating that the magnitude of the reflectance at Band 6 increases faster with TSM than those at Band 7. The sum of 6 slopes is used for X 4 because it gives the largest correlation coefficient.
We found that the ranges of these indices over the ECS were significantly different from each other. For example, the range of X 4 is about 10 times higher than that of X 3 calculated from in situ measurements in the ECS. These variations are not compatible with their actual contributions to CP. The weights (f 1 to f 4 in Eq. (10)) are adjusted in such a way that the degree of the influence of the indices is consistent with their actual importance to CP. The weights in Eq. (10) are designed to equalize the contributions of the different indices to the proxy. To achieve an equal contribution of each index, the values of the four weights are set to 0.3, 0.2, 10, and 1.0, respectively, according to the magnitude of the indices computed from in situ measurements in the ECS.
In the CPTSM model, the correlation coefficient is the major consideration in the selection of wavelengths for the four indices. The parameters in the model also depend on in situ measurements. The coefficients f 5 and f 6 of Eq. (11) are 0.947 and 0.775, respectively, which are obtained from the regression analysis of in situ measurements. It is important to note that these band selections and parameter values are regionally dependent, and should be modified if the model is applied to other areas.
5.3. Analysis of the performance of the indices
The composition and distribution of TSM in the ECS are very complex. TSM is dominated by suspended sediment in coastal waters, but by phytoplankton over the outer shelf region. Furthermore, the particle type and size of suspended sediments change from one region to the other. Are these variations related to the indices and CP? To answer this question, the values of the four indices together with CP computed from the reflectance of SeaWiFS along line A (see Fig. 7) are shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11. Comparison of the values of the four indices (X 1 to X 4) of the reflectance and the complex proxy (CP ). All values are calculated from SeaWiFS measured reflectance along line A in Fig. 7 and adjusted by the corresponding weights.
Line A in Fig. 7 is selected for analysis because it spans a region with a wide range of TSM concentrations from very turbid coastal waters to clear waters over the outer shelf. The concentrations of TSM decrease from west to east along line A. The variation of the indices exhibits a similar trend from the coast to the shelf regions. The range of X 2 is relatively small, from 0.45 to 0.19, with a standard deviation of 0.0432 and a mean slope of − 0.0265/degree. The range of X 4 is the largest, from 0.45 to − 0.2, with a standard deviation of 0.1545 and a mean slope of − 0.1113/degree. The magnitudes and slopes of X 1 are similar to those of X 3. Their standard deviations are 0.0815 and 0.0832 respectively. As CP is a linear combination of the indices, variations of all four indices are reflected in CP. Therefore, CP is expected to simulate variations of TSM in satellite imagery better than any individual index.
The composition of TSM along line A varies from predominately suspended sediment to predominately phytoplankton. The types of suspended sediment alternate between sand, silt, and mud according to the type distribution in the sea bed. The different types of particles may be reflected in the different indices. The variation of X 4 (shown in Fig. 11) suggests that it may correspond primarily to suspended sediments. X 2 may be very closely related to phytoplankton variations.
6. Conclusions
The sensitivity of the remote sensing reflectance depends on the bands chosen for the model and the range of TSM concentrations. Four indices based on different combinations of band reflectance have been shown to improve the sensitivity of the reflectance in different TSM ranges. A complex proxy, which is a combination of four indices, is proposed to convert the non-linear relationship with log 10 (TSM) to a quasi-linear one over the entire range of TSM concentrations. Using the complex proxy, a robust TSM model has been developed to process satellite data over the study area of the ECS.
Turbidity was measured using a Seapoint Turbidity Meter. The data were recalibrated for values higher than 750 FTU, which improves the linear relationship with TSM. Turbidity data in FTU are converted to TSM in g m − 3 using a linear equation with a correlation coefficient of 0.954, thus significantly increasing the number of TSM stations. Two sets of in situ reflectance measurement (above-water and in-water methods), are compared and the results indicate that they agree well with a relative difference of 4.5%. The atmospheric correction of SeaWiFS data is crucial for TSM retrieval in coastal regions and a practical method has been developed to obtain the epsilon and aerosol optical depth. The accuracy of SeaWiFS reflectance is assessed using in situ measurements, with a mean relative difference of 9.46%.
TSM models based on empirical methods have proved to be practical in processing satellite remote sensing data although models using a semi-analytical approach can map TSM distribution more efficiently. The CPTSM model incorporates the positive features of these two approaches through the complex proxy. The performance of the CPTSM model is evaluated using in situ measurements during 4 cruises in 2006 and 2007. The mean relative error is 23% and the correlation coefficient is 0.91. The model is used to process the SeaWiFS data to obtain the TSM distribution in the ECS. The accuracy of the retrieved TSM is evaluated using match-up datasets of a range of time differences between the satellite overpass and in situ measurements. The average relative error is 24.5% based on the 1-day match-up dataset. We propose to use the CPTSM model to monitor the TSM distribution in the ECS which is characterized by a wide concentration range of TSM concentrations from clear waters to highly turbid waters.
The concept of the complex proxy in the CPTSM model can be extended to other remote sensing models, such as those for determining the concentration of chlorophyll or CDOM. A crucial point is the establishment of indices that can represent a range of sensitivities of the relationship between water constituents and the reflectance. Once the indices are created, a complex proxy can then be designed to convert the non-linear relationship between the reflectance and water constituents to a quasi-linear one. Finally, a robust remote sensing model can be established from the complex proxy.

Overview of the East Sea Dispute
China’s recent aggressive acts in the East Sea has pushed escalation of tensions in the area and sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences. VietNamNet would like to give you an overview of the dispute in the East Sea to help our reader understand its nature.
The China-Philippines dispute in the East Sea
I. Overview of the East Sea
The East Sea map.
The East Sea is a semi-enclosed sea in the Pacific Ocean, covering an area of over 3.5 million sq. km. It is bordered by nine coastal countries, namely Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and Singapore.
The East Sea is abundant in natural resources, especially oil, gas and marine resources. Recently, data suggest that the sea has huge reserves of natural hydrate.
The sea is the second busiest maritime route in the world after the Mediterranean route, with 150 - 200 large-tonnage ships passing through its waters every day. Imports and exports essential for such major economies as China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Chinese Taiwan and Hong Kong, depend largely on this shipping route. Militarily, the East Sea is where naval fleets from many countries both inside and outside the region operate.
All these factors have led to an inevitable and obvious situation that in the East Sea the interests of many countries are closely intertwined at different levels. Peace and stability in the East Sea directly affect peace and stability in the region and the world.
II. Maritime zones of the countries bordering the East Sea under the international law of the sea
The third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (1967-1982) adopted the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea containing 320 articles and nine annexes.
As an outcome of prolonged negotiations among different groupings of countries, the Convention constituted a fair and culminant package deal in the process of codification and progressive development of the international law of the sea.
It has definitely established the legal regimes for different maritime zones under sovereignty and sovereign rights of coastal states, providing for the rights and obligations of the states in sea-related activities and setting up a series of important international mechanisms for the implementation of the Convention and settlement of sea disputes such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, the Conference of States Parties to the Convention, the International Seabed Authority and the Commission on the Limit of the Continental Shelf.
To date, 161 countries and international organizations are parties to the Convention, among them seven countries bordering the East Sea - Vietnam, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
By applying the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to the conditions of the East Sea, we can see several basic points below:
First, the countries bordering the East Sea have the sovereignty over their internal waters and territorial seas of 12 nautical miles which are measured from their baselines. It is notable that under the international law of the sea of the 1940s-50s, the territorial seas of the countries bordering the East Sea were just 3 nautical miles, beyond which were high seas. Thus, the Convention has enlarged the territorial seas of the countries bordering the East Sea by 9 nautical miles.
Second, each country bordering the East Sea has the sovereign rights over its exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles and continental shelf of at least 200 nautical miles. The breadths of both zones are measured from the baseline used to determine its territorial sea. When its actual continental shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles, a nation bordering the East Sea may expand its continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles provided that it strictly complies with provisions and procedures set out in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea .
Each country bordering the East Sea has full jurisdiction to explore and exploit natural resources in its maritime zones, especially the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, to serve people's livelihoods and national development. Each country bordering the East Sea has full powers to allow or disallow other countries to exploit natural resources in its maritime zones. At the same time, it is obliged to respect those sovereign rights of other neighboring countries. In pursuance to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the countries bordering the East Sea are concurrently obliged to respect other nations' rights to freedom of navigation in and flight over their exclusive economic zones and the airspaces above these exclusive economic zones and continental shelves.
Third, under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, how should China's signing of a contract with the Crestone Energy Corp. in 1992 on Vietnam's Tu Chinh bank and official submission of its "U-shaped line" claim to the United Nations in May 2009, be viewed? The Tu Chinh bank completely lies within Vietnam's 200-nautical mile continental shelf on which Vietnam has assigned oil exploration blocks. China National Offshore Oil Corp's signing of a contract in 1992 with the American Crestone Energy Corp. to explore oil and gas in the Tu Chinh bank area within Vietnam's 200-nautical mile continental shelf (which was called Wan'an Bei in Chinese) was a blatant violation of Vietnam's sovereign rights under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
With regard to the "U-shaped line" or "nine-dotted line" claim, Chinese scholars all are clearly aware that at international seminars on the East Sea held in Hanoi (in 2009) and Ho Chi Minh City (in 2010) as well as other international seminars, French, Belgian, American and other foreign scholars clearly stated that the "U-shaped line" claim was dubious and groundless and that China should clearly explain the legal nature of sea areas within that "U-shaped line." So far, both Chinese politicians and scholars have failed to provide satisfactory answers.
Proceeding from the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea to which China is also a contracting party, it is apparent that this claim is absolutely contrary to provisions of the Convention. No provision in the Convention can justify this claim. Simply because the sea areas encircled by the "U-shaped line" cannot be the territorial sea or exclusive economic zone or continental shelf of China. These sea areas belong to the exclusive economic zones and continental shelves of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. The irrational "U-shaped line" claim has seriously violated the sovereignty rights of the five ASEAN nations over their exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. Therefore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines have sent their diplomatic notes to the United Nations General Secretary to reject this claim.
The presentation of the mentioned irrational claim to the United Nations in 2009 and recent field activities to pursue this claim are further complicating the East Sea situation, causing great concerns among the world community. Countries involved in the East Sea dispute and also many other countries have expressed their displeasure with this claim.
III. Current disputes in the East Sea with respect to international law
There are two types of disputes concerning the East Sea – one over the overlapping continental shelves and economic exclusive zones and the other about sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos.
a. Due to the narrow breadth of some areas in the East Sea, such as Bac Bo (Tonkin) Gulf and the Gulf of Thailand, which is less than 400 nautical miles wide, parts of the economic exclusive zones and continental shelves of neighboring countries overlap. As a result, there exist a number of disputes over the boundaries of the economic exclusive zones and continental shelves between the countries bordering the East Sea.
Relating to Vietnam, in the North, we have an overlapping area in the continental shelf and economic exclusive zone with China in the Bac Bo (Tonkin) Gulf and a smaller area in the entrance to the Gulf. While to the South there are overlapping areas which are claimed by Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia in the Gulf of Thailand. In the South of the East Sea, there is an overlapping area which is claimed by both Vietnam and Indonesia. The same overlapping areas are reported among other countries bordering the East Sea, such as between Malaysia and Thailand, between Thailand and Cambodia and between Indonesia and Malaysia. Sovereignty over these overlapping areas has been gradually settled by Vietnam and relevant countries in an amicable way in accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
b. The Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos consist of a series of tiny coral reefs and banks in the middle of the East Sea. At present, these two archipelagos are at the centre of complicated disputes between several countries bordering the East Sea. The sovereignty dispute over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) islands is between Vietnam and China while that over the Truong Sa (Spratly) is between five countries and six parties, including Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei (Brunei claims sea areas) and Chinese Taiwan.
To settle territorial sovereignty disputes, international law has already come up with a principle to establish sovereignty - the principle of effective occupation and effective, continuous and peaceful exercise of state authority. This principle has been used by countries and international jurisdiction bodies in settling disputes over territorial sovereignty in the world. Some of the classical cases should be mentioned here are the dispute over the Palmas island between the USA and the Netherlands, the Minquiers and Ecrehous case between the UK and France, the case of the Clipperton island between Mexico and France or the case of Greenland between Norway and Denmark.
IV. The dispute between Vietnam and China
It is a dispute over territory and sovereignty over the two archipelagoes of Hoang Sa (Paracels) and Truong Sa (Spratlys).
1. China’s territorial claims and its evidence – justification
a. China’s U-shaped claims
China's U-shaped line.
China claims by far the largest portion of territory - an area defined by the so-called "nine-dash line" which stretches hundreds of miles south and east from its most southerly province of Hainan. Beijing says its right to the area comes from 2,000 years of history where the Paracel and Spratly island chains were regarded as integral parts of the Chinese nation.
In 1947 China issued a map detailing its claims. It showed the two island groups falling entirely within its territory. Those claims are mirrored by Taiwan, as the Republic of China.
In fact, China had never claimed sovereignty over the islands before the 1940s. Vietnam has actively ruled over both the Paracels and the Spratlys since the 17th Century - and has the documents to prove it.
b. China’s illegal and aggressive acts in the East Sea
China has raised the biggest claims in the East Sea. After implementing the closed door policy for a long time, this country began eyeing and encroaching into the East Sea. The process has happened as below:
In 1909 it began to occupy Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago.
In 1946 it drew the U-shaped line, which covers around 80 percent of the East Sea. However until May 2009 it made the line public. At the same time it occupied eastern islands in Hoang Sa Archipelago and Ba Binh Island in Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago.
In 1956, the People’s Republic of China occupied the eastern part of Hoang Sa while Taiwan held Ba Binh Island in Truong Sa.
In 1958, the People’s Republic of China officially raised its sovereignty claims over Hoang Sa and Truong Sa.
In 1974, this country occupied the western part of Hoang Sa. It continued to occupy some islands in Truong Sa in 1988 and Vanh Khan Island of Truong Sa in 1995.
On February 21, 1992, China stipulated that the East Sea belongs to the territorial waters of its Hainan province.
In 1999, China submitted its U-shape line map to the United Nations, in which it claims almost all the East Sea. Vietnam and related countries have strongly protested China’s groundless and illegal U-shape line.
China claims sovereignty over the whole Hoang Sa Archipelago. It considers Hoang Sa and the adjacent waters as its natural territory. It also claims sovereignty over the entire Truong Sa Archipelago and its adjacent waters, but admits to have disputes.
From the 90s, along with China’s fast economic development and the improvement of China’s position in the international arena, China began building and implementing a new marine policy. Under this policy, China has strengthened its control and exploitation of the sea to serve its goal of becoming a maritime superpower. China believes that it cannot become a real superpower if it is not a maritime superpower.
China’s policy is exploring the far waters firstly and then to the near waters, the disputed waters firstly and then its waters; diplomatic methods go firstly, followed by naval force; sowing division among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); taking advantage of and restricting the US and Japan.
In terms of cooperation mode, China focuses on bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation when China holds the key role. Its main direction in the sea is the East Sea, where natural resources are abundant, big countries do not have military bases and related small countries are weak at military ability.
In 2011 China has been taking more aggressive and provoking acts in the East Sea, including encroaching Vietnam’s territories and cut the cables of Vietnam’s sea surveillance and oil exploration ships named Viking 2 and Binh Minh 2. This country also issued ban on fishing in the East Sea, covering the traditional fishing ground of Vietnam.
In 2012-2013, this country strengthened its provoking acts in the East Sea, as follow:
- Establishing the so-called "Sansha" city
The information about China’s establishment of the so-called "Sansha" city, which includes the island district of Truong Sa (Spratly) of Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam and the Hoang Sa (Paracels) island district of Da Nang, Vietnam, was released in June 2012.
In July 2012, China formally established the so-called "Sansha" city, based on Phu Lam Island, in Vietnam's Hoang Sa archipelago, despite the objections of the international community.
China urgently strengthened the so-called government apparatus of "Sansha" city by building ports, airports, bridges, offices, etc.
China also planned to build waste treatment works, apartments, roads in Vinh Hung or Vietnam's Phu Lam Island.
China held a flag raising ceremony on October 1, 2012 to mark its National Day on Phu Lam Island in the Hoang Sa archipelago.
On October 3, 2012 the Chinese navy’s Nanhai Fleet held an exercise in the waters of the Hoang Sa archipelago and five days later, China set up a meteorological station in the so-called Sansha City.
- Invitation of international bids for 9 oil and gas lots
In June 2012, China announced the opening of international bids for 9 oil and gas lot within Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone and Vietnam’s continental shelf.
In August 2012, China again opened international bid for the oil and gas block 65/12, seriously violating Vietnam's sovereignty over the Paracel Islands.
The nine oil and gas lots that the CNOOC opened international bids for are entirely in the exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles and the continental shelf of Vietnam
- Seizing Vietnamese fishing vessels and fishermen
In 2012, China arrested 21 fishermen and two Vietnamese fishing vessels in the waters of the Paracel Islands of Vietnam.
- The 'U-shaped' passports
China began issuing electronic passports with the U-shaped line in May 2012. Shortly after it was discovered, Vietnam asked China to remove the wrong content on this passport.
- Escalating violations
On November 23, 2012 China published a map of "Sansha," which includes the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa archipelagos and the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of Vietnam.
On November 27, 2012, Hainan Province ratified the revised "Charters on coastal border management and security of Hainan Province," which put the two archipelagoes of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa of Vietnam in the scope of application.
On November 30 2012, while Vietnam's Binh Minh 02 ship was conducting normal seismic exploration in the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of Vietnam, two Chinese fishing vessels deliberately obstructed and cut the ship’s cable, regardless of the warning signal of functional forces of Vietnam.
On March 20, 2013, a fishing boat numbered QNg 96382 with fishermen from the central province of Quang Ngai, Vietnam, was chased and shot by a Chinese ship in the waters of the Hoang Sa Archipelago of Vietnam.
Most recently on May 1, 2014 it deployed the mobile HD-981 drilling rig in the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of Vietnam. The drilling rig is escorted by many ships of the coast guard, the naval and fishery surveillance forces of China. Chinese ships attacked vessels of the law enforcement forces of Vietnam in Vietnam’s waters. They also rammed fishing ships of Vietnam. These acts have been strongly objected by Vietnam and the international community.
c. Why China’s U-shaped claim and argument are wrong?
The U-shaped line
First, let’s consider whether this line can be consistent with the extent of an EEZ and continental shelf belonging to the Paracels and Spratlys.
That line lies beyond the equidistance line between the disputed islands and the territories around the East Sea. Jurisprudence by the International Court of Justice always gives such small islands EEZs or continental shelves that fall far short of the equidistance line, usually not much father than 12 nautical miles from the islands.
Pursuant to these rules, the U-shaped line is too excessive and arbitrary to be justified as the Paracels and Spratlys’ EEZ and continental shelf boundary. Consequently, the maritime zone around Reed Bank rightfully belongs to the Philippines; the area around James Shoal to Malaysia; the Natuna region to Indonesia; the maritime zones around Nam Con Son and the Vanguard Bank to Vietnam. These delimitations are incontestable regardless of the fact that the Paracels and Spratlys and Scarborough Shoals are disputed.
Furthermore, the U-shaped line covers an area in the middle of the East Sea where the international community might well have the right to exploit economically the column of water, for example, to fish.
Thus, that line encircles an excessive area, adversely affecting the rights of the nations entitled to EEZs and continental shelves in the East Sea, as well as those of the international community.
To justify such extensive claim, Beijing would have to adduce the status of historic sovereignty and rights over maritime space.
However, UNCLOS only recognizes historic sovereignty and rights over maritime space within 12 nautical miles of baselines, not over the area enclosed by the U-shaped line. As a signatory to UNCLOS, China must respect this rule and cannot allege historic sovereignty and rights over maritime space in order to justify the U-shaped line. In addition, there is no evidence that China has historical sovereignty over the maritime space enclosed by that line.
Next, let’s consider the U-shaped line in terms of what rights, under international law, China intends to claim for it.
So far, China has been opaque about this claim. This “Middle State” [Editor’s note: Another translation of the ancient name for China are “the Middle Kingdom.”] has never stated exactly what rights it is claiming inside that line, even when it included a map showing the U-shaped line with its note verbale to the United Nations in 2009 to protest against continental shelf submissions by Vietnam and Malaysia.
Whether China claims the maritime space within the U-shaped line as EEZ and continental shelf, or as a maritime zone similar to “historic waters,” such claim is a threat to the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam. In addition, it affects considerably the rights of the international community, because UNCLOS grants rights within this body of water to all nations in the world.
The U-shaped line is like a dagger pointing at the heart of the East Sea without the holder giving any explanation or saying how he intends to use it. Supported by an increasingly powerful navy, it constitutes a threat to all nations in the world.
While the international community can be neutral on the disputes over the islands, it cannot afford to be neutral on China’s U-shaped line.
Both maritime history and UNCLOS show that the East Sea is an international sea, like the Mediterranean. The international community has an interest and the right to have a say in the maritime claims there. China’s opposition to the “internationalization” of the East Sea issue is tantamount to an attempt to de-internationalize an international sea. Once the East Sea has been de-internationalized, Beijing will be able to bring its strength to bear on the East Sea nations and impose its own rules on this body of water.

China’s argument
The argument is based on the principle “historical sovereignty.” They said that China used to be here, used to discover this archipelago, used to name, map…
Many international scholars have warned that if using historical events that were noted in different historical and geographic documents to consider territorial sovereignty or to settle territorial claims, this world will see a lot of changes. If using history, Spain, Portugal or Britain will have the right to claim all islands or the waters that they used to pass or come to.
Therefore, it is unable to rely on history and the name of history to defend territorial claims over islands amid the East Sea, and it is even unable to use the name of history to raise the U-shape claims and to seek every way to regularize that claim, regardless of clear criteria of the international law and practice.
To implement its marine strategy and its ambition to totally control the East Sea, China has applied many domestic and foreign measures, on negotiation table and on the field, to confirm its sovereignty in the East Sea.
China officially raised its U-shaped line claim in May 2009, by attaching a map with this line to a diplomatic note to the United Nations in protesting Vietnam’s report and the joint report of Vietnam and Malaysia on the boundary of the continental shelf. Accordingly, China claimed sovereignty over Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelagos and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf of the two archipelagos.
China used the regulations on island nation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) to outline the baseline for Paracel Islands. It stated to draw the baseline for the Spratly Islands, to claim EEZs and continental shelves for the two archipelagoes.
However, China’s claim is contrary to the UNCLOS; so in general, other countries did not agree with the claim.
To speed up propaganda on China’s sovereignty claims over the East Sea, the Chinese media has systematically published articles to excite the public opinion and slander countries in the region, especially Vietnam--of appropriating China’s marine resources.
China has published many maps and publications, organized international contests and supplied online maps related to China’s marine sovereignty.
This country has also collected documents associated with the East Sea and built up historical evidences to prove its sovereignty in the East Sea.
China has been seeking any measure to prove and defend its legal viewpoint on its process of establishing and implementing historical sovereignty over Hoang Sa and Truong Sa.
However, China’s ambition contradicts its documents. A lot of ancient documents clearly described and outlined that Hainan Island is China’s southern-most territory.
Mr. Pham Hoang Quan, an independent researcher on China’s history and geographic history, said that from the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, all official historical books did not note a single word about Hoang Sa and Truong Sa. It is the evidence that China has never considered the two archipelagoes as its territory. All books noted that Hainan Island is China’s southern-most territory.
After researching documents showed off by China, Prof. Monique Chemillier Gendreau, from the Paris VII Denis Diderot University, former Chair of the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights, concluded: Chinese knew about islands scattered in the East Sea along time ago, but China’s evidence is not enough to defend the argument that China was the first country that discovered, explored, exploited and managed the two islands.

2. Evidence and justification for Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands
a. Name and mistake for sovereignty
China has intentionally taken unfair advantage of the name South China Sea (the way Western people call the East Sea) to make misunderstandings that nearly the entire East Sea belongs to China’s sovereignty.
According to the Vietnam Encyclopedia, Giao Chi is the name for Vietnam and Vietnamese people in the past, used by Chinese feudal dynasties. In the era of Hung Kings*, Giao Chi was one of the 15 provinces of Van Lang country. Chinese feudal dynasties still used Giao Chi or An Nam to call the people and country of Dai Viet (Vietnam). In many ancient documents inscriptions, Giao Chi was still used to denote Vietnam until the end of the 19th century.
On pages 11b and 12a in “Vo Bi Chi” (a book of maps which records the journey of a Chinese man named Cheng Ho from China through the Indian Ocean to Africa in 1405-1433), Vietnam or Giao Chi country was drawn to be adjacent to China’s Qinzhou to the north, Champa to the south, the Giao Chi Sea (the sea of Giao Chi country - East Sea) to the east.
In 1842, another Chinese author named Wei Yuan published “Hai Quoc Do Chi”, book of maps of all countries in the world with meridians and latitudes. There are two maps of Vietnam in this book.
In the first map, An Nam (Vietnam) is divided into two parts (eastern and western parts). Offshore Vietnam to the east, Wei Yuan noted as Great East Sea. In the second map, offshore An Nam is the sea named East Sea.
In almost all ancient maps of China from the 14th century or older, the sea to the east of Vietnam is always noted as the Giao Chi Sea or the Great East Sea or the East Sea, meaning the sea of Giao Chi (or Vietnam) or simply the East Sea (of Vietnam).
b. Vietnam uninterruptedly performs its sovereignty in the East Sea
At least from the early of the 17th century, Vietnam has been conducted its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelagos in the East Sea in an official, continuous way and it has not been complained for scrambled by any country.
Since occupying Vietnam, France – on behalf of Vietnam – also performed that sovereignty under international law. The French built two weather stations on the Paracel Islands and Ba Binh – an island in the Spratly Islands.
In 1947, the government of the Republic of China made claims over the sovereignty in the East Sea with the U-shape line, including 11 interrupted dots. In 1949, the government of the People’s Republic of China made similar claims but the claims were neglected by the international community.
On October 14, 1945, Tran Van Huu, Vietnamese Prime Minister of the Bao Dai government, which was sponsored by the French, stated: “We confirmed our longstanding sovereignty over the Truong Sa and Hoang Sa archipelagos”.
Applying the aforementioned principle to the cases of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos, everyone clearly sees that the Vietnamese State has effectively occupied these two archipelagos for hundreds of years. Precisely speaking, the Vietnamese State has exercised its sovereignty over these archipelagos at least since the 17th century when they were not under the sovereignty of any country. Since then Vietnam has exercised effectively, continuously and peacefully its sovereignty over the two archipelagos.
There is ample of evidence of Vietnam's sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos. The first evidence is the maps of Vietnam in the 17th century. In these maps, these two archipelagos were called Bai Cat Vang (Golden Sandbank). And they were part of Binh Son district of Quang Ngai prefecture. The second evidence is contained in many ancient books of Vietnam, including Toan Tap Thien Nam Tu Chi Lo Do Thu (Route Maps from the Capital to Four Directions) in the 17th century, Phu Bien Tap Luc (Miscellaneous Records on the Pacification of the Frontier) in 1776, Dai Nam Thuc Luc Tien Bien and Chinh Bien (the First Part of the Chronicles of Dai Nam and the Main Part of the Chronicles of Dai Nam) between 1844-1848 and others. These books wrote about Hoang Sa (Paracel) and how it was exploited by Hoang Sa brigades. In addition, many foreign ancient books and maps confirmed the two archipelagos belonged to Vietnam. The third evidence was that the Vietnamese feudal state had dispatched the Hoang Sa and Bac Hai brigades to exploit the two archipelagos in the name of the State (each brigade consisted of 70 members and their trip lasted for six months to catch tortoises, holothurians and precious snails and collect merchandises from sunken ships). There were specific rules set up by the State on selecting people to go to the archipelagos as well as awarding those who excelled in their exploitation duties. Those brigades were continuously operating during the Nguyen Lords' period (1558-1783) to the Tay Son Dynasty (1786-1802) and the Nguyen Dynasty. The Nguyen Dynasty sent generals Pham Quang Anh (1815), Truong Phuc Si, Pham Van Nguyen and Pham Huu Nhat (from 1834-1836) to the Hoang Sa to survey and measure islands to draw a map of the archipelago. During their stay, the sailors also built temples and erected sovereignty markers there. In 2009, the Dang family in Ly Son Island, Quang Ngai Province, presented the Vietnamese State with a decree of the feudal dynasty confirming that the archipelago belongs to Vietnam.
Following its domination of Indochina, France, on behalf of Vietnam, continued to govern the two archipelagos by sending battleships to patrol the area to ensure security and prevent smuggling. The French authorities gave permissions to the Japanese to exploit guano on the archipelago. It also sent the De Lanessan ship there to conduct oceanographic, geological and biological research.
From 1930-1932, the French naval ships of Inconstant, Alerte, La Malicieuse and also De Lanessan were sent to the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago on many occasions. In the early 1930s, French troops were deployed at the main islands of the Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago (Truong Sa, An Bang, Ba Binh, Song Tu, Loai Ta and Thi Tu). Such activities were made public in the Gazette of the Republic of France published on July 26, 1933. In 1933, the General Governor of Indochina issued a decree incorporating the Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago into Ba Ria Province. France then separated the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago from Nam Nghia Province and merged it into Thua Thien Province. France also dispatched a unit to a garrison in the Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago.
After returning to Indochina, France demanded that troops of the Republic of China withdraw from some islands which they illegally occupied in 1946. The French troops replaced the Chinese and rebuilt meteorological and radio stations there.
In 1951, the San Francisco Conference discussed draft a Treaty of Peace with Japan. At that Conference, a proposal to return to China the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos was put forward to add to the draft Treaty. Yet, the proposal was rejected. The rejection decision was approved with 46 votes in favor, three against and one abstention. At the Conference, the head of the Vietnamese delegation affirmed the Vietnamese State's long-standing sovereignty over the two archipelagos. This statement did not receive any objections and/or reservations from the floor.
In 1956 France transferred the Vietnamese southern territory to the Saigon administration. And from then on the Saigon administration sent troops to the two archipelagos and recognized them administratively, setting up in each archipelago a commune which was part of a mainland district. The Saigon administration built sovereignty markers and continued to manage the meteorological stations there.
Since the 1950s, the situation in the two archipelagos became more complicated. Taking advantage of the withdrawal of French troops from Indochina under the Geneva Accords in 1954, China occupied the eastern part of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago in 1956. The Saigon administration vehemently opposed the occupation. In 1959, Chinese troops disguised as fishermen landed on the western part of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago. However, they were repelled by the troops of the Saigon administration and 82 Chinese "fishermen" were arrested. As for the western part of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago, the Saigon administration continued to control them until 1974. In the same year, taking advantage of the fight between the army of the Saigon administration and the liberation forces of the South Vietnam Provisional Government, China once again used navies to occupy the western part of the Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelago. Following the incident, both the Saigon administration and the South Vietnam Provisionary Government came out strongly against the illegal Chinese occupation.
In 1975, when the Saigon administration was overthrown by the revolutionary forces, the Vietnamese State overtook control of the islands within the Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelago and established the districts of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa. The naked truth is: by 1988 China had never occupied the Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago. On March 14, 1988, China started to use force to occupy some rocks on Vietnam's Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago. In the imbalanced fight on that day, 64 Vietnamese soldiers sacrificed their lives to protect the homeland's sovereignty.
In short, under the light of the international law, Vietnam has all historical evidence and legal foundation to confirm her sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos. According to historical records, China only started to occupy the eastern part of Vietnam's Hoang Sa Archipelago in the 1950s. And in 1974, China resorted to military force to occupy the western part of the archipelago. On March 14, 1988, China again used military force to occupy some rocks of Vietnam's Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago.

3. Solutions to the East Sea dispute?
a. The nature of the East Sea disputes
If we look at the map of the East Sea, the territorial water sovereignty of each country and the international maritime order have been clearly clarified under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS).
But why China dares to put forward the U-shape line to claim up to 80 percent of the East Sea – which could only happen if the wheel of history have reversed to the time before the World War II; when Vietnam, the Philippines and the countries around the East Sea were not recognized as independent nations and when Vietnamese, Filipino and other peoples did not have independence and freedom?
Sovereignty of a country must be understood in two ways: 1) the recognition of the international community, accompanied with international conventions on sovereignty. 2) the ability of state to defend the country’s sovereignty, most importantly the ability to ensure security and defense, the rights of its people to explore natural resources and live in the areas where their ancestors lived for thousands of years, even on the mainland or islands and waters.
When this way of approach to the role of the state in defending national sovereignty is applied in ensuring international maritime order, superpowers like the US and Japan must play the role of “super-states”. They ensure the rights of freedom of navigation and security in international waters. In some special cases for example, the joint efforts against Somali pirates, the cooperation among big countries to maintain international maritime security is a solution.
If in a country, expenses for maintaining security and sovereignty in its territorial waters is funded through taxes, the role of guaranteeing security and order in the international waters of super powers is funded through the interests from the freedom of navigation and international trade as well as cooperation in exploring natural resources in the ocean (oil, fish, etc.) with the agreement of host countries.
Therefore, under international viewpoint, the sovereignty on exploring natural resources (fish, oil) in the EEZ of each country is a form of private goods, which belongs to the ownership of that country, which is recognized by international conventions and it takes effect thanks to the role of defending the inviolable sovereignty of that country.
Security and free navigation on international maritime routes, on the other side, is public goods because ships of not only the host country but of all countries can freely travel and are protected on international maritime routes. This is clearly different from the rights to net fish or explore oil on the continental shelf of an independent country, in the meaning that other countries, despite their power, have no right to violate the natural resources belonging to an independent country though this country is much smaller and weaker than them.
This is the standard recognized by the whole world, but it must be protected by the state of the country with sovereignty. On the contrary, a big country that uses power, despite soft or hard power, to infringe the sovereignty of a small country, that appropriation can never build the foundation for sovereignty for the robbery country, as the history has proven many times.
b. The East Sea disputes are not bilateral matter
The national sovereignty, thus, does not stand alone. With the inherent non-proportion of economic and military power among countries, economic, politic and military relations between small and big countries, the sharing of appropriate strategies with international conventions and law will create official or unofficial alliances. The powers of alliances make an effective determent against an invasion of any big country against another country which is weaker in both economics and military.
Once an alliance weakens, the balance of regional and international balance will change, owning to the appearance of “gaps of power”. Nevertheless, the change of world order (and the emergence of the sponsor for the newly rising order) can become a global trend or not highly depends on the justice of that process. Once the injustice infringes, extreme fascism, sooner or later, that unjust ambition will be ruined.
The period of 2008-2010 witnessed the global crisis, which started from the US and spread to Western European countries. The crisis brought about two corollaries.
Firstly, the US, under the great pressure of debts after the two anti-terrorist wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and economic crisis, has weakened in terms of using the soft power to maintain the international order in strategic waters, but it would be very costly for the US if conflicts happen there. The case in which Chinese ships provoked the US’ USNS Impeccable ship near the Hoang Sa Archipelago (Paracel Islands) is an example.
Secondly, the US’ weakening after the crisis, plus the rising of China has made changes to international commercial and investment flows towards encouraging countries in the periphery to be closer together and depend more on China’s economic and soft power. On the other words, the current alliances become weaker. Along with it, the ability to defend sovereignty of state members of alliances like APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) or ASEAN has declined.
In that context, China has two options: 1) Cooperating with other super powers in the world, led by the US, to supply goods for maintaining the international order, the stability and prosperity development based on cooperation and global trade; 2) replacing the US and the US’ strategic allies (West Europe and Japan) to set up the new world order and new military alliance headed by the US in order to force others to obey the new order.
In fact, China has chosen the second. This process began by trampling on the UNCLOS in order to turn the East Sea into its pond. It is uneasy for China to realize that ambition because: 1) it abolishes the sovereignty of countries around the East Sea and goes on the contrary with the trend of the time (the campaign to struggle for independence for nations after the fascism was defeated). 2) In the long run, it can make a bad precedent for appropriating the rights of free navigation and maritime safety on international sea routes. Other countries (except for China) will have to pay fees or be fined or banned from using international sea routes or air routes, which are controlled by China.
The key point here is the clear difference between international maritime routes and maritime routes in China’s waters. When politic or interest conflicts occur, China can use its control right to ban related countries from traveling in the East Sea, though in principle, China commits maintaining free navigation. This will not happen if China cannot impose its real control on the waters bordered by the U-shape line.
The sovereignty disputes in the East Sea are not a bilateral matter, but the issue of regional and international security. China understands it very clearly and China understands that the US, Japan, West Europe and other superpowers in the world, like Russia and India also know its plot.
This game shows adventure in the strategy that China is pursuing. Carefully analyzing that game will create international agreement to solve the East Sea disputes, which China makes up into “bilateral conflicts” on the “indisputable sovereignty” in which China is the victim.
c. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) is the legal foundation to solve disputes over territorial waters and continental shelves between coastal countries that are adjacent or opposite to each other
Article 15 of the UNCLOS says: “Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured.”
Once a country is a member of the UNCLOS, it has to obey the entire content of this convention. That is the prerequisite for related parties to be able to negotiate and solve maritime border conflicts.
If claims are raised not based on the UNCLOS like the U-shape line, it will surely to reach not any fair result.
Issues concerning the East Sea are very complicated, important and sensitive to related countries. Marine resources in the East Sea are vital to the livelihood and daily life of hundreds of millions of people in the nine countries bordering the East Sea. Natural resources here are a necessary condition for the economic construction and development of related countries. Countries bordering the East Sea are stepping up activities in exercising their sovereignty and sovereign rights over their different sea areas respectively. At the same time, there are plentiful and diverse activities related to the East Sea (freedom and safety of navigation, combating crimes at sea, etc.) which are closely associated with the interests of different countries both inside and outside the region.
As a result, it is an objective requirement that all countries having activities in the East Sea should adhere to the common rules that the international community, including the countries bordering the East Sea, had worked hard to build – the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. While applying the Convention in exercising its sovereignty and sovereign rights over its internal waters, territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf as stipulated in the Convention, each country bordering the East Sea is obliged to respect the sovereignty and sovereign rights of other countries bordering the East Sea over their territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. This is an obligation that members of the United Nations must follow. This is also an obligation congruent with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
It will be very unfair and irrational when a country bordering the East Sea arbitrarily constructed an ambiguous claim line that is contrary to the 1982 Convention, which violates the sea areas of neighboring countries, creates a "disputed area" in the waters of neighboring countries and then requested the affected countries to "put aside disputes to jointly exploit" their very own continental shelves. Similarly, an act of a country bordering the East Sea on its own discretion imposed a ban on fishing in other neighboring countries' exclusive economic zones is also a violation of the 1982 Convention. Such behaviors are clear violations of international commitments made by a member of the United Nations under the Charter of this body.
The existence of sovereignty disputes over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos as well as disputes over the overlapping continental shelves and exclusive economic zones is an objective fact. The settlement of such disputes, especially the sovereignty dispute over the two archipelagos, is difficult and complicated, but not impossible. As mentioned above, there are overlapping areas concerning the continental shelves and exclusive economic zones of Vietnam and China in the Bac Bo (Tonkin) Gulf, and Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia in the Gulf of Thailand. In the past, on the basis of the 1982 Convention and in the spirit of friendship, neighborliness and respect for each other's legitimate interests, Vietnam has settled the maritime delimitation lines with Thailand in the Gulf of Thailand, with China in the Bac Bo (Tonkin) Gulf and the boundary of the continental shelf with Indonesia in the south of the East Sea. Other countries bordering the East Sea have also settled a number of sea disputes through joint efforts and on the basis of international law. Most recently, sovereignty disputes regarding some islets between Malaysia and Singapore, and between Indonesia and Malaysia were also settled by the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
Those experiences showed that sovereignty disputes over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos and disputes over the overlapping sea areas between countries bordering the East Sea will be amicably settled once international law, including the 1982 Convention, is respected, and peaceful means for solving disputes, which are stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations, are applied. Threat of force or threat to use force has been prohibited by international law. Threat of force or threat to use force will never constitute a proper method for resolving disputes in the East Sea.
Disputes related to the East Sea are obviously complicated. The path towards a final solution to these disputes that are acceptable to all concerned parties will be a bumpy and lengthy. That reality requires the parties involved to exert greater efforts to solve these issues. While seeking a fundamental and lasting solution to these disputes, the concerned parties should abide by the commitments prescribed in the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the East Sea (DOC), which was signed by ASEAN and China in 2002, in particular the commitment to restraining from any action that can further complicate the situation in the East Sea.
ASEAN member countries and China also need to increase their efforts and work together in building a more legally binding document which is a Code of Conduct in the East Sea. The document can be made in the form of a treaty, an accord, an agreement, or a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between ASEAN and China, which is signed by authorized representatives of ASEAN and China before being approved by competent agencies of ASEAN and China.
Respecting jus cogens principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations and provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, settling disputes by peaceful means, fully executing all the commitments contained in DOC, advancing toward the building of a Code of Conduct in the East Sea, and jointly working towards making the East Sea a body of peace, friendship and cooperation, are all key to resolving complex issues related to the East Sea.
