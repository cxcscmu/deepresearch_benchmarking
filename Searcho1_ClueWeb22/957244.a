So I've been asked to explain why the climate is changing. I know that climate change is a big topic, and there are a lot of factors involved. I think the main reason is human activity, especially the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. But I'm not entirely sure about all the details, so I should probably do some research to get a better understanding.

First, I need to understand what climate change actually is. I know that climate refers to the long-term weather patterns in a particular area, and climate change refers to the alteration of these patterns over time. This can include changes in temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and other aspects of the environment.

I believe that the current climate change we're experiencing is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. When we burn these fuels, we release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.

But I'm not sure if that's the only cause. Maybe there are natural factors that contribute to climate change as well. For example, volcanic eruptions can release large amounts of dust and gases into the atmosphere, which can affect global temperatures. Also, changes in the Earth's orbit and solar activity can influence the climate.

I think it's important to consider both human and natural causes of climate change. Maybe I should look up some information to get a clearer picture.

Let me try searching for "causes of climate change" to see what comes up.

Causes of Climate Change
The causes of climate change are complex and not fully understood. However, we do know that human activity is a major contributor to the problem.
Global warming has been caused by emissions from factories and transportation vehicles, as well as residential heating and air conditioning units. We are also seeing rising sea levels due to melting glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica.
In this blog post, we will discuss some causes of climate change so you can understand what you need to do to help prevent it!.
Climate Change Caused By Fossil Fuels
Climate change, one of the most debated issues in today’s world is causing a new ice age. Fossil fuels are releasing carbon dioxide into our atmosphere and trapping heat just like greenhouse gases do to earth.
This creates an insulating blanket that leads to more snowfall or rain during winter months which will ultimately lead us to another glacial period where temperatures would be as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit) worldwide!.
Fossil fuels have been destroying our planet for decades. They emit toxic gases that change the climate, which would be a problem if not enough people cared about this issue or were willing to do something about it.
We need to take action now and stop fossil fuel use so we can save our world from being destroyed by these pollutants.
Climate Change Caused By Deforestation
The destruction of our natural habitats has had a terrible effect on the climate and is worsening with each passing day.
Climate change may be one of the most pressing issues facing us today, but it’s also an issue that we can’t afford to ignore any longer. The effects are becoming clear as more forests disappear every year – in just 20 years from now there will be no trees left at all!
Deforestation has been scientifically proven to contribute significantly not only to the loss of habitat but also climate change. Deforestation is a major issue in Madagascar and Brazil, with deforestation rates over 300%.
The effects of human encroachment on forests are seen around the world today as people clear out trees for agricultural purposes or urbanization projects.
It’s important that we start taking care of our natural resources before it all disappears because without these ecosystems there will be no more animals, plants or clean air left either!
We all need to work hard to control the causes of climate change.
Climate Change Caused By Pollution
Pollution is the leading cause of climate change. It’s damaging our air, soil and water systems on a global scale.
The climate is changing at an alarming rate due to the accumulation of pollution.
The steady change in weather patterns has been happening for decades, but it’s only now that we’re starting to see a major shift as our planet continues to heat up from manmade factors such as greenhouse gases and aerosol particles dispersed into the atmosphere by jet planes.
Pollution not only changes the world’s climate but also pollutes our air with toxic gases like carbon dioxide that have been linked to asthma attacks, respiratory problems in children and adults alike as well as greenhouse emissions that contribute to global warming.
Climate Change Caused By Transportation
According to statistics, the transportation industry is responsible for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions in North America. This means that if we want a chance at combating climate change it’s vital that we take steps towards reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and embracing renewable energy sources like wind power or solar panels.
Climate change is an unfortunate consequence of the number of cars on the road. The carbon emissions from these vehicles contributes to global warming, which in turn affects our planet’s ecosystem and weather patterns.
As more people drive their own car for transportation purposes instead of taking public transit or biking around town, there are a lot more exhaust fumes being emitted into the atmosphere than before.
These chemicals have been identified as contributors to climate change because they trap heat within earth’s atmosphere and cause it to warm up faster than usual–leading us down a dangerous path toward destruction if we don’t reverse this trend soon!.
Climate Change Caused By Industrialization
The climate of Earth is changing because of the carbon dioxide emissions that are produced by human industrialization.
Imagine our future. Our society is booming with technologized wonders, and we’re all aboard the bandwagon of progress!.
But has this unstoppable force led to an irreversible cost? Like any technological innovation that man creates, industrialization too comes at a price.
In fact it’s such a big one that climate change may be inevitable as long as industry continues its exponential growth-rate expansion into other pristine parts of the world like Africa or even space–not just on Earth but also in orbit around it since satellites are now being designed to last for decades instead of years.
What will happen when these satellites eventually fall out from their orbits after more than two centuries due to natural decay? They’ll crash back down onto earth where they came from.
Climate Change Caused By Global Warming
Global warming has caused a drastic change in climate, leading to huge shifts from one extreme weather event to the next.
Climate changes have led us into an era of rapid and unpredictable weather events that seem more severe than before due to their frequency as well as increased intensity.
Climate Change Caused By Overpopulation
Overpopulation has caused significant changes in the climate!
A growing population means more resources are being consumed, which is causing a dramatic increase in global temperatures. It’s not just bad for humans and animals–the hundreds of thousands of species on Earth will only continue to decline if we don’t take action soon!.
Climate change is just one more side effect that will snowball as population sizes continue to increase and resource amount of people currently on Earth, we are quickly approaching our planet’s carrying capacity. es dwindle further.
If we don’t do something about overpopulation soon, then the Earth’s climate will change drastically. Scientists say that this could happen by 2030.
Climate Change Caused By Human Activities
The earth’s climate is changing at an alarming pace.
The root cause of this change is human activity, so people need to take a more active role in making sure the planet does not suffer irreparable damage like it did from events such as the ozone hole and acid rain due to pollution by factories that are no longer around anymore.
Climate change is causing havoc on the environment and affecting all of us. Humans are releasing a number of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere which cause global warming, but it’s not just humans that have to worry.
Climate change has an impact on wildlife populations too: some species can adapt by moving with changing weather conditions while others face extinction if they’re unable to find suitable habitat farther north or south in their new range as temperatures rise across the globe.
Climate Change Caused By Urbanization
Urbanization affects the environment in many ways. One of these is climate change, which occurs due to humans adding carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels for energy production or other human activities like farming livestock.
Increased emissions from cities have led some scientists to say that urban areas are “hotspots” when it comes to global warming because they produce more than 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions on Earth–more so even than industrialized nations such as China and India do!.
The effects can be seen around us every day with rising sea levels inundating coastal communities worldwide (not just low lying ones), an increase in both droughts and floods across our country’s agricultural regions, increased heat waves making life uncomfortable.
Climate Change Caused By Natural Causes
The causes of climate change are not yet fully understood, but there is some evidence that it may be caused by natural forces.
Scientists suspect the cause might lie in changes to land use like deforestation or irrigation schemes, solar radiation and volcanic eruptions which could have a warming effect on our atmosphere.
When examining the history of climate, it may seem like there are many sources and contributors to this global issue.
For example, volcanic eruptions cause a release into the atmosphere which cools down temperatures while deforestation can be linked with an increase in CO2 levels in our air due to releasing trees that absorb carbon dioxide from the ground (although not all forests act as one giant sponge).

usually, the main cause of climate change is the " greenhouse effect" which warm the earth's surface as a result of atmospheric pollution by gases, the particular greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone , and chlorofluorocarbon that heat from earth's surface is absorbed by  atmospheric greenhouse gases that produces this difference between the definite surface temperature and the effective temperature is due to the atmosphere. the increased amount of gasses that absorbed heat is advance to had more heat being retained in the atmosphere and can increase the global average surface temperature,not only greenhouse effect that cause climate change the human aspects can also change earth's climate, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and it can be one causing global warming.

Climate change (global warming) is a problematic issue, and this problem is growing. To make matters worse, this problem is a manifestation of human activities. People’s actions are resulting in devastating impacts to the environment. Unfortunately, not everyone concurs to this reasoning. Even with empirical data presented, there are skeptics who attribute climate change to natural causes rather than man-made causes. In order to prevent global warming from exacerbating, it is crucial for people to understand that climate change is happening; it is changing “even more radically,” (Emanuel 6) than ever, and humanity is the cause.  As of recent years, global warming has made a significant impact on Earth (Weeks, “Climate Change” 523). “Certain …show more content…
Climate change caused by people is known as anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change (Reuss 35). Due to increased human activity, carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas which traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, concentrations in the atmosphere have reached to its highest in three million years (Weeks “Climate Change” 521), and the concentrations are proliferating. With an abundance of carbon dioxide already emitted, Kevin Trenberth, a scientist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, asserted that, “Even if we all decided to stop emitting CO2 immediately, it would take at least 20 years to start putting new [low-carbon or carbon-free] systems in place, and another 50 years for the climate to adjust (qtd. in Weeks, “Climate Change” …show more content…
According to the International Agency, “More than 40 percent of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2010 came from electricity and heat generation” (qtd. in Weeks, “Climate Change” 528). Meanwhile, natural events, such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions, account for less than 10% of carbon dioxide emission (528). Furthermore, there are cases where human emissions of greenhouse gases cause other factors to amplify the progress of climate change (Reuss 35). When humans emit greenhouse gases and cause the global temperature to rise, ice melts (35). As a result of the ice melting, the earth has less ice to reflect light back into outer space (35). Consequently, the earth absorbs more sunlight and increases the global temperature. Even indirect actions, such as deforestation, contribute to climate change (35). When deforestation occurs, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (35). This is because there are less trees to undergo a process call carbon sequestration—the act of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and converting it to oxygen (35).  Additionally, the technology used to cut down trees operates on fossil fuels, and this contributes to the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere

fCLIMATE CHANGE
The most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties (principally its
mean and spread) of the climate system when considered over long periods of time, regardless of cause.

It is important to note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC],
uses “Climate change” for human induced change, with the term “Variability” for changes due to natural
phenomenon [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC]



CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change is caused both by natural occurrences, and mainly by human actions on the
environment. The natural causes of climate change is, as a result of variations in earth’s orbit, variation
in ocean circulation, variation in albedo of the continents, as well as variation in solar radiation. The
human causes are, however, results of deforestation, air pollution, and poor agricultural practices such
as bush burning, excess and wrong application of inorganic fertilizer, burning of fossil fuels, urbanization,

industralisation, inefficient transport system, among others.

Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of
the "greenhouse effect" — warming that result when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth
toward space.

Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-
permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature
are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or
chemically to changes in temperature, are seen as "feedbacks."

Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:

       Water vapor. The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the
        climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of
        clouds and precipitation, making these some of the most important feedback mechanisms to
        the greenhouse effect.

       Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon
        dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and
        through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels.
        Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by more than a third since the Industrial
        Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate change.

       Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities,
        including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as


                                                                                                           1
f        well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a
        molecule-for-molecule basis, methane is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide,
        but also one which is much less abundant in the atmosphere.

       Nitrous oxide. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the
        use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and
        biomass burning.

       Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number
        of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by
        international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They
        are also greenhouse gases.

On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of
fossil fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This
happens because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To
a lesser extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases.



EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

The consequences of changing the natural atmospheric greenhouse are difficult to predict, but certain
effects seem likely:

       On average, Earth will become warmer. Some regions may welcome warmer temperatures, but
        others may not.

       Warmer conditions will probably lead to more evaporation and precipitation overall, but
        individual regions will vary, some becoming wetter and others dryer.

       A stronger greenhouse effect will warm the oceans and partially melt glaciers and other ice,
        increasing sea level. Ocean water also will expand if it warms, contributing further to sea level
        rise.

       Meanwhile, some crops and other plants may respond favorably to increased atmospheric CO2,
        growing more vigorously and using water more efficiently. At the same time, higher
        temperatures and shifting climate patterns may change the areas where crops grow best and
        affect the makeup of natural plant communities.

Specifically in Nigeria, the year 2017 witnessed series of climate-related disasters in Nigeria, ranging
from the increased health risk, declining agricultural productivity, biodiversity loss, drying lakes, famine,
conflicts or social unrest, poverty, worsening food insecurity situation, heat stress, declining soil capacity
for agricultural production, increased natural disaster, extreme weather events, among others.


                                                                                                            2
f   One of the major country-specific effects of climate change in Nigeria is declining agricultural
    productivity, which is due to the irregular and unpredictable farming calendar. The usual April-
    October rainy season and the October-March dry season is no longer a constant as it has been
    for some decades now. Farmers now plant in the midst of great uncertainties, thus resulting in
    untold losses, for their investment waste away from lack of rainfall at the right time.
    Consequently, this result in decline in productivity, and the income of Nigerian farmers, as well
    as a likely fall in the agriculture share of GDP, which stands at 29.15% of Q3-2017 GDP figure
    [NBS] and employment.

   Another [indirect] effect of climate change is the issue of clashes between herdsmen and
    farmers, which is a serious and prevailing social problem in Nigeria. Due to the problem of
    rainfall variability, caused by climate change, herdsmen in the core North, now push down South
    more frequently, in order to feed their cattle on farmers’ cultivation. This has mutated over time
    in the destruction of investments and efforts, while also attacking outspoken farmers, a
    situation for which hundreds of lives have been brutally lost in Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa, Ogun
    and several other states, a stat corroborated by the National Emergency Management Agency
    (NEMA).

    Decades ago, pastures were arguably available at reasonable level in both the North and South
    of Nigeria, and these clashes were almost non-existent. Evidence is seen from the changing
    nature of the nation’s ecological zones. Hence, we see serious clashes result, because these
    nomadic herdsmen want to satisfactorily feed their cattle, often at the expense of farmers’
    cultivation. This issue needs urgent unbiased action in Nigeria now. The support of the
    international community at this point will be valued, as the Nigerian government has not been
    able to give satisfactory, non-ethnical and proactive solutions, while lives are wasting away.

   There is also an increasing rate of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Northern
    Nigeria is becoming more of a drought-prone area, with an advancing desert, already
    encroaching southward, thus making the few cultivable lands of the north, almost uncultivable.
    Flooding is no small issue in Nigeria, with hundreds of thousands of people, agribusiness and
    property lost in 2017, in Benue State, Kano, Lagos and other states [according to NEMA]. It is
    now a robust mechanism for numerous diseases to breed, especially vector-borne diseases like
    Malaria [WHO puts Nigeria as the nation with the highest Malaria casualties worldwide]. And
    because of drought, children, especially in the North, now stand at risk of malnutrition.

    According to United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Nigeria currently has the highest number
    of malnourished children, who are under the age of five. The erosion of low-lying coastal and
    non-coastal regions of Nigeria is also disaster, which is also causing buildings to collapse, with
    attendant loss of lives, while also raising construction cost as its implication.

   Of important concern also are the drying lakes in Nigeria, with the drying Lake Chad, which is at
    the junction of Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger as a valid reference point. Andrew Bamford,
    a British investigative journalist, on 14th April, 2006, reported that the lake is now less than 500

                                                                                                      3
f       square miles of water due to global warming. The consequences of the drying of these lakes
       include loss of means of livelihood of citizens that borders these lakes, who depend on it for
       farming, fishing, drinking and animal husbandry, as well as unrest and forced migration which
       places burden on the new location they are relocating to.

      Another very important effect of climate change in Nigeria is the declining soil carrying capacity
       and heat related problems on humans, crops and livestock. Due to deforestation, trees which
       should serve as cover for soil against the harsh sunshine, are felled indiscriminately, thereby,
       exposing soils and reducing soils productive capacity, and thus, creating problems for agriculture
       in Nigeria. Heat-related incidents are on the rise, as well as heat stress (hyperthermia) on both
       crops and livestock, because of increasing greenhouse gas emissions, leading to high losses in
       crop and livestock production.

      According to a report compiled in 2010, investigations revealed that over 200 people were killed
       by meningitis in Nigeria and Niger Republic in one week. There were outbreaks in 76 areas.
       There were 25,000 suspected cases and 1, 500 deaths in the first quarter of 2009. Although
       meningitis is a disease caused by an infection of the meanings, which is the thin lining that
       surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, experts have found a correlation between the weather
       and this disease. It is generally known that the disease attacks more people during the dry
       season because of dust, wind and cold nights. There were indications in the past one month that
       many people were treated for acute pneumonia in some hospitals as a result of the erratic and
       unpredictable weather.

      Finally, climate change has cost Nigeria an increasing loss of biodiversity, from which several
       problems have emerged, such as the destruction of marine ecosystem, loss of nature’s balance,
       as well as destruction of freshwater resources. This situation currently poses problems for man,
       as he cannot live in isolation, but in interdependence with his environment. Failure to protect
       the environment is like a death penalty, hence, we must, as a center of focus, ensure that the
       protection of the Nigerian ecosystem is not undermined



PROTOCOLS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today. It involves many dimensions –
science, economics, society, politics and moral and ethical questions – and is a global problem, felt on
local scales, that will be around for decades and centuries to come. Carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping
greenhouse gas that has driven recent global warming, lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years,
and the planet (especially the oceans) takes a while to respond to warming. So even if we stopped
emitting all greenhouse gases today, global warming and climate change will continue to affect future
generations. In this way, humanity is “committed” to some level of climate change.



                                                                                                       4
fHow much climate change? That will be determined by how our emissions continue and also exactly
how our climate system responds to those emissions. Despite increasing awareness of climate change,
our emissions of greenhouse gases continue on a relentless rise. In 2013, the daily level of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time in human history. The last
time levels were that high was about three to five million years ago, during the Pliocene era.

Because we are already committed to some level of climate change, responding to climate change
involves a two-pronged approach:

    1. Reducing emissions of and stabilizing the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the
       atmosphere (“mitigation”);

    2. Adapting to the climate change already in the pipeline (“adaptation”).

Mitigation and adaptation

Mitigation – reducing climate change – involves reducing the flow of heat-trapping greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere, either by reducing sources of these gases (for example, the burning of fossil fuels
for electricity, heat or transport) or enhancing the “sinks” that accumulate and store these gases (such
as the oceans, forests and soil). The goal of mitigation is to avoid significant human interference with the
climate system, and “stabilize greenhouse gas levels in a timeframe sufficient to allow ecosystems to
adapt naturally to climate change, ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable
economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner” (from the 2014 report on Mitigation of
Climate Change from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, page 4).

Adaptation – adapting to life in a changing climate – involves adjusting to actual or expected future
climate. The goal is to reduce our vulnerability to the harmful effects of climate change (like sea-level
encroachment, more intense extreme weather events or food insecurity). It also encompasses making
the most of any potential beneficial opportunities associated with climate change (for example, longer
growing seasons or increased yields in some regions).

Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped with changes in climate and
extremes with varying degrees of success. Climate change (drought in particular) has been at least partly
responsible for the rise and fall of civilizations. Earth’s climate has been relatively stable for the past
12,000 years and this stability has been crucial for the development of our modern civilization and life as
we know it. Modern life is tailored to the stable climate we have become accustomed to. As our climate
changes, we will have to learn to adapt. The faster the climate changes, the harder it could be.

While climate change is a global issue, it is felt on a local scale. Cities and municipalities are therefore at
the frontline of adaptation. In the absence of national or international climate policy direction, cities and
local communities around the world have been focusing on solving their own climate problems. They
are working to build flood defenses, plan for heat waves and higher temperatures, install water-
permeable pavements to better deal with floods and storm water and improve water storage and use.



                                                                                                             5
fAccording to the 2014 report on Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability (page 8) from
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, governments at various levels are also
getting better at adaptation. Climate change is starting to be factored into a variety of development
plans: how to manage the increasingly extreme disasters we are seeing and their associated risks, how
to protect coastlines and deal with sea-level encroachment, how to best manage land and forests, how
to deal with and plan for reduced water availability, how to develop resilient crop varieties and how to
protect energy and public infrastructure.

People been asking, what can we do to fix the climate? We need to start taking care of the Earth. We need to start worrying about the environment and take action. We need to help the environment and keep a safe environment. The problem is carbon dioxide is increasing it is causing the climate to change. It is making people feel worried. I think we should use electric cars or bikes when we don’t go on long trips for less carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide traps heat into earth.
I think we are causing climate change in our local community by driving cars, burning fossil fuels. Our climate change has changed over time. It has changed by getting worst. It changes when we burn more fossil fuels which get the Earth warmer. Carbon dioxide traps the heat to the Earth. Human activity is causing the Earth to get hotter, with a bigger population of clear cutting trees and forests, known as deforestation. Some people do not agree with me that this is a big deal because they don’t know what happens when you cut down trees and release carbon dioxide and burn fossil fuels, they don’t even know where it goes. It’s important to agree with me because we need to have a better and safer environment.
I think our local climate is not that good right now. If we don’t do anything about it is going to get worst. We need to start taking action. We could fix the problem by instead of taking the bus or a car, take your bike or go walking. You can help when you think about cutting trees, don’t cut the whole tree. Just cut down some of the branches to make it smaller. You can by also recycling. You can also help by using less heat and air conditioning, change a light bulb, drive less and drive smart, use less hot water, and plant a tree.
The biggest problem is that carbon dioxide is increasing. That is the main problem, which is causing heat trap in the Earth. The problem is we are burning a lot of fossil fuel. We can burn less by driving less and drive smart. If you want a nice life and future I suggest you help the environment which will make you feel better about yourself. Climate change deals weather, which will change the weather if we don’t take care of it.
Human activity is causing global warming
Humans are burning fossil fuels with a smaller contribution of     deforestation.
When we extract and burn fossil fuels such as coal or petroleum, we cause the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping "greenhouse gases" into the atmosphere
The Green house affect
is one of the main causes of GLOBAL WARMING!!!
1. What does this information tell us? what do most people think?
Most people think its because of the season and natural causes. The information tell us that climate change because season.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said?Why or Why not?
Nope I don't agree, because it' s because of the pollution that cause climate change.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said? Why or Why not??
The average is 3. I don't agree with it because pollution change climate.
4. What information would you tell people that took this survey that might change their answer?
The information I would tell them is to do their research before they answer the question.
But we can do something to STOP CLIMATE CHANGE
You can start using your bike instead of a car.
Recycle as much as you can.
Human activity has caused at least half of climate change in the last half-century, hundreds of scientists say. They are 95% certain of this, the surest they've ever been
1. What does this information tell us? What do most people think?
This information tell us that most people choose A. Most people think that climates are different in different places because of the Physical Features of the Earth.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said? Why or Why not?
Yes I agree, because it depends were the sun hits the most and where it hits the less on the Earth.
3. What was the average selection from our data? Do you agree with it? Why or Why not?
The average is A. Yes Agree, because it deals with the physical of the Earth.
4. What information would you tell people that took this survey that might change their answer?
I wouldn't tell them nothing because it does have to deal with physical features of the earth.
And just help us to live in a better and greener world.
We are seeing the consequences already in extreme weather patterns, particularly drought and flood, and they will probably get worse this century, the report said.
1. What does this information tell us? what do most people think?
The information tell us that people think that the climate of the Tri-Cities is we have seasons.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said? Why or Why not?
I agree with some. Only the people that chosed A. The is not wet.
3. What was the average selection from our data? Do you agree with it? Why or Why not?
The average was C from our data. I don't agree, because it is dry it isn't wet.
4. What information would you tell people that took this survey that might change their answer?
The information I would give them is tha if they notice the weather it is mostly dry. It's not wet that much.
1. What does this information tell us? what do most people think?
This information tell us that the effects of climate change is because of the food amount.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said? Why or Why not?
Not really, because climate change doesn't really deal with food amount. It deals with the tilt of the Earth because were the sun is pointing at.
3. What was the average selection from our data? Do you agree with it? Why or Why not?
Average is A. I don't agree, because it doesn't really do with climate.
4. What information would you tell people that took this survey that might change their answer?
The information I would tell him is that the tilt of the earth is what causes climate change because were the sun points at and were it doesn't.
1. What does this information tell us? what do most people think?
This information tell us that people think climate affcts weather.
2. Do you agree with the majority of what people said? Why or Why not?
I agree with all, because if the climate changes it cahnges weather. Climate is weather of a long period of time.
3. What was the average selection from our data? Do you agree with it? Why or Why not?
The avarage of this data is A. I agree with all, because climate affects weather. Climate is weather of a long period of time.
4. What information would you tell people that took this survey that might change their answer?
I wouldn't tell them nothing because they are all correct.

Alright, so I've got some search results here on the causes of climate change. Let me see what I can gather from these documents.

First up, Doc 1 from "Soul and Land" lists 10 main causes of climate change. They include fossil fuels, deforestation, pollution, transportation, industrialization, global warming, overpopulation, human activities, urbanization, and natural causes. That's a pretty comprehensive list, but I need to understand which of these are primarily responsible for the current climate change we're experiencing.

Doc 2 is from Brainly.ph, and it mentions that the main cause of climate change is the greenhouse effect due to atmospheric pollution by gases like carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons. It also notes that human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation contribute to global warming. This aligns with what I initially thought.

Doc 3 is from 123HelpMe and provides a more detailed explanation. It emphasizes that climate change is happening and that humanity is the primary cause. It discusses how increased human activities have led to higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is at its highest in three million years. The document also mentions that natural events like wildfires and volcanic eruptions account for less than 10% of carbon dioxide emissions, while human emissions are significantly higher.

Doc 4 is an Academia.edu article titled "Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions." It starts by defining climate change and distinguishes between natural and human-induced causes. The human causes include deforestation, air pollution, poor agricultural practices, burning of fossil fuels, urbanization, industrialization, and inefficient transport systems. The document also highlights specific effects of climate change in Nigeria, such as declining agricultural productivity, increased frequency of natural disasters, health risks, and social unrest.

Finally, Doc 5 is a Prezi presentation on the causes of climate change. It's a bit more informal and seems to be created by students. They discuss the impact of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and deforestation, and they propose solutions like using bicycles instead of cars and recycling.

From these sources, it's clear that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the main drivers of current climate change. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, which trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming.

I should also note that natural causes do play a role in climate change, but their impact is significantly smaller compared to human activities. For example, volcanic eruptions can release substantial amounts of gases and particles into the atmosphere, but these effects are usually short-term compared to the long-term trends caused by human emissions.

It's interesting to see that even in Nigeria, where some of these documents are based, the impacts of climate change are being felt acutely, from agricultural challenges to social conflicts. This underscores the global nature of the problem and the need for international cooperation to address it.

In summary, while both human and natural factors contribute to climate change, human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary causes of the current climate crisis.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary causes of current climate change.}} \]
