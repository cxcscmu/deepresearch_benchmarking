I need to figure out how slavery ended. Slavery has been a part of human history for thousands of years, existing in many different cultures and societies. So, when we talk about "slavery ending," it probably refers to the abolition of slavery in specific regions or globally. I should probably look into the historical events and movements that led to the end of slavery, especially focusing on the transatlantic slave trade since that's what most people might be thinking of.

First, I should understand what slavery is. Slavery is a system where people are owned by others, forced to work without pay, and have little to no personal freedoms. It's a really dark part of history, but it's important to learn about it to understand how societies have progressed.

I think the abolition movement played a big role in ending slavery. The abolitionists were people who fought against slavery and worked to have it outlawed. They were active in many countries, especially in Europe and the Americas.

Let me think about the timeline. Slavery was widespread, but the movement to end it started gaining momentum in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. One of the earliest victories was in Britain, where slavery was abolished in the British Empire through the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833. But even before that, in 1807, the British Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act, which abolished the slave trade in the British Empire.

Similarly, in the United States, slavery was abolished with the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, following the end of the Civil War. Before that, many states had already abolished slavery, and there were gradual emancipation laws in some places.

But slavery didn't end everywhere at the same time. In some countries, it took longer. For example, slavery wasn't abolished in Brazil until 1888, which was one of the last countries in the Americas to do so.

I should also consider that even after legal abolition, remnants of slavery persisted in various forms, such as sharecropping in the U.S. South, which trapped many former slaves in a cycle of debt and poverty.

Moreover, there were international efforts to combat slavery. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, declares that no one shall be held in slavery or involuntary servitude, and this has been reinforced by other international treaties and conventions.

But I need to be careful because slavery still exists today in different forms, like human trafficking and forced labor. So, while legal slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world, the practice continues illegally, and there are ongoing efforts to eradicate it completely.

Maybe I should look into the causes behind the abolition of slavery. There were moral and ethical arguments made by philosophers and activists, highlighting the inhumanity of slavery. Economic factors also played a role; industrialization changed the nature of labor needs, and slavery became less economically viable in some sectors.

Religion also had an impact. Some religious groups argued that slavery was immoral, while others used religion to justify it. The abolition movement was supported by many religious organizations.

Political movements and revolutions also contributed to the end of slavery. For example, the Haitian Revolution, where enslaved people revolted and established an independent republic, sent shockwaves through the slave-holding world and challenged the institution of slavery.

So, it seems that the end of slavery was brought about by a combination of moral, economic, political, and social forces.

But perhaps I should focus on a specific aspect. Maybe the legal abolishment of slavery in key countries would be a good place to start.

Let me think about the British Empire first. As I mentioned, the Slave Trade Act of 1807 abolished the slave trade in the British Empire, and then the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 abolished slavery itself, except in colonies where slavery was deemed too integral to the economy, but even there, slavery was abolished shortly thereafter.

In the United States, the story is different. Slavery was a deeply entrenched institution, especially in the South, where the economy was based on agriculture and relied heavily on slave labor. The abolitionist movement gained strength in the North, leading to political tensions that eventually resulted in the American Civil War. The Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln in 1863 declared slaves in Confederate-held areas to be free, and the 13th Amendment, ratified in 1865, officially abolished slavery throughout the United States.

In other countries, like France, slavery was abolished in 1794, then reinstated by Napoleon in 1802, but finally abolished again in 1848.

So, it's clear that the end of slavery was a gradual process that happened over several decades, with different countries abolishing it at different times and under different circumstances.

I should also consider the role of enslaved people themselves in bringing about the end of slavery. Many slaves resisted their enslavement through revolts, escapes, and other forms of resistance, which put pressure on the systems that enforced slavery.

For instance, the Underground Railroad in the United States helped thousands of slaves escape to freedom in the North and Canada. Harriet Tubman was a prominent figure in this movement.

Similarly, in the Caribbean, maroon communities were formed by escaped slaves who established their own settlements and sometimes engaged in warfare against slaveholders.

These acts of resistance demonstrated that slavery was not sustainable in the long run and added momentum to the abolitionist cause.

Furthermore, there were influential figures who played crucial roles in the abolition movement. People like William Wilberforce in Britain, Frederick Douglass in the United States, and Toussaint Louverture in Haiti are just a few examples.

Wilberforce was a key figure in the campaign to abolish the slave trade in Britain, giving many speeches and introducing bills in Parliament. Douglass was an escaped slave who became a prominent speaker and writer, advocating for the abolition of slavery and equal rights for African Americans. Louverture was a leader in the Haitian Revolution, which led to the establishment of Haiti as the first black republic.

Their efforts, along with those of many others, helped to change public opinion and influence policymakers to take action against slavery.

It's also important to note that abolition wasn't just about freeing slaves; it was also about addressing the social and economic structures that supported slavery. This included providing compensation to slave owners in some cases, although this is a controversial topic because it essentially rewarded slave owners for giving up their "property."

In Britain, for example, when slavery was abolished in 1833, the British government paid Â£20 million in compensation to slave owners, which was a huge sum at the time. The freed slaves received no compensation and had to adjust to life without the support system they were accustomed to, which was often fraught with challenges.

This highlights some of the complexities surrounding the abolition of slavery and its aftermath.

Moreover, the legacy of slavery continues to affect societies today, particularly in terms of racial inequalities and social justice issues. The fight against slavery has evolved into broader movements for civil rights and equality.

Given all this, I think the answer to "how did slavery end" is multifaceted. It involved a combination of legal changes, social movements, political actions, economic shifts, and acts of resistance by enslaved people themselves.

To summarize:

1. **Legal Abolition:** Through legislation and constitutional amendments in various countries, slavery was outlawed.

2. **Abolitionist Movements:** Activists and organizations worked to change public opinion and pressurize governments to end slavery.

3. **Economic Changes:** Industrialization and changes in economic structures made slavery less economically viable in some areas.

4. **Slave Resistance:** Revolts, escapes, and other forms of resistance weakened the institution of slavery.

5. **International Pressure:** As more countries abolished slavery, there was increased pressure on remaining slave-holding nations to follow suit.

6. **Ethical and Moral Arguments:** Philosophical and religious arguments against slavery gained traction, influencing public opinion and policy.

Therefore, the end of slavery was the result of a complex interplay of these factors, occurring over an extended period and varying by region.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Slavery ended through a combination of legal abolition, abolitionist movements, economic changes, slave resistance, international pressure, and ethical/moral arguments.}} \]
