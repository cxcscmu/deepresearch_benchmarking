So I've been thinking about what makes a good political leader. It's a pretty broad topic, and I know that different people have different opinions on this. Some might say that a good leader is one who can win elections, while others might focus on moral character or policy achievements. I need to think carefully about this and maybe do some research to get a more comprehensive understanding.

First off, I think a good political leader should be someone who can inspire and motivate people. They should have strong communication skills to articulate their vision and goals clearly. Being able to connect with constituents and understand their needs is crucial. Maybe I should look up some famous leaders and see what qualities they possess.

Let me try searching for some characteristics of effective political leaders.

Standard 4.7: Leadership and the Qualities of Political Leaders
Apply the knowledge of the meaning of leadership and the qualities of good leaders to evaluate political leaders in the community, state, and national levels. (Massachusetts Curriculum Framework for History and Social Studies) [8.T4.7]
FOCUS QUESTION: What is Effective Political Leadership?

Standard 4.7 addresses political leadership and the qualities that people seek in those they choose for leadership roles in democratic systems of government.
Leadership involves multiple skills and talents. It has been said that an effective leader is someone who knows "when to lead, when to follow, and when to get out of the way" (the phrase is attributed to the American revolutionary Thomas Paine). In this view, effective leaders do much more than give orders. They create a shared vision for the future and viable strategic plans for the present. They negotiate ways to achieve what is needed while also listening to what is wanted. They incorporate individuals and groups into processes of making decisions and enacting policies by developing support for their plans.
Different organizations need different types of leaders. A commercial profit-making firm needs a leader who can grow the business while balancing the interests of consumers, workers, and shareholders. An athletic team needs a leader who can call the plays and manage the personalities of the players to achieve success on the field and off it. A school classroom needs a teacher-leader who knows the curriculum and pursues the goal of ensuring that all students can excel academically, socially, and emotionally. Governments—local, state, and national—need political leaders who can fashion competing ideas and multiple interests into policies and practices that will promote equity and opportunity for all.
The Massachusetts learning standard on which the following modules are based refers to the "qualities of good leaders," but what does a value-laden word like "good" mean in political and historical contexts? "Effective leadership" is a more nuanced term. What is an effective political leader? In the view of former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, “A leader takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don’t necessarily want to go, but ought to be.”
Examples of effective leaders include:
Esther de Berdt is not a well-known name, but during the Revolutionary War, she formed the Ladies Association of Philadelphia to provide aid (including raising more than $300,000 dollars and making thousands of shirts) for George Washington's Continental Army.
Mary Ellen Pleasant was an indentured servant on Nantucket Island, an abolitionist leader before the Civil War and a real estate and food establishment entrepreneur in San Francisco during the Gold Rush, amassing a fortune of $30 million dollars which she used to defend Black people accused of crimes. Although she lost all her money in legal battles and died in poverty, she is recognized today as the "Mother of Civil Rights in California ."
Ida B. Wells, born a slave in Mississippi in 1862, began her career as a teacher and spent her life fighting for Black civil rights as a journalist, anti-lynching crusader and political activist. She was 22 years-old in 1884 when she refused to give up her seat to a White man on a railroad train and move to a Jim Crow car, for which she was thrown off the train. She won her court case, but that judgement was later reversed by a higher court. She was a founder of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Women.
Sylvia Mendez, the young girl at the center of the 1946 Mendez v. Westminster landmark desegregation case; Chief John Ross, the Cherokee leader who opposed the relocation of native peoples known as the Trail of Tears; and Fred Korematsu who challenged the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II are discussed elsewhere in this book.
The INVESTIGATE and UNCOVER modules for this topic explore five more women and men, straight and gay, Black and White, who demonstrated political leadership throughout their lives. ENGAGE asks who would you consider are the most famous Americans in United States history?
Modules for this Standard Include:

MEDIA LITERACY CONNECTIONS: Celebrities' Influence on Politics
1. INVESTIGATE: Frances Perkins, Margaret Sanger, and Harvey Milk - Three Examples of Political Leadership
Three individuals offer ways to explore the multiple dimensions of political leadership and social change in the United States: one who was appointed to a government position, one who assumed a political role as public citizen, and one who was elected to political office.
Appointed: An economist and social worker, Frances Perkins was appointed as Secretary of Labor in 1933, the first woman to serve in a President Cabinet.
Assumed: Margaret Sanger was a nurse and political activist who became a champion of reproductive rights for women. She opened the first birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916.
Elected: Harvey Milk was the first openly gay elected official in California in 1977. He was assassinated in 1978. By 2020, a LGBTQ politician has been elected to a political office in every state.
Frances Perkins and the Social Security Act of 1935
An economist and social worker, Frances Perkins was Secretary of Labor during the New Deal—the first woman member of a President’s Cabinet. Learn more: Frances Perkins, 'The Woman Behind the New Deal.'
Portrait of Frances Perkins
"Frances Perkins" by Jean MacLane | Public Domain
Francis Perkins was a leader in the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935 that created a national old-age insurance program while also giving support to children, the blind, the unemployed, those needing vocational training, and family health programs. By the end of 2018, the Social Security trust funds totaled nearly $2.9 trillion. There is more information at a resourcesforhistoryteachers wiki page, Frances Perkins and the Social Security Act.
Margaret Sanger and the Struggle for Reproductive Rights
Margaret Sanger was a women's reproductive rights and birth control advocate, who throughout a long career as a political activist, achieved many legal and medical victories in the struggle to provide women with safe and effective methods of contraception. She opened the nation's first birth control clinic in Brooklyn, New York in 1916.
Margaret Sanger (1921)
by Underwood & Underwood | Public Domain
Margaret Sanger's collaboration with Gregory Pincus led to the development and approval of the birth control pill in 1960. Four years later, in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), the Supreme Court affirmed women’s constitutional right to use contraceptives. There is more information at a resourcesforhistoryteachers wiki page, Margaret Sanger and Reproductive Rights for Women.
However, Margaret Sanger's political and public health views include disturbing facts. In summer 2020, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York said it would remove her name from a Manhattan clinic because of her connections to eugenics, a movement for selective breeding of human beings that targeted the poor, people with disabilities, immigrants and people of color.
Harvey Milk, Gay Civil Rights Leader
In 1977, Harvey Milk became the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California by winning a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the city’s legislative body.

To win that election, Harvey Milk successfully built a coalition of immigrant, elderly, minority, union, gay, and straight voters focused on a message of social justice and political change. He was assassinated after just 11 months in office, becoming a martyr for the gay rights movement. There is more information at a resourcesforhistoryteachers wiki page, Harvey Milk, Gay Civil Rights Leader.

2. UNCOVER: Benjamin Banneker, George Washington Carver and Black Inventors' Contributions to Math, Science, and Politics
Benjamin Banneker
Benjamin Banneker was a free Black astronomer, mathematician, surveyor, author, and farmer who was part of the commission which made the original survey of Washington, D.C. in 1791.
Benjamin Banneker Poster - with Biographical Paragraphs
"BENJAMIN BANNEKER - ASTRONOMER-CITY PLANNER" by Charles Henry Alston | Public Domain
Benjamin Banneker was "a man of many firsts" (Washington Interdependence Council, 2017, para. 1 ). In the decades before and after the American Revolution, he made the first striking clock made of indigenous American parts, he was the first to track the 17-year locust cycle, and he was among the first farmers to employ crop rotation to improve yield.
Between 1792 and 1797, Banneker published a series of annual almanacs of astronomical and tidal information with weather predictions, doing all the mathematical and scientific calculations himself (Benjamin Banneker's Almanac ). He has been called the first Black Civil Rights leader because of his opposition to slavery and his willingness to speak out against the mistreatment of Native Americans.
George Washington Carver
Born into slavery in Diamond, Missouri around 1864, George Washington Carver became a world-famous chemist and agricultural researcher. It is said that he single-handedly revolutionized southern agriculture in the United States, including researching more than 300 uses of peanuts, introducing methods of prevent soil depletion, and developing crop rotation methods.

A monument in Diamond Missouri of Carver as a young boy was the first ever national memorial to honor an African American (George Washington Carver National Monument ).
Benjamin Banneker and George Washington Carver are just two examples from the long history of Black Inventors in the United States. Many of the names and achievements are not known today - Elijah McCoy, Granville Woods, Madame C J Walker, Thomas L. Jennings, Henry Blair, Norbert Rillieux , Garrett Morgan, Jan Matzeliger - but with 50,000 total patents, Black people accounted for more inventions during the period 1870 to 1940 than immigrants from every country except England and Germany (The Black Inventors Who Elevated the United States: Reassessing the Golden Age of Invention, Brookings (November 23, 2020).

3. ENGAGE: Who Do You Think Are the Most Famous Americans?
In 2007 and 2008, Sam Wineburg and a group of Stanford University researchers asked 11th and 12th grade students to write names of the most famous Americans in history from Columbus to the present day (Wineburg & Monte-Sano, 2008 ). The students could not include any Presidents on the list. The students were then asked to write the names of the five most famous women in American history. They could not list First Ladies.
To the surprise of the researchers, girls and boys from across the country, in urban and rural schools, had mostly similar lists: Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, and Benjamin Franklin were the top five selections. Even more surprising, surveys of adults from an entirely different generation produced remarkably similar lists.
The researchers concluded a broad “cultural curriculum” conveyed through media images, corporate advertising, and shared information has a far greater effect on what is learned about people in history than do textbooks and classes in schools.
Suggested Learning Activities
Compare and Contrast
As a class or with a group of friends, write individual lists of the 10 most famous or influential Americans in United States history?
Explore similarities and differences across the lists.
How many women or people of color were on the lists
Investigate the reasons for the similarities and differences.
State Your View
Returning to the Sam Wineburg study, "Why were Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and LGBTQ individuals left of the lists?" (see the full study here: “Famous Americans”: The Changing Pantheon of American Heroes)
Learning Plan
Research an individual’s work and contributions, and in 200-250 words describe who they are, why you selected them, and what aspect of their work is important to the field. Within your description, include at least 2 links relevant to this individual (Plan from Royal Roads University ).
Media Literacy Connections: Celebrities' Influence on Politics
During elections, celebrities might endorse a political candidate or issue in hopes that their fans will follow in their footsteps. Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama for President in 2008 has been cited as the most impactful celebrity endorsement in history (U.S. Election: What Impact Do Celebrity Endorsements Really Have? The Conversation, October 4, 2016).
Do celebrity endorsements make a real difference for voters? Researchers are undecided. In 2018, 65,000 people registered to vote in Tennessee after Taylor Swift (who had 180 million followers on Instagram) endorsed two Democratic Congressional candidates - one candidate won and the other lost. Swift's endorsement was followed by more than 212,000 new voter registrations across the country, mostly among those in the 18 to 24 age group. Perhaps what celebrities say has more impact on younger voters?
Can you think of some examples of celebrities who have shared their political views or endorsements on social media? Who are these celebrities? In what ways did they influence politics?
In these activities, you will analyze media endorsements by celebrities, and then develop a request (or pitch) to convince a celebrity to endorse your candidate for President in the next election.

Standard 4.7 Conclusion
Effective political leadership is an essential ingredient of a vibrant democracy. Unlike dictators or despots, effective leaders offer plans for change and invite people to join in and help to achieve those goals. Effective leaders work collaboratively and cooperatively, not autocratically. INVESTIGATE looked at three democratic leaders who entered political life in different ways: Frances Perkins who was appointed to a Presidential Cabinet; Margaret Sanger who assumed a public role as an advocate and activist; and Harvey Milk who was elected to political office. UNCOVER reviewed the life and accomplishments of Benjamin Banneker and George Washington Carver. ENGAGE asked who people think are the most famous Americans in United States history.

Traits of Political Leaders |
Traits of Political Leaders
By Douglas R. Satterfield|October 11, 2015
0 Comment
[October 11, 2015]  It’s the right time to be discussing traits of political leaders in America because of publicity given to the campaigners in the upcoming presidential election next year.  Examination of those traits is a legitimate topic and a thorough discussion is worthwhile for those who plan to vote and for the future of the country.  Our question here is whether those traits make for good leadership?
What I would like to do is provide a list of the more common traits of our political leaders in America.  Yet, I don’t think that the list would be so different from politicians in most democratic countries and the link of this issue to leadership is fundamental to the successful running of the country.  Senior political leaders make a difference; whether they are good or bad leaders will be decided quickly.
Listed in no particular order – because of the subjectivity of the issue – are 5 outstanding traits of political leaders.  There is a bias as the list is more appropriate for senior political leaders.  The traits are not what they should be for a political leader, but what they are:
Ability to relate to constituents. No surprise here since being a senior politician means having been elected many times. The most outstanding social skill is being able to “connect” to the voters; sometimes called charisma. Thus, it follows, they are a successful campaigner.
Risk-Adverse. When a leader takes risks there’s a good chance of alienating voters. A middle-of-the-road approach therefore frequently crafted to reduce exposure to bad ideas, people, and events.
Deficient in important historical knowledge. Whether through intellectual laziness or purposeful manipulation, using past history – a distortion of the past – to justify future actions is common among shrewd politicians.
Ambitious and emotionally stable. Motivation is another name that describes political leaders. They must have the emotional fortitude and resilience to lead people with many needs and wants.
Good analytical skills. Found in most politicians, especially those who have been reelected, is the mental ability to juggle many ideas simultaneously and to solve problems quickly and equitably.
What makes a successful political leader? 1 The most critical issue of all is whether those traits are useful in a political leadership role and the list here is useful. But getting elected requires skills that differ from actually leading.

An effective leader contains two components - the traits of a leader and the skills of efficiency.  This is to say that there is a notable difference between a leader and an effective leader.  To be a leader requires a strong personality and the ability to read people.  An effective leader, however, combines these qualities along with smart business practices as well as intelligent crafting of infrastructure.  These descriptions of leaders have been formed by my years at Penn State and my time in the PLA.  Of course, I have not actually spent three years at 
Penn State or two in the PLA, but rather two and one years respectively.  I would therefore add that my understanding of the requisite traits of a leader is also due to my time traveling abroad and more importantly the process of growing older.
In addressing the first portion of this question, what traits constitute a leader, I think it is appropriate to refer back to the orientation activities from just a few weeks back in which we were asked to decide on one characteristic that is most important in a leader.  My team settled upon conviction.  I stand behind this still for the reason that all people face nay-sayers in their lives and general resistance.  People choose to follow leaders because they see a spirit of conviction in them that ensures they will be able to withstand resistance without faltering, and in a way lead them threw the storm.  In addition to a spirit of conviction, I would add that a knack for understanding people is also important.  This is the trait behinds charisma that people often associate with leadership.  People who can understand the motives and reasons behind the actions of other, both big and small, are more apt at crafting their own words and actions to further draw the support of others.  To be a leader, a strong support base is necessary; for this no leader without a following.
Again, a leader and an effective leader can look very different.  An example of a leader who embodies the characteristics listed above is Jim Jones.  Jim Jones is known for leading a cult known as the Peoples Temple which eventually ended in mass suicide by cyanide poisoning, killing 909 Temple members and 5 non-members in the ensuing violence.  Jones was a charismatic leader with a great ability to read others and embody their grievances and had unsurpassed conviction for his political and social campaign.  He was not, however, an efficient leader.  The ability to lead efficiently is based on similar predicates as living organisms - to grow and prosper.  If a leader cannot establish an entity that will one day be able to continue on without him than he has failed in effective leadership and accomplished only leadership.
Effective leadership, therefore, requires the establishment by the leader of a smartly organized and in itself efficient infrastructure to which he can delegate and at times even defer to.  Political Organizations, most notably, the Democratic and Republican parties, are established this way to ensure that their goals are continuously pushed forward no matter who is at the helm.  In this manner, the leader has ensured the longevity of his aims and can thereby be classified as an effective leader.  Another important characteristic is, broadly speaking, smart business practices.  To be effective, a leader must continuously be concerned with the future and not just the immediate nature of whatever concerns they are facing.  This means looking towards the future to read the direction of peoples' attitudes and the general movement of politics worldwide that may impact their own agenda.  It also means being responsible for the financial viability of the group, as smart business practices most clearly implies.  A person who demonstrates the characteristics of a leader as well as those of an effective leader who may act as a clear example is Martin Luther King Jr.  He had the charisma and conviction to draw people into his movement as well as smart business practices and a smartly organized infrastructure.  This is what ensured that the civil rights movement continued full steam ahead after his untimely death.  He was the leader of the movement but he was not its heart and soul.  In the most basic of terms, the difference between leadership and effective leadership is a difference in intentions.  A leader works for themselves, entangling their aims with their own advancement; an effective leader works purely for the aims they wish to promulgate.
To define a leader, especially, an effective leader is no easy task at a young age, really any age, because it is a rather abstract concept that is informed by one's experiences.  Therefore, my understanding of a leader upon entering Penn State or the PLA is not the same as it is now that I approach my graduation from college.  For me, the greatest evolution of understanding as it regards a leader is the realization that a leader is not a position of aggrandizement.  Since the college applications process the question of how many positions of leadership do you hold has been presented to me more times than I care to recall.  This has an effect of intonating that to be a leader is really to make one look more impressive to potential employers or school admissions boards.  The experiences I have had in my life and many from these past four years remind me, however, that almost every effective leader takes on the roll begrudgingly.  They see that they have the skills to make a difference but also realize that the price to pay is quite high.  It is only the non-effective brand of leadership that works purely in favor of the person who can call themselves the leader and that is because they design it so.  In so many words, the leaders I admire are the soft spoken leaders who express their convictions through their actions and efforts directed towards the improvement of others.  A title means nothing, a difference made means everything.

Who is a good political leader? Qualities a political leader must have.
What it takes to be a Political leader and important qualities of a Good Leader
What is leadership? Leadership is the ability of an individual to lead, inspire and guide to transform other individuals, groups, organizations or society for a good cause.
Management is doing things right; Leadership is doing the right things.
– Peter Drucker
Who is a political leader? A political leader is a public servant who works for the betterment of the society. He/she is elected by the members of the society by casting votes. A political leader requires ‘statesmanship’; as opposed to just being a ‘politician’ – this means having the integrity and willingness to stand up for what is right, even if it means resigning a position in government or losing an election.
Mark Skousen says, “We shall never change our political leaders until we change the people who elect them.” Hence its important as citizens to elect the right leader who can create transformation.
Citizens should elect leaders considering their ability and capability to make a difference and add value to the society.  It’s then his/her responsibility as a leader to make a difference that citizens are looking for.
But surprisingly today’s politicians say, “They are going to do one thing while they intend to do another. Then they do neither what they said nor what they intended.”
What it takes to be a good political leader?
A good political leader is one who is capable to take decisions, determined to work for the betterment, has the willingness to manage & rectify issues and importantly stand up for what is right. A political leader should not be worried about his/her position, power and authority. He should always work for the growth of the society and should value his citizens. Every political leader should inherit the skills and research capabilities to think and act towards future growth. A successful leader, should have five major virtues: Discipline, Trustworthiness, Courage, Humaneness, Intelligence.
Of all the leadership roles, political leaders are always on top of everyone’s mind because they are in the news always for one reason or the other. Around the world there are many aspiring political leaders but unfortunately, there are few leaders who live up to the ethics and principles.
“The future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in Government than in Politics.”
– Franklin D. Roosevelt

In India, most of the political leaders lack the basic and important leadership qualities such as accountability, transparency, availability and integrity. Some of these leaders even indulge in corruption and other illegal activities. In the present generation the word “ political leaders” has a negative opinion on the citizens, which is not a surprise. However, the present developments show us that the upcoming young leaders are following the leadership ideals. We are seeing some positive changes in Indian politics, which is welcoming.
Having responsible politicians in the governing body is important as they are the decision makers of the country, state and other public affairs. They have the power to manage, distribute the economic resources, build relationships with stakeholders and make decisions that can have a great impact on the well-being of a nation. As a responsible citizens we expect our politicians to focus more on long-term plans for the wellness of the nation than the short-term plans.
Responsibility is one of the most important leadership qualities. Most political leaders point fingers at other leaders rather than taking the responsibility upon them. Leaders should acknowledge other leaders contribution towards society. They should accept their own faults/ failures /mistakes and should always work towards their betterment.
A leader who is honest, accountable and takes responsibility for his/her own decisions and actions has the quality to become a great leader.
“Not all civil servants admire strong political leadership. But if you want to change things for the better, you need strong political leadership”. – Harriet Harman
Important Qualities of a good political leader:
He/she must be capable of making tough and brave decisions for better future of public.
He/she should have the courage to stand up and say what needs to be said rather than just tell what people like.
He/she should work for people’s well-being rather than fighting for their better political positions.
He/she must listen to the people and represent them faithfully.
He/she should be loyal to the people he/she represents. And he/she should be loyal to other leaders so that they can work together and face problems together.
Regardless of political parties and opinions, one should work with a range of other peoples to achieve the greatest good for the general public.
He/she should resist themselves from various temptations of the political arena.
He/she should be humble and down to earth. He/she should consider that he is just a leader and not owner of the people he represents.
Importance of leadership in society:
Leadership is instrumental for social change. Overcoming social problems or modernizing and abolishing social norms has been impossible without the right kind of leadership.
Leaders work for goodness of society, respect their people’s voice, creates a positive and happy society, and keep these people motivated and inspired.
Leadership will emphasize the importance of education, picking the right career, working hard and focusing on performance.
Some communities and societies are often remembered by their leaders and its exceptional social phenomenon that one leader can’t shape the future of the general public. They make them feel closer to each other and strengthen their bonds.
Leader has a capable of visualize the people needs from different angles and plan things accordingly. This would enable proper distribution of development and ensure productive results.

6 Aspects of Political Skill
Political Savvy & Leadership Effectiveness
Do you think of yourself as “politically savvy” at work?
Research has found that politically savvy people have better career prospects, are seen as more promotable, and are less likely to have derailed careers. People who bumble through the political realities — or avoid or ignore them — are missing opportunities, connections, and resources.
Organizational politics is a sometimes controversial and hotly debated topic. Many managers in large organizations lament the fact that they must even acknowledge its existence, much less engage in political behavior in order to get ahead. They question the ethics of behaving in ways that may feel inauthentic, manipulative, and ultimately self-serving. Some will ultimately embrace politics as a necessary evil, while others will refuse to play the game entirely, despite the likely negative impact on their careers.
While the term political skill, or political savvy, generally elicits more negative than positive perceptions, it isn’t inherently a bad thing.
The first step in overcoming any lack of political skill is to accept office politics as a natural, neutral part of work life. Politics is neither good nor bad. In fact, political skill is a necessity, and when used appropriately, leaders can use their political savvy to create positive outcomes for themselves and others.
We define political savvy as the ability to maximize and leverage relationships in order to achieve organizational, team, and individual goals.
Leaders with political savvy can use their political skills to successfully meet their organization’s leadership challenges and to improve the performance and productivity of their teams. Possessing political skill will enhance a leader’s effectiveness at work, improve their team’s performance, and improve their own chances of career advancement.
6 Characteristics Associated With Political Skills
How can you tell if a leader has political skills? The answer: if they appear not to have any such skills at all.
Behaviors that are genuine, authentic, straightforward, and effective are associated with political savvy. Leaders who are not politically skilled can come off as manipulative or self-serving.
Politically skilled leaders are masters of 6 characteristics:
Social astuteness
Interpersonal influence
Networking ability
Thinking before speaking
Managing up
Apparent sincerity
Leaders who have the behavioral flexibility to employ all 6 political skill practices will be more adept at maximizing and leveraging their relationships with others at work. If used properly, political savvy can help you maintain a positive image in your organization and can help drive your individual, team, and organization’s performance.
How to Be More Politically Savvy
Just like needing traditional managerial skills in areas such as budgeting, planning, coordinating, and the like, leaders do best when they also have political savvy. They especially need to be adept at making good impressions and influencing using the skill of persuasion.
You can develop these behaviors and improve your political savvy by focusing on the following 6 skills:
Hone your powers of perception. Socially astute managers are good at reading people’s non-verbal behaviors and can intuitively sense the motivations of others. By being more perceptive of yourself and others in social situations, you can improve your self-awareness and better interpret others’ behaviors.
Practice influence. Those who are effective at exerting interpersonal influence on others build strong interpersonal relationships through establishing good rapport, communicating well, and getting others to like them. By becoming more comfortable with your interpersonal leadership power, you can improve your judgment and know when to assert yourself – resulting in more cooperative relationships. Skilled influencers are not always overtly political; they just play the political game fairly and effortlessly.
Learn to network effectively. Leaders who possess a strong networking ability build friendships and beneficial working relationships by garnering support, negotiating, and managing conflict. Skilled networkers know when and how to leverage others to obtain the needed resources to accomplish both personal and organizational tasks. They’re also seen as willing to reciprocate and have a network perspective.
Think before you speak. Leaders with political savvy have impulse control. They tend to choose their organizational battles wisely and size up situations before deciding how to present ideas to others. Managers who actually consider whether or not to voice a thought or a feeling, and who are thoughtful about the timing and presentation of what they have to say, are less likely to derail their careers.
Manage up – to a point. Leaders need to be able to skillfully communicate with their bosses, higher-ups, and so on. But political savvy also involves maintaining good relationships with people at all levels in the organization. Our research shows that people who are especially skilled at “managing up” tend to put so much energy into their bosses’ needs that they neglect to lead their own teams – so balance here is key.
Be sincere. Politically skilled individuals display high levels of integrity, authenticity, sincerity, and genuineness. They are – or appear to be – honest, open, and forthright, inspiring trust and confidence. So to sharpen your political savvy, be genuine with everyone in your organization. If you try too hard, your co-workers will see right through it. Be an authentic leader.
A Special Note for Women Leaders on Political Savvy
Office politics can be especially difficult for women.
Our women’s leadership development programs often contain a segment focused on organizational politics and the development of influencing skills. And through the years, we’ve heard women leaders tell us they struggle with the topic. They’re simply uncomfortable with the idea that political skill may be an important component of leadership.
Because of this perspective, they find it difficult to incorporate political behaviors into their repertoire. Office politics, some women say, feels inauthentic, much like networking does.
Researchers have documented gender-based differences in attitudes about office politics as well. Some have found that women perceive organizations as more political than men do. Others have found that women managers are more likely to report that engaging in political behavior is difficult and painful, whereas men tend to be more involved in political processes and regard them as a natural and normal part of organizational life.
We also conducted a study where we found that leaders who excelled in certain characteristics, including political savvy, received higher leader effectiveness ratings from their bosses than leaders who scored lower on these political skills.
Apparent sincerity was not found to be important for men, but women with higher levels of apparent sincerity were perceived to be more effective leaders than women with lower levels of apparent sincerity.
Put differently, as unfair as it may be, women are penalized when they exhibit low sincerity, whereas men are not.
A key reason for the varying perspectives and interpretations of behaviors may lie in the different ways women and men are socialized. Men tend to feel they are part of an “insiders club” where the rules of the game are made clear earlier (by other men). Women tend to feel more like “outsiders.” The rules women follow are more traditional and are part of a belief system that tells them if they work hard enough and have enough expertise, they will get ahead.
In her seminal 1994 study of women executives who have broken the glass ceiling, Lisa Mainiero found that many of the women she interviewed characterized themselves as “apolitical” and avoided playing politics. In reality, many of them were found to be very politically savvy, despite the fact that they did not view their behaviors as political. Mainiero goes on to say that political skill is vital for a woman’s career advancement, as they need political savvy to gain access to inside information and achieve the social capital needed to break the glass ceiling.
Despite significant progress, women today still are apt to find themselves in situations where opportunities for promotion, access to mentors and sponsors, and encouragement to take risks are absent. These unique barriers make it more critical than ever for women to embrace and develop political savvy.
Our recommendation to women leaders is to accept that organizational politics are a neutral, natural part of the workplace and that you can be politically savvy without playing games or taking advantage of other people. Instead, focus on growing your political skill in terms of the sincere use of your skills, behaviors, and qualities in order to be more effective. Intentionally work on your leadership brand and build your capacity to lead others in a sincere, authentic manner.
And that’s good advice on political skills that could apply to politics-wary men, as well.

Alright, I've got some information from these search results about what makes a good political leader. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, from Doc 1, it talks about leadership and the qualities of political leaders. It mentions that leadership involves creating a shared vision, negotiating ways to achieve goals, and incorporating individuals and groups into decision-making processes. It also highlights that different organizations need different types of leaders, and in government, political leaders need to fashion competing ideas and interests into policies that promote equity and opportunity for all.

The document then discusses the concept of "effective leadership" and provides examples of effective leaders like Esther De Berdt, Mary Ellen Pleasant, Ida B. Wells, Sylvia Mendez, Chief John Ross, and Fred Korematsu. It seems like these leaders were effective because they fought for civil rights, provided aid during wars, and challenged injustices.

Furthermore, Doc 1 explores three examples of political leadership: Frances Perkins, who was the first woman appointed to a President's Cabinet; Margaret Sanger, who was a political activist for reproductive rights; and Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California. Each of these individuals demonstrated leadership in different ways: through appointment, assumption of a political role as a public citizen, and election to political office.

The document also mentions that in a study, students and adults tended to have similar lists of the most famous Americans, including figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, and Benjamin Franklin. The study suggests that a "cultural curriculum" through media and shared information has a greater effect on what people learn about historical figures than textbooks and classes.

From Doc 2, there's a list of five outstanding traits of political leaders:

1. Ability to relate to constituents (charisma and successful campaigning).

2. Risk-averse (preferring middle-of-the-road approaches to avoid alienating voters).

3. Deficient in important historical knowledge (using distorted history to justify actions).

4. Ambitious and emotionally stable.

5. Good analytical skills.

The author questions whether these traits are useful in a political leadership role, noting that getting elected requires different skills from actual leading.

Doc 3 is a blog post from someone reflecting on what constitutes an effective leader versus just a leader. The author argues that a leader needs traits like conviction and understanding people, but an effective leader also needs to establish a sustainable infrastructure and practice smart business approaches. The author uses examples like Jim Jones, who was a charismatic leader but not an effective one, and Martin Luther King Jr., who was both charismatic and established a lasting movement.

Doc 4 is another blog post listing important qualities of a good political leader:

- Capability to make tough decisions for the future.

- Courage to speak truthfully.

- Working for public well-being over personal gain.

- Listening to and representing people faithfully.

- Loyalty to constituents and other leaders.

- Collaboration across political divides.

- Resistance to political temptations.

- Humility and down-to-earth attitude.

The author emphasizes that political leaders should focus on long-term plans for the nation's welfare rather than short-term political gains.

Lastly, Doc 5 from the Center for Creative Leadership discusses political skill in leadership, defining it as the ability to maximize and leverage relationships to achieve organizational, team, and individual goals. It presents six aspects of political skill:

1. Social astuteness.

2. Interpersonal influence.

3. Networking ability.

4. Thinking before speaking.

5. Managing up.

6. Apparent sincerity.

The article suggests that political skill is necessary and can be used ethically to improve performance and career prospects. It also notes that women leaders may have particular challenges in embracing political skill due to societal expectations but encourages them to develop these skills authentically.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that a good political leader possesses a combination of personal traits, relational skills, and strategic abilities. They need to connect with people, make difficult decisions, and build sustainable systems that benefit the public. Additionally, they should be aware of political dynamics and use their influence ethically to achieve positive outcomes.

I think the key takeaway is that political leadership is complex and multifaceted. It's not just about charisma or getting elected; it's about effectively guiding and serving the community or nation, often within a political landscape that requires navigating various interests and challenges.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{A good political leader possesses a combination of personal traits, relational skills, and strategic abilities, connecting with people, making difficult decisions, and building sustainable systems that benefit the public, while navigating political dynamics ethically to achieve positive outcomes.}} \]
