Alright, so I have this question: "How does ableism affect society?" Hmm, I'm not super familiar with the term "ableism," but I think it has something to do with discrimination against people with disabilities. So, first things first, I need to make sure I understand what ableism really is.

I guess ableism is like racism or sexism, but instead, it's about treating people differently based on their abilities, especially discriminating against those with disabilities. But I should probably look that up to get a precise definition.

Maybe I should start by searching for "definition of ableism." That sounds like a good place to begin.

Okay, so from these search results, it seems like ableism is defined as discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. It's similar to other forms of discrimination like racism or sexism, but specifically targets people based on their abilities, particularly those with disabilities.

Some sources mention that ableism can involve negative attitudes or unfair treatment towards disabled people. There's also a note about how ableism can reinforce the idea that disability is a personal tragedy, which seems to suggest that it's not just about unequal treatment but also about how society perceives and values people with disabilities.

I think to understand how ableism affects society, I need to consider both the individual level and the societal level. At the individual level, ableism can lead to discrimination in employment, education, and social interactions. For example, a person with a disability might be passed over for a job because the employer assumes they can't perform the duties, even if they could with reasonable accommodations.

At the societal level, ableism can be embedded in policies, infrastructure, and cultural norms. For instance, buildings without accessibility features like ramps or elevators exclude people with mobility impairments. Similarly, media representations that portray disabled people stereotypically or as objects of pity can reinforce negative attitudes.

Moreover, ableism can intersect with other forms of discrimination, such as racism, sexism, or classism, compounding the challenges faced by individuals who belong to multiple marginalized groups.

I should probably look for more information on how ableism manifests in different areas of society and what effects it has.

Maybe I can search for "effects of ableism in society" or "impact of ableism on society."

Disabled. I want you to take a moment and recognize what comes to your mind when you read the word. Do you think of individuals who are vulnerable, and of low competence? Do you think of disabilities you can see? Society has taught us to look at individuals with disabilities in this light. Medicine has played a role in this depiction as traditionally disabilities have been determined by a biomedicalist stance. Even providers have said that “[d]espite their intentions, personal goals, and normative expectations, even health professionals are unconscious bearers of implicit social biases that affect the quality of professional interventions. (Campbell, 2001)” So, what do we call this? It is Ableism which is defined as “a network of beliefs, processes and practices that produces a particular kind of self and body (the corporeal standard) that is projected as the perfect, species-typical and therefore essential and fully human. Disability then, is cast as a diminished state of being human. (Galli, 2015)”
Why is this dangerous?
In medicine disability is viewed as something being wrong with the individual and that it needs to be fixed. Often individuals will feel like this is commonsense, leaving individuals with disabilities in a vulnerable place as providers and others can become ‘heroic’ and unnecessary measures can be employed, leaving to individuals having a poor quality of life. These experiences can then impact the individual feeling comfortable in getting help, or their access to healthcare. When heroic measures are taken, the dignity of the human can be taken away. The removal of dignity in a medical situation will impact the individual accessing healthcare, trusting providers or being truthful with their providers. Often providers will think individuals with disabilities are not being truthful.
What does ableism look like?
There are three major ways that one could see ableism occur. Direct ableism is when it is conscious and oppressive where someone is being discriminated against because of their disability. There is indirect ableism which is unconscious behavior that is not intended to be harmful. An example would be using improper language. Systemic ableism is from centuries of discrimination against disabled individuals. Systemic ableism is the most common form of ableism due to a long societal belief that individuals with disabilities do not have capacity. A few concrete examples are places not being accessible, asking people if they are actually disabled, invalidating an individual who have invisible disabilities and feeling pity for those with a disability.
How do we combat ableism?
Now that you know what ableism looks like you might be wondering how to combat ableism. Know that each day is a chance to combat ableism and become an ally to the community. When in doubt, do research. It is not on individuals in the community to educate you on the appropriate ways to interact or advocate. The first step is becoming more aware of your actions and calling out ableism as you see it in a way that reflects your feelings of the situation. No ally is perfect and there will always be a learning opportunity and more room for growth. Below are some ways you can begin combating ableism on a personal level.
1)   Watch what you say. Try not to brush people off by saying things are no big deal, not that difficult, and it shouldn’t be too hard. These can be disrespectful and hurtful to individuals. Remember that every human has their own experience and what is easy for one might be more difficult for the other. Only bring up a disability when it is relevant to bring up.
2)   Be considerate. Don’t use the resources that are designated for individuals with disabilities if you don’t need to.
3)   Ask before assisting. Don’t assume an individual is unable to complete a task, ask them if they need assistance and respect their answer. Automatically assisting individuals can be viewed as disrespectful
4)   Don’t assume. Don’t assume someone is not disabled. Disabilities can be invisible and individuals who utilize resources they need for their disability have every right to use those resources.
5)   Change your language. Use person first language, ask individuals how they would like to be referred to, and use language like successful and productive not the word normal.

4 ways ableism still affects people with disabilities
By Nicole Ciarlone
February 21, 2020
First of all, what is ableism? Ableism is the discrimination against people with disabilities, essentially the cause of many disparities youth and people of all ages face in the disability community. There are many different examples of ableism like discrimination and “able privilege,” which refers to the way our society is structured in favor of able-people.
Here are just a few examples of able privilege:
Only ⅓ of New York City subways are accessible to wheelchair users and people who are unable to use the stairs.
Those without disabilities don’t require extensions, extra time on tests, extended absences, or any other additional accommodations in school because of a mental illness, ADHD, autism, or other disabilities.
Able people can assure themselves that their ability to perform at a job will not discourage employers from hiring them, and don’t have to worry about disclosing their disability to their employers.
Although it is not your fault, we think it’s important for everyone to recognize ableism in our everyday lives. Here are four common examples:
1. Society sets low standards and expectations for people with disabilities. Consciously and subconsciously, able people see others with disabilities as “incapable” or “inferior.”
Our National Inclusion Manager and IT Quality Administrator Piper Slowinski has witnessed this example many times as she volunteers at camps for kids with disabilities.
“I spend lots of time volunteering at camps for kids with various kinds of disabilities, and you see many well-intentioned folks reinforcing low standards on many of the kids there. It’s never coming from an intentional or bad-hearted place, but it’s things like, “We’re moving too slow, we need to help this child get dressed so we can make it to breakfast on time.” And, “I want everyone to keep up with one another, so instead of redesigning an activity to allow for different paces and styles, I’m going to hurriedly help this child along,” said Piper.
I then went on to ask Piper why this is problematic.
“It tells that child that we don’t expect much of them, and given time, they’ll start to believe the limits that others impose upon them. If we tell a child they can’t do something, even if they can do it when given the chance, they’ll start to internalize that and believe it. By our actions, we create and shape reality – and that reality can trap many people with disabilities into incorrectly internalizing.”
If we truly believe youth and people with disabilities are capable, they will be able to live a life of dignity, pride, and purpose.
2. Many people make the assumption that if someone has a disability you can see, they must have an intellectual one too, which is most definitely not the case. The two do not coincide.
Tyler, a former PYD mentee and current online mentor has experienced this exact encounter one too many times.
“The public is often extremely quick to generalize that blindness equates to me being less intelligent or less capable of leading a quality, independent life. I have been able to enjoy tremendous success in my personal and professional endeavors with accommodations in place.”
Tyler then goes on to explain how people treat him as if he is less mature or younger than he really is. He tells me about a recent encounter with a stranger as he was simply crossing the street.
The woman approached Tyler insisting she help him because he seemed “confused;” reiterating that the street was dangerous and he shouldn’t be on it alone.
This instance is merely one of many examples, but Tyler felt her actions were patronizing to assume he was incapable of independently crossing the street.
Each instance is unique, but over the years Tyler has become a strong advocate for himself and the community by using every scenario like this one to educate others on the fact that although he is blind, he is able to adapt to the world around him.
“Many improvements have been made when it comes to acceptance and understanding of disability, but we are far from a completely tolerant and accepting society,” said Tyler.
Tyler pursues his masters degree in public administration and envisions himself developing policies at local, state, and federal levels to create more opportunities for the disability community.
3. There are ableistic words embedded in our language used as disrespectful slang and insults, like “They’re so retarded,” or “She’s absolutely crazy.”
These are more commonly frowned upon, but there are many you may not know reference disability in their definitions. Here are some examples:
Dumb
Lacking the power of speech; temporarily unable to speak; refraining from any or much speech; silent.
You can view the definition here.
Lame
Crippled or physically disabled, especially in the foot or leg so as to limp or walk with difficulty; impaired or disabled through defect or injury; weak, inadequate, unsatisfactory, clumsy.
You can view the definition here.
Insane
Not sane; not of sound mind; mentally deranged; of or relating to a person who is mentally deranged; utterly senseless.
You can view the definition here.
Moron
(This term is no longer in technical use in psychology because it is now considered offensive.) A person of borderline intelligence in a former and discarded classification of mental retardation, having an intelligence quotient of 50 to 69.
You can view the definition here.
4. Inspiration porn: Able people view and use people with disabilities solely as objects of their own inspiration. The term inspiration porn was coined by Stella Young, an Australian comedian, journalist, and disability rights activist.
Throughout her life as a person with a disability, she witnesses numerous instances of inspiration porn. In the video below, she told a story of when she was nominated for a community achievement award in her hometown at 15 years old. Her parents questioned the nomination because she hadn’t actually achieved anything yet. She went on to explain that if you took disability out of the equation, she wasn’t doing anything out of the ordinary. She was just an everyday student attending high school.
Later in life, she gave a lecture to a group of high school students. During the lecture, a boy raised his hand and said “When are you going to start the motivational speech? Usually when people in wheelchairs come to school they start saying motivational stuff.”
And in that moment, she realized people only see the disability community as objects of inspiration.
“For many people we are not real people. We are there to inspire,” said Stella.
That’s not to say people with disabilities can’t inspire you. If Stella achieved something out of the ordinary at 15, then of course the excellence award would have been warranted, and you could be inspired by her!

I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much | Stella Young
Watch on
Here are some real world examples of inspiration porn from the internet and beyond:
Not only is this inspiration porn, but the quote implies that disabilities are inherently a bad thing.
Piper then went on to explain what an everyday person can do themselves to change this narrative. She suggests we all begin to be mindful of our language and stop referring to disabilities as something that makes another person weak or less than.
“And instead, we need to recognize that for many people with disabilities, they are not “disabled” by anything intrinsic to who they are, but by the environments they are in. And we all have the ability to create more inclusive environments through our actions and words that empower people with disabilities rather than disempower them.”

Ableism: Definition, Meaning, Origin and Examples of an Ableist Society
Ableism: Definition, Meaning, Origin and Examples of an Ableist Society
Disability Information / Leave a Comment
Ableism is a very wide topic with numerous implications. It affects the life of an individual, especially a disabled individual, in myriads of ways. But, before jumping on the impacts or manifestation of ableism let us start with understanding the meaning of the word – ableism.
Going by the dictionary meaning, ableism is the discrimination or prejudices against people with disabilities. Somehow, the dictionary meaning fails to provide the complete scope of the word. Therefore, it is important to understand ableism as a concept.
Our world has been built for the able-bodied individuals. It fails to be truly empathetic towards someone who lacks in their physical or mental abilities. The society formed around this lack of empathy tends to see disabled individuals as someone inferior to those without a disability. It sees disability as something that needs to be cured or eliminated. Such a society sees the disabled individuals as someone who needs to be fixed in order to be at par with other individuals in society. This is called ableism.
“Ableism sees disabled individuals as inferior to the non-disabled individuals.”
Origin of the Concept of Ableism
Do you remember Darwin’s concept of the survival of the fittest? The concept was not applicable to the evolution and survival of different species but also the survival of individuals within a species. Humans, who did not have the physical ability to hunt and gather, were not fit for survival. So, as a basic instinct person with disabilities seemed inferior to those without disabilities.
With changing time the value of physical strength and abilities for human survival reduced significantly. But, the basic instinct to see disabled individuals as inferior remained the same. When democracy became the most effective form of political system people started exerting pressure to demand their human rights. It was around the 1960s and 1970s when activists started placing disability in political context for demanding equal rights for disabled individuals.
The term ‘ableism’ was first coined by US feminists in the 1980s and gradually got accepted worldwide. The activists stressed the fact that society sees individuals without disabilities as superior beings and wants disabled individuals to qualify to their standard to be treated equally. This leads to discrimination and prejudices against persons with disabilities at every stage of their life.
Examples of Ableism in Daily Life
Ableism manifests itself in various forms in a person’s life especially if they are disabled. Most of the time we ignore or tend not to care about such instances but as a society, we need to weed out ableist action as well as thoughts from society. It is necessary to make the world a better place for everybody.
Following are some of the common examples of ableism we encounter in day-to-day life:
Suggesting people with disabilities some cure for their disability – This is one of the most common ableist attitudes faced by persons with disabilities. People see persons with disabilities as someone who needs to be fixed hence as soon as they meet someone with a disability they either want to pray for their cure, suggest them a remedy or a doctor, or asks them about the treatment they are taking for their disability. This is an ableist attitude.
Treating PwDs like kids or nobody – People tend to baby-talk with persons with disabilities or they talk to someone who is with the disabled person even when the talk is about the person with a disability. Persons with Disabilities should be treated with dignity just like you would treat a non-disabled individual.
Building inaccessible infrastructure – Inaccessible infrastructure puts unnecessary hindrances in the lives of persons with disabilities. Building inaccessible infrastructure is ignoring the human rights of persons with disabilities. This is an ableist approach.
Discriminating against persons with disabilities – Discrimination against persons with disabilities is rooted in an ableist attitude. Any kind of discrimination against PwDs like segregating them or mocking them is always wrong.
Using ableist language – complimenting someone by saying “you are so beautiful despite your disability” or “ you do not look like a disabled” is an example of ableist attitude. Words like stupid, insane, etc. are part of the ableist dictionary that sees disability as inferior.
These are just a few examples of ableism to help you understand in how many forms can ableism affect a person’s life.
Types of Ableism
Based on the manifestation, ableism can be divided into following categories –
Physical Ableism – The ableism that manifests in the form of discrimination against persons with a disability based on a person’s physical appearance.
Mental Ableism – It is the discrimination based on the mental health condition of an individual or their cognitive abilities.
Medical Ableism – The medical model of disability is based on medical ableism. It sees persons with disabilities as something that need to be fixed. It quantifies individuals against the standard ‘normal’ body and seeks to make every body at par with the normal body.
Structural Ableism – It is the ableism that creates structural hindrances by creating inaccessible infrastructure. Failing to provide accessibility to persons with disabilities in the form of ramps, special education, accessibility features in websites, etc. fall under the category of structural ableism.
Cultural Ableism – It is the social discrimination done against persons with disabilities. The examples may include exclusion of persons with disabilities from social gatherings or not treating persons with disabilities with equality in society.
Internalized Ableism – The internalized ableism is the most unique category of ableism; it is discrimination done by a disabled individuals against themselves and other disabled individuals. When a disabled individual thinks that disability is something to be ashamed of and sees herself as inferior to others then it is due to internalized ableism.
Hostile Ableism – When social or cultural ableism gets hostile towards certain disability or disabled individuals then it is called hostile ableism. An example may include disowning of a child with a disability. Eugenics is also an example of hostile ableism.
Benevolent Ableism – This is the discrimination where disabled individuals are seen as someone that needs to be taken care of like a child. In this type of ableism, the disabled individual is not seen as a participating adult.
Ambivalent Ableism – This ableism lies somewhere between hostile and benevolent ableism.
As a reader of WeCapable, you should understand that disability may make someone different but it doesn’t make someone inferior. Let us together try to make the world a better place to live by dropping ableism from our thought, action, and words. For most persons with disabilities ableism is a bigger hurdle than their disability.

Summary
Ableism refers to bias, prejudice, and discrimination against people with disabilities. It hinges on the idea that people with disabilities are less valuable than nondisabled people.
Differences in ability are a normal part of human experience. Just under 1 in 5 people in the United States lives with a disability, and worldwide, people with disabilities represent the largest marginalized group, making up 15% of the global population. Despite this, ableism is one of the most common forms of prejudice.
What is disability?
Clique Images/Getty Images
To understand ableism, a person needs to understand what disability is.
There are two models of disability: the medical model and the social model. The medical model treats disability as a health condition. The social model views disability as a concept created by humans.
However, this does not mean that impairments do not exist. The social model argues that that the definition of “disability” depends on context. For example, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be a disability in a world that values a neurotypical way of thinking, but in a world that values and understands neurodiversity, it might not be.
There is no single set of characteristics that makes someone disabled in every situation. This highlights the reality that the society a person lives in often informs what they think of as “disability.”
What is ableism?
Ableism perpetuates a negative view of disability. It frames being nondisabled as the ideal and disability as a flaw or abnormality. It is a form of systemic oppression that affects people who identify as disabled, as well as anyone who others perceive to be disabled. Ableism can also indirectly affect caregivers.
As with other forms of oppression, people do not always know they are thinking or behaving in an ableist way. This is because people learn ableism from others, consciously or unconsciously. Bias that a person is unaware they have is known as implicit bias.
Implicit bias against people with disabilities is extremely common. An older study found that 76% of respondents had an implicit bias in favor of people without disabilities. This included respondents who had disabilities themselves.
In the study, ableism was among the most common and strongest forms of implicit and explicit bias out of the ones the researchers tested for, surpassing gender, race, weight, and sexuality. It was second only to ageism.

Types of ableism
Ableism manifests in many ways. It exists on different levels of society, including the following:
Institutional level: This form of ableism affects institutions. An example is medical ableism, which is rooted in the idea that disability of any kind is a problem that needs fixing. When this is part of medical teaching and health policy, it affects the entire healthcare system and the well-being of patients.
Interpersonal level: This is ableism that takes place in social interactions and relationships. For example, a parent of a child with a disability might try to “cure” the disability rather than accept it.
Internal level: Internalized ableism is when a person consciously or unconsciously believes in the harmful messages they hear about disability and applies them to themselves. For example, a person may feel that disability accommodations are a privilege and not a right.
Ableism also takes on different forms, including:
Hostile ableism: This includes openly aggressive behaviors or policies, such as bullying, abuse, and violence.
Benevolent ableism: This form of ableism views people with disabilities as weak, vulnerable, or in need of rescuing. This is patronizing and undermines the person’s individuality and autonomy, reinforcing an unequal power dynamic.
Ambivalent ableism: This is a combination of both hostile and benevolent ableism. For example, a person might start a social interaction by treating someone in a patronizing way, and then switch to being hostile if the person objects to their behavior.
An important thing to note about ableism is that it affects people differently depending on how others perceive their disability. For example, how people discriminate against those with visible impairments is different from how they treat those with invisible impairments.
Other factors that can influence this include:
whether an impairment is physical or cognitive
whether or not a condition is well known to the general public
whether it has a history of being stigmatized, as this can lead to the development of specific myths, stereotypes, or slurs
Examples of ableism
Examples of ableism range from blatant hostility and aggression to less obvious everyday interactions. Some examples of these include:
asking someone what is “wrong” with them
saying, “You do not look disabled,” as though this is a compliment
viewing a person with a disability as inspirational for doing typical things, such as having a career
assuming a physical disability is a product of laziness or lack of exercise
using public facilities that are for people with disabilities, such as parking spaces or toilets
questioning whether a person’s disability is real
On a larger scale, some examples of ableism include:
Ableist language: There are many examples of ableism in everyday language. Terms such as “dumb” and “lame” were originally used to describe disabilities, but today, people use them as synonyms for “stupid” or “bad.” People also misuse words in a way that trivializes conditions. For example, a person may say, “I am so OCD .”
Inaccessible design: Designing buildings, public spaces, products, and technology that only caters to nondisabled people is an example of ableism. This includes websites that have no text enlargement feature, buildings that have no ramp for wheelchairs, and sidewalks with obstacles that make walking more difficult.
Education discrimination: Schools refusing to make disability accommodations, failing to understand a disability, or trying to “teach” a child not to have their impairment are all examples of ableism in education. For example, a teacher might punish a child for their dyslexia rather than adapt how they teach.
Employment discrimination: Employers may be biased against those with disabilities, believing they make less productive workers. They may also refuse disability accommodations to existing employees or allow workplace bullying to go unpunished.
Ableism and health
Here are some of the ways ableism affects health and healthcare.
Barriers to care
Some doctors assume that having a disability inevitably leads to a low quality of life. This is based on the idea that someone can only have a high quality of life if they are nondisabled. It can also tie in to a belief that being nondisabled makes someone’s life more worthwhile.
This bias has serious consequences. It can cause medical professionals to ignore the lived experiences of their patients, incorrectly blame new symptoms on a person’s disability, or withdraw medical support in the belief that nothing they do will help. It can lead to barriers to getting healthcare, as well as avoidable illness and death.
Disregard for peoples’ lives
Ableism can cause people to prioritize the health and independence of nondisabled people at the expense of those with disabilities.
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some people refused to wear masks to prevent the spread of the disease, despite knowing that older adults and people with certain long-term conditions were at a higher risk.
This shows a clear disregard for the lives of people most vulnerable to COVID-19, and for those with disabilities, as older adults and people with chronic illnesses are more likely to have one.
Failure to control the spread of COVID-19 has also led to people with disabilities spending prolonged time indoors. Some have postponed medical appointments, been unable to access caregiver services, or have been excluded from priority lists for COVID-19 vaccination.
Physical restraint
It is well known that historically, doctors used force to restrain the movements of patients with mental health conditions and developmental differences. However, physical restraint still takes place in U.S. education and healthcare settings.
The aim of restraint is often to stop people from harming themselves or others, but some institutions also use it to stop damage to property, control behavior, or as punishment for rule-breaking. Its use is disproportionately high among people with neurological or developmental conditions, particularly children.
According to a report, dozens of people in the United States died in the 1990s and 2000s due to physical restraint. Many were children with disabilities.
Eugenics
Eugenics is the practice of, or belief in, eradicating “undesirable” traits from humans via selective breeding. It was a popular concept among scientists in the early 20th century, and it was responsible for many mass sterilization programs across the United States. It also informed similar policies in Nazi Germany and, ultimately, the Holocaust.
The impact of eugenics is still present in healthcare. In some cases, programs lasted into the 21st century, and many survivors are still alive. The mental and physical impact of the programs continues to affect the survivors and their families.
There are also new technologies, such as genetic testing and engineering, that make it possible to avoid or “edit out” genetic conditions that can cause disability. Some argue this can enable a modern version of eugenics.
What is the impact of ableism?
Ableism affects everyone. It shapes how people think about physical or mental differences, which anyone can acquire during their lifetime. It also damages society as a whole by:
reducing access to transport, education, and the internet
increasing levels of unemployment
increasing poverty
fueling bullying, harassment, and violence
causing unnecessary institutionalization

What is anti-ableism?
Anti-ableism means actively working to dismantle ableism. It begins with recognizing that ableism exists, that it causes serious harm, and that nondisabled people benefit from this system. This is known as privilege.
Nondisabled people do not need to think about accessibility or worry about facing ableist discrimination. Others may be more likely to respect nondisabled people or promote them to positions of power. A person, or group of people, can use this privilege to help others.
Some ways to begin practicing anti-ableism include:
learning about disability — what it means and how it affects people
learning about ableism, ableist stereotypes, and the history of disability rights activism
listening to people with disabilities share their experiences
challenging ableism as it happens, for example, by correcting a myth or stopping bullying
giving people with disabilities a platform, or “passing the mic,” instead of speaking for them
advocating for accessibility and inclusivity
enacting policies or laws that counter ableism
Summary
Ableism is prejudice and discrimination against people with disabilities. It is based on the idea that being nondisabled is the default, and anything outside that is abnormal or undesirable. It manifests in many different ways, from subtle comments to open hostility.
In healthcare, ableism can affect interactions with doctors and other professionals, healthcare policies, and health outcomes. The idea that disabled people have less value or lower-quality lives contributes to damaging practices that persist today.
Anti-ableism is a way for anyone to work against ableism.

Introduction
The controversies over ableism are an ongoing topic that our society must continually address in order to meet the needs of all people. Ableism is defined as discrimination or acts of prejudices against specific groups or individuals with disabilities (Adams, etl. 2013, pg. 297). This encompasses any person who experiences oppression due to any physical, intellectual, mental, or emotional disorder they possess (Levy, 2015). Overtime, we have seen a dramatic shift in the way our society addresses individuals with these types of impairments. Previously, people with disabilities were viewed as being inadequate or incapable or achieving certain statuses (Adams, etl. 2013, pg. 297). They were often disregarded and slighted by other …show more content…
I have developed compassion through adversities experienced personally and knowledge gained from observing family members and struggles they have encountered. This knowledge has allowed me to have an empathetic approach when working with children and families who are targets due to their statuses. Ableism can affect individuals at any age and can especially have a significant impact on children. The environment and situation that a person is born into attributes to what becomes that person’s norm. Children are very impressionable and it has been my experience that children are typically very similar to their parents. Even though children tend to be products of their environment, it is possible to break the cycle. Being in a position of leadership, I find it imperative to embrace the potential to make a difference in the life of others. Positively influencing one person can leave a lifelong lasting impression. By focusing on one’s abilities rather than their disabilities, and with the right combination of encouragement, support, and guidance, is a motivator for growth. It is my belief that a person can become and accomplish anything he or she dreams with the proper supports and self-intrinsic qualities to be determined and resilient. Taking personal responsibility for the cards life has dealt is a big factor. Ultimately, it has to come from

Alright, so from these search results, I've gathered that ableism is discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities. It's a form of systemic oppression that affects people with disabilities in various ways, both at the individual and societal levels.

One source mentioned that ableism can be seen in everyday interactions, like assuming that a person with a disability needs help without asking them first, or using language that belittles their experiences. It can also be embedded in institutional policies and physical environments that aren't accessible to people with disabilities.

Another source talked about "inspiration porn," which is when people with disabilities are portrayed solely as inspiring because they're overcoming their disabilities, rather than being seen as full individuals with their own talents and challenges. This can be patronizing and doesn't recognize the person's agency and capabilities beyond their disability.

I also came across the term "able privilege," which refers to the advantages that non-disabled people have in a society designed for able-bodied individuals. For example, most public buildings have steps, which makes them inaccessible to people who use wheelchairs. This is a form of structural ableism.

Moreover, ableism can intersect with other forms of discrimination, such as racism, sexism, or classism, creating compounded disadvantages for individuals who belong to multiple marginalized groups.

In terms of impact, ableism can limit opportunities for education, employment, and social participation for people with disabilities. It can also lead to poorer health outcomes, as medical treatments may not be tailored to their specific needs, and they might face barriers in accessing healthcare services.

I think it's important to recognize that disability is a natural part of human diversity, and that people with disabilities have the right to participate fully in society, with the appropriate accommodations and support.

So, to sum it up, ableism affects society by creating barriers and inequalities for people with disabilities, both in terms of their rights and their ability to participate fully in community life. Addressing ableism requires a multifaceted approach, including raising awareness, promoting inclusive policies, and fostering attitudinal changes towards disability.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Ableism affects society by creating barriers and inequalities for people with disabilities, impacting their rights and ability to participate fully in community life.}} \]
