Alright, so I've been hearing a lot about Medicare Advantage plans lately, and I'm wondering why there's so much push for them. I mean, I know what Medicare is—it's the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, or younger with certain disabilities. But Medicare Advantage seems a bit different. I think it's offered by private companies that contract with Medicare, right? So, why is there such an emphasis on these plans?

First, maybe I should understand what exactly Medicare Advantage plans are. I know that traditional Medicare has Part A, which covers hospital stays, and Part B, which covers doctors' services and outpatient care. Then there's Part D for prescription drugs. Medicare Advantage, or MA plans, are an alternative to original Medicare. They're offered by private insurers approved by Medicare, and they have to cover at least what original Medicare does, but they often offer extra benefits.

So, one reason people might be pushing Medicare Advantage is that they offer additional benefits. For example, some MA plans include vision, hearing, and dental coverage, which aren't typically covered by original Medicare. Also, they often include prescription drug coverage, so you don't have to sign up separately for Part D.

Another thing is that Medicare Advantage plans might have lower out-of-pocket costs for some people. They often have annual limits on out-of-pocket expenses, which original Medicare doesn't have. So, for someone who needs a lot of medical care, that could be a big advantage.

Also, MA plans might have networks of providers, which could mean lower costs because the insurers have negotiated rates with certain doctors and hospitals. So, if you stay within the network, you might save money.

But why are insurers and possibly the government pushing these plans? Well, for insurers, it's probably because they can make a profit by offering these plans. They get paid by Medicare to provide these plans, and they might be able to manage costs more efficiently than original Medicare.

As for the government, maybe Medicare Advantage helps them contain costs. If private insurers can provide the same benefits as original Medicare but at a lower cost, that could save the government money. Plus, with MA plans, there might be more emphasis on preventive care and managing chronic conditions, which could lead to better health outcomes and lower overall costs in the long run.

But I should look into this more. Maybe there are some statistics or studies that show the advantages and disadvantages of Medicare Advantage plans compared to original Medicare. I think doing some research would help me understand why there's so much promotion of these plans.

Let me try to search for some information. Maybe I can find out more about the growth of Medicare Advantage and why it's becoming more popular.

Newly expanded supplemental benefits in Medicare Advantage grew 43% for 2022
Along with that growth, the number of plans offering more than one benefit increased 15%, from 175 to 202.

Medicare Advantage plans offering at least one newly-expanded supplemental benefit rose 43% from the 2021 to the '22 coverage year, finds new analysis from the Better Medicare Alliance.
The findings show that under the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' reinterpretation of "primarily health-related" benefits, supplemental benefit offerings in Medicare Advantage – such as home-based palliative care, in-home support services, caregiver support and therapeutic massage – all increased for the upcoming year.
Along with the 43% jump in supplemental benefit offerings, the number of plans offering more than one benefit increased 15%, from 175 to 202.
The Biden Administration projects to enroll 29.5 million beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage over the coming year. The supplemental benefits are unavailable in fee-for-service Medicare.
Guidance issued in both 2018 and 2019 from CMS expanded the type of supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage plans are permitted to offer.
WHAT'S THE IMPACT?
Medicare Advantage plans – private plans offering Medicare benefits – must cover all benefits covered by original Medicare at a level of cost sharing that is, in total, no greater than original Medicare. MA plans may offer additional, supplemental benefits such as dental, vision and fitness.
Under CMS guidelines issued in spring 2018, plans were granted more flexibility regarding the benefits they were permitted to offer. This new flexibility expanded the types of supplemental benefits that could be provided to all enrollees (called "'primarily health related' for supplemental benefits"), and also allowed plans to offer different cost-sharing or additional benefits to specific subsets of their enrollees.
In spring 2019, CMS further expanded the flexibility of these benefits by allowing MA plans to offer special supplemental benefits for the chronically ill.
In-home support services had the largest growth in prevalence among these plan benefits, especially from 2020 to 2022. The prevalence of support for caregivers of enrollees almost doubled from 2020 to 2022, bringing it up to a similar level to home-based palliative care and therapeutic massage, both of which had small increases from 2021 and 2022.
With the exception of therapeutic massage from 2020 to 2021 and adult day health services from 2021 to 2022, all of the identified benefits have increased in plan prevalence each year.
THE LARGER TREND
Insurers are expanding their Medicare Advantage offerings at a decent clip, with Humana announcing in October that it would debut a new Medicare Advantage PPO plan in 37 rural counties in North Carolina in response to market demand in the eastern part of the state.
Around the same time, UnitedHealthcare, which already has significant market control with its MA plans, said it will strengthen its foothold in the space by expanding its MA plans in 2022, adding a potential 3.1 million members and reaching 94% of Medicare-eligible consumers in the U.S.
For the third straight year, health insurer Cigna is expanding its Medicare Advantage plans, growing into 108 new counties and three new states – Connecticut, Oregon and Washington. The move will increase its geographic presence by nearly 30%.
Centene is also getting in on the act, expanding MA into 327 new counties and three new states –Massachusetts, Nebraska and Oklahoma. In all, this represents a 26% expansion of Centene's MA footprint, with the offering available to a potential 48 million beneficiaries across 36 states.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in late September that the average premium for Medicare Advantage plans will be lower in 2022 at $19 per month, compared with $21.22 in 2021. However, Part D coverage is rising to $33 per month, compared with $31.47 in 2021.
Enrollment in MA continues to increase, CMS said. In 2022, it's projected to reach 29.5 million people, compared with 26.9 million enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2021.

​Medicare Advantage Plans Increasingly Popular
​Extra benefits attracting enrollees, but experts say plans can deliver better on their promises

As Medicare Advantage plans approach their 25th birthday — the law that created the current system allowing private health care providers to offer a one-stop-shop alternative to original Medicare was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1997 — they have become an integral part of the program. Today, an estimated 42 percent of Medicare recipients are enrolled in an MA plan, and experts project the majority of beneficiaries may get their medical coverage through one by 2030.
The growth of MA plans is linked closely to the founding idea of Medicare: Provide older Americans with the same kind of health insurance coverage they got when they were working. For the first 20 years of the program, original Medicare did just that by offering plain-style health insurance in which doctors and hospitals simply got paid for services rendered. But as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs) came on the scene in a big way during the 1980s and ’90s, more Americans became accustomed to getting care through a single, all-encompassing health care network. That led to the creation in 1997 of Medicare Part C — first called Medicare+Choice and now Medicare Advantage.
Ever since, most Medicare enrollees have had a decision to make: Choose pay-per-service health insurance under original Medicare or become a member of an MA plan that gets paid a lump sum by the federal government to provide all your care. In 2005, 13 percent of enrollees chose the MA option, and the growth has been steady ever since; enrollment in Advantage plans rose 10 percent between 2020 and 2021 alone.

One reason for this growth is all the extra benefits MA plans provide — but which Congress has not yet allowed original Medicare to offer. For example, many MA plans tout gym benefits plus some dental, vision and hearing care. And in recent years, government officials have given the plans permission to offer transportation to doctor appointments, modifications to beneficiaries’ homes such as wheelchair ramps, and even carpet cleaning to help people with respiratory problems.
AARP is lobbying Congress to allow original Medicare to offer similar benefits to its enrollees, as is the Center for Medicare Advocacy, which stated in a March report that “there is a growing imbalance between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare ... relating to the scope of coverage.”
Another selling point of MA plans is their one-stop-shopping experience, says Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). In contrast, original Medicare enrollees wanting prescription drug coverage must shop for a private Part D plan, and many also choose to buy a supplemental or “Medigap” insurance policy to cover health costs not covered by Medicare. They also need to consider buying separate dental and vision care policies, she says.
Neuman also points to the aggressive marketing of MA plans. From NFL Hall of Famer Joe Namath to former sitcom star Jimmie “J.J.” Walker, celebrities are routinely endorsing MA plans in TV ads touting all their extra services at no increase to your usual Part B premium.
“Traditional Medicare doesn’t really market,” Neuman says.
Although Medicare Advantage is obviously popular with consumers, a full report card on it has to look at its macro-level goals, such as providing superior health care to older Americans while saving taxpayers money. And at that level, the jury is still out. Here is a look at MA plans today from several important angles.
The MA consumer experience
Being in an MA plan is very different from getting your care under original Medicare.
If you are enrolled in original Medicare and you need a doctor, you can go to any provider in the United States who has signed up to treat Medicare patients. If you need to see a specialist or go to a hospital, you can pick whomever or whichever you want, as long as they participate in the program. You control general oversight of your health care, though you have the option of using a primary care physician to help guide your choices.
MA plans mostly come in one of two approaches. HMOs typically have closed panels of doctors who often practice together in one location; usually your care will be entirely coordinated by that medical group. If you go outside the HMO’s staff for health care, the plan likely won’t pay for it. If you want to see a specialist — say, a cardiologist to thoroughly check out your heart health — you typically need your primary care doctor to give a referral to a specialist within the HMO.
PPOs are a little looser than HMOs, but they still have restrictions. You’ll likely have a list of professionals within the PPO that you must choose from, but you won’t need a gatekeeping doctor to preapprove seeing a specialist. Still, you may have to get more pre-authorizations for procedures or tests than under original Medicare. Some PPOs do let their members get outside care, but you’ll usually pay much more for it.
Quratulain “Annie” Syed, M.D., is an Atlanta geriatrician who has taken care of patients via both original Medicare and MA plans. She’s sold on MA. These plans give practitioners “more ability to innovate the care, compared to the standard practice,” Syed says. She points to the emphasis on preventive care by MA plans, their ongoing communication with members and the free transportation that some plans offer. Together, these offerings increase the chance of enrollees seeing their doctors more often. Patients who visit her only once or twice a year bring “a whole laundry list of problems,” Syed says.

The extra benefit aspect in MA plans has roots in the 1980s. But the benefits proliferated after 2003, when Congress deemed that if MA plans were able to provide medical care to members for less than what Medicare paid them, the extra money should be put toward either providing extra services or cutting patients’ costs.
Sheereen Aarif first got on Medicare in 2006, when a heart condition disabled her. She was on original Medicare, but when she moved to be with her sons in Douglasville, Georgia, an adviser suggested she consider an MA plan. The 69-year-old retired engineering technician is glad she did.
The main reason she switched, Aarif says, was the transportation benefit. Her cardiologist is 45 minutes from where she lives. “My children work, and I have no way of getting around. I don’t drive.” She couldn’t continue to afford the Lyft costs. Now her plan offers her five round-trip rides each year.
Aarif was also pleased to find out that the MA plan would keep tabs on her annual screenings and even whether she exercised. And her physical activities came with a bonus. “I went to the senior center before COVID and did exercises and line dancing. We got points for that.” Those points, it turned out, were convertible into a gift card that the plan sent her just in time to do Christmas shopping.
About 40 percent of Humana’s 4.9 million MA plan members have the transportation benefit, according to company spokesman Jim Turner. But do enrollees use such offerings? MA plans do not generally report this data, but Turner said that about 18 percent of those who joined Humana in 2021 had already used their over-the-counter drug discount cards through July — a benefit not offered by original Medicare. And about 80 percent of Humana members who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (the federal-state health program for those with low income) use the Healthy Foods Card, which provides qualifying members with a $75-a-month food allowance.
United Healthcare, the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans (many of which carry the AARP brand), says its “Medicare Advantage plans go beyond traditional health care services to try to help address the issues outside the doctor’s office that impact people’s health, such as food security, housing, transportation and social support.” Another example: United and other MA plans have begun offering programs that provide members the ability to have licensed medical staff come to their home.
The question of care
Extra benefits aside, some experts cite a potential downside to the restrictions in MA plans: members’ limited choices for specialist doctors or hospitals. This comes into play particularly when there is a need for a more serious or unique treatment for health issues ranging from cancer to joint replacements; patients in an MA plan often don’t have the option to go to a top-grade but out-of-network research hospital or specialist unless they are willing to pay far more of the costs themselves.
A 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office looked at whether people with complicated health issues may not be as satisfied with MA plans. The report found that “beneficiaries in the last year of life disproportionately disenrolled” and went back to original Medicare. The report also said that such moves “increased Medicare spending by hundreds of millions of dollars.” The reason: While the government pays MA plans a flat rate to care for enrollees, original Medicare pays health care providers directly for services rendered, and people near life’s end often generate huge amounts of medical costs. Medicare pays for hospice care for people near the end of life, whether in original Medicare or an MA plan.
David Lipschutz, associate director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, says that while some studies show MA plans do better when it comes to preventive care, other studies show “people who are sicker tend to disenroll at a higher rate than those who are not sick. That is, to me, very telling.”
Alicia Jones, director of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) in Nebraska, says that in her experience, people who have had a history of serious illnesses will more often opt for original Medicare with a Medigap policy because they want predictability when it comes to costs. “They like to know exactly what they are going to be spending,” she says. A Medigap policy “might be a little more expensive, but it does mean you know exactly every month what it’s going to cost.” Roughly 34 percent of original Medicare enrollees buy supplemental Medigap coverage; another 29 percent of enrollees get supplemental coverage through an employer-sponsored retiree benefit.
Under MA plans, there may be copays and other out-of-pocket costs that are less predictable. That said, MA plans have a cap on annual out-of-pocket costs (in 2021, that was $7,550).
At the Medicare Rights Center, there have been several common themes to the complaints received from beneficiaries over the past decade, says Casey Schwarz, the advocacy group’s senior counsel for education and federal policy. “More people who call because they are dissatisfied with their MA plan largely have complaints about affordability, about networks, about denials,” Schwarz says. “For example, they may have low out-of-pocket costs when they have relatively few health care needs. But if they become sicker, their out-of-pocket costs can be larger.”
Often the most pressing concern Schwarz’s counselors hear about, she says, is from consumers who want to switch out of an MA plan because they want to see a doctor who is not in their plan’s network.
But switching from an MA plan to original Medicare can be tricky. The federal government basically gives beneficiaries a yearlong tryout period with MA. If you’re not happy with your plan within the first year, you can switch to original Medicare and still be guaranteed eligibility for a Medigap plan.
But if you’ve been in an MA plan for longer than a year and choose to switch to original Medicare, in most states Medigap plans can charge you more — or refuse to sell you a policy — if you have a health issue.
The big-picture goals
The federal government assesses MA plans through a five-star quality bonus program that rates them based on 40 performance measures. These range from health screening availability and patient satisfaction to how quickly plans respond to denial of care appeals. Plans have an incentive to do well in these categories because those that get at least four stars typically get bonus payments from Medicare. In 2021, about 80 percent of MA plans got at least four stars; some critics suggest this means the quality measures are not stringent enough.
“By some measures, the program has been wildly successful. But from our perspective, we also look at whether Medicare Advantage is achieving its full potential with respect to the Medicare program as a whole,” says James Mathews, executive director of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), which Congress established to analyze the program and provide advice. His organization believes the method Medicare uses to grade MA plans “fails utterly.” The commission has urged Congress to scrap the current system in favor of one that would better evaluate how well plans meet patient needs.
Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which runs Medicare, told AARP in an interview that “it is the responsibility of CMS to continue to make sure that plans are living up to their role, and we certainly will be looking at our regulations, and our guidance, to make sure that we are holding the plans to the standards that they should meet.” But Brooks-LaSure wouldn’t say if she thinks the quality rating system for Advantage plans should be reformed, as MedPAC recommends.
Does MA save money?
While MA plans dispute this, MedPAC said in a 2021 report that taxpayers have not financially benefited from the program over the past two decades. “The Commission estimates that Medicare currently spends 4 percent more per capita for beneficiaries enrolled in MA than it spends for similar enrollees in traditional fee-for-service Medicare,” the report states.
Mathews explains how this happens: Each year, MA plans give the government their bids that reflect how much they think it will cost them to deliver care to members. Though the bids say they provide medical care for an average of 87 percent of what it costs fee-for-service Medicare, the formula the government uses to pay nets those plans 104 percent of the fee-for-service costs. Under MedPAC’s June recommendations, Medicare would pay MA plans closer to parity with original Medicare costs per beneficiary. That would save the program $10 billion over five years.
Medicare Advantage plans say the MedPAC calculations are based on flawed assumptions. Mark Hamelburg, senior vice president at America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade association for the health insurance industry, says the group’s calculations show that not only have MA plans been able to bid to provide care at less than what it cost Medicare for the original program, but “the actual dollars out the door have been less.”
But a blog post from MedPAC disputes the trade group's analysis, saying: “MedPAC continues to find that Medicare pays more for beneficiaries enrolled in MA, compared to similar beneficiaries" enrolled in fee-for-service coverage.
Will the two choices continue to coexist?
In interviews, Mathews and Brooks-LaSure made clear that neither MedPAC nor CMS intends to advise beneficiaries on which option is better. And other experts say there is no one-size-fits-all conclusion about which type of Medicare coverage Americans should choose.
Brooks-LaSure told AARP that she believes both original Medicare and MA “need to be viable options for people so that they can decide on their own which one makes the most sense for them.” What is clear is that enrollment in MA plans is likely to continue rising. A Congressional Budget Office analysis projects that by 2030, 55 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will be enrolled in MA plans.
Congress is considering proposals to fund new benefits for original Medicare that would level the playing field. But other differences, particularly the cap on out-of-pocket costs, likely mean that MA plans will continue to increase in popularity. “It’s quite possible,” says KFF’s Neuman, “that based on current trends, Medicare will be looking more and more like a marketplace of private plans.”

Medicare Advantage plans are another way to get your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called “Part C” or “MA Plans,” are offered by Medicare-approved private companies that must follow rules set by Medicare.
Today, most Medicare Advantage plans include some form of drug coverage (Medicare Part D).  Unlike Medicare Supplement insurance, with an MA plan, in many cases, you’ll need to use health care providers who participate in the plan’s network and service area for the lowest costs. These plans set a limit on what you’ll have to pay out-of-pocket each year for covered services.  This can help protect you from unexpected costs. Some plans offer out-of-network coverage, but sometimes at a higher cost.
It pays to compare your plan options.  To find a local Medicare insurance agent use the Association’s free directory.  Agents will list whether they offer both Medicare Advantage as well as Medicare Supplement plans.

4 Positive Trends That Continue to Define Medicare Advantage Plans
4 Positive Trends That Continue to Define Medicare Advantage Plans
Medicare Advantage plans have diverse member populations, low member spending, high quality of care, and high enrollment growth.

By Kelsey Waddill
January 18, 2021 - Four trends have continued to define the Medicare Advantage space in recent years, fact sheets from the Alliance of Community Health Plans (ACHP) revealed.
“Congress created Medicare Advantage (MA) in 2003 to provide America’s seniors a convenient, coordinated option for their health coverage and to drive greater value and accountability in the Medicare program,” an ACHP fact sheet began. “Today, the evidence is clear: MA is working, providing exceptional coverage and care for nearly 23 million seniors.”
Four fact sheets from ACHP revealed how diversity, lower out-of-pocket healthcare spending, high quality of care, and strong enrollment growth have continued to characterize Medicare Advantage plans.
Diverse member population
Medicare Advantage plans continue to serve a diverse member population, compared to traditional Medicare.
The Medicare Advantage population included around 25 million seniors in 2020. Of those, over 60 percent were women.

Research from previous years also demonstrated that minority communities have been strongly represented in the Medicare Advantage member population.
Around half of all Hispanic American seniors (52 percent) and African American seniors (49 percent) chose Medicare Advantage over Medicare when they became eligible. Over a third of all Asian Americans selected Medicare Advantage plans (35 percent).
The percentage of Medicare Advantage enrollees who are people of color has increased over time. From 2013 to 2018, the share of enrollees who were people of color grew by more than 37 percent.
Slightly over half of all seniors in Medicare Advantage plans made less than $30,000 per year. A little more than a quarter of Medicare Advantage members had an income of $50,000 per year or more (28 percent).
Lower senior spending
Six in ten seniors did not have a premium for their Medicare Advantage plan, one ACHP fact sheet shared. Seniors also experienced lower healthcare costs due to the Medicare Advantage out-of-pocket healthcare spending cap.
READ MORE: Medicare Advantage Quality of Care Surpasses Traditional Medicare
A separate report by UnitedHealth Group discovered that 3.5 percent of traditional Medicare beneficiaries spent more than Medicare Advantage members. Whereas these traditional Medicare beneficiaries were spending around $12,000 in out-of-pocket healthcare spending, Medicare Advantage members had an out-of-pocket healthcare spending limit of $6,700.
Medicare Advantage members were not the only stakeholders who saved on healthcare spending due to their health plan selection, the ACHP fact sheets stated. Medicare Advantage cost taxpayers 9.5 percent less than traditional Medicare did. This statistic included the costs of Medicare Advantage plans’ extra benefits.
Traditional Medicare saw an improper payment of 6.7 percent in 2020, compared to Medicare Advantage’s 6.0 percent improper payment rate.
“MA incentivizes health plans, providers and health systems to closely coordinate care to improve health outcomes and reduce costs,” the ACHP fact sheet argued. “In areas where MA is prevalent, doctors employ those innovations learned with MA when caring for patients in traditional Medicare – creating efficiencies and providing higher quality care.”
Higher quality of care
The Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system incentivizes Medicare Advantage plans to value quality over quantity, another ACHP fact sheet confirmed.
READ MORE: Prescription Coverage Draws Beneficiaries to Medicare Advantage
Almost eight in ten Medicare Advantage members (78 percent) were in a Medicare Advantage plan that boasted 4 stars or more, 52 percent more than when the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system started eight years prior.
Nearly all Medicare Advantage members were satisfied with their health plan (99 percent), whereas 85 percent of traditional Medicare beneficiaries expressed satisfaction.
Medicare Advantage plans’ higher quality care was perhaps most evident in their low hospitalization rates. Medicare Advantage plans had a 57 percent lower unnecessary hospitalization rate than Medicare did, the ACHP fact sheet explained.
High enrollment growth
Medicare Advantage plans also experienced high enrollment growth. From 2013 to 2020, Medicare Advantage saw a 60 percent increase in its enrollment.
Medicare Advantage members also had more Medicare Advantage health plan options in which to enroll. In the past nine years, the number of Medicare Advantage plans rose 161 percent.
The Better Medicare Alliance found that the number of Medicare Advantage plans has increased 49 percent since 2017 alone.
The trend is expected to continue, with experts predicting that Medicare Advantage will hit 33 million enrollees by 2030.
Meanwhile, enrollment in traditional Medicare dropped more than 100,000 beneficiaries in 2019, a separate ACHP fact sheet stated.
Looking to the future, payer experts have predicted that improving member experience for dual eligibles will be a significant focus for Medicare Advantage plans.
"Duals are unique: they have to work with the state, they have to work through federal,” Mike Polen, senior vice president and chief executive officer of Medicare at Centene, told HealthPayerIntelligence.
“What you're continuing to see is the need to integrate those two programs together so that the member has a seamless overall experience. Again, the focus is on being able to coordinate their care better than they currently are today, looking for solutions where you're integrating the various state and federal programs together, which ultimately should reduce costs and improve quality for the member.”
This group also presents an opportunity for Medicare Advantage plans to boost enrollment even further, an analysis by LEK Consulting added.

How to Succeed in the Booming Business of Medicare Advantage
To capitalize on the rapid growth in membership, insurers need to rethink the way they design and administer MA plans.
by Akshay Jindal, Ashwin Badrinarayan, and Sanchit Madan
There is great uncertainty surrounding attempts to repeal, reform, or replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). But as we’ve noted, market participants can’t afford to sit still. Regardless of what happens, there is one very significant sector of healthcare that is positioned to succeed in this environment of uncertainty: Medicare Advantage (MA). As baby boomers age into qualification for Medicare, members are more likely to opt for plans that have benefits beyond what Medicare has traditionally offered. As a result, MA will present a significant source of growth for insurers. But to access a substantial share of this profit, plans need to urgently invest in key differentiating capabilities.
Some background: The federal government provides healthcare insurance for seniors through Medicare, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Although Medicare reimburses providers, it doesn’t cover all costs. This is where Medicare Advantage comes into play. Members have the option of purchasing MA plans from private insurers to cover out-of-pocket costs. The majority of Medicare recipients do not choose MA plans, either because they aren’t aware of them or because their preferred doctors may not always be part of the plans, but the numbers are growing. Based on CMS data, more than 32 percent of Medicare members in 2016 — some 19 million out of the 58 million total — enrolled in MA plans. But this is just the beginning. Analysis from Strategy&, PwC’s strategy consulting business, projects that over the next eight years, enrollment in MA will rise at a compounded annual rate of between 7 and 12 percent. Accordingly, we expect annual revenues for MA plans to rise from US$215 billion in fiscal year 2017 to more than $500 billion by 2025.
The underlying growth of MA is good news for healthcare payors. But not all participants will benefit equally. Given the structural and market forces at work, the total number of profitable MA plans is actually likely to decrease even as the number of participants surges. In this winner-take-all market, between $10 billion and $15 billion per year in total industry profits will shift toward a smaller number of higher-performing plans.
As they sign up more members, plans operating in the MA market in the coming years will have to grapple with a host of external and internal challenges to their profits. These include cost pressures, lower reimbursement rates, increasingly stringent compliance requirements, and the double-edged sword of performance-driven reimbursements. CMS conducts an annual assessment of MA plans based on performance in a range of areas, including patient experience, access to care, and clinical care outcomes. The results of this assessment are published as star ratings, with the best-performing plans receiving a five-star rating. CMS offers substantial financial incentives in the form of bonus payments to plans with a higher star rating. Additionally, a small proportion (i.e., up to 5 percent) of the reimbursement payments are tied to these quality ratings.
Between $10 billion and $15 billion per year in total industry profits will shift toward a smaller number of higher-performing plans.
As time goes on, CMS will be basing a larger proportion of its payments on the ability of payors to deliver specific results and improvements in health metrics. At the same time, customers will likely flock to those plans with the highest quality ratings. This will create a virtuous circle. We project that within three years, 73 percent of the total MA membership will be serviced by plans with four or more stars, up from 34 percent today. Aside from attracting more members, plans with quality ratings of four or more stars will continue to receive a significant portion of the quality incentives paid by CMS, and have the resources to offer more attractive plans and reinforce their brands. The resulting increase in profit — an additional $800 million to $1.2 billion annually — means they’ll have larger cash flows to deploy for further investment in differentiated capabilities and market-position enhancement.
Success Factors
To achieve the desired performance levels and have a winning position in the MA market, insurance plans need to urgently invest in four key success factors.
Provider payment innovation/MACRA. In the healthcare market generally, there is a shift from the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) model toward payment for value or quality of services rendered, rather than quantity. The value-based payment model ties provider payments to the outcome of services provided as part of an effort to focus more on patient well-being and decrease medical costs. For example, insurers are implementing value-based payment strategies through episodic bundled payments for conditions such as hip and knee surgery and maternity care. Overall, tying payments to values and outcomes should help healthcare plans reduce medical expenses through the elimination of unnecessary and duplicate services. The 2015 Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) is accelerating this shift by rewarding or penalizing Medicare providers (i.e., doctors and hospitals) through the addition of a bonus to, or subtraction of a fine from, their FFS payments based on the quality of care. As a result, Medicare plans will be able to negotiate rates with providers based on their performance. In order to thrive in the MACRA world, plans will need to provide scale and management capabilities to support providers through this transition, and to revamp their provider network and engagement strategies. MA plans can help physicians segue into MACRA-based payment models by equipping them with solutions and funding that enable them to perform MACRA-related analysis and reporting.
Enhanced care models/care coordination. Coordinating care for members is another critical differentiator for MA plans. Due to their age and health conditions, typical MA enrollees on average seek a lot more medical services across multiple avenues — physicians, labs, pharmacies, and long-term care — than younger patients. As reimbursement shifts to a value-based model, payors will need to find cost efficiencies by managing care through a “whole-person care” model. For example, by coordinating the care of a 70-year-old heart bypass surgery patient more effectively with the surgeon, hospital, and nursing home, payors can help smooth postoperative care and reduce readmissions. To forge a seamless care-delivery experience for the newly tech-savvy and empowered enrollees, MA plans can employ innovative and customizable models for integrated care coordination (e.g., cash bonus for enrollment in wellness programs) and through technology such as customized apps to track member health/wellness (e.g., tracking diets for diabetics).
Proactive and member-centric risk management. As compliance and regulatory requirements continue to become more stringent, plans need to deploy a three-step member-centric strategy to manage risk. First, they have to use data analysis to evaluate all member interactions across the company to identify the greatest risk areas for regulatory noncompliance. This can be done through by analyzing complaints and holding reviews of audits and internal processes. For example, timely member notification — such as the need to confirm receipt of enrollment applications within seven business days — is often an area of high risk for payors to ensure compliance with CMS requirements. Reviewing a single member’s experience with claims (as opposed to reviewing every process in the internal claims department) can be effective in identifying areas of concern. Next, payors must systematically address the most probable and highest-impact areas through both short- and long-term solutions that directly manage each high-risk member interaction. Finally, as plans implement solutions, they need to adopt a culture of continuous improvement that both extends and updates these solutions regularly.
Member-centric risk management that aligns with the way CMS regards regulatory compliance offers several clear advantages. It can predict “hot spots,” or future areas of concern, such as changes in coverage that may result in barriers to care, before they become full-blown citations; it also can help management prioritize allocation of resources to areas that will have the greatest impact. More fundamentally, plans can identify and address root causes that typically span organizational boundaries.
Member engagement and experience. With the rapid increase in the number of baby boomers qualifying for Medicare, it is critical for MA plans to invest in differentiated member engagement capabilities. As noted, the number of customers for these plans is becoming more significant. But given the decades of experience these customers now have with online shopping, banking, and other services, their expectations for technology and user experience are increasing. Payors must review member needs across the spectrum of care as well as the services they provide and define new user experiences for each step. Doing so will allow plans to ensure member satisfaction, enable better retention, and reduce the number of member complaints, which are a significant driver of plan performance ratings.
Each of these four differentiating areas is important for success in the MA market. But to truly succeed, payors will need to build a coherent strategy that holistically ties these four areas with a corresponding “way to play.” For example, a clinic-based care coordinator, such as Illinois-based Riverside Healthcare, can emphasize in-person care experiences and maintain a low-cost model by automating or outsourcing operations including compliance, all while leveraging MACRA principles for its narrow network design. A regional plan with large membership, such as Florida-based managed care company Wellcare, should seek to enhance the member experience by expanding its digital footprint while developing proactive risk management and operational excellence capabilities that ensure compliant and low-cost operations.
Regardless of the path they choose, plans must begin investing in capabilities now. In the winner-take-all healthcare market of the future, passivity is not an option.

Alright, so I've got some search results here about Medicare Advantage plans. Let's see what I can gather from these documents.

From Doc 1, it's about the growth of Medicare Advantage plans and how they're offering more supplemental benefits. It mentions that these benefits include things like home-based palliative care, in-home support services, and even therapeutic massage. The number of plans offering these benefits has increased significantly from 2021 to 2022, with a 43% jump. Also, the number of plans offering more than one benefit increased by 15%. The Biden administration projects that 29.5 million beneficiaries will be enrolled in Medicare Advantage for the coming year.

This suggests that Medicare Advantage plans are expanding their offerings to attract more enrollees by providing additional benefits that original Medicare doesn't cover. This could be one reason why there's a push for these plans—they offer more comprehensive coverage.

Moving on to Doc 2, it's from AARP and discusses the increasing popularity of Medicare Advantage plans. It mentions that around 42% of Medicare recipients are enrolled in MA plans, and projections suggest that the majority may be enrolled in MA by 2030. The growth is attributed to the extra benefits offered by MA plans, such as gym memberships, some dental, vision, and hearing care, and recently even transportation to doctor appointments and home modifications for those with respiratory issues.

AARP is lobbying for original Medicare to offer similar benefits, indicating that these extra perks are attractive to enrollees. So, the push for MA plans could be due to their ability to provide these additional benefits that original Medicare doesn't.

Doc 2 also points out that MA plans offer a one-stop-shopping experience, which might be more convenient for some people compared to original Medicare, where enrollees need to separately enroll in Part D for prescription drugs and possibly purchase Medigap policies for additional coverage.

There's also mention of aggressive marketing by MA plans, with celebrities endorsing them, highlighting their extra services without increasing the usual Part B premium. This suggests that marketing plays a role in promoting MA plans.

However, the document also notes that while MA plans are popular among consumers, their performance in terms of providing superior healthcare and saving taxpayer money is still up for debate. So, there might be some mixed opinions about their overall effectiveness.

Doc 3 provides statistics on Medicare Advantage plans, such as the number of plans available, their growth, and enrollment numbers. It shows that the number of MA plans has increased by 13% from 2020 to 2021, with Florida having the most plans available. Enrollment is projected to reach 26.5 million in 2021, with the top 25 insurers enrolling 87% of the national market.

This indicates a significant and growing presence of MA plans in the market, which could be why there's a push for them—more plans are being offered, and more people are enrolling in them.

Doc 4 is from HealthPayerIntelligence and discusses four positive trends defining Medicare Advantage plans: diverse member populations, lower member spending, high quality of care, and strong enrollment growth.

It mentions that MA plans serve a diverse population, with high representation from minority communities and lower-income individuals. This suggests that MA plans are accessible and appealing to a broad range of beneficiaries.

Regarding lower spending, the article notes that six in ten seniors don't have a premium for their MA plan, and they benefit from an out-of-pocket spending cap. Comparatively, traditional Medicare beneficiaries spent more out-of-pocket. This cost-saving aspect could be another reason for the push towards MA plans—both for enrollees seeking lower costs and for the government aiming to contain healthcare spending.

The quality of care is highlighted by the high satisfaction rates among MA members and lower hospitalization rates compared to traditional Medicare. This suggests that MA plans may be providing better care, which would be a strong argument for promoting them.

Lastly, the strong enrollment growth is evident, with a 60% increase from 2013 to 2020, and projections to reach 33 million enrollees by 2030. This trend indicates that MA plans are becoming increasingly popular, which could be due to the benefits they offer and the marketing efforts behind them.

Doc 5 is from Strategy& and discusses how to succeed in the booming MA business. It projects that MA revenues will rise from $215 billion in FY2017 to over $500 billion by 2025, presenting a significant growth opportunity for insurers.

However, the article also notes that while the number of enrollees is increasing, the number of profitable MA plans may decrease, leading to a winner-takes-all market where a smaller number of high-performing plans capture most of the profits.

To succeed, the article identifies four key success factors: provider payment innovation (especially in light of MACRA), enhanced care models and care coordination, proactive and member-centric risk management, and member engagement and experience.

This suggests that to remain competitive and profitable, MA plans need to invest in these areas to differentiate themselves and provide better value to enrollees and the healthcare system overall.

So, synthesizing all this information, it seems that there are several reasons why there's a push for Medicare Advantage plans:

1. **Additional Benefits:** MA plans offer extra benefits like dental, vision, hearing, gym memberships, and even non-medical services like transportation and home modifications. These additional perks make them more attractive to enrollees compared to original Medicare.

2. **Cost Savings:** MA plans often have lower out-of-pocket costs for enrollees, with features like annual spending caps and no premiums for many enrollees. This can be a significant draw for those looking to save money on their healthcare costs.

3. **Convenience:** The one-stop-shopping model of MA plans, where all coverage is provided through a single plan, can be more convenient than managing multiple parts and supplements under original Medicare.

4. **Quality of Care:** MA plans are reported to have higher satisfaction rates and better health outcomes, such as lower hospitalization rates, which can appeal to those seeking higher-quality care.

5. **Marketing Efforts:** Aggressive marketing by MA plans, including celebrity endorsements, highlights the benefits and may influence enrollees to choose MA over original Medicare.

6. **Government Incentives:** The government may be pushing MA plans as a way to contain costs, as they believe private insurers can manage care more efficiently and cost-effectively than original Medicare.

7. **Growth and Profit Opportunities:** For insurers, the growing MA market presents a significant opportunity for business growth and profits, motivating them to promote these plans.

However, it's essential to consider that there are also criticisms and concerns about MA plans, such as potential limitations on provider choice, varying coverage across plans, and the quality of care provided. Some advocate for original Medicare to offer similar benefits to level the playing field.

In conclusion, the push for Medicare Advantage plans is multifaceted, involving benefits to enrollees, insurers, and potentially the healthcare system as a whole. Understanding these dynamics can help in evaluating the pros and cons of MA plans compared to original Medicare.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Medicare Advantage plans are being pushed due to their additional benefits, cost savings, convenience, perceived higher quality of care, aggressive marketing, and potential for cost containment by the government and profit for insurers.}} \]
