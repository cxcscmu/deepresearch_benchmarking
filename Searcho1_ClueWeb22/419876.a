As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. I provide information based on the data I've been trained on, which includes a wide range of sources such as books, websites, and other digital content. My purpose is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the input I receive, helping with tasks like writing, brainstorming, and providing explanations on various topics.

In terms of making decisions, AI models like myself follow predefined algorithms and rules set by their developers. We don't have the ability to make choices or judgments in the way humans do; instead, we generate responses based on patterns and associations learned from the data we were trained on. This means that while I can provide information and insights on how judges make decisions, I cannot experience or make decisions in the same manner as a human judge would.

If you have any questions about how judges make decisions or any other topic, feel free to ask!

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{As an AI language model, I don't make decisions like judges do; I provide information based on patterns learned from data.}} \]
