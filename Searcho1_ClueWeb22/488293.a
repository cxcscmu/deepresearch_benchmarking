So I've been given this question about whether standardized testing should be abolished. Now, I have to think carefully about this because it's a pretty big topic and there are lots of different opinions out there. First off, I need to understand what standardized testing is and why it exists. Then, I can look into the pros and cons and see if abolishing it is a good idea.

Let me start by trying to define standardized testing. From what I know, standardized tests are designed to assess students' knowledge and skills in a uniform way. They're usually multiple-choice tests that are the same for everyone taking them, no matter where they're from or which school they attend. The idea is to have a fair and objective way to measure student performance across different regions and schools.

But I'm not entirely sure about the details, so maybe I should look that up. Let me try searching for "what is standardized testing" to get a clearer definition.

Standardized test
A standardized test is a method of assessment built on the principle of consistency: all test takers are required to answer the same questions and all answers are graded in the same, predetermined way. Standardized tests are used throughout an individual’s education: to compare class progress in elementary or high school, to apply for higher ed using the SAT or to get into grad school with the GRE.
Standardized tests refer to large scale assessments administered to substantial groups of students. Most standardized tests consist of multiple choice and true or false questions. Standardized tests allow educators to compare class and student progress across a wide geographical area and are often thought to be the most fair and objective format of large-scale testing due to the consistency in questions asked and grading style.

Standardized test
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Young adults in Poland sit for their Matura exams.  The Matura is standardized so that universities can easily compare results from students across the entire country.
A standardized test is a test that is administered and scored in a consistent, or "standard", manner. Standardized tests are designed in such a way that the questions and interpretations are consistent and are administered and scored in a predetermined, standard manner. [1]
Any test in which the same test is given in the same manner to all test takers, and graded in the same manner for everyone, is a standardized test. Standardized tests do not need to be high-stakes tests, time-limited tests, or multiple-choice tests. A standardized test may be any type of test:  a written test, an oral test, or a practical skills performance test.  The questions can be simple or complex.  The subject matter among school-age students is frequently academic skills, but a standardized test can be given on nearly any topic, including driving tests, creativity, athleticism, personality, professional ethics, or other attributes.
The opposite of standardized testing is non-standardized testing, in which either significantly different tests are given to different test takers, or the same test is assigned under significantly different conditions (e.g., one group is permitted far less time to complete the test than the next group) or evaluated differently (e.g., the same answer is counted right for one student, but wrong for another student).
Most everyday quizzes and tests taken by students during school meet the definition of a standardized test:  everyone in the class takes the same test, at the same time, under the same circumstances, and all of the students are graded by their teacher in the same way.  However, the term standardized test is most commonly used to refer to tests that are given to larger groups, such as a test taken by all adults who wish to acquire a license to have a particular kind of job, or by all students of a certain age.
Because everyone gets the same test and the same grading system, standardized tests are often perceived as being fairer than non-standardized tests. Such tests are often thought of as fairer and more objective than a system in which some students get an easier test and others get a more difficult test. Standardized tests are designed to permit reliable comparison of outcomes across all test takers, because everyone is taking the same test. [2] However, both testing in general and standardized testing in specific are criticized by some people.  For example, some people believe that it is unfair to ask all students the same questions, if some students' schools did not have the same learning standards .

Definition[edit]
Two men take an authentic, non-written, criterion-referenced standardized test. If they perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the mannequin with the correct speed and pressure, they will pass this exam.
The definition of a standardized test has changed somewhat over time. [3] In 1960, standardized tests were defined as those in which the conditions and content were equal for everyone taking the test, regardless of when, where, or by whom the test was given or graded. The purpose of this standardization is to make sure that the scores reliably indicate the abilities or skills being measured, and not other things, such as different instructions about what to do if the test taker does not know the answer to a question. [3]
By the beginning of the 21st century, the focus shifted away from a strict sameness of conditions towards equal fairness of conditions. [3] For example, a test taker with a broken wrist might write more slowly because of the injury, and it would be more equitable, and produce a more reliable understanding of the test taker's actual knowledge, if that person were given a few more minutes to write down the answers to a time-limited test.  Changing the testing conditions in a way that improves fairness with respect to a permanent or temporary disability, but without undermining the main point of the assessment, is called accommodation.  However, if the purpose of the test were to see how quickly the student could write, then giving the test taker extra time would become a modification of the content, and no longer a standardized test.

Each musician chooses a different piece of music to play.  Judges choose the musician they like best.  One judge gives extra points to musicians who wear a costume.
History[edit]
China[edit]
Main article: Imperial examination
The earliest evidence of standardized testing was in China, during the Han Dynasty, [4] where the imperial examinations covered the Six Arts which included music, archery, horsemanship, arithmetic, writing, and knowledge of the rituals and ceremonies of both public and private parts.  These exams were used to select employees for the state bureaucracy.
Later, sections on military strategies, civil law, revenue and taxation, agriculture and geography were added to the testing. In this form, the examinations were institutionalized for more than a millennium.
Today, standardized testing remains widely used, most famously in the Gaokao system.
UK[edit]
Standardized testing was introduced into Europe in the early 19th century, modeled on the Chinese mandarin examinations, [5] through the advocacy of British colonial administrators, the most "persistent" of which was Britain's consul in Guangzhou, China, Thomas Taylor Meadows. [5] Meadows warned of the collapse of the British Empire if standardized testing was not implemented throughout the empire immediately. [5]
Prior to their adoption, standardized testing was not traditionally a part of Western pedagogy.  Based on the skeptical and open-ended tradition of debate inherited from Ancient Greece, Western academia favored non-standardized assessments using essays written by students. It is because of this, that the first European implementation of standardized testing did not occur in Europe proper, but in British India.[6] Inspired by the Chinese use of standardized testing, in the early 19th century, British "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism." [6] This practice of standardized testing was later adopted in the late 19th century by the British mainland. The parliamentary debates that ensued made many references to the "Chinese mandarin system". [5]
It was from Britain that standardized testing spread, not only throughout the British Commonwealth, but to Europe and then America. [5] Its spread was fueled by the Industrial Revolution. The increase in number of school students during and after the Industrial Revolution, as a result of compulsory education laws, decreased the use of open-ended assessment, which was harder to mass-produce and assess objectively due to its intrinsically subjective nature.
British soldiers took standardized tests during the Second World War.  This new recruit is sorting mechanical parts to test his understanding of machinery.  His uniform shows no name, rank, or other sign that might bias the scoring of his work.
Standardized tests such as the War Office Selection Boards were developed for the British Army during the Second World War to choose candidates for officer training and other tasks. [7] The tests looked at soldiers' mental abilities, mechanical skills, ability to work with others, and other qualities.  Previous methods had suffered from bias and resulted in choosing the wrong soldiers for officer training. [7]
United States[edit]
Further information: List of standardized tests in the United States
Standardized testing has been a part of American education since the 19th century, but the widespread reliance on standardized testing in schools in the US is largely a 20th-century phenomenon.
Immigration in the mid-19th century contributed to the growth of standardized tests in the United States. [8] Standardized tests were used when people first entered the US to test social roles and find social power and status. [9]
The College Entrance Examination Board did not offer standardized testing for university and college admission until 1900. Their first examinations were administered in 1901, in nine subjects. This test was implemented with the idea of creating standardized admissions for the United States in northeastern elite universities. Originally, the test was also meant for top boarding schools, in order to standardize curriculum. [10] Originally the standardized test was made of essays and was not intended for widespread testing.[citation needed]
During World War I, the Army Alpha and Beta tests were developed to help place new recruits in appropriate assignments based upon their assessed intelligence levels. [11] The first edition of a modern standardized test for IQ, the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Test, appeared in 1916.  The College Board then designed the SAT (Scholar Aptitude Test) in 1926. The first SAT test was based on the Army IQ tests, with the goal of determining the test taker's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking.[12] In 1959, Everett Lindquist offered the ACT (American College Testing) for the first time. [13] As of 2020, the ACT includes four main sections with multiple-choice questions to test English, mathematics, reading, and science, plus an optional writing section. [14]
Individual states began testing large numbers of children and teenagers through the public school systems in the 1970s.  By the 1980s, American schools were assessing nationally. [15] In 2012, 45 states paid an average of $27 per student, and $669 million overall, on large-scale annual academic tests. [16] However, other costs, such as paying teachers to prepare students for the tests and for class time spent administering the tests, significantly exceeds the cost of the test itself. [16]
The need for the federal government to make meaningful comparisons across a highly de-centralized (locally controlled) public education system has encouraged the use of large-scale standardized testing.  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 required some standardized testing in public schools. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 further tied some types of public school funding to the results of standardized testing.
The goal of No Child Left Behind was to improve the education system in the United States by holding schools and teachers accountable for student achievement, including the educational achievement gap between minority and non-minority children in public schools.  An additional factor in the United States education system is the socioeconomic background of the students being tested. According to the National Center for Children in Poverty, 41 percent of children under the age of 18 come from lower-income families. [17] These students require specialized attention to perform well in school and on the standardized tests. [18]
Under these federal laws, the school curriculum was still set by each state, but the federal government required states to assess how well schools and teachers were teaching the state-chosen material with standardized tests. [19] Students' results on large-scale standardized tests were used to allocate funds and other resources to schools, and to close poorly performing schools.  The Every Student Succeeds Act replaced the NCLB at the end of 2015. [20] By that point, these large-scale standardized tests had become controversial in the United States because they were high-stakes tests for the school systems and teachers. [21]
While in recent years, many universities and colleges have abandoned the requirement of standardized test scores by applicants. [22]
Australia[edit]
The Australian National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) standardized testing was commenced in 2008 by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, an independent authority "responsible for the development of a national curriculum, a national assessment program and a national data collection and reporting program that supports 21st century learning for all Australian students". [23]
The testing includes all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 in Australian schools to be assessed using national tests. The subjects covered in these testings include Reading, Writing, Language Conventions (Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation) and Numeracy.
The program presents students level reports designed to enable parents to see their child's progress over the course of their schooling life, and help teachers to improve individual learning opportunities for their students. Students and school level data are also provided to the appropriate school system on the understanding that they can be used to target specific supports and resources to schools that need them most. Teachers and schools use this information, in conjunction with other information, to determine how well their students are performing and to identify any areas of need requiring assistance.
The concept of testing student achievement is not new, although the current Australian approach may be said to have its origins in current educational policy structures in both the US and the UK. There are several key differences between the Australian NAPLAN and the UK and USA strategies. Schools that are found to be under-performing in the Australian context will be offered financial assistance under the current federal government policy.
Colombia[edit]
In 1968 the Colombian Institute for the evaluation of education - ICFES was born to regulate higher education. The previous public evaluation system for the authorization of operation and legal recognition for institutions and university programs was implemented.
Colombia has several standardized tests that assess the level of education in the country. These exams are performed by the ICFES.
Students in third grade, fifth grade and ninth grade take the "Saber 3°5°9°" exam. This test is currently presented on a computer in controlled and census samples.
Upon leaving high school students present the "Saber 11" that allows them to enter different universities in the country. Students studying at home can take this exam to graduate from high school and get their degree certificate and diploma.
Students leaving university must take the "Saber Pro" exam.
Canada[edit]
Main article: List of Canadian primary and secondary examinations
Canada leaves education, and standardized testing as result, under the jurisdiction of the provinces. Each province has its own province-wide standardized testing regime, ranging from no required standardized tests for students in Ontario to exams worth 50% of final high school grades in Newfoundland and Labrador.[citation needed]
Design and scoring[edit]
Design[edit]
Most commonly, a major academic test includes both human-scored and computer-scored sections.
A standardized test can be composed of multiple-choice questions, true-false questions, essay questions, authentic assessments, or nearly any other form of assessment.  Multiple-choice and true-false items are often chosen for tests that are taken by thousands of people because they can be given and scored inexpensively, quickly, and reliably through using special answer sheets that can be read by a computer or via computer-adaptive testing. Some standardized tests have short-answer or essay writing components that are assigned a score by independent evaluators who use rubrics (rules or guidelines) and benchmark papers (examples of papers for each possible score) to determine the grade to be given to a response.
Any subject matter[edit]
Scoring form for driving tests in the UK.  Every person who wants a driver's license takes the same test and gets scored in the same way.
Not all standardized tests involve answering questions.  An authentic assessment for athletic skills could take the form of running for a set amount of time or dribbling a ball for a certain distance.  Healthcare professionals must pass tests proving that they can perform medical procedures.  Candidates for driver's licenses must pass a standardized test showing that they can drive a car.  The Canadian Standardized Test of Fitness has been used in medical research, to determine how physically fit the test takers are. [24] [25]
Machine and human scoring[edit]
Some standardized testing uses multiple-choice tests, which are relatively inexpensive to score, but any form of assessment can be used.
Since the latter part of the 20th century, large-scale standardized testing has been shaped in part, by the ease and low cost of grading of multiple-choice tests by computer. Most national and international assessments are not fully evaluated by people.
People are used to score items that are not able to be scored easily by computer (such as essays). For example, the Graduate Record Exam is a computer-adaptive assessment that requires no scoring by people except for the writing portion. [26]
Human scoring is relatively expensive and often variable, which is why computer scoring is preferred when feasible. For example, some critics say that poorly paid employees will score tests badly. [27] Agreement between scorers can vary between 60 and 85 percent, depending on the test and the scoring session. For large-scale tests in schools, some test-givers pay to have two or more scorers read each paper; if their scores do not agree, then the paper is passed to additional scorers. [27]
Though the process is more difficult than grading multiple-choice tests electronically, essays can also be graded by computer.  In other instances, essays and other open-ended responses are graded according to a pre-determined assessment rubric by trained graders.  For example, at Pearson, all essay graders have four-year university degrees, and a majority are current or former classroom teachers. [28]
Use of rubrics for fairness[edit]
Using a rubric is meant to increase fairness when the student's performance is evaluated.  In standardized testing, measurement error (a consistent pattern of errors and biases in scoring the test) is easy to determine in standardized testing.  In non-standardized assessment, graders have more individual discretion and therefore are more likely to produce unfair results through unconscious bias.  When the score depends upon the graders' individual preferences, then the result an individual student receives depends upon who grades the test.  Standardized tests also remove teacher bias in assessment. Research shows that teachers create a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy in their assessment of students, granting those they anticipate will achieve with higher scores and giving those who they expect to fail lower grades. [29]

Student #1: WWII was caused by Hitler and Germany invading Poland.
Teacher #1: This answer mentions one of the required items, so it is correct.
Teacher #2: This answer is correct.
Teacher #1: I feel like this answer is good enough, so I'll mark it correct.
Teacher #2: This answer is correct, but this good student should be able to do better than that, so I'll only give partial credit.
Student #2: WWII was caused by multiple factors, including the Great Depression and the general economic situation, the rise of national socialism, fascism, and imperialist expansionism, and unresolved resentments related to WWI.  The war in Europe began with the German invasion of Poland.
Teacher #1: This answer mentions one of the required items, so it is correct.
Teacher #2: This answer is correct.
Teacher #1: I feel like this answer is correct and complete, so I'll give full credit.
Teacher #2: This answer is correct, so I'll give full points.
Student #3: WWII was caused by the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.
Teacher #1: This answer does not mention any of the required items. No points.
Teacher #2: This answer is wrong. No credit.
Teacher #1: This answer is wrong.  No points.
Teacher #2: This answer is wrong, but this student tried hard and the sentence is grammatically correct, so I'll give one point for effort.
Using scores for comparisons[edit]
There are two types of standardized test score interpretations:  a norm-referenced score interpretation or a criterion-referenced score interpretation.
Norm-referenced score interpretations compare test-takers to a sample of peers.  The goal is to rank students as being better or worse than other students.  Norm-referenced test score interpretations are associated with traditional education.  Students who perform better than others pass the test, and students who perform worse than others fail the test.
Criterion-referenced score interpretations compare test-takers to a criterion (a formal definition of content), regardless of the scores of other examinees.  These may also be described as standards-based assessments, as they are aligned with the standards-based education reform movement. [30] Criterion-referenced score interpretations are concerned solely with whether or not this particular student's answer is correct and complete.  Under criterion-referenced systems, it is possible for all students to pass the test, or for all students to fail the test.
Either of these systems can be used in standardized testing.  What is important to standardized testing is whether all students are asked equivalent questions, under equivalent circumstances, and graded equally.  In a standardized test, if a given answer is correct for one student, it is correct for all students.  Graders do not accept an answer as good enough for one student but reject the same answer as inadequate for another student.
The term normative assessment refers to the process of comparing one test-taker to his or her peers. A norm-referenced test (NRT) is a type of test, assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A criterion-referenced test (CRT) is a style of test which uses test scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers are criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student can answer the questions correctly.  The teacher is not usually trying to compare each student's result against other students.
This makes standardized tests useful for admissions purposes in higher education, where a school is trying to compare students from across the nation or across the world. Examples of such international benchmark tests include the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS ). Performance on these exams have been speculated to change based on the way standards like the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) line up with top countries across the world.
Because the results can be compared across dissimilar schools, the results of a national standardized test can be used to determine what areas need to be improved. Tests that are taken by everyone can help the government determine which schools and which students are struggling the most. [31] With this information, they can implement solutions to fix the issue, allowing students to learn and grow in an academic environment. [31]
Standards[edit]
The considerations of validity and reliability typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the quality of any standardized test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing standards and making overall judgments about the quality of any standardized test as a whole within a given context.
Evaluation standards[edit]
In the field of evaluation, and in particular educational evaluation, the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation [32] has published three sets of standards for evaluations. The Personnel Evaluation Standards [33] was published in 1988, The Program Evaluation Standards (2nd edition) [34] was published in 1994, and The Student Evaluation Standards [35] was published in 2003.
Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic. The tests are aimed at ensuring that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance, however; standardized tests offer narrow information on many forms of intelligence and relying on them harms students because they inaccurately measure a student's potential for success. [36]
Testing standards[edit]
In the field of psychometrics, the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing [37] place standards about validity and reliability, along with errors of measurement and issues related to the accommodation of individuals with disabilities.  The third and final major topic covers standards related to testing applications, credentialing, plus testing in program evaluation and public policy .
Statistical validity[edit]
One of the main advantages of standardized testing is that the results can be empirically documented; therefore, the test scores can be shown to have a relative degree of validity and reliability, as well as results which are generalizable and replicable. [38] This is often contrasted with grades on a school transcript, which are assigned by individual teachers.  It may be difficult to account for differences in educational culture across schools, difficulty of a given teacher's curriculum, differences in teaching style, and techniques and biases that affect grading.
Another advantage is aggregation. A well designed standardized test provides an assessment of an individual's mastery of a domain of knowledge or skill which at some level of aggregation will provide useful information. That is, while individual assessments may not be accurate enough for practical purposes, the mean scores of classes, schools, branches of a company, or other groups may well provide useful information because of the reduction of error accomplished by increasing the sample size.
Test takers[edit]
There is criticism from students themselves that tests, while standardized, are unfair to the individual student. Some students are "bad test takers", meaning they get nervous and unfocused on tests. Therefore, while the test is standard and should provide fair results, the test takers are at a disadvantage, but have no way to prove their knowledge otherwise, as there is no other testing alternative that allows students to prove their knowledge and problem-solving skills.
Some students have test anxiety. Test anxiety applies to standardized tests as well, where students who may not have test anxiety regularly feel immense pressure to perform when the stakes are so high. High-stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.
Annual standardized tests at school[edit]
Standardized testing is a very common way of determining a student's past academic achievement and future potential.  However, high-stakes tests (whether standardized or non-standardized) can cause anxiety.  When teachers or schools are rewarded for better performance on tests, then those rewards encourage teachers to "teach to the test" instead of providing a rich and broad curriculum. In 2007 a qualitative study done by Au Wayne demonstrated that standardized testing narrows the curriculum and encourages teacher-centered instruction instead of student-centered learning.[39]
The validity, quality, or use of tests, particularly annual standardized tests common in education have continued to be widely both supported or criticized. Like the tests themselves, supports and criticisms of tests are often varied and may come from a variety of sources such as parents, test takers, instructors, business groups, universities, or governmental watchdogs.
Supporters of large-scale standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for promoting testing in education:
Feedback or diagnosis of test taker's performance [40]
Fair and efficient [41]
Promotes accountability [40] [41]
Prediction and selection [40]
Improves performance [40]
Critics of standardized tests in education often provide the following reasons for revising or removing standardized tests in education:
Narrows curricular format and encourages teaching to the test.[42]
Poor predictive quality. [43] [44]
Grade inflation of test scores or grades. [45] [46] [47]
Culturally or socioeconomically biased. [48] [49]
Psychologically damaging. [50]
Poor indicator of intelligence or ability. [51] [52] [53] [54]
Effects on schools[edit]
A past standardized testing paper using multiple choice questions and answering them in the form as shown above.
Standardized testing is used as a public policy strategy to establish stronger accountability measures for public education.  While the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) has served as an educational barometer for some thirty years by administering standardized tests on a regular basis to random schools throughout the United States, efforts over the last decade at the state and federal levels have mandated annual standardized test administration for all public schools across the country. [55]
The idea behind the standardized testing policy movement is that testing is the first step to improving schools, teaching practice, and educational methods through data collection.  Proponents argue that the data generated by the standardized tests act like a report card for the community, demonstrating how well local schools are performing.  Critics of the movement, however, point to various discrepancies that result from current state standardized testing practices, including problems with test validity and reliability and false correlations (see Simpson's paradox ).
Along with administering and scoring the actual tests, in some cases the teachers are being scored on how well their own students perform on the tests. Teachers are under pressure to continuously raise scores to prove they are worthy of keeping their jobs. This approach has been criticized because there are so many external factors, such as domestic violence, hunger, and homelessness among students, that affect how well students perform. [36]
Performance-based pay is the idea that teachers should be paid more if the students perform well on the tests, and less if they perform poorly. [56] New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to "teach to the test," but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform called for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains. [57]
Schools that score poorly wind up being slated for closure or downsizing, which gives direct influence on the administration to result to dangerous tactics such as intimidation, cheating and drilling of information to raise scores. [56]
Uncritical use of standardized test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence.[58] The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed to cope with this criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors. [59][self-published source] In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status.  The difference between the student's expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher's efforts.
Affecting what is taught to students[edit]
Offers guidance to teachers. Standardized tests will allow teachers to see how their students are performing compared to others in the country. This will help them revise their teaching methods if necessary to help their students meet the standards. [31]
Allows students to see own progress. Students will be given the opportunity to reflect on their scores and see where their strengths as well as weaknesses are. [31]
Provide parents information about their child. The scores can allow parents to get an idea about how their child is doing academically compared to everyone else of the same age in the nation. [60]
Critics also charge that standardized tests encourage "teaching to the test" at the expense of creativity and in-depth coverage of subjects not on the test. Multiple choice tests are criticized for failing to assess skills such as writing. Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance. Ethical and economical questions arise for teachers when faced with clearly underperforming or underskilled students and a standardized test.
Critics contend that overuse and misuse of these tests harms teaching and learning by narrowing the curriculum. According to the group FairTest, when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and this can lead to the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests. [61]
Critics say that teaching to the test disfavors higher-order learning; it transforms what the teachers are allowed to be teaching and heavily limits the amount of other information students learn throughout the years. [56] While it is possible to use a standardized test without letting its contents determine curriculum and instruction, frequently, what is not tested is not taught, and how the subject is tested often becomes a model for how to teach the subject.
Critics also object to the type of material that is typically tested by schools.  Although standardized tests for non-academic attributes such as the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking exist, schools rarely give standardized tests to measure initiative, creativity, imagination, curiosity, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. [62] Instead, the tests given by schools tend to focus less on moral or character development, and more on individual identifiable academic skills.
In her book, Now You See It, Cathy Davidson criticizes standardized tests. She describes our youth as "assembly line kids on an assembly line model," meaning the use of the standardized test as a part of a one-size-fits-all educational model. She also criticizes the narrowness of skills being tested and labeling children without these skills as failures or as students with disabilities. [63] Widespread and organized cheating has been a growing culture. [64]
Education theorist Bill Ayers has commented on the limitations of the standardized test, writing that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning." [65] In his book, The Shame of the Nation,Jonathan Kozol argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of "cognitive decapitation". Kozol comes to this realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests. [66]
There are three metrics by which the best performing countries in the TIMMS (the "A+ countries") are measured: focus, coherence, and rigor. Focus is defined as the number of topics covered in each grade; the idea is that the fewer topics covered in each grade, the more focus can be given to each topic. The definition of coherence is adhering to a sequence of topics covered that follows the natural progression or logical structure of mathematics. The CCSSM was compared to both the current state standards and the A+ country standards. With the most topics covered on average, the current state standards had the lowest focus. [67] The Common Core Standards aim to fix this discrepancy by helping educators focus on what students need to learn instead of becoming distracted by extraneous topics. They encourage educational materials to go from covering a vast array of topics in a shallow manner to a few topics in much more depth. [68]
Time and money[edit]
Standardized tests are a way to measure the education level of students and schools on a broad scale. From Kindergarten to 12th grade, most American students participate in annual standardized tests.  The average student takes about 10 of these tests per year (e.g., one or two reading comprehension tests, one or two math tests, a writing test, a science test, etc.). [69] The average amount of testing takes about 2.3% of total class time (equal to about four school days per year). [70]
Standardized tests are expensive to administer. It has been reported that the United States spends about US$1.7 billion annually on these tests. [71] In 2001, it was also reported that only three companies (Harcourt Educational Measurement, CTB McGraw-Hill and Riverside Publishing) design 96% of the tests taken at the state level. [72]

Heavy reliance on high-stakes standardized tests for decision-making is often controversial.  Critics often propose emphasizing cumulative or even non-numerical measures, such as classroom grades or brief individual assessments (written in prose) from teachers.  Supporters argue that test scores provide a clear-cut, objective standard that serves as a valuable check on grade inflation.[73]
The National Academy of Sciences recommends that major educational decisions not be based solely on a single test score. [74] The use of minimum cut-scores for entrance or graduation does not imply a single standard, since test scores are nearly always combined with other minimal criteria such as number of credits, prerequisite courses, attendance, etc.  Test scores are often perceived as the "sole criteria" simply because they are the most difficult, or the fulfillment of other criteria is automatically assumed.  One exception to this rule is the GED, which has allowed many people to have their skills recognized even though they did not meet traditional criteria.[citation needed]
Some teachers would argue that a single standardized test only measures a student's current knowledge and it does not reflect the students progress from the beginning of the year. [75] A result created by individuals that are not a part of the student's regular instruction, but by professionals that determine what students should know at different ages. In addition, teachers agree that the best test creator and facilitator are themselves. They argue that they are the most aware of students abilities, capacities, and necessities which would allow them to take a longer on subjects or proceed on with the regular curriculum.
Effects on disadvantaged students[edit]
Monty Neill, the director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, claims that students who speak English as a second language, who have a disability, or who come from low-income families are disproportionately denied a diploma due to a test score, which is unfair and harmful. In the late 1970s when the graduation test began in the United States, for example, a lawsuit claimed that many Black students had not had a fair opportunity on the material they were tested on the graduation test because they had attended schools segregated by law. "The interaction of under-resourced schools and testing most powerfully hits students of color", as Neill argues, "They are disproportionately denied diplomas or grade promotion, and the schools they attend are the ones most likely to fare poorly on the tests and face sanctions such as restructuring." [76]
In the journal The Progressive, Barbara Miner explicates the drawbacks of standardized testing by analyzing three different books. As the co-director of the Center for Education at Rice University and a professor of education, Linda M. McNeil in her book Contradictions of School Reform: Educational Costs of Standardized Testing writes "Educational standardization harms teaching and learning and, over the long term, restratifies education by race and class." McNeil believes that test-based education reform places higher standards for students of color. According to Miner, McNeil "shows how test-based reform centralizes power in the hands of the corporate and political elite—a particularly frightening development during this time of increasing corporate and conservative influence over education reform." Such test-based reform has dumbed down learning, especially for students of color. [77]
FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate. [61]
Use of standardized tests in university admissions[edit]
Standardized tests are reviewed by universities as part of the application, along with other supporting evidence such as personal statements, GPA, and letters of recommendation. Nathan Kuncel, a scholar of higher education, noticed that in college admission, SAT, ACT, and other standardized tests "help overwhelmed admissions officers divide enormous numbers of applicants into pools for further assessment. High scores don't guarantee admission anywhere, and low scores don't rule it out, but schools take the tests seriously." [78]
Research shows that the tests predict more than just first-year grades and the level of courses a student is likely to take. The longitudinal research conducted by scientists shows that students with high test scores are more likely to take the challenging route through college. [79] Tests also can indicate the outcomes of students beyond college, including faculty evaluations, research accomplishments, degree attainment, performance on comprehensive exams and professional licensure. [80]
Since GPA has difference across schools and even for two students in the same school, the common measure provided by the test score is more useful.
However, in an April 1995 "meta-analysis" published in the Journal of Educational and Psychological Measurement, Todd Morrison and Melanie Morrison examined two dozen validity studies of the test required to get into just about any Masters or PhD program in America: the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). This study encompassed more than 5,000 test-takers over the past 30 years. The authors found that GRE scores accounted for just 6 percent of the variation in grades in graduate school. The GRE appears to be "virtually useless from a prediction standpoint," wrote the authors. Repeated studies of the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) find the same.
There is debate whether the test will indicate the long-term success in work and life since there are many other factors, but fundamental skills such as reading, writing, and math are related to job performance.
A longitudinal research in 2007 has demonstrated that major life accomplishments, such as publishing a novel or patenting technology, are also associated with test scores, even after taking into account educational opportunities. There is even a sizable body of evidence that these skills are related to effective leadership and creative achievements at work. Being able to read texts and make sense of them and having strong quantitative reasoning are crucial in the modern information economy.[80]
Many arguments suggest that skills from tests are useful—but only up to a point.
However, a remarkable longitudinal study published in 2008 in the journal Psychological Science examined students who scored in the top 1% at the age of 13. Twenty years later, they were, on average, very highly accomplished, with high incomes, major awards and career accomplishments that would make any parent proud. [81]
Admissions officers rely on a combination of application materials, including letters of recommendation, interviews, student essays, GPA, tests, and personal statements to evaluate the student comprehensively. However, most of these tools are not guarantee of future success. Problems with traditional interviews and letters of recommendation are so pervasive that many schools are looking for better options. [82]
There is a correlation between test scores and social class, but success on standardized tests and in college is not simply dependent on class. The studies show that "the tests were valid even when controlling for socioeconomic class. Regardless of their family background, students with good tests scores and high-school grades do better in college than students with lower scores and weaker transcripts." [83]
Another criticism relating to social class and standardized testing is that only wealthy people receive test preparation and coaching. However, "Researchers have conducted a mix of experimental studies and controlled field studies to test this question. They have generally concluded that the gains due to test prep are more on the order of 5 to 20 points and not the 100 to 200 points claimed by some test prep companies." [84]
More importantly, many people hold the opinion that tests prevent diversity in admissions since minorities have lower scores in tests compared to other represented groups. [85] A 2012 study looked at schools where admissions tests are optional for applicants and compared them to schools that use the tests, and the result shows that "recent research demonstrates that testing-optional schools have been enrolling increasingly diverse student bodies. But the same is true of schools that require testing." [86]
Opponents claim that standardized tests are misused and uncritical judgments of intelligence and performance, but supporters argue that these aren't negatives of standardized tests, but criticisms of poorly designed testing regimes. They argue that testing should and does focus educational resources on the most important aspects of education — imparting a pre-defined set of knowledge and skills — and that other aspects are either less important, or should be added to the testing scheme.
Evidence shows that black and Hispanic students score lower than whites and Asians on average. Therefore, the math and reading standard tests such as SAT have faced escalating attacks from progressives. However, an exhaustive UC faculty senate report, commissioned by Ms. Napolitano and released in 2020, found the tests are not discriminatory and play an important role in protecting educational quality. [87]
The report suggested that worsening grade inflation, especially at wealthy high schools, makes a standard assessment especially important. [87]
Regarding UC schools' intention in dropping standard tests such as the SAT and ACT in college admissions, subjective and customized tests like essays and extra-curriculars can be easily tailored and detrimental to the students who are not familiar with the process. Admissions without testing may be even more tilted in favor of the well-connected. [88]
In January 2020, the faculty senate at the University of California recommended that the UC system keep standardized tests as admissions requirements. [87] The report says standardized math and reading tests are useful for predicting college performance. Based on data from the students in the UC system, the report concludes that "test scores are currently better predictors of first-year GPA than high school grade point average." [87] The report continues: scores are also good at predicting total college GPA and the possibility a student will graduate. While the "predictive power of test scores has gone up," the report adds, "the predictive power of high school grades has gone down." [87]
Test scores enable UC schools "to select those students from underrepresented groups who are more likely to earn higher grades and to graduate on time." [87] "The original intent of the SAT was to identify students who came from outside relatively privileged circles who might have the potential to succeed in university," the report says. [87] The SAT's maker, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), now claims the SAT is not an "aptitude" test but rather an assessment of "developed abilities". [89]
Testing for students of color, those with disabilities, and those from low-income communities in the United States[edit]
Controversy[edit]
Standardized testing and the requirement of such tests for college admissions is a controversial topic. The reason for the controversy is that these tests can create unequal opportunities for students based on their economic status, race, or even ability status. It is common for students of color, those with disabilities, and those from low-income communities to have low student performance rates. This is most likely due to "generations of exclusionary housing, education, and economic policy". [90] These achievement gaps aren't a new concept. In 1991, the gap between the average scores of white students and those of black students was .91 standard deviations, while in 2020, the gap had decreased to .79 standard deviations. [90]
Cost of Taking The Tests[edit]
Standardized testing can be costly for students, in both prep courses/tutors and in actually taking test. The ACT and SAT can cost $55-$70 and $52-$68 respectively. [91] Many students who can afford to end up taking the tests multiple time to see the best score [92] they can get, and will submit "super-scores" or a score consisting of their best scores from each section. Students from low-income communities cannot always afford to take the test multiple times.
Cost of Test Prep[edit]
Students in low-income communities often times do not have the same resources for test prep that their peers from more affluent backgrounds do. This discrepancy in resources available causes there to be a significant difference in the scores of students from different racial backgrounds. In an analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution found that 59% of white students and 80% of Asian test takers are deemed "college ready" [93] by the SAT standards in comparison to the under 25% of Black students and under 33% of Hispanic/Latino students who are deemed "college ready." While the College Board reports that socioeconomic factors do not directly impact a student's performance, it can indirectly impact it through the course of access to prep courses and better schooling, experiences that can heavily impact on test scores.
Students with Disabilities[edit]
When it comes to students with disabilities and special needs, these tests are not always an appropriate method to measure knowledge or readiness. For students with disabilities, it is not always realistic to expect them to sit at a desk for hours at a time and silently take a test. To refute that, students with disabilities can get accommodations, such as extra time to work on the tests. [94]

Lesson Summary
What Is Standardized Testing?
What is standardized testing? Standardized testing is meant to be an objective way of measuring what students know in order to gain data regarding ability or achievement. The tests are usually multiple choice, true-false, or written response (or a combination). The tests are taken by hand or on an electronic device. Standardized tests must be administered and scored in a consistent or standard manner across the board. The implications of standardized tests are far reaching, as the data is used to measure student achievement in comparison to others, and for college admission, to drive instruction, and to hold teachers accountable for their positions. Outside of the educational arena, standardized testing is also commonly used for employment and professional licensing purposes.
Standardized Test Definition
The standardized test definition is a form of testing that contains the same or common questions scored in the same manner in order to assess the performance of the test-takers. The administration and scoring of the test must be consistent in order to maintain the validity of the assessment. Test administrators must follow the instructions given by the testing company in a precise manner throughout the entire administration period. Scoring for the multiple choice and true-false tests is done by computer, matched by the correct version of the test. Written responses must be scored by a human, but in order to halt any subjectivity by the human scorer, a rubric is used. The basis of standardized testing is to be a legitimate, unbiased, and equitable method of assessing students strictly because the results that come from the test are meant to yield valid results.
Standardized tests are often a combination of multiple choice, true/false, and some form of written response.

What Do Standardized Tests Measure?
In general, standardized tests measure student performance. Performance measurement comes in many different facets, such as an accurate measurement of student learning comprehension, what students have the ability to learn, and student analytical skills.
Types of Standardized Testing in Schools
There are many types of standardized testing in schools. These include aptitude tests, college admissions tests, and achievement tests. Each of their purposes are discussed and explained in detail.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is standardized testing and why is it important?
Standardized testing is a way of measuring student ability in a fair and consistent manner. It is important because the results yield valuable information regarding student achievement and teacher and district accountability and serve as a basis for data-driven instruction.
What are some examples of standardized testing?
Some examples of standardized testing include aptitude tests, college admissions tests, and achievement tests. A common aptitude test is the ASVAB. Commonly known college admissions tests are the ACT and SAT. State high-stakes education tests are achievement tests.
What do standardized tests actually test?
Standardized tests are used measure student performance. This is done by either testing a student's current knowledge or their propensity to learn.

Standardized tests are a form of assessment that is scored the same for each student, making a consistent benchmark for grade progression. See arguments for and against their use, learning the different types of tests and the limitations of each. Updated: 11/12/2021
What Are Standardized Tests?
Standardized tests are often referred to as assessments. An assessment is generally defined as the collection and analysis of information about one or more students. When tests are standardized, this means that a particular group of students will take the same test that will be scored and analyzed the same way. The Score result for each student is then compared to the rest of the group to see how well the students performed.
The federal law known as No Child Left Behind, or NCLB, was created so that schools were held accountable for what students learned throughout the school year. States were required to set goals and objectives for students starting in grade three and, at the end of the year, assess whether students met the required goals and objectives. These standardized, or high stakes, tests not only provide schools, districts, and states with information about student achievement (or lack of), the tests can also determine whether or not students are promoted to the next grade level. Additionally, teachers and/or schools with high numbers of students who do not perform well on the end-of-year tests could face negative consequences as a result.

Supporters
Standardized tests differ from teacher-made tests because they are not specific to any lesson or activity from the classroom. Instead, standardized tests provide more of a general overview of what students should know at a particular grade level. Those in favor of standardized tests argue that such testing holds teachers more accountable for what students should know and, when used with other assessments, should give a pretty accurate picture of student achievement. Since these types of tests are created by people who are not a part of the classroom setting, the results are considered more reliable in measuring student performance.
Opponents
Arguments made against standardized tests usually center around the enormous amount of weight placed on these tests. Many teachers become fearful of poor test results and spend more time teaching to the tests rather than focusing on quality lessons and grade-level curriculum. Furthermore, tests may contain biases that prevent certain groups of students from doing well due to differences in learning style, cultural diversity, language barriers, and low socioeconomic status.
Types of Tests
There are many types of assessments used in school systems in the United States. Let's take a look at a few of the most commonly used standardized tests.
Aptitude Tests
Aptitude tests measure what a student understands about a particular subject area. For example, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) measures student knowledge in the areas of reading, math, and essay. Scores on the SAT are used by colleges to make admission decisions. These typically show students' abilities to be successful in higher education settings.
Intelligence Tests
Typical intelligence tests are used to determine a student's mental ability. These tests can indicate whether a student's scores are high enough for the student to be placed in a gifted and talented program or low enough to be referred for special education. These types of tests are generally administered by a psychologist or anyone else trained to give the test and interpret the results.

Standardized Test Definition
Standardized Test
LAST UPDATED: 11.12.15
A standardized test is any form of test that (1) requires all test takers to answer the same questions, or a selection of questions from common bank of questions, in the same way, and that (2) is scored in a “standard” or consistent manner, which makes it possible to compare the relative performance of individual students or groups of students. While different types of tests and assessments may be “standardized” in this way, the term is primarily associated with large-scale tests administered to large populations of students, such as a multiple-choice test given to all the eighth-grade public-school students in a particular state, for example.
In addition to the familiar multiple-choice format, standardized tests can include true-false questions, short-answer questions, essay questions, or a mix of question types. While standardized tests were traditionally presented on paper and completed using pencils, and many still are, they are increasingly being administered on computers connected to online programs (for a related discussion, see computer-adaptive test ). While standardized tests may come in a variety of forms, multiple-choice and true-false formats are widely used for large-scale testing situations because computers can score them quickly, consistently, and inexpensively. In contrast, open-ended essay questions need to be scored by humans using a common set of guidelines or rubrics to promote consistent evaluations from essay to essay—a less efficient and more time-intensive and costly option that is also considered to be more subjective. (Computerized systems designed to replace human scoring are currently being developed by a variety of companies; while these systems are still in their infancy, they are nevertheless becoming the object of growing national debate.)
While standardized tests are a major source of debate in the United States, many test experts and educators consider them to be a fair and objective method of assessing the academic achievement of students, mainly because the standardized format, coupled with computerized scoring, reduces the potential for favoritism, bias, or subjective evaluations. On the other hand, subjective human judgment enters into the testing process at various stages—e.g., in the selection and presentation of questions, or in the subject matter and phrasing of both questions and answers. Subjectivity also enters into the process when test developers set passing scores—a decision that can affect how many students pass or fail, or how many achieve a level of performance considered to be “ proficient .” For more detailed discussions of these issue, see measurement error, test accommodations , test bias and score inflation.
Standardized tests may be used for a wide variety of educational purposes. For example, they may be used to determine a young child’s readiness for kindergarten, identify students who need special-education services or specialized academic support, place students in different academic programs or course levels, or award diplomas and other educational certificates. The following are a few representative examples of the most common forms of standardized test:
Achievement tests are designed to measure the knowledge and skills students learned in school or to determine the academic progress they have made over a period of time. The tests may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a schools and teachers, or identify the appropriate academic placement for a student—i.e., what courses or programs may be deemed most suitable, or what forms of academic support they may need. Achievement tests are “backward-looking” in that they measure how well students have learned what they were expected to learn.
Aptitude tests attempt to predict a student’s ability to succeed in an intellectual or physical endeavor by, for example, evaluating mathematical ability, language proficiency, abstract reasoning, motor coordination, or musical talent. Aptitude tests are “forward-looking” in that they typically attempt to forecast or predict how well students will do in a future educational or career setting. Aptitude tests are often a source of debate, since many question their predictive accuracy and value.
College-admissions tests are used in the process of deciding which students will be admitted to a collegiate program. While there is a great deal of debate about the accuracy and utility of college-admissions tests, and many institutions of higher education no longer require applicants to take them, the tests are used as indicators of intellectual and academic potential, and some may consider them predictive of how well an applicant will do in postsecondary program.
International-comparison tests are administered periodically to representative samples of students in a number of countries, including the United States, for the purposes of monitoring achievement trends in individual countries and comparing educational performance across countries. A few widely used examples of international-comparison tests include the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).
Psychological tests, including IQ tests, are used to measure a person’s cognitive abilities and mental, emotional, developmental, and social characteristics. Trained professionals, such as school psychologists, typically administer the tests, which may require students to perform a series of tasks or solve a set of problems. Psychological tests are often used to identify students with learning disabilities or other special needs that would qualify them for specialized services.
Reform
Following a wide variety of state and federal laws, policies, and regulations aimed at improving school and teacher performance, standardized achievement tests have become an increasingly prominent part of public schooling in the United States. When focused on reforming schools and improving student achievement, standardized tests are used in a few primary ways:
To hold schools and educators accountable for educational results and student performance. In this case, test scores are used as a measure of effectiveness, and low scores may trigger a variety of consequences for schools and teachers. For a more detailed discussion see high-stakes test.
To evaluate whether students have learned what they are expected to learn, such as whether they have met state learning standards. In this case, test scores are seen as a representative indicator of student achievement.
To identify gaps in student learning and academic progress. In this case, test scores may be used, along with other information about students, to diagnose learning needs so that educators can provide appropriate services, instruction, or academic support.
To identify achievement gaps among different student groups, including students of color, students who are not proficient in English, students from low-income households, and students with physical or learning disabilities. In this case, exposing and highlighting achievement gaps may be seen as an essential first step in the effort to educate all students well, which can lead to greater public awareness and changes in educational policies and programs.
To determine whether educational policies are working as intended. In this case, elected officials and education policy makers may rely on standardized-test results to determine whether their laws and policies are working or not, or to compare educational performance from school to school or state to state. They may also use the results to persuade the public and other elected officials that their policies are in the best interest of children and society.
Debate
While debates about standardized testing are wide-ranging, nuanced, and sometimes emotionally charged, many debates tend to be focused on the ways in which the tests are used, and whether they present reliable or unreliable evaluations of student learning, rather than on whether standardized testing is inherently good or bad (although there is certainly debate on this topic as well). Most test developers and testing experts, for example, caution against using standardized-test scores as an exclusive measure of educational performance, although many would also contend that test scores can be a valuable indicator of performance if used appropriately and judiciously. Generally speaking, standardized testing is more likely to become an object of debate and controversy when test scores are used to make consequential decisions about educational policies, schools, teachers, and students. The tests are less likely to be contentious when they are used to diagnose learning needs and provide students with better services—although the line separating these two purposes is notoriously fuzzy in practice (thus, the ongoing debates).
While an exhaustive discussion of standardized-testing debates is beyond the scope of this resource, the following questions will illustrate a few of the major issues commonly discussed and debated in the United States:
Are numerical scores on a standardized test misleading indicators of student learning, since standardized tests can only evaluate a narrow range of achievement using inherently limited methods? Or do the scores provide accurate, objective, and useful evidence of school, teacher, or student performance? (Standardized tests don’t measure everything students are expected to learn in school. A test with 50 multiple-choice questions, for example, can’t possibly measure all the knowledge and skills a student was taught, or is expected to learn, in a particular subject area, which is one reason why some educators and experts caution against using standardized-test scores as the only indicator of educational performance and success.)
Are standardized tests fair to all students because every student takes the same test and is evaluated in the same way? Do the tests have inherent biases that may disadvantage certain groups, such as students of color, students who are unfamiliar with American cultural conventions, students who are not proficient in English, or students with disabilities that may affect their performance?
Is the use of standardized tests providing valuable information that educators and school leaders can use to improve instructional quality? Is the pervasive overuse of testing actually taking up valuable instructional time that could be better spent teaching students more content and skills?
Do the benefits of standardized testing—consistent data on school and student performance that can be used to inform efforts to improve schools and teaching—outweigh the costs—the money spent on developing the tests and analyzing the results, the instructional time teachers spend prepping students, or the time students spend taking the test?
Do math and reading test scores, for example, provide a full and accurate picture of school, teacher, and student performance? Do standardized tests focus too narrowly on a few academic subjects?
Does the narrow range of academic content evaluated by standardized tests cause teachers to focus too much on test preparation and a few academic subjects (a practice known as “teaching to the test”) at the expense of other worthwhile educational pursuits, such as art, music, health, physical education, or 21 st century skills, for example?
Do standardized tests, and the consequences attached to low scores, hold schools, educators, and students to higher standards and improve the quality of public education? Do the tests create conditions that undermine effective education, such as cheating, unhealthy forms of competition, or unjustly negative perceptions of public schooling?
Should some of the most important decisions in public education—such as whether to reduce or increase school funding or fire teachers and principals—be made entirely or primarily on the basis of test scores? Are standardized-test scores, which could potentially be misleading or inaccurate, too limited a measure to use as a basis for such consequential decisions?

Alright, so I've got this question: "Should standardized testing be abolished?" Hmm, that's a big one. I need to think carefully about this because there are a lot of different opinions out there. First off, I need to understand what standardized testing is and why it exists. Then, I can look into the pros and cons and see if abolishing it is a good idea.

Let me start by trying to define standardized testing. From what I know, standardized tests are designed to assess students' knowledge and skills in a uniform way. They're usually multiple-choice tests that are the same for everyone taking them, no matter where they're from or which school they attend. The idea is to have a fair and objective way to measure student performance across different regions and schools.

But I'm not entirely sure about the details, so maybe I should look that up. Let me try searching for "what is standardized testing" to get a clearer definition.
