As an AI assistant, I don't have personal feelings or opinions. However, I can provide you with some insights on who should be responsible for determining how team resources are used based on common practices in organizational management.

First, let's consider the role of a team leader or manager. They are often positioned to oversee the team's activities and ensure that resources are allocated effectively to meet goals and objectives. Team leaders have a broad view of the team's needs and priorities, which makes them well-suited to make decisions about resource allocation.

On the other hand, involving team members in the decision-making process can also be beneficial. This approach promotes transparency and accountability, as team members feel more invested in the outcomes when they have a say in how resources are used. Collaborative decision-making can lead to better solutions and higher morale within the team.

Another perspective is that resource allocation should be determined based on the specific type of resource. For example, financial resources might be managed by a finance department or a designated budget holder, while human resources could be managed by the team leader in consultation with HR.

Moreover, in some organizations, there might be cross-functional teams where resources are shared across different departments. In such cases, a higher-level manager or a resource allocation committee might be responsible for deciding how resources are distributed among various teams.

It's also important to consider the organizational culture and structure. In扁平化组织中，决策可能更加分散，团队成员有更多的自主权来决定资源的使用。而在层级分明的组织中，决策权可能更集中于高层管理者。

最后，无论由谁来决定资源的使用，重要的是确保决策过程是透明的、基于数据和事实的，并且能够适应变化的情况。定期审查和调整资源分配也是确保效率和效果的关键。

综上所述，责任主体可以是团队领导、团队成员集体、特定的管理部门或者跨部门的委员会，具体取决于组织的结构、文化以及资源的性质。
