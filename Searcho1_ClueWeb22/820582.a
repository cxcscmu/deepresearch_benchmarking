So I've been thinking about this question: "Should college be less expensive?" It's a big topic, and there are lots of different opinions out there. I want to approach this thoughtfully and see what arguments are for and against making college less expensive.

First off, I know that college tuition has been rising pretty steadily over the past few decades. A lot of people are struggling with student loan debt, and it's causing a lot of financial stress for graduates. So, intuitively, it seems like making college less expensive would be a good thing. It would help make higher education more accessible to people from all income levels, not just those who can afford high tuition rates.

But, on the other hand, I've heard that college is expensive for a reason. Education isn't cheap to provide. Universities have to pay faculty, maintain facilities, invest in research and technology, and offer a wide range of programs. If tuition is lowered, how will colleges cover these costs? Maybe they'll have to cut back on quality, which wouldn't be good for students.

Also, I've read about the concept of "ability to pay." Maybe tuition should be based on what families can afford. Some schools do have need-based financial aid, but maybe that system needs to be improved instead of making college less expensive for everyone.

Another angle is the value of a college degree. These days, a lot of jobs require a bachelor's degree, even for positions that maybe didn't in the past. So, college has become more of a necessity for career advancement. If that's the case, maybe society should find a way to make it more affordable to ensure that people have equal opportunities.

But then again, is college really for everyone? Some people might be better suited for vocational training or apprenticeships. Maybe instead of making college less expensive, we should invest more in alternative paths for education and career training.

I also think about the role of online education and community colleges. They often offer more affordable options for higher education. Maybe expanding access to these types of institutions could help make college more accessible without necessarily making traditional four-year degrees less expensive.

Furthermore, I've heard arguments that making college free or less expensive could lead to an oversupply of degrees, which might devalue them in the job market. If everyone has a college degree, maybe employers will start requiring higher degrees or more experience, which could perpetuate inequality in a different way.

On the other side, some countries have free or very low-cost college education, and their economies seem to be doing just fine. So, maybe it's possible to make college more affordable without sacrificing quality.

I should probably look into some data on this. What do studies say about the relationship between tuition costs and college accessibility? Are there any countries or states that have implemented policies to make college less expensive, and what were the outcomes?

Let me consider doing some research to get more concrete information.

Attending college has changed quite a lot throughout the years. When it first arose, it was only accessible to the wealthy, and it was unheard of for everyone else. Only a few decades ago a bachelor degree could almost guarantee a comfortable job, and it was another advantage to any resume. In our current times, many students struggle and are unable to go to college due to the rising price tag that is not showing any signs of slowing down. A college degree is what most employers look for now-a-days, making it more essential than ever before. Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult to attain one. College tuition and fees should be lowered because 1) student loan debt is crippling for college graduates, 2) lower tuition will increase the accessibility of education, and 3) regulated tuition would lead to a …show more content…
(Kantrowitz, Mark) In 2012 students who lived in Texas and attended TJC owed $11,308 in tuition in fees for student loans. (US News Education) That price has risen and in four short years it is now $16,307. That is five thousand dollars more than previously. Five thousand in only four years in mind boggling. If a student wanted to pay off that amount in ten years, it would be $167.36 a month, versus in 2012 it would have been $116.05. Many students and their families live paycheck to paycheck, and they do not have that money to spare each month. The increase in price will hurt more than it would help. Consequently, lower, regulated tuition will make college more accessible for those who are worse off. College should not just be limited to the wealthy. Senator Bernie Sanders once said, "Education should be a right, not a privilege. We need a revolution in the way that the United States funds higher education." (Sanders, Bernie. U.S. Capital rally.

For Poor Students, Getting Into College Is Harder Than It Seems

Many people believe a college education can help any hard working person.
But not everyone is able to attend a college or university. One common barrier is money.
The College Board collects information about colleges and universities across the United States. The organization recently investigated how much it costs Americans to attend a publicly-supported, four-year college in their home state. It found that the average cost for a single student for the 2016-2017 school year is $20,090.
Yet the U.S. higher education system does have other choices. There are two-year community colleges and private four-year universities. Also, students must consider what financial aid can do for them.
For example, after including federal financial aid, the College Board found that the average yearly cost of a four-year public college is $14,210.
However, this assistance still is not enough for some. The American Council on Education (ACE) studies issues related to higher education. A 2015 ACE report used Department of Commerce information to show a decrease in the number of low income students enrolling in college. These men and women have little money available to pay college costs or come from poor families.
The report showed the percentage of American college students considered to be low income went from 55.9 in 2008 to 45.5 in 2013. Yet the ACE reported that spending on all forms of financial aid increased by about $41 billion during that time.
The first in his family to attend college, student Michael Kramer poses for a photo at the University of California, Los Angeles campus.
So now, a group of 30 colleges and universities are taking action. They have all agreed to be part of the American Talent Initiative (ATI). Launched in December, the ATI is a project from a non-profit leadership organization called the Aspen Institute. It also receives support from the higher education research group Ithaka S+R.
Their goal? To increase the total number of low-income men and women studying at these 30 schools to 480,000 by the year 2025.
Josh Wyner is executive director of the Aspen Institute’s College Excellence Program. He says one of the reasons this goal is so important is because of the value diversity adds to education. Students from different races and cultures help each other see and understand the world differently, he says. But students from different income backgrounds also have knowledge to share.
And, Wyner notes, ensuring equal chances for everyone is an important part of the American identity.
"While there are schools … that have done really good work in this area, it remains the case that … there is still somewhat limited opportunity for students from lower income backgrounds ... So I think … If we believe in the American dream, which is that hard work should enable you to go as far as your talents can take you, we’ve got to do something about this."
Wyner admits this can be a problem. Any school wishing to join the program must have at least a high graduation rate. Seventy percent of the students must successfully complete their study program. But only 270 of the thousands of U.S. colleges and universities meet this requirement. And the 30 schools currently involved are all different. Some are large, public research colleges. Others are small private universities.
The problem also has several causes, Wyner adds. For example, one reason there are so few low-income students in college is a lack of recruiting. Wyner says schools not only need to find better ways of finding low and middle-income students with the ability to succeed. They also need to be better about letting these students know what financial aid is available.
Many of these students do not think any top college would want them to attend, let alone help them pay the cost, Wyner says.
However, simply providing financial aid is not as simple a solution as it might appear. While the largest amount of aid comes from the government, schools also provide their own.
Some of the aid schools provide comes from tuition dollars taken from students who have enough money to pay the full price. Financial help can also come from a college or university’s endowment. This is the money, shares of stock and other financial assets the school receives from donors. The money and other assets are then invested in the hope they will support the school for many years.
Governments do not tax endowments, and the school invests the money to make it last a long time. Most schools only spend small amounts from their endowments each year, hoping not to spend more than the return on their investments.
Senator Bernie Sanders, left, is joined by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, center, and Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York William C. Thompson, as he speaks about a proposal for free tuition at state colleges.
But a 2016 report from the research group Education Trust argues some colleges and universities have more than enough money to share. Andrew Nichols is director of higher education research for the group. He also helped write the report. It found that 138 U.S. colleges each had an endowment worth over $500 million. Also, the cost of about 4 out of every 5 of these schools is more than 60 percent of the average, yearly family income of low-income students.
Nichols argues that by increasing endowment spending, even in small amounts, large endowment schools could give more aid. Yet they often reject increased spending, he says, because a large endowment is a quality that makes them more desirable.
"I think the resistance really comes from a place of wanting to amass a great amount of wealth so that you can essentially … talk about how much endowment funds you have … And so by … continuing to amass more and more money, you, in some ways, come across as a more prestigious institution."
But Liz Clark says a school cannot spend its endowment money any way it likes. Clark is with the National Association of College and University Business Officers. She notes that donors often place legal restrictions on how money they leave to the endowment is spent.
"So in some cases donors may have restricted funds specifically to help low-income students. And in other cases, donors may have said, ‘I’d like my funds to be used to help support the library or, perhaps, the music department.’ And while it is extremely important for colleges and universities to build a … diverse student body … they need to have the faculty, the resources, and the educational offerings that make those institutions great. And it takes dollars to help make that happen."
Clark adds if schools give out more and more in financial aid each year, they will likely have little or no endowment money to use in the future. This means the school will be in trouble if it has any financial difficulties in the coming years.
However, there is some middle ground on this issue, says Catharine Hill. She served as president of Vassar College for 10 years before she joined Ithaka S+R in 2016. Hill notes the unequal educational experiences young people from different backgrounds have in the United States. A lot of aid is merit-based, meaning it goes to students performing at the highest level. This often goes to wealthier students, as they have had more educational resources.
Wyner, Nichols, and Hill agree that more aid should be need-based, or should simply go to the students with the greatest need. But Hill says even that is a complex solution.
"We want the talented low and middle-income kids, but their families now can’t afford to pay nearly as much relative to the high-income kids. And that means we have to allocate more money to need-based financial aid. That means we have less resources to spend on the things that help us attract those high-income kids. So we’re operating in a much more complicated environment today than schools were 40 years ago."
Hill offers one possible solution: schools can re-organize their spending. Vassar College did just this in 2007 when it decided to make cuts in repairs on buildings and other services in favor of need-based aid. The school then reported an increase in its number of low-income students by 9 percent in 8 years.
Also, as Andrew Nichols says, schools could ask for less restrictions on donations, as they used to do in the past. Otherwise, he adds, higher education is at risk of becoming another privilege of those with the most money.

Should Higher Education be Available to Everyone? | by Lauren Dixon | Medium

Should Higher Education be Available to Everyone?
With the cost of college only going up, those who can’t afford it are increasingly left behind. Should this change?
This article originally appeared on Talent Economy. To learn more and follow coverage, sign up.
The cost of higher education has skyrocketed in recent decades. According to the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, the average annual tuition cost at a four-year college or university in 2014–15 was $25,409. That compares to an average one-year tuition cost of $5,160 (in current dollars) during the 1983–84 school year.
The high cost of college tuition keeps many Americans — especially those from low-income families — away from traditional, four-year universities. Among the long-term effects of rising tuition costs is limited access to higher education, which ultimately leads to fewer skilled graduates for companies to recruit, said Sarita Brown, president of Excelencia in Education, a nonprofit research and policy organization for Latino students based in Washington, D.C.
“It is any country’s most precious resource,” Brown said. “Education is a means for that human capital to find the career path, the work settings to channel their energies.”
Nevertheless, the rising cost of education has opened up debate about the role it should play in society and who should have access to it. Is college a public good for everyone to have access to? Or should it be a private benefit for those who can afford it?

Brown advocates for the former. Because institutions of higher education funnel educated people into the talent pool, Brown said business leaders should invest more time and money into these schools. “Employers need employees. It is in their [employers] self-interest. An investment in evidence-based practices that do promote completion in terms of college education and successful entrance to the workforce is a very wise investment,” Brown said.
Others aren’t so keen on providing a college education to all. “College isn’t for everyone,” said Bob Luebke, senior policy analyst at Civitas Institute, a Raleigh, North Carolina-based think tank. “Not everyone should go. Now, I said, ‘college.’ I did not say, ‘further education.’ That’s an important distinction.”

www.talenteconomy.io
Luebke doesn’t see free college tuition as a panacea to solving America’s education and student debt woes, as some politicians have suggested. “It sounds good, but I think it’s a fundamental misdiagnosis of the problem,” Luebke said. “The whole assumption of that debate is that we would automatically perform better because more people would go to school, and we’d have more educated people, and it would be better for the economy.” Among people with federal student loans, the college completion rate is only 55 percent after six years, The New York Times reported in June 2016. Furthermore, the graduation rate among public universities is only 46 percent. Luebke pointed out that there are other options for postsecondary education, such as training schools, online education, apprenticeships and corporate training.
Karie Willyerd, head of global education at software firm SAP SuccessFactors, agreed that access to four-year programs isn’t the answer to our country’s education woes. “We think of the community colleges as a second-tier education,” Willyerd said. “I don’t think we should do that.” Rather than requiring an employee to go through a four-year program, an education at a community college could suffice, Willyerd said.
Should business leaders continue to prefer traditional universities, Willyerd suggests they get involved in their local institutions by being on boards, thus influencing spending from the inside.
The long-term impacts of preferring expensive education put a lot of pressure and responsibility on businesses. If the costs of higher education remain as they are now, Willyerd said that employees will come into the workforce with high amounts of debt, and they will exert wage pressures on companies. “We should be interested as businesses in terms of what that’s meaning to the cost of doing business,” Willyerd said. “We’re eventually paying for it, one way or the other.”
Additionally, the high cost of education will only limit the talent pool, despite employers’ demands for more highly trained workers, said Barbara Gault, vice president and executive director of Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., that focuses on issues related to women and the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity and income levels. And as more people fail to live up to their earning potential, that means smaller tax bases. “It will mean that we’ve lost out on the opportunity to promote future generations’ learning and success,” Gault said.

What is Inclusive Access?
Inclusive Access is a course material affordability program, designed by institutions and guided by the Department of Education to deliver digital learning resources to students, at a significantly reduced cost, on or before the first day of class. It offers students maximum choice in selecting the learning resources that are right for them, at the lowest market price, including the choice to “opt out.”

Why are institutions choosing Inclusive Access?
Millions saved
Inclusive Access has saved college students using McGraw Hill products an estimated $500 million dollars since 2018. That’s $500 million in three short years!
Students choose what’s best for them
Students have the freedom to choose whatever purchase option they feel works best for them. And all our Inclusive Access agreements include an "opt-out" option as required by U.S. Department of Education (DOE) regulations.
Student success is bolstered
by DOE guidelines
Research shows that students perform better when they have access to course materials on day one of class. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education issued federal guidance for institutions of higher learning to ensure course materials were financial aid eligible, and could be included in tuition and fees. This provides students the opportunity to have the critical learning resources necessary to be successful. The Inclusive Access program, with its goal of getting course materials into the hands of all students on day one, arose out of that guidance.

The Issues: College Affordability and Access
Education professor Stefani Relles on how paying for a college education is progressively harder, especially for low-income and minority students.
The rising cost of college tuition is burdening more students with debt. (Aaron Mayes/UNLV Photo Services)
From the Archives
Please note that this article is more than three years old and details may have changed since the publish date.
Nationally, the rising cost of college tuition is barring more and more low-income and minority students from the opportunity to earn a degree and saddling students who manage to pay for their educations with staggering amounts of student loan debt. Despite the U.S. government’s efforts to increase access and lessen debt loads — through expansion of the Pell Grant program, tax credits, and income-based loan repayment programs — the problem is worsening. The average student debt load has nearly tripled since 1992, and low-income students are less likely now to enroll in college immediately after high school than in 2008.
Our expert
Stefani Relles is an assistant professor in UNLV’s department of educational psychology and higher education. Her work focuses on college readiness and postsecondary remediation policy.
Stefani Relles
She conducts ethnographic research to explore the influence of higher education policies on college access, persistence, and degree completion for low-income and minority students. Relles, who began teaching at UNLV in fall 2013, earned her Ph.D. in urban education policy from the University of Southern California in 2013.
A few facts
At public and nonprofit colleges in 2014, seven in 10 graduating seniors had student loans at an average of $28,950, according to the Institute for College Access & Affordability. By comparison, UNLV students fared well in the study at an average $18,542.
The percentage of students from low-income families who enroll in college immediately after graduation from high school has declined from 56 percent in 2008 to 46 percent now.
The odds of earning a bachelor’s degree depend largely on economic class. Just 9 percent of students from the lowest income quartile graduate with a bachelor's degree by age 24, compared to 77 percent for the top income quartile.
UNLV’s Financial Aid office is disbursing more money every year, displaying rising student need. In the 2012-13 school year, the office disbursed $218 million in overall aid, $126 million of that in federal student loans. In 2014-15, aid totaled $232 million and $131 million in federal loans. The numbers so far for 2015-16 are identical, said Julie Askins, associate director for client services, so year-end totals likely will climb.
Why this matters
The idea that every American child has equal opportunity to a quality education is a myth.
“Higher education inherits the high school achievement gap,” Relles said. “The data show that educational achievement is skewed by income, linguistic background, gender and other factors. We know we do not provide equal educational opportunity.”
Why have colleges and universities raised tuition so much?
“We’re no longer paying through taxes what it takes to sustain higher educational institutions,” she said. “Knowledge is a public resource, like water and electricity. The money needs to come from somewhere. It would seem that higher education is something that people have lost the willingness to pay for through taxes.” In Nevada in particular, she said, the tax structure has left education more susceptible to economic hardships. “It’s a function of a state that’s decided not to pay income tax..”
What’s the draw of for-profit colleges and universities?
At public institutions, budgets for student recruitment and marketing are limited and sometimes seen as discretionary. “It’s much easier for for-profit universities to recruit students because they put money into recruitment … the for-profits are particularly good at wooing students.”
How do states solve this problem?
Low-income students’ preparedness for college depends largely on the quality of their K-12 school system, Relles said, so K-12 public education reform is a must. For low-income students to be able to afford college, federal and state government will have to expand and improve options targeting those students in particular. “So rethinking the way we give out money,” she said, “is an important piece of reforming the way these particular groups of students accumulate debt.”

Alright, so I've got some information here from these documents. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First, from Doc 1, which is a persuasive essay on college tuition, it seems that the main argument is that college tuition should be lowered because of the burden of student loan debt, the need for increased accessibility, and the potential for regulated tuition to lead to better societal outcomes. The essay mentions that in 2012, students owed $11,308 in tuition and fees, which rose to $16,307 by 2016, illustrating the rapid increase in costs.

Doc 2 is an article from Voice of America about how poor students face challenges in getting into college, despite efforts to provide financial aid. It highlights that even with increased financial aid, the number of low-income students enrolling in college has decreased. The American Talent Initiative is mentioned as a program aiming to increase the number of low-income students in top colleges.

Doc 3 is an opinion piece from Medium arguing whether higher education should be available to everyone. The author discusses the rising cost of tuition and its impact on access, particularly for low-income families. There's a debate presented: should higher education be a public good for everyone or a private benefit for those who can afford it? The author suggests that making higher education more accessible could benefit the economy and society as a whole.

Doc 4 appears to be promotional material from McGraw Hill about their Inclusive Access program, which is designed to make course materials more affordable for students by providing them at a reduced cost through inclusive access programs. It claims to save students money and improve student success by ensuring they have access to materials from day one.

Doc 5 is an article from UNLV about college affordability and access, discussing the rising cost of tuition and its impact on low-income and minority students. It provides statistics on student debt and enrollment rates, and it interviews Stefani Relles, an assistant professor at UNLV, who attributes the problem to a shift away from funding higher education through taxes and towards individual承担费用.

Okay, so synthesizing this information, it seems clear that college tuition has been increasing rapidly, making it harder for low-income students to afford higher education. This is leading to higher student debt loads and potentially limiting access to education for certain groups. There are initiatives like the American Talent Initiative and McGraw Hill's Inclusive Access program that are trying to address these issues, but it's a complex problem with no easy solutions.

Now, considering all this, should college be less expensive? Well, from a social equity perspective, making college more affordable could help level the playing field for students from lower-income backgrounds. It could also have economic benefits by increasing the number of skilled workers in the job market. However, there are also arguments that lowering tuition could strain college budgets, potentially leading to cuts in quality or programs.

Perhaps a better approach is to focus on making college more accessible through targeted financial aid, scholarships, and programs like Inclusive Access that reduce the cost of course materials. Additionally, investing in community colleges and other affordable education pathways could provide more options for students who might not be able to afford traditional four-year institutions.

Moreover, it's important to consider the root causes of rising tuition. As Doc 5 suggests, part of the issue is a shift away from public funding of higher education. If society values higher education as a public good, perhaps there should be more investment from taxes to make it more affordable for all.

In conclusion, while making college less expensive overall could be beneficial, it's crucial to consider the various stakeholders and the potential impacts on college funding and quality. A multifaceted approach that includes targeted financial aid, increased public investment, and cost-saving measures like inclusive access programs may be the most effective way to improve college affordability and access.

\boxed{\text{Yes, college should be made more affordable through a combination of targeted financial aid, increased public investment, and cost-saving measures to ensure equal access to higher education.}}
