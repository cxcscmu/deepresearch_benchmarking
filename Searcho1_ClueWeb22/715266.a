Alright, so I'm trying to figure out what causes resentment in marriages. Resentment seems like such a negative emotion, and it's probably really damaging to a relationship if it builds up over time. I guess the first thing I should do is try to understand what resentment actually is.

Resentment is basically a feeling of anger or bitterness towards someone because of something they've done or haven't done. In the context of marriage, it's likely that this feeling develops when one partner feels wronged or unfairly treated by the other. It's probably something that builds up over time, with small issues piling up until one partner just feels really frustrated and angry.

So, what are some common things that might cause one partner to feel this way? Let me think about typical marital issues. Communication problems probably top the list. If partners aren't communicating effectively, misunderstandings can occur, and feelings can get hurt. Maybe one partner feels like they're not being heard or that their concerns are being ignored.

Another thing could be unfair division of labor, whether it's household chores or responsibilities related to parenting. If one partner feels like they're carrying a bigger load without appreciation or support from the other, that could lead to resentment.

Financial issues are also a big stressor in marriages. Differences in spending habits, disagreements about money management, or feeling like one partner is not contributing equally to finances could all cause resentment.

Infidelity or even just emotional affairs could certainly lead to feelings of betrayal and resentment. Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship, and breaking that trust can have serious consequences.

Perhaps lack of intimacy or sexual dissatisfaction could also be a source of resentment. If one partner feels neglected or unfulfilled in that aspect of the relationship, it might lead to feelings of anger and bitterness.

I also wonder if differences in career or personal goals could cause resentment. For example, if one partner feels like their dreams are being sacrificed for the other's career, that might lead to resentment over time.

Additionally, family interference, such as overbearing in-laws or favoritism towards one's own family, could be a source of resentment in a marriage.

I think it's also possible that unresolved conflicts or a pattern of avoiding issues could lead to resentment. When problems are swept under the rug instead of being addressed, they don't go away; they just fester and grow.

Maybe expectations that aren't met could also cause resentment. If one partner had certain expectations about marriage that aren't being fulfilled, they might feel disappointed and resentful.

I should probably look into this a bit more deeply. Maybe there are studies or articles that discuss common causes of resentment in marriages. Let me see if I can find some reliable sources on this topic.

If you have had these questions or experienced resentment in your marriage, this article will equip you with everything you need to know.
What is resentment in marriage
Wikipedia defines resentment as a
“complex, multilayered emotion that has been described as a mixture of disappointment, disgust, anger, and fear.”
Simply put, resentment is deep-seated anger or indignation directed toward a person or situation as a result of being treated unfairly or badly.
Within the context of marriage, resentment in a marriage occurs when one or both spouses begin to feel or express deep-seated anger toward themselves as a result of internalized emotional battles they may be going through.
So, what causes resentment in a marriage? Usually, resentment comes up in the marriage because one or more people have emotions they may have bottled up, and they may feel that they have no power over these negative feelings they are experiencing.

Let’s learn what causes resentment in a marriage further in detail.
What causes resentment in a marriage
Considering the complicated nature of resentment in marriages, there are several reasons why resentment may spring up in a marriage. Usually, these are tiny and independent factors that have stretched out over a long time. Here are some of them.
1. One-sided feelings
One of the most common causes of a resentful spouse is one-sided feelings. When one person keeps making all the love gestures in the marriage while the other just keeps receiving (and making little or no efforts to return the love), presentment may begin to creep up in the heart of the other spouse.
2. Unfulfilled expectations
During the honeymoon stage of relationships, most spouses have high expectations of themselves. Some of these expectations can be unattainable by the other spouse at times.
The challenge with this is that when the novelty of the relationship wears away, and you begin to see that your spouse may not be able to live up to the high expectations you had for them, you may find yourself becoming that resentful spouse in the marriage.
3. Betrayal
If you have ever suffered the painful punch of betrayal in the relationship (from financial betrayal to sexual, and emotional betrayal), this could be a potent sponsor of resentment in marriage.
Betrayal usually turns to resentment if the act of betrayal and the results were left unattended or brushed under the carpet by both spouses.
4. Low performance
When one spouse consistently performs at a low level (with household responsibilities, social responsibilities, and other responsibilities), the other spouse who has to overcompensate for their lapses may find themselves slipping into resentment.
5. Feelings of being ignored
Every once in a while, you want your spouse to be there for you. Maybe, you’ve returned home after a long day at work, and you need someone to talk to. Or, you’ve changed your hairstyle (after spending hours at the hairstylist’s place), and you want your spouse to appreciate the new look.
What happens when your spouse is emotionally unavailable, leaving you feeling as though they are ignoring you?
Over time, feeling ignored by your spouse or partner can cause resentment in a marriage.
When one person constantly feels as though they need to put in a lot of work or swim across a sea full of piranhas to get their spouse to notice them, they may slip into their shell and begin to feel resentful instead.
6. Lack of adjustment
For any relationship to thrive, both partners must be willing to make adjustments and compromise on some things. If one person has to bend over backward to please the other (who does nothing to return the gesture), resentment can begin to build in the relationship.

7. Unsatisfied sexual desires
One of the important aspects of a marriage is the sex life of both spouses. Married people are supposed to find sexual fulfillment in their marriage and their spouses.
If, in your marriage, you start feeling as though your spouse no longer satisfies you sexually or leaves you hanging and sexually frustrated once they are satisfied, resentment toward your spouse may begin to creep in.
What are the signs of resentment
Not sure how resentment in marriage presents itself? Here are a few signs to look out for.
1. You always find faults with each other
One of the primary signs of resentment toward your spouse is that you always find faults in each other. At some point, it may begin to feel as though they aren’t good enough, and you’d always require something more from them. As a result, all their efforts will prove to be inefficient.

2. You begin to withhold intimacy with them
One of the major ingredients of a healthy relationship is intimacy. Intimacy is a result of trust and caring. These, however, will be jeopardized if resentment begins to spring up in the marriage.
When you resent your spouse, you would find yourself beginning to pull away from them.
This includes trying to shorten the time you spend with them, coming to bed later than usual (even when you have no apparent reason for doing so), and skipping anything that requires you to spend time with them.
Whenever you find yourself pulling back from your spouse, it may be that you are dealing with resentment in marriage.
3. You are emotionally detached from the relationship
Take stock of the things that used to excite you before now. Do they still excite you when you do them with your spouse? If the answer is negative, it may be that you need to start figuring out how to fix resentment in a marriage.
The dangerous thing about this is that it rarely happens immediately. It usually happens over time and can be difficult to spot as a result.
4. At some point, you begin to feel hopeless in the relationship
This could be the result of the fact that you feel as though talking to your partner about the deep-seated emotions you are feeling will yield little or no results.
If left unattended, this feeling of hopelessness will begin to drive you away from your spouse, and as a result, the relationship/marriage may begin to decline.
Wanting out
This is probably the apex of resentment in marriage. When things get to a point where either yourself or your spouse would rather end things than try to keep the marriage/relationship alive and work things out, it could be because resentment has taken its toll on the relationship.
6. You quarrel over the same issue multiple times
This is usually because either of you isn’t listening or because your feelings are beginning to get into the way of rational and effective communication.
If you find yourselves quarreling over the same issue multiple times, you may want to take stock of the marriage and determine if either of you has become a resentful spouse.
7. Unhealthy comparison
“Can’t you just be more like…?”
This statement can sometimes be another expression of resentment in a marriage. When you start comparing your partner or relationship to another person, scenario, or circumstance, it is usually because there is something about that person that you want them to adopt.
Resentment may creep in if, after a while, you discover that your partner or relationship cannot fit that mold you have created in your mind.
Unhealthy comparisons will ultimately leave you resentful and bitter, especially in your marriage.
8. You have increased difficulties with letting go
“To err is human, but to forgive is divine,” right?
This statement holds until resentment in marriage begins to set in. When you begin to resent your spouse, letting go of their past hurts, and mistakes become a huge problem. You hold onto their mistakes and wave them in their faces with every opportunity that presents itself.
The result of this is that your spouse may begin to put up a front as well. If this doesn’t get any special attention from you, you may end up with a marriage that has been tossed to the winds.

Can resentment destroy a marriage
It is not enough to know what resentment is and how it presents itself in marriage. Knowing if resentment can destroy a marriage and proven strategies for healing resentment are vital as well.
So, can resentment destroy a marriage?
The simple answer is “yes.” If unattended, resentment can kill the feelings of love you have for your partner, and it is only a matter of time until the reins that we’re holding your marriage in place begin to unravel.
If allowed to run its full course, resentment and bitterness can turn the sweetest people into insufferable humans who find it impossible to interact with and build meaningful relationships with others.
The good thing is that you do not need to permit resentment to ruin your marriage. There are proven strategies that can help you to nip this plague in the bud and do so quickly.
Tips to prevent resentment from destroying your marriage
Resentment can destroy marriages, yes.
However, this doesn’t have to be the case for you. If you or your spouse have been bitter/resentful toward yourselves, here are some proven tips to prevent resentment from destroying your marriage .
How to cope with resentment in marriage
After figuring out what causes resentment in marriage and determining whether yours is plagued by resentment, you need to take active steps to cope with resentment in your marriage.
Here are a few ways to cope with resentment issues in your marriage.
1. Acknowledge your feelings
The first step toward coping with resentment in marriage and even dealing with it is to acknowledge the presence of those emotions in your heart. It is impossible to rectify anything you haven’t yet admitted to yourself is present.
2. If possible, pinpoint why you feel that way
Early on, we discussed how resentment is an interplay of multiple emotions accumulated over time. One of the strategies for overcoming resentment in marriage is to identify (in clear terms) the reason why you feel the way you do.
Is there something your spouse did that hurt you? Is it how they treat you? It is vital to identify these in clear terms.
3. Communicate
Communication is a powerful tool for dealing with resentment in marriage. When you have identified the reason for the resentment, take out some time to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with your spouse.
Let them in on everything that is going on with you and as much as possible, don’t keep anything back from them.
4. Remind yourself why you shouldn’t hold a grudge
Sometimes, it may feel as though you’re indulging yourself when you do this, but you need to remind yourself of the reasons why you mustn’t hold grudges in your marriage. Also, think about the health implications of grudge-keeping as you make this list.
5. Have empathy
When you start communicating with your spouse, be open to listening to them and understand their perspectives on relevant issues. When you bring up a scenario, allow them to talk and try to see things from their perspective. With empathy, it is easier to kick resentment away from your marriage.

6. Seek professional help
Sometimes, it is impossible to completely let go of resentment on your own. At this point, you would need the help of experts. Here’s how to figure this out.
When to get professional help for resentment in marriage
If you have tried all the steps outlined in the last section of this article and you still find it difficult to let go of your spouse (even after they have understood their flaws and apologized to you), you may need to enlist the help of professional marriage counselors to help you.
Seeking the help of a counselor or therapist doesn’t mean you are broken or mentally unstable. Just think of it as the price you may have to pay for the health of your marriage.
Notwithstanding where you are in America, you can easily access a qualified marriage counselor by finding a therapist .

What Causes Resentment In A Marriage (Plus How To Heal Yours)
Jul 31 2020
MARRIAGE IN CRISIS
What Causes Resentment In A Marriage (Plus How You Can Heal Resentment In Yours)
You may ask yourself, “What causes resentment?” or “Why am I feeling resentful?”.  No one likes to be taken for granted, feel unappreciated or devalued, but if your partner does something that causes you to feel that way,  you may feel resentful.
You expect that your spouse will cherish and care for you, but when you find instead you are unintentionally or intentionally taken for granted this can lead to many negative emotions.
You might start out feeling disappointed, frustrated or hurt that you are not being thought of or cared for.  Over time this quickly can turn into anger and resentment.
Many times people know they are upset at their partner, but they do not see how their feelings are impacting the relationship. Here’s a list of the most common signs you should look for:
12 Signs You Feel Resentful:
You feel your partner is being dismissive or not listening to you.
You think about the situation constantly throughout the day.
Fighting becomes more frequent and intense and over smaller issues.
You avoid being with your partner or talking about anything meaningful.
You feel helpless, hopeless, indifferent and/or sad about the relationship.
You refuse or withhold sex or intimacy as a bargaining tool.
You are having difficulty letting go of what happened with your partner.
You discuss only facts or logistics (take out the trash).
Your sentences are brief and short (yes/no answers or I don’t know).
You do not use romantic or loving language.
No physical signs of affection, such as a hug, snuggle or hand-holding.
You do not look at your partner or you avoid eye contact.
Can Your Marriage Survive Resentment?
If couples figure out a way to talk about their perspective, feel listened to, and changes are made in the relationship, the couple will have a greater likelihood to make their relationship work. On the other hand, if they can not find a way to navigate and discuss their feelings and issues, they should seek counseling to address their feelings.
Depending on how long a couple has felt resentful will determine and impact whether or not the relationship can survive. When couples address these issues before resentment builds to a devastating level of hurt, pain and anger, then the marriage can be saved, and even improve.
How Can I Stop Feeling Resentful?
If you are someone who likes to avoid issues and not address how you feel, then resentment will boil up inside of you unless you take care of the situation. As difficult as it is to talk about the conflicts, resentment does not disappear or go away on its own.
The most effective method to stop what causes resentment is to be aware of the resentment, discuss the issue with your partner and work to resolve it.
Steps To Stop Feeling Resentment
Couples can stop feeling resentful when they begin to have an open conversation with their spouse about what causes resentment. They need to state that they are feeling resentful, discuss what has caused that feeling, and give suggestions about how to change these situations. Usually, if one partner is feeling resentful, the other partner is feeling resentful too.
If your spouse does not want to change or denies feeling resentful, then you can continue working on the steps by yourself.
Ideally, if you as a  couple can press the “replay button” and decide to restart the relationship, then you can truly create a new beginning. You may only be able to restart the relationship though if you both apologize and ask for forgiveness for what’s happened in the past.
Next, in order to resolve not to repeat this pattern of building resentment,  you need to recognize the situations that cause resentment. You will need to make a conscious decision to be aware of those situations and signs in your relationship.
Couples can make their own list of signs of what causes resentment and daily or weekly review the list to see whether or not signs have appeared. If so, then the couple (or individual) will move to the next step. If not, then continue to check your list for the next month or two to ensure resentment has not begun again.
Finally, if resentment starts to occur again, couples need to apologize to each other for what happened and make a plan on how it won’t happen again.
Your Relationship Can Thrive After Resentment
Resentment in a marriage increases when a partner feels unappreciated, uncared for and neglected. When couples ignore their feelings of resentment, problems build up and need to be fixed.
Your marriage can survive when you recognize what causes resentment and follow the steps to stop this pattern. When you take care of your partner and your partner takes care of you this bond will allow for your relationships to thrive.

The Root of All Causes of Divorce: Resentment - Divorced Girl Smiling

The Root of All Causes of Divorce: Resentment
By Jackie Pilossoph, Creator and Editor-in-chief, Divorced Girl Smiling site, podcast and app, Love Essentially columnist and author
There are so many different causes of divorce, and every divorce story is unique. Here are a few common causes of divorce: Cheating, excessive arguing, substance abuse, lack of sex, growing apart, physical abuse, verbal abuse, growing apart.
While all of these reasons are valid and very very significant, I believe that all causes of divorce are symptoms of a much larger “root.” What is that root?
Resentment.
Every single couple on earth, from the happiest to the most miserable has some resentment. It starts the day we meet our spouse and continues through until the day one of the people dies (maybe even after-the person who is living can still carry resentment, even if the spouse is no longer living.)
Resentment is impossible not to have, if you think about it. Little things about our spouses bug us, (that’s normal) and cause some negative feelings, and if we addressed every single thing to that person, it might be a long list, no matter how much we love the person.
But there’s a big difference between little things that bother us, (things we can live with and things that really aren’t a big deal to us,) and things that might affect our relationship long-term and end up being one of the causes of divorce.
The best way to really talk about resentment as one of the causes of divorce is to give examples.
Let’s say you and your spouse have a five month old, and you, as the woman have been changing the baby’s diapers and waking up with the baby for midnight feedings the entire time. Your spouse has never offered to get up with the baby. You are beyond exhausted. Every time you get back into bed after a late night feeding, you see your husband sleeping peacefully and you resent that. But, that’s just the way it’s always been, and he is the one working, so you say nothing.
Five years later, you still resent it. In fact, you will resent that your entire life. Does that mean you will end up divorced? Not at all. It’s just a fact that you will hold a little bit of resentment about that forever. Even if you go to marriage therapy and bring it up, that helps, but it’s still there and probably always will be. People have a hard time forgetting.
Another example of resentment: Let’s say you’ve been married for 10 years and all of a sudden, your husband starts making new friends and acting single and wants to go out all the time. He suddenly starts drinking more than he used to, and stays out really late. He swears he isn’t cheating, but more and more, you find yourself home alone on Saturday nights.
Six months later, he gets tired of going out and drinking, and stops. But, you have resentment for the past. And again, bringing it out in therapy might help, but therapy can’t erase history. What therapy does is, teaches a couple how to communicate better and meet each other’s needs so that they can stay together and live happier together.
One last example. Let’s say a spouse cheated. He told his wife about it, was deeply regretful, and begged her forgiveness. The two went to therapy and did some work on the marriage and ended up staying together. But still, she harbored resentment.
Here’s the point.
How you choose to handle your resentment could be the difference between whether or not you get divorced.
I think that when people feel resentment, they can act out in several different ways:
1. Cheating
2. Drugs or alcohol use to numb their resentment
3. Acting blatantly angry and rude to their spouse
4. Passive aggressive behavior: sugary sweet on the outside, cutting on the inside
Kind of like, “it’s payback time,” whether they even realize what they are doing it or not.
If you end up doing one of the above four things, try to figure out if in fact you are doing it out of resentment, and what that resentment is specifically. Understanding your emotions and what is motivating the behavior is key to stopping the behavior.
My advice would be that if you are feeling resentful about anything, try one or both of these things: talk to your spouse. Communicate in a nice, productive way. Say something like, “I don’t want to get into a fight, but there’s something I’d like to talk to you about because I love you and I want us to be together forever…” or in the case of the woman whose husband cheated, “You know, it’s been a few years, and still I harbor resentment for your cheating. I’m having a hard time letting it go. I just want you to know how I feel.”
Sometimes just airing out your resentment is enough. Getting it out and feeling heard and validated might be all you need.
But, if you do that, be prepared that your spouse might not have the reaction you want or need. He/she might get angry and defensive. He/she might not want the confrontation, so this might anger the person, or they might avoid talking about it. In other words, if you are going to speak up about your resentment, know going in that it could make things worse. Are you ready to open this can of worms? I personally think that if talking in a nice way to your spouse brings out any kind of mean or angry reaction, there are issues that really need to be worked on.
In any event, if you do air your resentment, at least you know you tried. And, if the person doesn’t handle it in the best way, remember that is something you can’t control. You can only control how YOU act.
Here’s the thing about resentment as the root of all causes of divorce: When resentment leads to divorce, it is because the person has held it inside for so long, harbored things, and then turned those feelings into anger and bitterness. And from what I’ve seen with couples is, there comes a time when a person decides they are so resentful, there is no turning back, no matter how much the other person apologizes. So, my point is, get your resentment out in the open early. Then there’s no chance of it building up so much that you can’t come back from it.
Therapy isn’t a cure all, but it really does help. Expressing how you feel in front of a third party can feel safe and easier, and the therapist can control the way the couple is communicating, and offer tips and suggestions to help the two listen to each other and have productive, calm disagreements.
Resentment is a little bit like cancer.
It can sit there for a really really really long time and then it begins to grow, until it is completely out of control if you don’t treat it in time. It’s tricky and manipulative.
People often say, “I just don’t even care anymore,” but I think they do. I think if they say this, they have built up a barrier of self-protection that is so thick, they themselves believe they don’t care. Perhaps they feel beaten down, their resentment so deep in their core that they think it’s too late.
Talk to the person who caused the resentment before the resentment gets too big. It’s uncomfortable and stressful to tell your spouse something that’s bothering you, but if you do it in a healthy way, I bet you’ll be surprised at the reaction–especially if the two of you have a pretty good relationship.
Your spouse might say, “Jee…I had no idea that bothered you. I’ll try to change that behavior.” Or, your spouse might get upset, but then think about it and weigh his or her options of changing the behavior or you not being happy. He or she might choose you.
In closing, I know a couple who was married for 60 years. They were very happy and in love until death, and they both told me that there was resentment on both sides. But, they were little things, things that didn’t warrant a divorce. How did they manage to stay together that long? They told me it was because “If something was bugging one of us, we told the other.” The bottom line is, if you are willing to speak up about something–as uncomfortable, awkward and scary as it might seem to do so, that makes it impossible to harbor resentment, which gives you a better chance at a healthy relationship.

How To Fix Toxic Resentment In Marriage: 7 Practical Steps
How To Fix Toxic Resentment In Marriage: 7 Practical Steps

Home • Relationship Tips
By Reece Stockhausen & Jodie Milton
W hen left unchecked, resentment in marriage is fatal. It destroys the love and leaves you feeling bitter and angry towards your partner.
But the surprising thing about resentment is that when approached correctly, it can actually be an unexpected gift.
In fact, knowing how to overcome resentment in our marriage has helped us to address important relationship issues and create an even stronger marriage – and a better sex life.
In this blog you’ll learn exactly how to deal with resentment in your marriage, including:
What causes resentment in a marriage, and the toxic signs to watch out for
What to do when you feel resentment towards your spouse
What to do when your spouse resents you
A proven action plan for how to overcome resentment in your marriage
And how to turn resentment into a force for growth and fulfilment
Whether you’re the one feeling resentment towards your partner, or you think that your partner holds resentment towards you, this is the complete guide for healing resentment in your marriage.
What Is Resentment In Marriage?
Resentment in marriage is the buildup of negative feelings towards your partner when you feel wronged, betrayed, neglected, poorly treated, or taken for granted. Resentment is toxic to a relationship and over time will erode the safety, connection, and good will necessary for a successful marriage.
Resentment towards your spouse basically comes down to this:
Your partner has knowingly or unknowingly broken the agreements of your relationship. And that hurts.
Whether it’s how you want to be treated, what you thought your marriage would look like, or the life you thought you were building together, the disappointment, anger, and frustration of these unmet expectations can be devastating.
What Causes Resentment In Marriage?
The causes of resentment in marriage are many and varied, but common causes include:
Feeling like you contribute more to the relationship than your partner
A long-term lack of emotional intimacy and connection
Feeling unimportant or that you’re not a priority to your partner
An unfulfilling sex life
Toxic communication or unresolved arguments
Feeling unappreciated or like your partner doesn’t really ‘see’ you
Selfish or controlling behaviour
Intense criticism or demeaning comments from your partner
Resentments often start small:
A careless remark, a forgotten commitment, a lack of appreciation.
But if these small hurts are not resolved effectively, they intensify over time. One minor incident builds upon another until you’re carrying around a heart full of past grievances.
What Are The Signs Of Resentment In Marriage?
Resentment in marriage can look like:
Obsessive thoughts about past hurts
Criticism, negative judgements, and ‘thinking the worst’ of your partner
A constant feeling of tension or walking on eggshells
Stonewalling, defensiveness, and emotional withholding
Not feeling safe and finding it difficult to trust
Fantasizing about leaving the relationship
Actively attempting to hurt your partner’s feelings
A sense of feeling let down or betrayed by your partner
Chronic arguments and an inability to collaborate effectively
Consistent fault finding
Fearing vulnerability and not feeling safe to open up to each other
A lack of plutonic touch and everyday affection
Experiencing sexual rejection and feeling unwanted
Does Resentment Lead To Divorce?
If left unaddressed, resentment can erode a marriage to the point where divorce seems like the only option. Resentment undermines the positives making it difficult to deal with problems in a constructive way. It can make staying together feel hopeless and often pushes one partner – or both – towards leaving.
But a marriage can recover from resentment:
It takes shared responsibility, a willingness to talk openly, and a dedication to doing the healing work. You have to understand the hurts in your relationship, be able to talk them through together, and then commit to meeting each other’s needs.
Think of it like this:
Imagine that in your relationship there’s a glass window between you and your partner.
For connection to flow easily, the window needs to be clean and clear.
But when some small hurt happens between you, it’s like a dark stain on the window. One or two aren’t a problem as you can still see each other clearly. But a build up of unresolved issues creates a wall so that you no longer feel close or connected.
Overcoming resentment in your marriage is the process of ‘cleaning the relationship window’, allowing you to come back together and build a more fulfilling marriage.
How To Overcome Anger And Resentment In Your Marriage
The next section guides you through a process to understand the hurts you’re feeling, uncover the valid needs underneath them, and help you communicate those needs in a way that will help you get them met.
And, parts of this process will be difficult.
Resentment can be challenging as it colors your perception and creates harmful narratives about your relationship and your partner that aren’t always accurate. (We call them ‘poo goggles’ – the opposite of rose-colored glasses).
To overcome anger and resentment in your marriage you have to be willing to question these assumptions and consider different perspectives.
Keep an open mind, and trust that this process has the power to transform even the toughest of resentments – if you’re willing to try.
What Do You Do When Your Spouse Resents You?
If your partner holds resentment towards you then you’ll want to open up a conversation where the two of you can go through these steps together.
If you’re not sure how to do that, try initiating a relationship check in.
Or you could send them this article and let them know that you want to work through the resentments in your marriage, whether that’s by yourselves or with the guidance of a relationship coach or a marriage therapist.
1. Look For The Positives
Ready to put that open mind into practice? List all of the things that are awesome about your partner and your relationship.
Let’s be clear that this is not an attempt to gaslight or be all ‘toxic positivity’*.
These positive attributes aren’t going to magic away the negatives or instantly fix your resentment.
But before we dive into the more challenging aspects of healing resentment in marriage, start by remembering what’s great about your spouse, and why you’ve chosen to be in a relationship with them.
Challenge yourself to write down at least 20 things. This is your ‘why?’ for getting over resentment in your marriage.
2. Understanding Hurts & Complaints
Now list the ‘negatives’ and the things you’re feeling resentful about:
What are some of the complaints you have about your partner?
What have they done that’s hard to let go of?
Where do you feel disrespected, unloved, or wronged?
Then pick one resentment you want to focus on healing:
How do you feel when you think about this? (Hint – go beyond anger and frustration, and feel what other emotions are there)
What really hurts about this?
Why is this important to you?
What assumptions have you made about your partner and their actions? Why do you think they’re doing what they’re doing?
And most importantly:
What is it that you truly want?
What is the need or vulnerable desire underneath the hurt?
What would you like them to acknowledge, change, or take action on? (We call this the ‘yearning beneath the complaint’)
Hint: The need or desire will usually be something positive but vulnerable to articulate. Something like, “I want to feel like you truly love me.” “I want to know that you still care about me.” or “I want to have more play and fun in our relationship.”
If you keep getting a need that feels adversarial, dig a little deeper.
3. Communicate Your Needs
Now that you have a better understanding of your resentments, it’s time to talk to your partner. But be careful.
Because as relationship experts John & Julie Gottman discovered, “If a conversation starts with criticism or other destructive communication, it’s going to end as an argument 96% of the time.”*
So instead of making ‘you always’ or ‘you never’ accusations, try talking about your resentment from your own perspective.
This formula can be helpful:
Effective Communication Formula
When ___________ happened / happens, I feel / felt ___________. What I would like / need from you is ___________, / I want to feel ___________.
For example, instead of, “You never make time for me. Work is always more important to you than me.”
Try:
“When you work late nights and weekends, I feel unimportant and abandoned. What I would like is more quality time together. I want to feel like I matter to you, and that I’m your priority.”
Protips:
Choose just one resentment to focus on at a time
Be mindful of not making assumptions or interpretations about their behaviour
Avoid personal attacks
4. Be Sensitive To Their Triggers
When we turn to our partner with a complaint or request about our needs, one of the most common responses is defensiveness or turning away.
Is it because they’re an asshole?
Look, it’s certainly possible. But in the vast majority of relationships there’s a much more compassionate reason:
They’re triggered.
Something you’ve said has brought up their insecurities and unresolved emotional wounds.
If you make a request that you’d like to spend more time together, they hear:
“You’re not doing enough. You’re a failure.”
When you tell them you feel unhappy in your marriage, they hear:
“You don’t make me happy because you’re not good enough for me.”
It’s why resentment breeds resentment. When you try to communicate about your hurts, it hurts your partner. They react, which hurts you more. It’s a toxic cycle that can be difficult to break.
But if you can notice when your partner gets defensive and respond with empathy – reassuring their triggers and insecurities – you set yourself up for a much more productive conversation.
5. Get Curious About Their Perspective
Refer back to the interpretations and assumptions you were making about your resentments:
I’m not important to you.
You don’t respect me.
You don’t appreciate all of the things I do.
You’re not attracted to me anymore.
It’s time to practice curiosity and ask what else might be going on. To do this well you’ll need to summon all of the compassion and open-mindedness you can:
“I’m curious about why you’re working so late each evening? What’s going on for you at work? Is it actually possible for us to spend more time together now?”
“Why do you think we’re not having as much sex as we used to? Are you struggling with anything? How do you feel about our sex life? How do you feel about yourself sexually?”
“When that thing happened / when you said that thing – what was going on for you? What did you actually mean when you said that?”
This is a delicate step that can be difficult to master. Our communication course for couples equips you with proven tools to have more productive conversations.
6. Make An Action Plan
In as few words as possible, what actions would help you to get your needs met and resolve the situation? Is it:
An apology?
A commitment to a regular date night?
A plan to re-distribute the chores?
A request for more affectionate touch or words of appreciation?
Or to have more sex dates?
The clearer you are on what you need, the more meaningful and effective this action plan becomes.
Don’t forget to also ask what your partner might need:
“How can I support you in making these changes?” can be a great question to ask.
Sometimes we don’t realise that there are very real obstacles standing in the way. So if you can help remove those obstacles you have a better chance of success.
And remember – needs aren’t demands. Expressing a real need will usually feel soft and vulnerable. Because the truth is, there’s no guarantee. And that can be scary.
7. Celebrate Success
Change doesn’t happen overnight. It happens step by step, moment to moment. And any positive momentum you make certainly won’t continue unless you take the time to actively appreciate and celebrate it.
Because when it comes to behaviour change, the science of positive reinforcement is clear: it works.*
So be on the lookout for all the ways your partner is trying. Tell them how much it means to you. Tell them how it makes you feel.
Yes, there’ll be mistakes along the way, and you might need to course correct many times. But never forget to appreciate what you’re each doing every step of the way.

Resentment In Marriage | #1 Resentment Definition! – Dr. Wyatt Fisher
Resentment in Marriage | Resentment Definition
Today we're going to be talking about how to respond to resentment. But first, let me explain my resentment definition.
What is resentment in marriage?
Resentment in marriage is the culmination of negative feelings you have toward your partner from unresolved conflicts, offenses, and unmet needs. Left unattended, resentment usually gets worse with time instead of better and creates significant barriers to intimacy on all levels.
Resentment- 3 Steps To Heal It!
Watch on
Resentment can be a common part of marriage landscape, so you have a choice. You can either learn how to work through resentments or you can just let them fester. Obviously, if your partner is taking ownership for their behavior and recognizing what they've done, it's much easier to work through resentments. However, even if they're not, there are some things you can do to work through resentment on your own. I'm going to cover three steps on how to deal with resentment.
Resentment in Marriage Tips
1-Expressing Your Resentment
The first one is discussing your feelings of resentment with your partner. It's amazing how many couples have resentment towards one another, but they never talk about it. They just stuff it down because they know if they bring it up it's going to turn into a fight. It's going to turn to a conflict. Their partner is going to get defensive. So they just avoid it. And unfortunately that makes the resentment just go deeper and deeper and deeper. So the first tip I would recommend is finding a method for being able to discuss your resentments with your partner. When I work with couples in my practice, for example, I teach them a conflict resolution method called the reunite tool. The reunite tool has certain rules of what you can and can't do to keep the conversation safe. When you're the complainer, there's a whole set of guidelines you can and can't do so you're not attacking. And when you're the listener, there's a set of guidelines you can and can't do to make sure you're empathetic. And that creates safety for the conversation to occur. And when there's safety people have freedom to express what they really feel. That in and of itself, just being able to get it out and talk about what you feel and why is cathartic. It creates a release for people and sometimes that's all they need. They just needed to get it out. And once it's out, it just kind of vaporizes away. It dissolves, especially if their spouse is doing a good job as the listener with empathizing for what they have done. So the first step is discussing your feelings using some type of conflict resolution method. You need a method to be able to express your resentment in a way that's not going to be attacking in order to optimize your spouse's reaction.
2-Compassion Chart
Step two is working through the compassion chart. Before I go through it, this chart is not designed to absolve your partner from any responsibility for what they've done. However, it is designed to explain and explore all the variables that were probably at play, that influenced their hurtful behavior to you. So as I explain this, go back to my original resentment definition and think about one area you've struggled with resentment towards your partner. I'm also going to share an area that I've had resentment towards my wife so you can see how it works. So in my marriage, several years ago, my wife got into a pattern where she was starting to spend a lot of time with some friends of hers, some girlfriends of hers. At first I was happy for her, but before long she was gone more and more and more. And I started feeling like a single parent with our four kids. And so my initial happiness for her led to frustration and then it led to anger, and then it led to bitterness because the more I would bring it up and discuss it with her, she felt like I was criticizing her so the more she was gone. So we got into a vicious cycle that was difficult for us to break through. And one of the things that helped us break through it was me working through this compassion chart I developed during that time in our marriage.
First. What about your spouse's upbringing may have influenced their hurtful behavior to you? So when I was thinking of my spouse, my wife, I had to think back to her upbringing. And I remember learning that she was very lonely growing up. She was raised by a single mom and was not around extended family. Her mom was a flight attendant so she was gone for long periods of time. So my wife was alone a lot. And that created a hole in her soul, this desire for community, this desire to feel connected, this desire to feel like she belongs. And for the first time in her adult life, she was developing this friend community that was satiating her and filling that hole in her soul. And she couldn't get enough of it. And that's one of the reasons she was gone so much because it was filling up this desire from her upbringing that had always been there. So what about you? What about your partner's upbringing may have influenced their behavior that hurt you?
Second. What about their situation may have been influencing their hurtful behavior? So for my wife, when I looked at this behavior where she was gone all the time with her friends, when I looked at her situation, she had been a stay at home mom at that point for around 12 years and she was itching to get out of the house, itching to start something of her own, itching to just get out and have fun with friends. And so her circumstances played a part of her behavior that was hurting me. So it was helpful for me to look at her circumstances. And what about you when your partner was hurting you? What was going on in their life in that moment and how much were those circumstances influencing their hurtful behavior to you?
Third. What were you doing, if anything, that may have influenced their hurtful behavior to you? So again, what were you doing, if anything, that may have influenced their hurtful behavior to you? So when I was looking at my wife being gone all the time, I had to take a hard look at myself and ask myself, what am I doing that may be encouraging her to want to be gone. I had to ask her for this feedback. And what I discovered is that somewhere along the lines I had stopped making her feel adored. And that's one of her top needs is adoration. Somewhere along the lines of our marriage and having kids and career and all of these things, I had stopped making her feel adored. However, when she was with this friend group, she felt adored. They were complimenting her, they were affirming her, they were pointing out her talents, all of these things that she was not getting at home. And so without realizing it, my lack of filling up her bucket was influencing her behavior that was hurting me. And so what was it for you? What, if anything, were you doing in your marriage that may have influenced your partner's hurtful behavior to you?
Fourth. What about your background may be getting activated and may be influencing how you're reacting to their hurtful behavior? So what about your background, your childhood, your wounds in your past might be influencing how you're responding to the hurtful behavior from your partner? So for me, I was having a very strong reaction with my wife being gone all the time. And I started checking in with some close friends of mine and I started asking them, do you think I'm overreacting? And several of my friends said back to me, you know, I think something's going on with your wife because she's gone too much. However, you seem to be getting too upset. And when you ever get that feedback from people that the intensity of your reaction seems stronger than what's warranted, most likely you're getting triggered.  A trigger is when something from your past is getting activated. Some type of wound, some type of hurt in your past is getting lit up. You're reacting louder and more emphatically than you would if you didn't have that wound in your past. So when I started getting that feedback that some of my friends were telling me I was reacting stronger than what seemed warranted I started looking back in my past and realized it was triggering some of my past wounds of feeling rejected growing up. I had pockets in my development growing up where I felt rejection and I was feeling the same thing from my wife. So her being gone so much was starting to make me feel rejected and it was stirring up those wounds from my past. So what about you when your partner was hurting you? Was that stirring up any type of wounds from your past? And if so, how is that influencing how you're reacting back to their behavior compared to if you didn't have those wounds? It's a great question to ask.
Fifth. How have you also been hurtful? A lot of times we get on our high horse and all we can see is how our partner has done wrong. But in reality, a lot of times we've also been hurtful. Maybe not in the same way or maybe not to the same degree and maybe not even in the same relationship. But think of a time when you have done something hurtful. When have you been neglectful? When have you been offensive? When have you done something you know you shouldn't have and you hurt somebody? So capture that because it can be very humbling and it can level the playing field. And I had to look at this in my own life as well and think about the times in my marriage when I've been hurtful to her and didn't make her feel very good.
Usually when couples go through this compassion chart, they start out feeling like the hurtful behavior from their partner is 100% their partner's fault. But once they walk through this chart, usually that goes down to around 40 to 60% still their partner's fault. And that's the goal. The goal is not to go down to 0% where none of it's their fault. However, it's normally not 100% their fault either. It's usually somewhere in the middle. And this chart just helps to explain all the variables that were at play.  Research shows that it's more effective to cultivate compassion when you're trying to forgive somebody. Cultivating compassion for what caused their hurtful behavior increases forgiveness naturally.
3-Emotionally Corrective Experiences
So far we've talked about discussing your feelings using the reunite tool so you can express it constructively. It's always better out than in as long as it's constructive and not destructive. And then we talked about the compassion chart and all the steps involved in it. The third piece to healing from resentment in your marriage is experiencing emotionally corrective experiences. Think back to my resentment definition in the beginning of the article. How could your partner right the wrong? Ideally your partner is taking ownership for what they've done and is starting to do the opposite. And the more they do the opposite of the behavior that hurt you, the more the pain from the past will start to disappear. That's called an emotionally corrective experience. So the more they do the right thing, the more you will eventually start forgetting all the times they did the wrong thing.
If you have resentment in marriage, it is going to divide and conquer you. If you're wondering what is resentment then you probably have it. Resentment will break apart your relationship and keep you separated. You have to be tracking your heart. What's your resentment definition? What's causing your resentment?  Use the three steps covered in this article to work through it.

Alright, I've got some information from these articles about resentment in marriage. Let me try to make sense of it all.

First off, resentment seems to be a really negative emotion that can really damage a marriage if it's not dealt with. It's like a buildup of anger and bitterness towards your partner because they've done something wrong or haven't met your expectations. And it's not just a one-time thing; it's something that can build up over time, with small issues piling up until it becomes a big problem.

From what I've read, there are lots of things that can cause resentment in a marriage. Communication problems seem to be a big one. If partners aren't talking properly or aren't listening to each other, that can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings, which can turn into resentment over time.

Another common cause is an unfair division of labor, whether it's household chores or responsibilities related to parenting. If one partner feels like they're doing way more than the other without any appreciation or help, that can make them feel resentful.

Financial issues are also a big source of resentment. Differences in how each partner handles money, disagreements about spending or saving, or feeling like one partner isn't contributing equally financially can all lead to resentment.

Infidelity is another major cause. Cheating or even just emotional affairs can breach trust, which is essential in a marriage, and that breach can lead to deep-seated resentment.

Intimacy issues can also cause resentment. If one partner feels like their physical or emotional needs aren't being met, they might start to feel resentful towards their partner.

Additionally, differences in career or personal goals can lead to resentment if one partner feels like their dreams are being sacrificed for the other's career.

Family interference is another potential cause. If one partner's family is too involved or if there's favoritism towards one's own family, that can cause resentment in the marriage.

And finally, unresolved conflicts or a pattern of avoiding issues can lead to resentment. Sweeping problems under the rug doesn't make them go away; it just lets them fester and grow.

So, these are some of the common causes of resentment in marriage. But what can be done about it? How can couples deal with resentment before it destroys their relationship?

Well, one article suggested that acknowledging your feelings is the first step. You have to recognize that you're feeling resentful and try to pinpoint why. Communication is key here. Talking to your partner about your feelings in a calm and constructive way can help alleviate some of that resentment.

Having empathy is also important. Trying to see things from your partner's perspective can help you understand their behavior and perhaps find common ground.

If the resentment is really deep-seated, seeking professional help from a marriage counselor or therapist might be necessary. They can provide tools and strategies to help couples work through their issues.

One thing that struck me is that resentment can be like a cancer in a marriage. It starts small, maybe with little annoyances, but if it's not addressed, it can grow and spread until it consumes the entire relationship.

So, it's crucial to tackle resentment early on, before it becomes too big to handle. That means being open and honest with your partner about your feelings, and being willing to listen to theirs as well.

I also noticed that resentment can lead to other negative behaviors, like cheating or substance abuse, as a way to cope with the negative emotions. But obviously, these behaviors only make things worse and can further damage the marriage.

So, in summary, resentment in marriage is a serious issue that can stem from various causes, and it's important for couples to address it head-on to prevent it from destroying their relationship. Open communication, empathy, and, if needed, professional help are key in overcoming resentment.

\boxed{\text{Resentment in marriage is a buildup of anger and bitterness towards one's partner due to unmet expectations or hurtful actions, which can be caused by issues like poor communication, unequal division of labor, financial disputes, infidelity, intimacy problems, differing goals, family interference, and unresolved conflicts.
