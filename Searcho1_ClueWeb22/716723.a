Alright, so I have this question: "How is gaming technology used by pharmaceutical companies?" Hmm, at first glance, it seems like two pretty different worlds—are video games and drugs really related in any way? But I guess there must be some connection, or else the question wouldn't be asked. So, I need to figure out how technologies originally developed for gaming are being utilized in the pharmaceutical industry.

First off, I should probably understand what gaming technology entails. Gaming technology includes things like graphics rendering, physics simulations, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality. These are all advanced technologies that have been developed to enhance the gaming experience, making games more immersive and realistic.

Now, pharmaceutical companies are involved in drug discovery, development, and manufacturing. They deal with complex biological systems, molecular modeling, clinical trials, and patient data analysis. So, how could gaming tech help with any of these processes?

Let me start by considering molecular modeling. Pharmacologists often need to visualize and manipulate molecular structures to understand how drugs interact with proteins and other molecules in the body. Gaming technology's advanced graphics capabilities could be useful here. Maybe they use game engines to create interactive 3D models of molecules.

Another area could be simulations. In gaming, there are sophisticated physics engines that can simulate real-world phenomena. Perhaps pharmaceutical companies use similar technology to simulate how drugs behave in the body or how different compounds interact with each other.

Artificial intelligence is a big part of both gaming and pharmaceuticals. In gaming, AI is used for non-player characters and decision-making processes. In pharma, AI can be used for predicting protein structures, identifying drug targets, or even designing new molecules. Maybe there's overlap in the AI algorithms used in both fields.

Virtual and augmented reality could also have applications in pharmaceutical training or education. For example, medical reps or researchers could use VR to visualize complex biological systems or to train for surgical procedures that involve drug delivery.

Let me try to find some concrete examples. Maybe there are specific instances where gaming technology has been repurposed for pharmaceutical use.

I should probably do some research on this. Let's see what I can find online.

Gamification is Serious Business
Published Jan. 28, 2013
By Robin Robinson
Research and case studies from both the academic and healthcare space bring forth ample evidence that games can improve patient compliance and healthcare outcomes. But can they effectively be used for physician education, sales training, and brand marketing? Forward-thinking gamification experts believe they can. According to our experts, gamification has implications across the all industry verticals — from discovery to clinical development to physicians to patients. “Evidence shows that gamification can significantly increase engagement and message recall,” says Buddy Scalera, senior VP, interactive content and market research, Ogilvy CommonHealth. “For brands trying to communicate complex messages about science and data, gamified marketing can be part of an effective, measurable campaign.” According to Sarah Ray, research analyst at Cutting Edge Information, most gamification strategies use the same mechanisms that make games themselves so popular. “Pharmaceutical companies benefit by reinforcing the desired behavior through rewards, ensuring that patients do what is best for both them and the company,” she says. “Recent studies on lottery and other reward systems that drug companies have implemented have started to show positive results for patient adherence.” Gamification makes it easier for users to digest new information in an interactive way, and it is especially useful in the medical industry, says John Wes Green, integrated marketing innovation practice lead, advisory services, Paragon Solutions. “Leveraging game-oriented mechanics, thinking, and dynamics into non-game applications facilitates learning and engagement in a more user-friendly, interactive way,” he says. The principles of gamification are parallel to the fundamental principles at the heart of human motivation and behavior, says Alex Butler, former pharmaceutical marketer turned digital healthcare marketing consultant. “The real benefit of gaming principles to all aspects of business is, as with all technology, the understanding of people and how they behave,” he says. According to a blog post by game designer and guru Jane McGonigal, people around the planet play 3 billion hours of video games every week. Currently, more than half a billion people worldwide play computer and videogames at least an hour a day, and 183 million of those players are in the United States. Ms. McGonigal designs games for all purposes, and after an injury affected her life, she developed SuperBetter, a game that has helped more than 150,000 players tackle real-life health challenges such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury. On the pharma industry side, there are several companies that are using gaming for a variety of purposes. For example, Abbott Nutrition, the company behind Similac, PediaSure, and Ensure, has used gamification in its online training program for residents and program faculty members. The company drives engagement by rewarding residents who complete ongoing educational modules. For European patients, Pfizer created a Back in Play game to boost knowledge of ankylosing spondylitis, a disease that causes inflammation in the spine and pelvis joints. Over the past two years, Boehringer Ingelheim has been developing Syrum, a game that aims to expand drug industry knowledge, improve disease awareness, and allow the company to conduct market research. Several years ago, Bayer created the diabetes Didget blood glucose meter for children to use with their Nintendo DS handheld game system, which rewards them for testing consistently. According to Brendan Gallagher, senior VP, emerging technology and channels, Digitas Health, devising a successful game for a life-sciences company can be almost as difficult as bringing a new molecule to market. “However, we are beginning to see some companies using gaming principles and crowd sourcing to solve big problems,” he says Mr. Gallagher cites Boehringer Ingelheim’s use of Kaggle, a platform for data prediction competitions, as a good example. BI engaged Kaggle to help improve the drug discovery process with the “Predicting a Biological Response” competition. “The goal of the competition was to predict the likelihood of mutagenicity, which causes damage to DNA as a key side effect that new drugs should avoid,” he explains. “BI’s Facebook game, Syrum, helps to promote awareness of the drug-discovery process.” Successful examples of mobile gaming applications are also starting to emerge, including HealthPrize and Mango Health, both of which are motivationally designed medicine adherence applications that reward patients for taking their prescription drugs. Another good example is Hubbub Health, which is a social health network that combines gaming, daily challenges, and a community to promote physical and mental wellness. “Games are also being used on the clinical side,” Mr. Butler says. “We have witnessed significant use of games in the rehabilitation of stroke victims, in the treatment of depression in young people and in the elderly, in support in CBT, and in treating anger issues in young vulnerable children to name a few. Games are a true area of innovation in digital health that can have a massive impact on health outcomes.” Another example of gaming and healthcare at work in the name of science is the online game Foldit. The game turns protein folding into a competitive sport. According to Foldit, after about 20 minutes of training, people feel like they’re playing a video game but they are actually mouse-clicking in the name of medical science. The game is simple: researchers send a series of puzzles to Foldit’s almost half a million registered users, and the scientists then filter the results, searching for the best designs and taking those into the lab for real-life testing. Mr. Butler cites a 2012 success story from the initiative. Players redesigned a protein in just three weeks, which had stumped scientists for 15 years. Foldit attracts a unique type of gamer, one who enjoys obsessing over biological protein folding patterns. Mr. Butler says the game was developed by University of Washington scientists Zoran Popovic, director of the Center for Game Science, and biochemist David Baker. Another example of collaborative online gaming is a program designed to help people diagnose malaria. Mr. Butler says the game helps players distinguish malaria-infected red blood cells from healthy ones. The application of game principles allow participants to be accurate to within 1.25% of trained pathologists. This was put into clinical practice supporting diagnosis of malaria in resource-poor settings. Despite all of these examples of successful innovations from these pioneering companies, the validity of gamification remains in question for many industry leaders. What Makes a Game a Game? The name gamification may be its own worst enemy. The word “game” can mean many different things to people, and most usually, the word is equated with fun and entertainment that results in little or no constructive end. But that is not what the gamification process is at all, our experts say. Gamification refers to using the mechanics of gaming in a non-game context to engage users and solve problems, our experts — and Wikipedia — say. One important element that must be present is reward and recognition for the player’s actions, for example badges, leader boards, scores, or prizes. There are other key principles that must be involved for a game to achieve its goal —whether it be patient adherence, physician education, or brand awareness, or solving complex science. There needs to be a goal or goals and a sense of purpose. There needs to be rules and restrictions, and working within these limitations must motivate players to meet challenges by thinking creatively and strategically. And most importantly, there must be feedback, Mr. Butler says. “We all need feedback systems that inform us on how close we are to achieving our goals and these are effective only when people voluntarily agree to take part,” he says. “Using these four key principles and incorporating a motivational design into all aspects of corporate culture, companies can achieve amazing results.” Often poorly executed gamification is a result of misunderstood, nuanced psychological interactions that players have with games, he adds. The game mechanics must create a feedback system that aligns with players’ goals and doesn’t confuse incidental properties of points and tables with primary features, such as interactions with behavioral complexity. In other words, the feedback must be real and have true psychological resonance for those taking part, Mr. Butler says. Trapper Markelz, head of product at MeYou Health, a social well-being company, agrees that feedback is tremendously important in gaming and he has observed many gamified programs miss the mark. As designers get comfortable with how to use gamification, hopefully they will learn to use it in more effective ways, he says. “One of the most simple ideas in gaming is feedback,” he says. “It is amazing to me how many products are created that simply aren’t clear about when and how to use them. Or how many products make no attempt to introduce features and capabilities over time and rely on explaining everything with a manual or through intensive training.” Selling Games to the C-Suite Gamification is not an easy sell to the C-suite, Mr. Scalera says. The biggest challenge the life-sciences industry faces is the perception that games have no place in a serious conversation about health, science, and data. “Bring up games and team leaders start to think of everything from the Xbox to Monopoly to slot machines,” Mr. Scalera says. “But this isn’t what is meant by gamified messaging.” According to a Cutting Edge Information report, many leaders view gamification as incompatible with company objectives and internal stakeholders are reluctant to develop gamification platforms. “They remain unconvinced of gamification’s potential beyond entertainment value, especially when targeting patient education and patient adherence,” Ms. Ray from Cutting Edge says. Mr. Scalera suggests steering discussions away from the word game and using words such as engagement and message recall. “After all, gamified marketing isn’t really about the game,” he says. “It’s about engaging the user to think about the brand challenge so he or she can win the game.” Mr. Scalera says there is a linguistic challenge that requires careful word selection when describing the approach to leadership, because the wrong word could trivialize the overall tactical approach. “When pitching the idea, it’s important to share data about engagement, retention, and recall, since that’s what will frame and elevate a serious conversation,” he adds. According to Mr. Markelz, it is extremely common for those unfamiliar with how gaming works to assume that by adding game dynamics, mechanics, and aesthetics to a product experience, the overall experience will be trivialized. “Gamification is just another tool in the toolbox to foster engagement,” he says. “We need to keep stakeholders focused on the strategic goals of the product, like how it will drive outcomes, or how it will boost revenue, and let the product teams at a tactical level decide when and how to use gamification.” “It’s important that senior management understands that when we gamify a message, we’re not necessarily looking to entertain the users, we’re trying to get them to think, and that makes a lot of sense in the life-sciences industry,” Mr. Scalera says. When pitching gamification ideas to top-level executives, teams should adopt a realistic approach: understand that not all internal and external stakeholders will be equally receptive to gamification, Ms. Ray suggests. “Alleviating internal stakeholders’ concerns requires digital teams to focus on the driving strategy behind any proposed use of gamification,” she says. “Pharmaceutical companies’ gamification strategies should reflect small, concentrated efforts toward a central goal, instead of more generalized game-based efforts that lose sight of the guiding objective.” To effectively argue the need for a gamification solution, marketers should not only predict direct return on investment, but also the return on resources compared with other initiatives. Mr. Green cautions marketers to not overlook the impact on internal resources that a gaming program may have. “A great example of this paradigm is the operational needs and resource consumption of patient relationship marketing programs,” he says. “Most ROI models are designed to illustrate the direct impact on the adherence curve, without taking into consideration extraneous resource consumption, such as people, time, and infrastructure.” According to Cutting Edge, case studies, like those developed by Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pennsylvania, demonstrate the value of gamification. These studies show that, if developed with a specific purpose in mind and implemented on a small scale, gamification enhances companies’ strategies by promoting objectives, often without the literal game. Games Solve Problems Games can be used for more than patient education or motivation. Physicians respond well to gamifying education. Customer service can be gamified as can sales training. Wherever that long-term engagement can help solve a problem is a good place to gamify. “At its core, gamification is about leveraging the dynamics, mechanics, and aesthetics of game design to create fulfilling experiences and extend engagement,” Mr. Green says. “If there is a business need that can derive value from engagement, this is where gamification can best be applied.” Physician education is one place that can benefit from gamification, and the industry and physicians are becoming more open to this type of training, which is being defined as competitive education, says Mike Marett, senior VP, head of global business development, WorldOne Interactive. The industry should view using game mechanisms to educate healthcare professionals as an emerging marketing channel. According to Mr. Marett, physicians are seeking new approaches to learn and there is adequate data and precedence that support this specific opportunity. It is important, however, to ensure that the content is relevant and that the activities are rooted in science, he says. “Platforms and technologies that gamify education and awareness have the power to improve collaboration, change behavior, and drive measurable results for healthcare marketers,” Mr. Marett says. “Technology and trends will only continue to evolve so pharma should always be keen to consider new ways to unlock differentiated channels and platforms to disseminate their targeted messages.” According to a WorldOne poll of 500 global doctors, administered via MedLIVE.com, 82% of physicians are interested in competing against global peers in an online health game that tests their knowledge, and 84% are interested in forecasting future healthcare events in competitive online environments as a way of learning about healthcare trends. “Competitive education is an emerging healthcare professional marketing category proving that when marketers convert their brand science into sport, they benefit greatly from driving targeted promotional engagement, deepening education, deriving data, and supporting forecasting initiatives,” Mr. Marett says. Mr. Green agrees that there are many applications for gamification within the life-sciences industry, but his view is that the primary opportunity lies within patient customer service to help overcome one of the biggest problems patients experience, which is buyer’s remorse. “Prospective patients and those on treatment experience significant levels of emotional and psychological discourse when starting or continuing a treatment,” he says. “Gamification could be leveraged in a novel way to address concerns in a p
ivate — as opposed to public — setting to educate, challenge, and advance the patient’s understanding and comfort level with the prescribed treatment.” Gamifying will be more successful when the goal is sustained, long-term engagement. A training exercise or single-use interaction can feel contrived and forced if game dynamics and mechanics are applied. “If the goal is to have someone engage in a journey of exploration, achievement, and social interaction, the use of gamification will be much more successful,” Mr. Markelz says. “Not every healthcare problem can be solved by more engagement, so not every problem should be tackled with games.” Gamification Slated for Growth Many research companies are predicting tremendous growth in the use of gamification. Forrester has forecast that the gamification market will be valued at $2.5 billion by 2015. According to Gartner, 40% of global organizations will use gamification as the primary mechanism to transform business operations. Mr. Green predicts that many organizations will experience growing pains as they mature their capabilities to embrace this new approach. “The underlying principles of interactivity, instant performance gratification and, in some situations, a publicly oriented competitive environment will continue to fuel the insatiable appetite of health audiences to engage and participate in initiatives that leverage gaming dynamics and mechanics,” he says. “This interest and engagement will accelerate as other industries begin applying this methodology to their business approaches.” The quirk about gamification in the digital healthcare sector is that there are numerous examples of success, and there are still many non-believers. “Games are still often characterized as a fringe concern, only interesting to a small number of believers and enthusiasts,” Mr. Butler says. “Within the gaming industry the two most powerful drivers of change are the socialization of gaming with online gaming and the proliferation of mobile devices, making games an any time-any place activity that can even be integrated into people’s real lives. These trends have also been a driver of innovation in gaming for healthcare.” As communication technology continues to evolve, new platforms, channels, and devices will redefine how companies engage with media and content, Mr. Marett says. “Our communal aim as pharma marketers is to leverage best-in-class technology and apply principles from emerging trends for the purpose of increasing awareness, encouraging collaboration, supporting the physician decision journey, and improving patient outcomes,” he says. Some of the games that people regularly interact with are more complex than some of the most complex clinical software, yet no one needed to be trained on those games. They learned how to play them over an extended period of progressive learning. “I am excited to see how these concepts of feedback and information cascades will start to make their way into non-game products,” Mr. Markelz says. Sidebars: Defining Gamification Trending Now: The Challenges of Gamification Gamification: And the Survey Says… Defining Gamification Gamification is the use of game-thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to ­engage users and solve problems.

Many organizations have dedicated innovation or digital CoEs that have proven governance, change management, methodologies, and artifacts that help their internal stakeholders understand how to best leverage and adopt emerging technologies into their marketing mix. For those organizations that do not have ­dedicated resources in place, beginning with the end customer in mind and having clear business ­objectives helps level set the excitement a new ­technology ­creates in the minds of business leaders. ­Organizations must rationalize how gamification can deliver on an audience’s wants, needs, desires, or value through an iron-clad business case. Creating a gamification solution because it’s sexy is ­synonymous with the thought process of the early 1990s in which ‘build it and they will come’ was a prevalent business approach. As such, being ­methodical and disciplined regarding the business objectives, end customers priorities, and impact will guide organizations on how to best leverage gamification to achieve corporate objectives.

The practice has proven to ­effectively engage target audiences in desirable ­iterative behavior and create loyalty around core content, qualifying an obvious opportunity for the life-sciences industry. Gamification should be applied when creating alternative educational experiences for healthcare professionals. HCPs are competitive by nature, ­already have a large appetite for digital, and a strong desire to learn and amplify their expertise. Leveraging their pedigree in combination with gamification to create competitive educational ­environments creates powerful opportunities to dynamically inform and promote brands/ therapeutic areas. Similarly patients are likely to better adhere to prescribed treatments if their CRM/loyalty ­programs include visual badges, points, and/or ­status to help them monitor their progress. It can’t be denied that the prevalence of gaming has already reached healthcare professionals, who are very difficult to connect with. Combining ­competitive education platforms with social media will help ­amplify key messages and important ­therapeutic content.

How Technology is Changing the Pharmaceutical Industry
admin August 01, 2020 27 Leave a comment
Adopting the latest high-end technologies can boost the pharmaceutical industry digitally. Although choosing the right tech to keep this safe as this is a very sensitive field for human health.
Technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT integration in the medical field, Advance capsules, and digitalization of medicine through healthcare mobile apps are among the latest innovations that are changing the pharmaceutical industry digitally. These technologies have already been changed other industries like banking, education, and media. Innovators, researchers, as well as pharmaceuticals experts, know the importance of technology and digitalization in this field and they are making enough effort in experiments to make it possible.

Digitization of Medicine through Healthcare Mobile Apps
Fitness bands are everywhere around the world and these bands are the main source of information and data that is helping the digitalization of medicine. Every band comes with a health application that is continuously monitoring your heart rate and other important factors. The companies that made these bands share the health data of people from different regions to the researchers and bigger companies. This helps a lot in the research of pharmaceuticals.
Some applications in wearable monitoring apps are available, through which doctors send feedback to their patients. Also, some applications send auto-generated feedback according to the user results.
Therefore, more digital apps are entering this field with the rise of new technologies. Undoubtedly, fitness and healthcare apps are the next big breakthrough for pharmaceutical industries
Growing Capsule Technology
The capsule shells could be hard or soft depending on their technology of formulation. The patient swallowed the whole capsule in one take. In conditions where child patients are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of the capsule can be removed and sprinkled (or added) on soft food to cure his disease. In the production of pharmaceuticals, capsule making refers to a range of techniques and technologies used to produce medicines in a stable soft shell known as a capsule, allowing them to be taken orally.
Since 2013, Kratora has been providing customers from around the world with high-quality, all-natural kratom powder and kratom capsules from some well-known growers. If you’re looking for a Kratom, look for a fairly-priced, organically-sourced kratom for sale in the USA.
Like premium Kratom powders, Kratom capsules are now unrivaled in their quality and consistency.
The Kratom used in those capsules is always:
Laboratory-tested for quality and safety
100% free of any bad chemicals
Shipped in air-tight, resealable packaging to preserve freshness
Telecare
Using the Video Call for the provision of healthcare services and consultations to patients at their homes is known as telecare. There are a lot of benefits of using digital communication technology for health advice. This includes time-saving to attend hospitals, reducing healthcare costs, and travel issues for bed patients. However, different applications and care situations are what the advantages provided by telecare are dependent on. And more shreds of evidence on the benefits of telecare and its cost-effectiveness are required to justify the big investments in this technology, Research Suggests.
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are no doubt the biggest breakthrough of the last decade. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning could also be the next big thing for the pharmaceutical industry. AI is still in its early stages and could be harmful if not done correctly but it is still being used in the healthcare industry for doing repeating labor tasks such as lab test analyses, analysis of healthcare systems, data management, data entry, analysis to identify errors or medical solution provided by AI-based applications and medication management, etc. Machine Learning is also being used in the identification and diagnosis of critical disease, personalized referred medicine, rare disease identification, and new drug research, etc.
IoT Integration
To help the pharmaceutical industry, IoT has very good potential. IoT can reduce the risk of machine failure by using sensors with connected devices and improve production by detecting issues and making adjustments before they cause a problem.
Manufacturing of the pharmaceutical industry can take advantage of IoT like tracking of medicine material and management process of medicines manufacturing. Additionally, receiving stations that can collect information from RFID tags and barcodes could be really helpful. They can also match the information from different locations to make the manufacturing process smoother.

Gamification in Pharma: Is it still a thing?
About 8 or 9 years ago, when social and mobile apps forever altered the landscape with games like Words with Friends and Candy Crush, the healthcare industry took notice. We tried to replicate the simplicity and allure of these games, thus solidifying “gamification” in healthcare.
As an avid gamer, no one was more excited by this trend than me! I couldn’t wait to launch games that kept sales reps engaged, challenged HCPs to compete while learning new data, and motivated patients to stay compliant by leveling up. Then, reality set in.
Failure to Launch
Despite the fact that gaming is an ideal platform to foster lasting behavioral changes, the gamification trend didn’t take off in pharma at the rate we see across the broader healthcare landscape. Most were limited to gimmicky Family Feud-style trivia or Space Invader-like shooters. And for an industry striving to influence behavior change — whether it be prescribing habits or lifestyle adjustments — I found it perplexing that we didn’t leverage gaming to tell complex and engaging stories through game-based challenges or puzzles that helped users think differently about a disease or treatment.
There are myriad reasons pharma hasn’t focused more on the medium, budget and timing being the two main culprits. To create a game that resonates with patients or physicians, you need research, planning, testing, and optimization to strike the right balance between novelty in gameplay and educational/behavior-changing content. That takes time to perfect… and the desire to launch tactics as quickly and inexpensively as possible is my best guess at the underlying reason most pharma games rely on repetitive, single elements of gameplay that reduce them to a forgettable tactic reserved mostly for convention booths.
So, does that mean pharma shouldn’t embrace gaming? Absolutely not!
Building the Right Game for Pharma
According to a recent report, the global Healthcare Gamification Market is poised to grow 53% over the next several years to reach approximately $13.58 billion by 2025. As the landscape continues to evolve, the question becomes: How can pharma marketers embrace gaming as a viable platform?
Chronic Condition Management. For anyone that struggles with weight, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, etc., gamification can be a compelling tool for reinforcing ongoing care and lifestyle adjustments. One example is Bayer’s Didget blood glucose meter. It connects to a Nintendo DS gaming platform and helps kids manage their diabetes by rewarding them for consistent testing and, as points accumulate, allowing them to unlock new levels and options.
DIDGET Blood Glucose Meter
2. Exercises & Therapy. Physical therapy is crucial for patients who suffer from debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Gaming is an excellent way to extend therapy beyond the office and into the home. Beat Medical provides apps for adults and children with mobility and speech disabilities as a result of Parkinson’s and Dyspraxia, and through simple and fun games, they deliver daily exercises to help improve speech and motor skills. Another example is a recent collaboration between Rice University and Nintendo to help children with cerebral palsy and spina bifida. They constructed a system of Wii Balance Boards arranged between handrails and a screen. Patients shoot monsters by hitting specific spots of the boards with their feet. As they improve, the game becomes more challenging and helps to improve balance and coordinated movement.
3. Game-Based Rewards to Encourage Adherence. Gaming can help motivate and reinforce the importance of taking medications consistently and on time. One such gaming app, developed by Mango Health, incentivizes patients to stay adherent and adopt healthier lifestyles by earning points and unlocking the chance to win gift cards or make charitable donations. A similar platform, HealthPrize, motivates users to engage in branded content, take quizzes, and earn points that can be redeemed for various offers.
4. Simulation-Based Training for HCPs. Think Operation, only on a much larger and digital scale. Simulation learning can take many forms, including simple skills training on a mobile app, or recreations of full-body, virtual reality “patients” who require complex procedures. Doctors can interact with these virtual patients to learn anything from how to deliver sensitive news to inserting catheters.
And, if all else fails, there’s always in-game advertising. Bring on those mobile banners! Just don’t be afraid of adding gamification to your brand arsenal.
Megan is a video game junkie to this day and believes nothing will ever beat the experience of smashing buildings in Rampage at the local arcade. If you disagree, Megan can be reached for comment at megan.fabry@ddbhealth.com. You’d be wrong, but she will respond.

How Technology Is Revolutionizing the Pharma Industry
How Technology Is Revolutionizing the Pharma Industry
The technological advances that have been made in the medical industry in the last 10 years are nothing short of amazing. Such game-changing innovations have positively impacted the pharmaceutical industry and pharmaceutical products as well. Here are some ways in which technology has impacted the pharma industry:
3D printed organs
As 3D printing becomes more commonplace and accessible, its reach has stretched into a variety of different industries. Scientists and medical professionals are currently working on how to use bioprinters to print organs. The machines are able to print tissue in order to make organs. There are some who suggest that 3D-printed organs will begin to be used for transplants and other purposes, such as research, within five years from now. While the new technology has the potential to eliminate the shortage of organs available for those in need of transplants, it remains to be seen just how soon the printed organs will be widely available for those in need.
Artificial intelligence
Much like 3D printing, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more widely employed by many industries, including the pharmaceutical industry. AI does not mean robots becoming smarter than humans and things going awry from there. Rather, AI in this context simply refers to using computers and machine intelligence to take care of simple tasks in order to save time for the tasks that require human energy and brain power. Similar technology used for facial recognition, for example, is being researched for use in the medical and pharmaceutical industries.
Scientists working in the research and development aspects of the pharma industry are also looking to use AI to discover new ways in which elements and compounds can be effective in engineering new groundbreaking drugs.
Obalon Balloon System
The Obalon Balloon System and other intragastric balloons are devices designed to help patients lose weight. The saline-filled balloons are either implanted (usually by an endoscope) or swallowed. The product works by taking up room in a patient’s stomach so they will eat less food and therefore lose weight. The balloons work best in conjunction with regular exercise. The Obalon Balloon System uses three balloons that are placed individually over a period of three months. At the end of a six-month period, the balloons are removed by way of endoscopy. This technological innovation can be an effective tool for individuals who have struggled to make lifestyle changes involving diet and exercise alone. Intragastric balloons must be prescribed by physicians.
Biochemical product development
Biochemical product development, in layman’s terms, is how a pharmaceutical drug is created. Those who specialize in pharmaceutical biochemistry are the ones who create new pharmaceuticals that help people who are dealing with a health issue. They also conduct studies on how drugs interact with the health and wellness of human beings. As with other technological advancements, there are great strides being made in biochemical product development as well. In some cases, they are using the artificial intelligence we mentioned earlier to help them make breakthroughs. It will be interesting to see what the future holds as scientists and biomedical engineers work to produce drugs that can boost the health of the human population.
Pharmacists and technology
So how do all of these technological advances in pharmaceutical products tie back to the duties of a pharmacist? Easy. Pharmacists will be on the front lines of dispersing these new kinds of medicines, as they are the ones with whom consumers typically interact when they pick up prescriptions. They’ll have to stay current with new innovations in order to best answer any questions patients have at the time of pickup.
Pharmacists aren’t the only ones who will have to adapt to any changes in the near future; pharmacy technicians will have to adjust as well. The duties of pharmacy technicians include organizing the pharmacy’s inventory, packing and labeling the drugs, customer service tasks, such as answering phones and checking people out, and more. Pharmacists and the pharmacy technicians they supervise are essential links between the public and the pharmaceutical industry.

Future of Work, Health
The pharmaceutical industry recently stunned the world by developing multiple COVID-19 vaccines faster than anyone thought possible. Intensive collaboration using advanced technology made it possible.
Pandemic-driven changes in how people work create new hurdles—but also new opportunities. For example, restrictions on in-person work often made it impossible to have experts on site. Microsoft HoloLens and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist helped manufacturers get back to work by enabling highly skilled professionals to work together and guide others remotely. Companies ready to take advantage of digital speed, scale, and collaboration are reaping the rewards.
Mixed reality has played a key role for pharmaceutical research and manufacturing organizations looking to achieve that kind of rapid transformation. Discover how combining digital information with physical reality opens new ways to manage collaboration, upskill staff, and keep manufacturing chains up and running by downloading the Remote service in pharmaceuticals: modernize operations with mixed reality eBook.
Getting talent up to speed with immersive training
More complex therapies and faster timelines mean more sophisticated skills are required of manufacturing personnel. Pharmaceutical companies need to find, train, and retain skilled technicians to deploy advanced processes. Using HoloLens and Dynamics 365 Guides, they can provide training in context and get employees ready in hours instead of weeks or months.
This speeds learning and helps drive consistency. New employees gain new skills and self-service access to information so they can solve issues independently. Trainees can also practice complex or hazardous procedures virtually first, helping reduce risk and improve safety.
Knowledge obtained over many years by master technicians can be recorded and used to train new employees at scale anywhere in the world. Recordings of training sessions provide valuable insight into areas of improvement and speed the deployment of best practices.
Ensuring uptime with efficient maintenance
In addition to minimizing onboarding time and maximizing the productivity of their talent, pharmaceutical manufacturers need to keep equipment running at peak efficiency. Breakdowns can result in millions of dollars in lost productivity.
With global facilities, scarce skills, and limited ability to travel and congregate, preventing downtime requires making the best use of field service capabilities. Dynamics 365 Remote Assist empowers technicians to collaborate without needing to be onsite. They can solve problems more efficiently by working together regardless of physical location.
The individual performing the service can stay hands-on, accessing instructions and guidance in a hands-free, heads-up display rather than switching to a laptop or physical manual. Lead technicians can see everything that’s happening in real time from anywhere.
By reducing time and travel associated with on-site maintenance, HoloLens 2 and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist enable issues to be resolved in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. They can also dramatically reduce costs. A Forrester study on the Total Economic Impact of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist highlights the possibility of millions of dollars in savings for a typical large manufacturer.
Exploring the frontiers of possibility
Training and maintenance are only the beginning of mixed reality in the pharmaceutical industry. At every step of the innovation value chain, the combination of physical and digital collaboration opens new doors.
Mixed reality helps manufacturers scale the deep technical knowledge possessed by senior employees. Scientists working in different locations can manipulate molecular models and explore data in new ways. Clinical trial managers can help participants maintain compliance without having to visit them in person. Even marketing teams are using mixed reality to understand customer needs.
Enabling highly secure innovation
Of course, all of this is only possible using devices that comply with the industry’s stringent security and safety protocols. Microsoft understands the needs of regulated manufacturers, which is why we developed HoloLens 2 Industrial Edition. It meets particle-emissions standards for entry and operation in clean-room environments, so pharma companies can bring digital capabilities into their most sensitive processes.
We’re also working closely with the pharma industry and key customers to help them meet their requirements under Good Clinical, Laboratory, and Manufacturing Practices (GxP) regulations. These include regulations enforced by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as recognized guidelines for computerized systems in the EU. We offer extensive documentation about using Microsoft services, including Dynamics 365 in GxP-regulated scenarios.
In a world where hybrid work has become the norm, a hands-on industry like pharma must adapt quickly. Leaders have shown great resilience and are now seeking ways to build on the value they’ve created. Learn more about how you can make the most of your talent, optimize operations, and innovate without limits using Microsoft mixed reality solutions by downloading our free eBook .

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let me see what I can find.

Looking at Doc 1, it's from PharmaVoice and talks about gamification in the pharmaceutical industry. It seems like gamification is being used for things like patient compliance, physician education, and brand marketing. There are examples like Abbott Nutrition using gamification in their training programs, and Pfizer creating a game for patients to learn about ankylosing spondylitis. There's also mention of Boehringer Ingelheim's Syrum game, which aims to expand drug industry knowledge and improve disease awareness.

This is interesting, but I think the question is more about gaming technology, not just gamification. Gamification is using game-like elements in non-game contexts, but I think the question is asking about actual gaming technology, like graphics engines, VR, AR, AI, etc., and how those are being used in pharmaceuticals.

Doc 2 is from TechSpotty and discusses how technology is changing the pharmaceutical industry. It mentions digitization of medicine through healthcare mobile apps, growing capsule technology, telecare, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT integration. While these are all relevant technologies, I'm not sure if this is specifically about gaming technology.

Doc 3 is from Medium and discusses gamification in pharma. It talks about how pharma has tried to use gamification but hasn't fully embraced it yet. It gives examples like Bayer's Didget blood glucose meter connected to a Nintendo DS and apps that encourage medication adherence through rewards. Again, this seems more about gamification than the underlying gaming technology.

Doc 4 is from Coyne College and talks about how technology is revolutionizing the pharma industry, mentioning 3D printed organs, artificial intelligence, the Obalon Balloon System, and biochemical product development. It also touches on the role of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in dispensing these new pharmaceutical products. Once again, while these are all technological advancements, I don't see a direct link to gaming technology.

Doc 5 is from Microsoft's blog and discusses how mixed reality, specifically HoloLens and Dynamics 365, are being used in pharmaceutical manufacturing for training and maintenance. It talks about using mixed reality for immersive training, efficient maintenance, and collaboration across distances. This seems closer to what I'm looking for, as mixed reality involves technologies like AR and VR, which are also used in gaming.

Wait a minute, maybe I need to broaden my search terms. Perhaps "gaming technology" is too narrow, and I should look for terms like "gaming tech in pharma," "VR in pharmaceuticals," "AR in drug development," "AI in pharma," or "game engines in pharmaceutical research."

Let me try another search.

The Use of Virtual Reality (VR) in Pharmaceutical Marketing Communications - Pitstop Health
The Use of Virtual Reality (VR) in Pharmaceutical Marketing Communications
Virtual Reality is increasing user interaction
Published 5 years ago
As health care and health care marketing grows, so too will the number of tools designed for medical and pharmaceutical marketing. Innovations include Flash animations, 3D presentations and video webcasts. Now pharmaceutical companies are making scientific content come alive through VR, otherwise known as virtual reality.
VR allows for event experiences that were impossible just a few years ago. Pharmaceutical companies can use VR in medical conventions rather than hauling around heavy, expensive equipment. Virtual reality also helps convention attendees explore mechanism of action in a completely new and engaging way.
VR sessions can increase the quality and attractiveness of visits by medical representatives. With virtual reality, the user becomes actively involved in the presentation. A health care professional looking through a pair of VR glasses can explore pharmaceutical machinery that is in a remote location or vacuum sealed. The clinician can also interact with the virtual environment to learn how to use the machinery.
About VR in Pharma and Biotech Yesterday and Today
Virtual reality is the computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment in which users can interact in a seemingly real or physical way by using special electronic equipment, such as headgear with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors. Immersed in the environment, the user becomes part of the virtual world and can manipulate objects or perform a series of actions.
Perhaps the earliest example of immersive, multisensory technology was the Sensorama Simulator, invented in 1957 and patented in 1962. This early virtual reality machine played a 3D film along with stereo sound, wind and aromas. It also included a bucket seat and a set of handles that would shake and move in conjunction with the sights and sounds of the movie.
Interest in virtual reality has exploded since the introduction of Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Gear VR and Google Cardboard. In fact, the number of research articles relating to VR in the PubMed database has increased from just 204 publications in 2004 to 720 in 2014.
Technology continues to advance quickly, making very high-quality virtual reality experiences possible today at reasonable prices. Modern VR builds on video gaming technology to create interactive experiences for customers on behalf of a brand.
Modern VR also builds upon mechanism of action (MOA) animations, which are a mainstay in pharmaceutical marketing. In fact, no blockbuster drug gets released without a 3D animation. While MOAs provide clear and concise information about drugs, most animations pale in comparison to the experience of “being” in the bloodstream or penetrating a cell wall to deliver healing medicine.
Virtual Reality and Pharmaceuticals
There are almost unlimited benefits of virtual reality in pharmaceutical marketing today. VR gives pharmaceutical marketers an opportunity to deliver to their audiences the closest experience possible with a product, service or place without actually being there. VR gives pharmaceutical marketers an ideal way to engage customers.
Branding
Pharmaceutical companies can use VR technology to promote brand awareness in a unique way. Consumers are far more likely to remember the extraordinary experience of virtual reality than a PowerPoint presentation. VR allows retailers to market products more cost effectively – marketers can provide the viewer with an immersive virtual reality experience instead of lugging around expensive, heavy machinery.
Virtual reality creates an innovative approach to visual storytelling for pharmaceutical and biotech marketing, enabling marketers to tell stories in a completely new way. VR always creates a buzz and builds excitement about a product, even when the product is as mundane as a syringe or tubing.
The “wow factor” of virtual reality attracts clients while well-placed substantive information leads consumers to the “eureka moment” of real understanding of the potential benefits of a particular pharmaceutical product. Virtual reality creates excitement that grabs the attention of a target group and entices them to learn more about a product. Marketers can then make information available that might not be accessible or interesting through traditional media.
Because VR is exciting and engaging, it helps pique and retain interest in biochemical processes, clinical trials, equipment and more by creating an interactive, intuitive and sometimes playful learning environment. It allows pharmaceutical professionals and other health care workers to become active, rather than passive, consumers of information.
Experience
Virtual reality provides a tangible and powerful product experience not possible with brochures, speeches, websites or even videos because it allows potential clients to “test drive” equipment without actually having to touch the equipment. The VR experience is the difference between walking around a seaside resort, for example, rather than merely seeing pictures of it.
Virtual reality can build empathy. Because of demanding workloads and the scientific complexities of their jobs, practitioners can sometimes lose sight of why they became doctors in the first place, which is to help patients. VR helps them regain empathy in a truly impactful way, one that helps clinicians.
VR helps clinicians “experience” what it is like to have Parkinson’s or chronic migraines, for example, as they feel their hands shake or see as a migraine aura distorts their vision. The experience engages users in a way that makes them more receptive to brand messages.
Training
Virtual reality can facilitate training. A company that produces stents, for example, can use VR to let clinicians experience how it feels to use the device without the fear of failure. VR shows the production process and educates consumers in an immersive way. Viewers get an inside look at machinery and physiological processes normally hidden from view.
At the drug introduction stage, virtual reality serves as a tool for raising awareness among doctors. At the product growth and maturity stage, VR reinforces traditional promotional tools and increases market penetration, which leads to more sales, frequent use of the drug, use of the drug by new patients and more.
Making Scientific Information Come Alive Through VR
An increasing number of companies now embrace the idea that making scientific content come alive through VR can improve interest in new products during medical conventions, conferences and other events where doctors, administrators and other medical professionals gather. A growing number of pharmaceutical companies are utilizing virtual reality to engage physicians and to create memorable brand experiences.

Bringing virtual reality to the lab
Novartis researchers want to use the technology to help them design new drugs.
By Elizabeth Dougherty |
Oct 18, 2017
Back in the 1950s, scientists created models of proteins using wires and blocks to visualize molecular machinery. The models helped them understand how proteins work and interact with drugs. Later, computer graphics replaced wire models, adding richness and precision but losing a dimension.
Now drug hunters at Novartis are working to bring that third dimension back, only instead of using wires and blocks, they are using virtual reality (VR), which immerses users in a digitally rendered alternate world.
Viktor Hornak, an investigator in the Global Discovery Chemistry department at the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), is driving an effort to adapt VR tools for use in the drug design process. He and his colleagues recognize a potential for VR to help drug hunters more quickly improve the molecular makeup of a new drug by smoothing communications between scientists and enabling them to see biological machinery more clearly.
From games to science
Hornak and his colleagues decided to give VR a whirl the instant the technology became available on the consumer market in 2016. For about USD 700, they had all they needed to get started…with gaming.
But for drug discovery, the off-the-shelf technology was about as interesting as a smart TV with no internet connection. “It’s just the hardware,” says Hornak. “There’s no software available to support our research.”
So Hornak partnered with IT experts at Novartis to develop software that understands how to translate information about a protein’s structure – the location of every atom in the molecule and the shape of its machinery – into a 3-D virtual view. With this software, the team can use VR headsets to immerse themselves in the protein and take a walk around.
“We spend a lot of time looking at structures and trying to understand how they interact with our drugs. In VR, I’m the size of the drug and I’m looking at the protein interactions around me,” says Hornak. “You can’t do that within the constraints of a flat computer screen. A 3-D view is more natural.”
These molecular walks are useful during the early stages of drug design, when chemists and biologists need to exchange a lot of ideas about a protein’s interactions with a potential small molecule drug. These conversations can be tricky because the researchers come from different scientific backgrounds and don’t always speak the same language.
With the prototype VR system, scientists can walk through a chemical structure together. Seeing the same things at the same time helps them more rapidly settle on the best ideas for tweaking a drug’s chemical makeup so that it fits more easily into a protein’s machinery and more effectively alters the protein’s function to slow or stop a disease process.
Narrowing down the options is valuable because chemists have thousands of molecules to choose from when improving candidate drugs. The more information they have about how well a small molecule fits, or how it might fit better, the more likely they are to choose an option that is safer or more effective at fighting disease.
“I was blown away the first time I got a chance to climb inside a protein and walk around,” says José Duca, Executive Director of the Computer-Aided Drug Discovery group in Global Discovery Chemistry. “VR allows us to see these molecules in ways we’ve never seen before. There is still much to be done, but the technology has the potential to give us insights that could speed the drug discovery process.”
Pushing the field
Hornak is hoping that developers of molecular visualization tools will jump onto the VR bandwagon. Only a few have, because VR hardware is still new and the industry is fragmented, with more than one platform competing for dominance much the way VHS and Betamax fought to win the home video market.
In addition, on the heels of VR is AR (short for augmented reality), another means of 3-D visualization. While AR is not as immersive as VR, it is more collaborative because the virtual objects appear inside the viewer’s real environment rather than in an isolated virtual world.
By developing an in-house prototype VR system for drug discovery at this early stage, Hornak and his colleagues are able to demonstrate the potential value of VR to developers of existing 2-D molecular visualization tools. “We would prefer to be leaders in the process and help shape its future than to wait,” he says.
Ultimately, VR could have a very wide reach, especially if developers rally behind it and begin writing VR applications the way they write apps for the mobile phone. “This is a new way of doing things, not just for science, but for all kinds of interactions,” says Hornak.

SWOT Analysis:  Virtual Reality Destined to Become Successful Marketing Platform
By Linda J. DiPersio on October 31, 2018 in DTC in Focus, DTC News, Guest Columnist
Zen Chu, MD, of Accelerated Medical Ventures and senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management, said “We’ve got so many new technologies and redesigned experiences impacting both the value we deliver and also the value patients are getting from healthcare.” A SWOT analysis shows that virtual reality (VR) is a novelty that will be become another successful communication marketing platform in the pharmaceutical mass media mix. From the assessment below, the benefits of the strengths and opportunities of VR marketing techniques substantially outweigh the challenges of the weaknesses and threats, which inevitably will decrease over time.
Strengths
Marketing approaches are enhanced with VR by providing more innovative information with immersive storytelling. Patients are exposed to the impacts of their medications by viewing colorful three-dimensional (3D) videos instead of reading dull, long-winded, monotonous drug information in black and white printed materials. The immersive Mechanism of Action (MOA) animation of VR is a full circle video experience with 3D images that provides narrative while stimulating the senses. Spatial audio allows patients to hear information emanating from all directions that result in a blended experience. In-depth sensory perception with VR creates empathy with an inspirational message that takes patients on a journey, captures their full attention, draws them into an encounter with pharmaceuticals, and coerces them into exploring their options while ensuring a memorable experience. Patients are motivated to become engaged with drugs in a resourceful way immediately after a VR pharmaceutical experience, which strengthens the value of VR as a marketing tool.
Weaknesses
Pharmaceutical marketers encounter challenges with the promotion of 3D imaginary visuals, the possible high cost of required equipment, an increase in manpower budgets and the subsequent lower marketing budgets and the lack of technology acceptance. Often times, VR marketers are confronted with the seemingly futile struggle to overcome the fantasy versus reality theme. 3D visuals bring the patient into a conceptual, fantasy world of a fictional environment as opposed to augmented realty (AR) which delivers a physical, real-world environment including sound, video, and graphics generated by computer technology. The cost of the necessary head gear can be expensive which could hinder marketing strategies that would promote it as an easily attainable communication vehicle. The patients’ perception is that it is not worth their investment of time and money considering the high probability of the insignificant value of 3D visuals that are not operational on such devices as iPads. VR campaigns necessitate more staff, such as artists, animators, and copywriters, which escalate the cost of manpower while decreasing the available funding for marketing efforts. Modern technology lacks human interaction in a manner that patients believe is detached and aloof. Simple, high-tech tools such as glasses lack warmth and are devoid of personal touch. Combining medicine with technology is regarded by some patients as standoffish and distant.
Opportunities
The promotion of products with branding, growth of empathy awareness through an imaginative experience, education, and training are all marketing opportunities that engage patients and doctors while increasing sales, drug compliance, and the number of new drug users. VR produces branding by supporting products that stimulate creativity and evoke senses which results in a unique, complete experience rather than merely a visual presentation. Empathy is built when doctors reaffirm to themselves that they chose their medical careers so they could positively influence humanity. VR serves as training and education for doctors with the optimistic outlook that any mistakes would occur during these simulated patient encounters and not in the real world. By presenting in videos the negative impacts on the quality of life with drug non-compliance, doctors are encouraged to prescribe certain therapeutic medications to keep patients on drug therapy for a longer period of time. This not only equates to improved health, but also an increase in sales and market penetration during growth and maturity drug cycles.
Threats
VR marketing strategies are susceptible to exposing the missing value or content, glossing over the specific benefits and risks of the drug, depicting non-compliance with the FDA, and focusing on a flashy fad. The VR experience is an entertaining simulation, but does not always include the requisite information. Striking graphics can overshadow the content. The patient remembers the glitzy presentation while recalling the data as lackluster. As one pharma marketing executive at Ferring Pharmaceuticals said, “Content is king and experience is queen.” Patients may lose interest in the health topic and be unable to identify the positive and negative impacts of the drug after viewing the video for only a few seconds if there is not an angle to keep them focused on the content. Messages are sometimes camouflaged by a great deal of pizzazz; however, they need to be a true representation of the drug that shows compliance with FDA approval and specific industry regulations. Many patients are under the impression that glasses can be easily replaced with the next innovation which may be less associated with a passing, showy toy, and more connected with a modest health apparatus that has longevity in the industry.
In summary, a SWOT analysis outlines the positives of VR pharmaceutical marketing which surpass the negatives. In the near future, challenges will be overcome in at least three ways:
The cost of equipment is decreasing as demand increases and less expensive, more sleekly designed head gear bursts onto the market;
Technology acceptance is growing immeasurably;
More value and content is being added.
Undoubtedly, VR is destined to become the newest, avant-garde media tool in pharma that will increase patient engagement and ROI exponentially while improving patient well-being.

• AR technology increases efficiency
AR technology can help increase efficiency in day-to-day operations. With AR glasses, routine tasks like product search, pick up, and placement is made more accessible.  AR-backed User Manuals also provide real-time instructions on technical and operating guidelines, which saves time and resources, reduces chances of errors, and leads to increased efficiency.
Conclusion
In the Asia Pacific region, India is expected to lead with ar vr in healthcare at a CAGR of 26.1% by 2027. AR technology in the pharma sector will become an indispensable application for the pharma sector and can reap massive benefits.
The potential of digital innovations in the pharma and healthcare sector is vast, limited only by the ingenuity and creativity of the developers. EDIIIE  is an augmented reality company in India that constantly strives to surpass the stakes by developing accurate and explicit tools that enable breakthroughs in treatment and diagnosis in the medical field.

Okay, so from these search results, I can see that virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are being used in the pharmaceutical industry for various purposes. It seems like these technologies are being utilized for training, marketing, and even in the research and development phase.

In Doc 1 from PharmaVoice, it talks about gamification in pharma, which includes using VR and AR for educational purposes and to enhance patient engagement. For example, virtual reality can be used to simulate medical procedures or to help patients understand complex medical concepts.

Doc 2 from Virtuosi Immersive VR Education for Pharma shows that they offer VR education solutions for pharmaceutical companies, particularly in the areas of sterile manufacturing and microbiology. This suggests that VR is being used to train employees in these critical areas, potentially replacing or supplementing traditional training methods.

Doc 3 from Novartis discusses how they are using VR in drug design. Researchers are immersing themselves in virtual environments to better understand protein structures and how drugs interact with them. This could lead to more efficient drug design processes.

Doc 4 from DTC Perspectives talks about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of using VR in pharmaceutical marketing. It highlights that VR can provide immersive experiences that engage patients and doctors, potentially leading to better understanding and compliance with drug treatments.

Doc 5 from EDIIIE discusses the applications and benefits of AR in pharma, including its use in R&D, training, and customer engagement. It mentions that AR can help in visualizing complex medical concepts and in providing hands-on training in a safe environment.

From these documents, it seems clear that gaming technology, specifically VR and AR, is being leveraged in the pharmaceutical industry to improve training, enhance understanding of complex concepts, and potentially speed up drug development processes.

But I need to think about whether there are other aspects of gaming technology being used in pharma beyond VR and AR. For instance, game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine are used to create immersive environments and simulations. Could these be used in pharma for training or visualization purposes?

Also, artificial intelligence (AI), which is a component of many games, is being used in pharma for drug discovery and personalized medicine. Maybe that's another way gaming technology is influencing pharma.

Let me consider searching for more specific examples.

Top 7 Trends In Pharmaceutical Research In 2018
by Andrii Buvailo
April 25, 2018 59812 Comments 16
Topics: Industry Trends
Being under ever-increasing pressure to compete in a challenging economic and technological environment, pharmaceutical and biotech companies must continually innovate in their R&D programmes to stay ahead of the game.
External innovations come in different forms and originate in different places -- from university labs, to privately held venture capital-backed startups and contract research organizations (CROs). Let’s get to reviewing some of the most influential research trends which will be “hot” in 2018 and beyond, and summarize some of the key players driving innovations.
Last year BioPharmaTrend summarized several important trends affecting biopharmaceutical industry, namely: an advancement of various aspects of gene editing technologies (mainly, CRISPR/Cas9); a fascinating growth in the area of immuno-oncology (CAR-T cells); an increasing focus on microbiome research; a deepening interest in precision medicine; some important advances in antibiotics discovery; a growing excitement about artificial intelligence (AI) for drug discovery/development; a controversial but rapid growth in the area of medical cannabis; and continuous focus of pharma on engaging in R&D outsourcing models to access innovations and expertise.
Below is a continuation of this review with several more active areas of research added to the list, and some extended commentaries on the trends outlined above -- where relevant.
RELATED: "Hot" Research Areas in Drug Discovery - 2019
1. Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by pharma and biotech
With all the hype around AI nowadays, it is hard to surprise anybody with this trend in pharmaceutical research. However, it should be noted that AI-driven companies really start getting traction with big pharma and other leading life science players, with lots of research partnerships and collaborative programs -- here is a list of key deals so far, and here is a brief review of some notable activity in the “AI for drug discovery” space over the last several months.
A potential of AI-based tools is now explored at all stages of drug discovery and development -- from research data mining and assisting in target identification and validation, to helping come up with novel lead compounds and drug candidates, and predicting their properties and risks. And finally, AI-based software is now able to assist in planning chemical synthesis to obtain compounds of interest. AI is also applied to planning pre-clinical and clinical trials and analyzing biomedical and clinical data.
Beyond target-based drug discovery, AI is applied in other research areas, for instance, in phenotypic drug discovery programs -- analyzing data from high content screening methods.
With a major focus of AI-driven startups on small molecule drug discovery, there is also an interest in applying such technologies for biologics discovery and development.

2. Expanding chemical space for drug discovery explorations
A vital part of any small molecule drug discovery program is hit exploration -- identification of those starting point molecules which would embark on a journey towards successful medications (rarely they survive this journey, though) -- via numerous optimization, validation, and testing stages.
The key element of hit exploration is the access to an expanded and chemically diverse space of drug-like molecules to choose candidates from, especially, for probing novel target biology. Given that existing compound collections at the hands of pharma were built in part based on the small molecule designs targeting known biological targets, new biological targets require new designs and new ideas, instead of recycling excessively the same chemistry.
Following this need, academic labs and private companies create databases of chemical compounds far beyond what is available in typical pharmaceutical company compound collections. Examples include GDB-17 database of virtual molecules containing 166,4 billion molecules and FDB-17 of 10 million fragment-like molecules with up to 17 heavy atoms; ZINK -- a free database of commercially-available compounds for virtual screening, containing 750 million molecules, including 230 million in 3D formats ready for docking; and a recent development of synthetically accessible REadily AvailabLe (REAL) chemical space by Enamine -- 650 million molecules searchable via REAL Space Navigator software, and 337 million molecules searchable (by similarity) at EnamineStore.
An alternative approach to access new drug-like chemical space for hit exploration is using DNA-encoded library technology (DELT). Owing to the “split-and-pool” nature of DELT synthesis, it becomes possible to make huge numbers of compounds in a cost- and time-efficient manner (millions to billions of compounds). Here is an insightful report on the historical background, concepts, successes, limitations, and the future of DNA-encoded library technology.

3. Targeting RNA with small molecules
This is a hot trend in drug discovery space with a continuously growing excitement: academics, biotech startups and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly active about RNA targeting, although uncertainty is also high.
In the living organism, DNA stores the information for protein synthesis and RNA carries out the instructions encoded in DNA leading to protein synthesis in ribosomes. While a majority of drugs is directed at targeting proteins responsible for a disease, sometimes it is not enough to suppress pathogenic processes. It seems like a smart strategy to start earlier in the process and influence RNA before proteins were even synthesized, therefore substantially influencing the translation process of genotype to unwanted phenotype (disease manifestation).
The problem is, RNAs are notoriously terrible targets for small molecules -- they are linear, but able to clumsily twist, fold, or stick to itself, poorly lending its shape to suitable binding pockets for drugs. Besides, in contrast to proteins, they compose of just four nucleotide building blocks making them all look very similar and difficult for selective targeting by small molecules.
However, a number of recent advances suggest that it is actually possible to develop drug-like, biologically active small molecules that target RNA. Novel scientific insights prompted a golden rush for RNA -- at least a dozen companies have programs dedicated to it, including big pharma (Biogen, Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer), and biotech startups like Arrakis Therapeutics with a $38M Series A round in 2017, and Expansion Therapeutics -- $55M Series A early in 2018.
4. New antibiotics discovery
There is a growing concern about the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria — superbugs. They are responsible for about 700,000 deaths worldwide each year, and according to a U.K. government review, this number can dramatically increase -- up to 10 million by 2050. Bacteria evolve and develop resistance to the antibiotics which were traditionally used with great success, and then become useless with time.
Irresponsible prescription of antibiotics to treat simple cases in patients and widespread use of antibiotics in livestock farming jeopardize the situation by accelerating the rate of bacterial mutations, rendering them resistant to drugs with alarming speed.
On the other hand, antibiotics discovery has been an unattractive area for pharmaceutical research, compared to developing more ‘economically feasible’ drugs. It is probably the key reason behind a drying up of the pipeline of novel antibiotic classes, with the last one, introduced more than thirty years ago.
Nowadays the discovery of the antibiotics is becoming a more attractive area due to some beneficial changes in regulatory legislature, stimulating pharma to pour money into antibiotics discovery programs, and venture investors -- into biotech startups developing promising antibacterial medicines. In 2016, one of us (AB) reviewed the state of antibiotics drug discovery and summarized some of the promising startups in the space, including  Macrolide Pharmaceuticals, Iterum Therapeutics, Spero Therapeutics, Cidara Therapeutics, and Entasis Therapeutics.
Notably, one of the more exciting recent breakthroughs in the antibiotics space is the discovery of Teixobactin and its analogs in 2015 by a group of scientists led by Dr. Kim Lewis, Director of the Antimicrobial Discovery Center at Northeastern University. This powerful new antibiotics class is believed to be able to withstand the development of bacterial resistance against it. Last year, researchers from the University of Lincoln successfully developed a synthesized version of teixobactin, making an important step forward.
Now researchers from the Singapore Eye Research Institute have shown the synthetic version of the drug can successfully cure Staphylococcus aureus keratitis in live mouse models; before the activity of teixobactin was only demonstrated in vitro. With these new findings, teixobactin will need another 6-10 years of development to become a drug that doctors can use.
Since the discovery of teixobactin in 2015, another new family of antibiotics called malacidins were revealed in early 2018. This discovery is still in its early stages, and not nearly as developed as the latest research on teixobactin
5. Phenotypic screening
In 2011 authors David Swinney and Jason Anthony published results of their findings about how new medicines had been discovered between 1999 and 2008 unveiling the fact that considerably more of the first-in-class small molecule drugs had actually been discovered using phenotypic screening than target-based approaches (28 approved drugs vs 17, respectively) -- and it is even more striking taking into account that it was target based approach that had been a major focus over the period stated.
This influential analysis triggered a renaissance of the phenotypic drug discovery paradigm since 2011 -- both in the pharmaceutical industry and in academia. Recently, scientists at Novartis conducted a review of the current state of this trend and came to the conclusion that, while pharma research organizations encountered considerable challenges with a phenotypic approach, there is a decreasing number of target-based screens and an increase of phenotypic approaches in the past 5 years. Most probably, this trend will continue far beyond 2018.
Importantly, beyond just comparing phenotypic and target-based approaches, there is a clear trend toward more complex cellular assays, like going from immortal cell lines to primary cells, patient cells, co-cultures, and 3D cultures. The experimental setup is also becoming increasingly sophisticated, going far beyond univariate readouts toward observing changes in subcellular compartments, single-cell analysis, and even cell imaging.
6. Organs (body)-on-a-chip
Microchips lined by living human cells could revolutionize drug development, disease modeling, and personalized medicine. These microchips, called ‘organs-on-chips’, offer a potential alternative to traditional animal testing. Ultimately, connecting the systems altogether is a way to have the whole “body-on-a-chip” system ideal for drug discovery and drug candidate testing and validation.
This trend is now a big deal in drug discovery and development space and we have already covered the current status and context of the “organ-on-a-chip” paradigm in a recent mini-review.
While a lot of skepticism existed some 6-7 years ago when perspectives on the field were articulated by enthusiastic adopters. Today, however, the critics appear to be in full retreat. Not only have regulatory and funding agencies embraced the concept, but it is now increasingly adopted as a drug research platform by both pharma and academia. Over two dozen organ systems are represented in on-chip systems. Read more about it here.
7. Bioprinting
The area of bioprinting human tissues and organs is rapidly developing and it is, undoubtedly, the future of medicine. Founded in early 2016, Cellink is one of the first companies in the world to offer 3D printable bioink – a liquid that enables life and growth of human cells. Now the company bioprints parts of the body -- noses and ears, mainly for testing drugs and cosmetics. It also prints cubes enabling researchers to “play” with cells from human organs such as livers.
Cellink recently partnered with CTI Biotech, a French medtech company specializing in producing cancer tissues, in order to substantially advance the area of cancer research and drug discovery.
The young biotech startup will essentially help CTI to 3D print replicas of cancer tumors, by mixing the Cellink’s bioink with a sample of the patient's cancer cells. This will help researchers in identifying novel treatments against specific cancer types.
Another biotech startup developing 3D printing technology for printing biological materials -- an Oxford University spinout company, OxSyBio, which just secured £10m in Series A financing.
While 3D bioprinting is an extremely useful technology, it is static and inanimate because it considers only the initial state of the printed object. A more advanced approach is to incorporate “time” as the fourth dimension in the printed bio-objects (so called “4D bioprinting”), rendering them capable of changing their shapes or functionalities with time when an external stimulus is imposed. Here is an insightful review on 4D bioprinting.
Closing perspective
Even without a deep dive into each of the top trends just described, it should become apparent that AI will be taking an ever-increasing part of the action. All these new areas of biopharma innovation have become big data-centric. This circumstance in itself presages a pre-eminent role for AI, noting also, as a postscript to this coverage of the topic, that AI comprises multiple, analytical and numerical tools undergoing continuous evolution. The applications of AI in drug discovery and early-stage development are for the most part targeted at uncovering hidden patterns and inferences connecting causes and effects otherwise not identifiable or comprehensible.
Thus, the subset of AI tools that are employed in pharmaceutical research falls more appropriately under the moniker of “machine intelligence” or “machine learning”. These can be both supervised by human guidance, as in classifiers and statistical learning methods, or unsupervised in their inner workings as in the implementation of various types of artificial neural networks. Language and semantic processing and probabilistic methods for uncertain (or fuzzy) reasoning also play a useful role.
Understanding how these different functions can be integrated into the broad discipline of “AI” is a daunting task that all interested parties should undertake. One of the best places to look for explanations and clarifications is the Data Science Central portal and especially the blog posts by Vincent Granville, who regularly elucidates the differences between AI, machine learning, deep learning, and statistics. Becoming conversant on the ins and outs of AI as a whole is an indispensable component of keeping abreast or ahead of any biopharma trends.

Vantage Research
Vantage Research provides Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) Modeling and Simulation services to assist Research & Development in Pharma and LifeSciences. We work hand-in-hand with our clients to build and apply systems models to make critical decisions in various stages of the drug discovery and development lifecycle.
The pharmaceutical industry has had a declining yield of blockbuster drugs in the past few decades – a slow, expensive and failure-ridden drug development process being a significant factor. Historically, a “trial and error” approach proved successful for many decades, but in recent decades, promising breakthroughs in biomedical research have not translated to meaningful medical progress in terms of drugs delivered to the market. The industry has responded by innovating through various new technologies and approaches with the goal of precisely engineering new drugs from the ground up. QSP is one such approach.
Moving away from the traditional pharmacology’s focus on “one-gene, one-receptor, one-mechanism”, QSP adopts a systems level view, and uses mathematical models to represent physiological systems. The QSP approach combines latest biological knowledge gained from experimentation with mathematical modeling and sophisticated computational techniques – the end result is a powerful tool in the hands of R&D teams who are in the process of deciphering a drug’s mechanism of action or understanding patient-to-patient variability. This additional understanding of both the disease and drug action, is making a crucial difference to drug discovery and development.
When Vantage Research was founded in 2013, our vision was to build a center of excellence in QSP, and partner with Pharma R&D to make meaningful contributions to human health. Today, we are proudly associated with many global pharmaceutical companies and have contributed to development in areas such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, oncology, anemia and sepsis.
The QSP approach is not restricted to Pharma and LifeSciences – we also partner with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to further our understanding of malnutrition in young children, and its deleterious effects on physical and cognitive development in the populations of emerging economies. This problem, when solved, will have a massive impact – from improving individual health, to accelerating GDP growth.
At Vantage Research, our mission is to apply QSP to improve human health. We welcome you to browse through our website to learn about our work.

Hmm, from these search results, it seems like there's a lot of activity in AI for drug discovery, but not much specifically about game engines being used in pharma research. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps game engines are being used for creating simulations or visualizations in pharma, similar to how they're used in other industries for training and visualization.

Let me think about this. Game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine are powerful tools for creating interactive 3D environments. In pharma, researchers might use these engines to visualize molecular structures or to create simulations of biological processes.

For example, researchers could use game engines to create interactive models of proteins or drug molecules, allowing scientists to explore their structures in detail and understand how they interact with other molecules. This could be particularly useful in drug design, where understanding the precise shape and behavior of molecules is crucial.

Additionally, game engines could be used to create simulations of biological systems, such as cells or organs, to model how drugs affect these systems. This could help in predicting drug efficacy and potential side effects before moving to expensive clinical trials.

I recall that some universities and research institutions are already using game engines for scientific visualization and simulation. For instance, there are projects where Unity is used to visualize complex data sets or to create interactive educational tools.

Maybe pharma companies are adopting similar approaches. Let me look for some specific examples.

Unity for manufacturing

Unity – Having proved popular with global automakers, the Unity game engine is now being tuned to appeal to the wider manufacturing industry
Always on the front foot, the automotive industry was one of the first to embrace game engine technology. From collaborative design review and immersive training to product marketing and point of sale configurators, applications built upon game engines, also known as 3D engines or 3D development platforms, are prevalent among the major automakers.
Showcasing Unity’s forthcoming real-time ray tracing capability on the 2019 BMW 8 Series Coupe
Unity and Unreal Engine by Epic Games are the two major forces. Unity’s automaker customer list is impressive, including Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Volvo, Lexus, Lincoln, Toyota and others. The main attraction of the engine is the ability to create very high-quality visualisations of complex models in real-time.
Designers can make changes in CAD, bring the model into Unity, render it instantly with realistic materials, and then explore it interactively and immersively on many different devices. When using Unity’s High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) the quality is so good that creative agency Team One is now using the engine as a virtual studio to create photorealistic marketing assets for Lexus.
Cars that have not yet hit the production line can be placed in any global location. No more shipping top-secret vehicles around the world or waiting patiently for the perfect light of the golden hour. The creative process has been transformed.

Unity’s presence in the automotive sector kind of happened by accident. The company has traditionally been laser focused on the 3D games market. But a few years ago, a review of the customer base found huge global firms were using the engine – not just in automotive, but aerospace and AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) firms too, including Boeing, Raytheon, Airbus, AECOM, Atkins and Mortensen.
To cater to the needs of these customers, Unity set up a dedicated engineering business unit. The team continues to grow significantly. There are now 200 employees, with more recruits starting every week.
Tim McDonough, GM Engineering, Unity, admits that while this is not a huge number, the business unit is able to punch above its weight because it can harness the advanced technology in the multi-purpose engine. “We can go back to our core organisation and say ‘hey, we want to do real-time ray racing, or we want to do this’ and we get the benefit of all their R&D, plus the ability to get help with features that are just massive.”
It’s only in this last year that the company has really started to look at other areas of manufacturing, beyond automotive, as Unity senior product manager Ed Martin explained at the recent Unity Unite event in Copenhagen.
“We’ve expanded our focus to include the entire range of manufactured products, including trains, planes, medical equipment, industrial equipment, durable consumer goods – things like bicycles or washing machines – so essentially any manufactured product.”
This isn’t just about delivering high quality, interactive experiences on multiple devices, including desktop, web and VR/AR. Unity is now being used to support a wider range of manufacturing workflows, including PLM integration, simulation and digital twins.
Unity Pro
Hobbyists and small firms can use Unity for free, but most commercial customers — game developers, manufacturing firms, architectural practices, etc. — will need Unity Pro, which costs $125 per month.
Unity Pro is not a product, per se, rather a toolkit on which bespoke applications can be built. In order to get the most out of the engine, manufacturing firms will need C# programmers, and often look to the game industry to recruit talent.
Unlike a few years ago, where manufacturing firms were pretty much left to their own devices, Unity is now supporting its manufacturing customers by offering a layer of industry focused products and services.
There’s a new Unity Enterprise for Product Lifecycle bundle, which features several manufacturing-specific tools.
In addition to Unity Pro, it includes Unity measured materials (containing 300 realistic materials), PiXYZ software for data import, and toolkits that come with ‘ready-to-use building blocks’ to help firms extend the core functionality of the engine.
Currently there are toolkits for designing applications for Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) and Immersive Collaboration (see\ box out below).
Unity plans to add more toolkits in the future, including a Product Configurator to help firms iterate on different design options or to let customers explore the full product line. Training is also becoming a big focus, with new packages targeted at smaller firms.
Data import
One of the biggest challenges for any real-time viz workflow is how to bring in CAD data quickly and easily, while at the same time maintaining its engineering accuracy and ensuring it performs well in 3D.
To help optimise this process, Unity has a close relationship with French software developer PiXYZ. PiXYZ offers a number of tools that can quickly, and sometimes automatically, turn heavy CAD data into optimised meshes, complete with meta data.
“Customers are frequently amazed at how much time it [PiXYZ] saves them,” says Martin.
“I’ve literally had a customer tell me that they took a process that used to take them a few weeks and they took it down to a few minutes, just to be able to produce visualisation data for a fairly complex industrial product.”
PiXYZ’s software offers granular control when bringing in data. It includes the CAD model structure and the ability to reduce polygon counts for different LoDs (Levels of Detail). Python scripts can also be written to create ‘recipes’ that define how to treat certain elements within the dataset.
PiXYZ is investing in machine learning to make its algorithms more intelligent and autonomous, so in the future it could automatically recognise shapes that would be best treated with a specific optimisation.
Unity also has a close relationship with Autodesk, following an extended collaboration announced last year. The two companies are working on an optimised workflow from the automotive-focused viz tool Autodesk VRED, that supports the conversion of geometry, UVs, animations, and materials. 3ds Max is getting a similar treatment.
In the future, we wonder if this might extend to Autodesk Inventor or Fusion 360 to help address the wider manufacturing community. Of course, PiXYZ can already handle many different CAD formats.
Unity has gone one step further for the AEC sector, developing an application called Unity Reflect. It allows firms to quickly and easily bring in CAD or Building Information Modelling (BIM) data and then push it out to multiple devices.
Importantly, Unity Reflect features a live link to Autodesk Revit and other AEC-focused applications, so any changes made to the CAD/BIM model automatically update in Unity Reflect seconds later.
Unlike Unity Pro, which is a development platform and requires programming knowledge, Unity Reflect can be used out of the box. This opens up the game engine to a much wider audience.
While Reflect is heavily focused on AEC, according to Martin it is also relevant to manufacturing, “One common thing about all manufacturing customers is they manufacture things and they manufacture things in factories, and those factories are constantly being modified. I like to refer to a factory as a building that is constantly under construction.”
Looking to the future, we asked McDonough if Unity Reflect could evolve to become a general-purpose tool that would support manufacturing as well as AEC.
“I think it could,” he replied. “I think if you abstract the functionality, it’s an export pipeline, maintaining fidelity to data. It has the ability to synchronise models and let people see them even if they’re on a mobile device,” adding that Unity Reflect is open sourced so apps can also be built on top of it.
“We’ll produce more apps of our own,” he continues. “But I think you’ll see some firms build their own apps for competitive advantage. And you’ll see probably an ISV [Independent Software Vendor] community start building on top of Reflect too.” This is something that is already starting to happen in the AEC sector with SHoP Architects and ISVs including Xinaps (you can read more about Unity Reflect in DEVELOP3D’s sister publication, AEC Magazine ).

Plugging into PLM
Working with CAD files directly is important, but to help Unity become part of an optimised, managed workflow, and to further extend the reach of engineering data, the obvious next step is to plug it into a PLM system.
Unity has worked with Atos and PiXYZ to develop a PLM system integration that can be tailored to individual implementations of Siemens Teamcenter.
Using the Teamcenter connector developed by Atos, firms can ‘quickly and easily’ extract 3D geometry and metadata to create real-time experiences using Unity. This could be for marketing, training, client presentations or for developing VR/AR applications. CAD data or JT files can be pulled in from Unity or pushed out from Teamcenter, automatically processed through PiXYZ Studio.Batch.
Once the data is inside Unity, the system can automatically create a lightweight CAD viewer for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Web and more. Taking this to the next level, Light & Shadows’ Interact tool could be used to create a VR training experience that walks through the steps required to assemble or service a product. Or it could form the basis for immersive, collaborative design / review. Importantly, every asset and revision that is created can be tracked.

Unity – simulating reality
Unity Simulation is a new cloud-based tool designed to test out scenarios, by running thousands or millions of simulations in parallel. It can be used to verify 3D games but there are practical real-world applications where simulations are used for machine learning.
These include training and validating autonomous vehicles. Unity says that in order to be considered safe autonomous vehicles need to ‘drive’ over 10 billion miles, which could take a hundred years on the open road.
Virtual simulation not only rapidly accelerates this process but allows for dangerous scenarios to also be tested – for example, seeing how the car reacts when a child runs out into the street.
Unity Simulation also has applications for robotics, where firms can train and validate robots before building physical products. Most of the projects in this space are shrouded in secrecy but McDonough shares one example of a delivery robot project from a couple of years ago. “It was able to drive on the sidewalks, but it was too timid to cross the street and it kept getting run over,” he smiles. “So we taught it to cross the street with reinforcement learning and it was kind of goofy to watch the progression of it getting killed constantly and then it got good at crossing the street.
“So, we’ve done delivery robot work; household robotics stuff that I can’t talk about is being done. There’s a lot with arms that are picking up soft body things like, I think, a pair of socks, and the physics required to do that is totally different than picking up something rigid.”

Digital twins
Virtual prototyping and simulation can lay the foundations for digital twins. PREspective is a Unity-based tool from Unit040 that is designed to create and run an identical visual copy of a system in the virtual world, before the real system exists and after the system is operational.
The Netherlands-based firm has a strategic partnership with Unity. In fact, Unity sells the company’s software.
PREspective is used to simulate complex systems, ranging from machines to entire production facilities. Data can be brought in from a variety of applications, including CAD and physics for collision and gravity. The simulation can also be connected to IoT data sources or streams, perhaps for predictive maintenance or for training.
‘Digital Twin’ software PREspective is used to simulate complex systems, ranging from machines to entire production facilities
The thing that stands out about PREspective is that it can run the same PLC control software which will drive the system during operation. It means the digital twin should behave in exactly the same way as it would in the real world, so everything can be properly tested and validated prior to deployment.
“You can run through how it operates; you can put a human in the loop and understand human machine interaction with actual control systems for machines that have not been built yet,” says Martin.
PREspective is being used by Toyota to create virtual versions of its airport security systems, complete with conveyors and sensors for the trays and avatars to simulate how passengers might interact with the system. Engineers can even go into VR to test it out, as Unit040 CTO Guido van Gageldonk explains, “So, you, yourself can throw away a tray, or you can turn off the machine and look what will happen or try to totally mess with the entire system. For example, trying to fool some sensors by putting your hand in front of it.”

Test drives to blow your mind
‘Testing new HMI and UX designs at Volvo in Mixed Reality
Volvo is doing some crazy things with Unity, developing applications that allow the Swedish automaker to test new designs by blending the real and virtual worlds in a completely new way.
It uses Varjo’s mixed reality XR-1 headset, which delivers incredible detail so new HMI and UX designs can be overlaid on the dashboard of Volvo’s existing car – which is then physically driven on a real test track.
The car designers can then add virtual automobiles or unexpected road hazards (such as a virtual moose) to see how the car and the drivers react.
The big benefit for Volvo is it can can see how drivers use new functionality or whether they are distracted in any way – and all without having to build costly physical prototypes. We encourage you to check out the presentation below from Volvo’s Timmy Ghiurau at Unity Unite:

Unity – core developments
Unity is working on several new developments that should push the core engine forward in the coming year. The most notable is real time ray tracing, powered by Nvidia RTX technology, which will bring true photorealistic qualities to Unity’s High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP).
At Nvidia’s GTC event in April this year, Unity gave its first public demonstration of real-time ray tracing, showing work it had done with BMW, Light and Shadows and Nvidia. It’s currently an ‘experimental technology’ but will soon be available as a preview.
Unity is also working with Google, using its Kubernetes engine to stream high quality rendered models to any device. The idea here is that all the graphics processing is done in the cloud, so you can interact with very high-quality real time models on iPad, PC, laptop or even a mobile phone.
Unity says multiple sessions will be enabled from a single GPU, making it ‘cost effective’ and well suited to product configurators.
Conclusion
Over the last few years Unity (and indeed, Epic Games, the developer of Unreal Engine) has really woken up to the huge potential of 3D game engines in the manufacturing space. While the automotive and aerospace firms took the initiative several years ago, Unity is now actively targeting the wider manufacturing industry through its new engineering business unit.
The challenge for the company will be making its engine more accessible, especially to manufacturing firms that don’t have coding expertise in-house.
Certainly, firms can recruit programming talent from the games sector, and Unity is also doing a lot of the heavy lifting by developing toolkits on which to build workflow-driven applications. However, for the engine to really appeal to the wider manufacturing community, particularly when it comes to smaller firms, there’ll need to be off the shelf applications.
In this respect, it will be interesting to see if Unity develops a manufacturing-focused version of the AEC-centric Unity Reflect, which does the bread and butter work of data prep and conversion, pushing out large models to multiple devices quickly and easily.
Then of course, there are third-party developers like Unit040 and Light & Shadows which are delivering powerful industry-focused solutions based on Unity. We expect to see more of these in the future.
It’s still very early days for the engine but the potential is huge. With broad applications for design, manufacturing, simulation, training, sales and marketing, we’re excited to see where things will go.
Laying the foundations for design review in VR
Unity’s Immersive Collaboration toolkit provides a foundation on which to build custom collaborative design / review applications in VR. It means firms don’t need to reinvent the wheel, getting access to core tools including teleportation, measurement, cross sections, annotation (freehand and text), collision and scenario switching.
There’s also built in support for avatars and multiplayer with voice, so teams in different locations, even different countries, can collaborate on the same model.
According to Kieran Colenutt, art evangelist, Unity, building a base application requires minimal C# coding,
“Everything can be achieved through an interaction menu, or by a simple drag and drop functionality in order to create simple interaction.”
Of course, this is really just a starting point for manufacturing firms. As Unity is fully programmable, pretty much anything can be developed on top of a design / review application that has been built with the help of the Immersive Collaboration toolkit, from custom functionality all the way down to aesthetics.

Epic and Unity rev their engines for the next era of entertainment
Two rival developers of 3D graphics tools step up financing efforts as they look beyond video games

August 11 2020
The two biggest independent makers of the engines that power video games, Unity Technologies and Epic Games, are stepping up their financing efforts to capitalise on the booming market for interactive entertainment.
Unity and Epic both offer “game engines” — software tool kits used by other developers that can provide shortcuts when programming a new game and make graphics look more realistic. These engines are used by millions of designers to create games ranging from puzzle apps to first-person shooters, without having to start coding from scratch every time.
Once seen as niche technologies for high-end games, investors in Unity and Epic are betting that their 3D graphics tools will shape the next generation of entertainment, from video games and new forms of online socialising to Hollywood movies and TV shows.
Last week, Epic Games, better known outside the industry as the creator of Fortnite: Battle Royale, closed a $1.8bn round of funding, valuing the company at $17bn. The deal includes last month’s $250m investment from Sony, which the PlayStation maker said would “broaden their collaboration” ahead of the PS5’s release later this year, as well as an undisclosed amount in share sales by employees.
Games created using Epic’s Unreal engine, such as Microsoft’s long-running Gears of War series, have often pushed the visual capabilities of games consoles with realistic graphics and novel lighting effects.
Nintendo’s ‘Yoshi Crafted World’ uses the Unreal game engine
‘Final Fantasy VII’ remake also uses Unreal game engine
Its rival Unity, meanwhile, has hired bankers for a public listing expected later this year, said one person briefed on the matter, a move that would capitalise on its huge growth in mobile apps and fuel expansion into a much bigger addressable market beyond video gaming.
While Unity is seen as more limited in its capabilities than Unreal, it can be easier to use for smaller teams or independent developers. Unity also powers some of the world’s most lucrative mobile games, including Pokémon Go and Activision’s recent Call of Duty Mobile .
Both companies have made inroads in Hollywood. Unity was used by Disney to recreate the African savannah for last year’s Lion King remake, while Star Wars TV spin-off The Mandalorian was shot using Unreal Engine graphics.
“Historically there has been substantial industry convergence in the games developer tools business, but over the past decade the number of developers has increased so much, I believe the market can support two major players,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, games analyst at Ampere Analysis.
A ‘generational leap’
In May, Sony used a demonstration game developed in Unreal Engine 5, the toolkit’s latest iteration, to showcase the cutting-edge capabilities and photorealistic graphics of its forthcoming PlayStation 5 console.
Tim Sweeney, Epic’s founder and chief executive, has pitched Unreal Engine 5 as a “generational leap”, with Fortnite itself set to be among the first games to use it on the PS5 and Microsoft’s rival Xbox Series X. (Epic declined to make Mr Sweeney available for interview.)
“Unreal is a foundation piece in a more end-to-end proposition from Epic,” said Mr Harding-Rolls, which includes its own storefront for selling PC games and a platform for building online multiplayer experiences. “This whole suite of tools they built for Fortnite are now being offered to third parties.”
Epic wants to use its new funding to play a lead role in developing the so-called “Metaverse” — an expansion of games into platforms for new kinds of social and entertainment experiences, where friends will gather to watch virtual concerts. Analysts said Sony’s investment in Epic could signal that the Japanese company wants to push more of its entertainment content into Fortnite, whose virtual island has hosted real-life artists including Travis Scott and Marshmello.
“If Epic achieves its vision for the Metaverse, then its addressable market could grow from the entire global video gaming community to the entire global internet-connected population,” said Mina Faltas, chief investment officer of Washington Harbour Partners, which has invested in Epic.
In a sign of the trust that this vision has inspired among investors, Epic’s backers have agreed to purchase common stock, rather than preferred shares with greater rights that are typical of venture financings.
‘Your own means of production’
Currently, though, Unity has the upper hand, with many more developer clients thanks to its popularity as a platform for mobile gaming and greater ease of use.
The company has won the backing of the venture firm Sequoia Capital and the private equity group Silver Lake, whose co-chief executive Egon Durban is a board member at the gaming company. Investors most recently valued Unity, which declined to comment for this article, at $6bn in a round of funding last year.
Traditionally, most of the value in the games industry has accrued to owners of intellectual property — hit franchises such as Call of Duty or Super Mario — rather than the underlying tools. In Fortnite, which was released in 2017, Epic has created a cultural phenomenon and a huge new source of cash flow. But like Unity, its longer-term fortunes depend on providing tools behind the scenes to swaths of other developers.

‘Monument Valley 2’ using a Unity game engine
A major hurdle for both companies is that some of the biggest games makers opt to use their own engines rather than licensing independent products. The two largest US-based games companies, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, use their own proprietary software, which allows for greater differentiation and control.
“If you want an original custom look to your game, there are disadvantages to using an engine and assets from a marketplace that everyone uses,” said Mr Harding-Rolls.
One executive at a games company with its own engine, who asked not to be named discussing commercially sensitive matters, said it is important to “own your own means of production”.
“We have optimised it to do certain things incredibly well,” he said. “Having your own engine gives you a first-mover advantage.”
Cost is also a concern: Epic charges a 5 per cent royalty on the sale of every game that is developed using Unreal, once gross lifetime revenues of the title exceed $1m, whereas Unity charges no royalty and instead charges developers a licence fee to use its software.
But as both smartphones and consoles get ever more powerful, more developers are looking to Epic’s sophisticated tools to create more distinctive games, bringing new momentum to the two-decade-old Unreal Engine.
“Unity started out as the amateurs’ platform, making it incredibly easy to make stuff . . . The speed with which you can get something functioning is phenomenal,” said Nicholas Lovell, a games industry consultant. “Unreal can only be used by professionals. That’s its strength and its weakness.”

Vantage Research
Vantage Research provides Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) Modeling and Simulation services to assist Research & Development in Pharma and LifeSciences. We work hand-in-hand with our clients to build and apply systems models to make critical decisions in various stages of the drug discovery and development lifecycle.
The pharmaceutical industry has had a declining yield of blockbuster drugs in the past few decades – a slow, expensive and failure-ridden drug development process being a significant factor. Historically, a “trial and error” approach proved successful for many decades, but in recent decades, promising breakthroughs in biomedical research have not translated to meaningful medical progress in terms of drugs delivered to the market. The industry has responded by innovating through various new technologies and approaches with the goal of precisely engineering new drugs from the ground up. QSP is one such approach.
Moving away from the traditional pharmacology’s focus on “one-gene, one-receptor, one-mechanism”, QSP adopts a systems level view, and uses mathematical models to represent physiological systems. The QSP approach combines latest biological knowledge gained from experimentation with mathematical modeling and sophisticated computational techniques – the end result is a powerful tool in the hands of R&D teams who are in the process of deciphering a drug’s mechanism of action or understanding patient-to-patient variability. This additional understanding of both the disease and drug action, is making a crucial difference to drug discovery and development.
When Vantage Research was founded in 2013, our vision was to build a center of excellence in QSP, and partner with Pharma R&D to make meaningful contributions to human health. Today, we are proudly associated with many global pharmaceutical companies and have contributed to development in areas such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, oncology, anemia and sepsis.
The QSP approach is not restricted to Pharma and LifeSciences – we also partner with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to further our understanding of malnutrition in young children, and its deleterious effects on physical and cognitive development in the populations of emerging economies. This problem, when solved, will have a massive impact – from improving individual health, to accelerating GDP growth.
At Vantage Research, our mission is to apply QSP to improve human health. We welcome you to browse through our website to learn about our work.

Abstract and Figures
Intelligent vehicles simulations are utilized as the initial step of experiments before the deployment on the roads. Nowadays there are several frameworks that can be used to
control vehicles, and Robot Operating System (ROS) is the most common one. Moreover, there are several powerful visualization tools that can be used for simulations, and Unity Game Engine is on the top of the list. Accordingly, this paper introduces a methodology to connect both systems, ROS and Unity, thus linking the performance in simulations and real-life for better analogy. Additionally, a comparative study between GAZEBO
simulator and Unity simulator, in terms of functionalities and capabilities is shown. Last but not least, two use cases are presented for validation of the proposed methodology.

Seven Bridges Launches Unified Patient Network to Facilitate Clinical Research with Aim to Advance Precision Medicine and Improve Patient Care
PRESS RELEASE PR Newswire
Dec. 9, 2021, 08:00 AM
BOSTON, Dec. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Seven Bridges Genomics, the industry-leading bioinformatics ecosystem provider, today announced the formation of a new subsidiary, the Unified Patient Network (UPN), to facilitate clinical research and collaboration between participating health systems and biopharma companies with a focus on advancing precision medicine and improving patient care.
The UPN aims to accelerate the scientific advancement and clinical implementation of precision medicine.
The UPN will operate as a collaborative group of nonprofit academic health centers and other health systems participating in clinical research that is enabled by the UPN through biopharma funding. The initiative aims to advance medical science and identify the genetic roots of human health and disease, by building a large database of research participants' de-identified clinical and genomic data that will be available for research purposes – by researchers at UPN member health systems and biopharma companies.
"The UPN aims to accelerate the scientific advancement and clinical implementation of precision medicine, in a manner that provides truly unprecedented return-of-value to our health system members and their research participants, via clinical whole genome sequencing, genetic screening, genetic counseling, research tools, data assets, collaborative interoperability and a significant incremental funding stream, at no charge to the health systems or patients. With the ability to extend invitations to participate to patients across multiple health systems, UPN will be able to provide biopharma researchers unprecedented access to highly harmonized de-identified whole genome and longitudinal EHR data regarding highly specific cohorts drawn from thousands of research participants," said William Moss, CEO of Seven Bridges and the UPN.
"Our unique approach enables us to simultaneously optimize clinical and scientific research value on demand, without making it needlessly difficult to combine de-identified sequencing data and EHR content for large populations, resulting in a highly efficient operating model," Moss continued.
The UPN will operate across many disease states and therapeutic areas, including rare, complex neurodegenerative, psychiatric and autoimmune diseases and disorders, as well as cancer, cardiology and common diseases such as diabetes. The network will begin by aggregating very specific cohorts, measured on the order of thousands of research participants. Ultimately, the UPN's goal is to include over five million sequenced patient volunteers in its active network.
Patients who volunteer for clinical research studies conducted as part of the UPN will need to provide informed consent to participate and can opt at any time to have their de-identified genetic and clinical data removed from the network's database. The privacy of research participants will be strictly protected. Only de-identified genomic and clinical electronic health record (EHR) content will be made available via the highly secure database. Such data will be used, as part of institutional review board (IRB)-approved research studies, to understand how genes contribute to or protect against various diseases and influence how well patients respond to treatment. In some cases, genomic sequencing may reveal genetic alterations that could change the course of a patient's treatment.
Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and its affiliated health system, BJC HealthCare, is the first academic health system to join the UPN as a founding member. The network will expand to include other health systems and consented research participants from those institutions.
"Washington University has a long-standing commitment to advance precision medicine and bring more personalized treatments to our patients," said David H. Perlmutter, MD, Executive Vice Chancellor for Medical Affairs, the George and Carol Bauer Dean, and the Spencer T. and Ann. W. Olin Distinguished Professor at the School of Medicine. "The UPN will be an important part of making this a reality by providing a platform to aggregate clinical and genomic data from research participants and share de-identified data with researchers. The UPN strategy takes another important step in positioning our communities for a new era of precision medicine, with more personalized diagnoses and treatments across many diseases."
With the launch of the UPN, Seven Bridges has assembled a world-class executive leadership team, including Chief Clinical and Research Officer Dr. David Ledbetter. Dr. Ledbetter was previously executive vice president and chief scientific officer at Geisinger Health System where he was the principal investigator for the MyCode biobank and precision health program that exceeded 175,000 patients with exome sequence data linked to rich, longitudinal EHR and other clinical data. He has also been a professor of human genetics at Emory University School of Medicine, the University of Chicago School of Medicine, and Baylor College of Medicine .
"Previous experience from large population genomics projects have shown that healthcare data combined with genomics data can rapidly accelerate knowledge to help prevent disease or to improve patient outcomes, as well as identify new drug targets for biopharma pipelines. Until now, these valuable data sets have been confined to single health systems rather than aggregated and shared across multiple health systems, or have been siloed by individual commercial entities. The Unified Patient Network will unlock the long-promised benefits of our national investments in health IT and population scale genomics," said David Ledbetter, PhD, Chief Clinical and Research Officer for the UPN. "This unique multi-sided network will bring these stakeholders together with the aim of advancing precision medicine through a genomics-enabled learning health system, whereby patients can have their genomes sequenced free of charge, giving researchers greater insights into patient health risks, and biopharmaceutical companies to more easily identify cohorts of patients as part of drug discovery efforts, thereby lowering everyone's costs."
Phillip Payne, PhD, Associate Dean for Health Information and Data Science and Chief Data Scientist at Washington University School of Medicine said, "By bringing health systems together, we can enroll more patients into UPN studies, helping to speed innovative research while also protecting patients' identities and confidentiality. Genome sequencing is expensive and out of reach for most patients, but the UPN is providing such sequencing to research volunteers free of charge. This opens up the technology to many more people, including those in under-resourced communities, and is a huge win from an access and affordability standpoint."
The UPN will receive funding from biopharma companies that request access to research participants' de-identified genomic and health information for the companies' own research. A portion of that funding will be returned to the health systems in the UPN, Payne said, to support efforts to improve their patients' access to medical care and drive the institutions' research and teaching missions.
The UPN has assembled a dynamic team of partners and supporters to advance the high level of collaboration required to build, grow and sustain the network. The ecosystem includes Seven Bridges, Genome Medical, Amazon Web Services, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Illumina and others.
Partnering closely with Seven Bridges, the UPN is leveraging the Seven Bridges highly-secured research and development ecosystem as the interoperability infrastructure for the network community, and enabling exploration and analysis for complex cohort stratification across populations of millions of patients,  via the ARIA™ scientific intelligence system. The content will be made available only to credentialed researchers as part of IRB-approved research studies, as mutually agreed to by the UPN and the health system members, by leveraging Seven Bridges' proven security, authentication and authorization protocols and technologies.
The UPN is also working with Genome Medical, the leading telehealth provider of genetics and genomics care. "We are pleased that our genomic specialists and technology-enabled clinical support tools will expand access to the benefits of genomic science and medicine within the network," said Lisa Alderson, CEO and co-founder of Genome Medical. "By helping patients and their clinicians better understand and interpret genomic data, health care can best meet the needs of individual patients."
