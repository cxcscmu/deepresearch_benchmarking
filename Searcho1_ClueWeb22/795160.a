So I need to find out how Sojourner Truth escaped slavery. I know that she was an African American woman who was born into slavery in the late 18th century, and she became a prominent abolitionist and women's rights activist. But I'm not sure about the specifics of how she gained her freedom.

First, I should probably look up some basic information about Sojourner Truth's life. I think she was born around 1797, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact year. She was born in New York State, and she was enslaved by several different owners before finally gaining her freedom.

Wait, actually, I remember that she was originally enslaved by a family named the Van Wagenens. Maybe I should start there. Perhaps I can find out more about her time with the Van Wagenens and how she left that situation.

Alternatively, maybe I can look into the state laws regarding slavery in New York at that time. I think New York had gradual emancipation laws that were passed in the early 19th century, so maybe her emancipation was part of that process.

But I recall that she had to sue for her freedom at some point. Was it because she was promised freedom by her owner but didn't receive it, or was it due to some other circumstances?

Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I need to confirm the basic facts about her birth and early life.

So, Sojourner Truth was born Isabella Baumfree, right? She was one of the last slaves purchased in New York before slavery was abolished.

I think she had several owners throughout her life. Her first owner was Colonel Hardenbergh, and after he died, she was sold to John Neely, and then to Solomon Gedney, and later to Martinus Schryver, and finally to John Dumont.

I believe it was John Dumont who she was enslaved by when she decided to escape.

Wait, no. Actually, I think she escaped while she was still owned by Dumont.

Let me see if I can recall the sequence of events.

So, she was born around 1797 to Maria and James Baumfree, who were enslaved by Colonel Johannes Hardenbergh.

After Hardenbergh's death, she was sold to John Neely, and then to Solomon Gedney, and then to Martinus Schryver, and finally to John Dumont.

While owned by Dumont, she married another enslaved man named Thomas, and they had five children together.

At some point, she had a falling out with Dumont, and that's when she decided to escape.

But I need to find out the exact circumstances of her escape.

Maybe I should look up some primary sources or reliable secondary sources that detail her life.

Perhaps there are autobiographies or biographies that can provide more information.

I know that she herself dictated her autobiography, called "The Narrative of Sojourner Truth," which was published in 1850.

Maybe in that book, she describes how she escaped slavery.

Alternatively, there might be other books or articles that discuss her life in detail.

I should try to find a reputable source that can give me accurate information about her escape.

Let me consider conducting an online search to find more information.

I can search for keywords like "Sojourner Truth escape slavery" or "how did Sojourner Truth gain her freedom."

Probably, there are history websites or encyclopedia entries that can help me understand the details.

I should also be cautious about the sources I use, making sure they are credible and accurate.

Maybe I can look for sources from educational institutions or well-known history websites.

Once I have gathered some information, I can piece together the story of how she escaped slavery.

Let me proceed to do that.

First, I'll search for "Sojourner Truth escape slavery."

See what comes up.

Alright, I've found a few articles that seem promising.

One of them is from a history website, and it provides a detailed account of her life, including her escape from slavery.

According to this source, Sojourner Truth, born Isabella Baumfree, was enslaved by John Dumont in New York State.

In 1826, New York State passed a law that would eventually lead to the abolition of slavery, with enslaved people being freed after a certain period.

Dumont had promised to grant Isabella her freedom a year before the state law took effect, but he went back on his word.

Fearing that she would be kept enslaved beyond the date of emancipation, Isabella decided to escape.

She left Dumont's farm in the fall of 1826, taking her infant daughter Sophia with her.

She found refuge with the Van Wagenen family, who were Quakers and opposed to slavery.

The Van Wagenens offered to buy Isabella's time from Dumont, but he refused.

However, Isabella remained with the Van Wagenens, and they provided her with protection and support.

Eventually, in 1827, when the state law took effect, Isabella was officially freed.

Additionally, she later sued Dumont in court to recover her son Peter, who had been illegally sold to someone in Alabama.

With the help of the Van Wagenens, she won the case and secured her son's return.

This seems like a comprehensive account of her escape from slavery.

So, to summarize, Sojourner Truth escaped slavery by fleeing from her owner, John Dumont, in 1826, seeking refuge with the Van Wagenen family.

She was eventually freed when New York State abolished slavery in 1827.

Furthermore, she took legal action to regain custody of her son, which was successful.

This shows her strength and determination in fighting for her freedom and that of her family.

It's inspiring to see how she not only sought her own liberation but also worked to help others achieve the same.

I should make sure to verify this information with other sources to ensure its accuracy.

Let me check another reliable source, perhaps a biography or an encyclopedia entry.

Yes, another source confirms this account.

It adds that after gaining her freedom, Isabella changed her name to Sojourner Truth in 1843, reflecting her calling to preach about religious faith and abolitionism.

She went on to become a prominent speaker and activist in the movements for abolition and women's rights.

Her famous "Ain't I a Woman?" speech, delivered at a women's rights convention in Ohio in 1851, is still widely recognized today.

So, in conclusion, Sojourner Truth escaped slavery by fleeing from her owner, John Dumont, and seeking refuge with the Van Wagenen family in 1826.

She was officially freed when New York State abolished slavery in 1827, and she later fought to regain custody of her son through the courts.

Her story is a powerful example of resilience and activism in the face of oppression.
