I'm trying to figure out how traditional store-based retailers have benefited from adding internet channels to their operations. So, first off, I need to understand what exactly is meant by "traditional store-based retailers" and "internet channels."

Traditional store-based retailers are companies that have physical stores where customers can go to browse and purchase products in person. Think of places like department stores, clothing boutiques, electronics stores, and so on. Internet channels, on the other hand, refer to the online platforms these retailers have developed to allow customers to shop from their homes or anywhere with an internet connection.

So, the question is asking about the advantages or benefits that these retailers have gained by expanding into the digital space. I imagine there are several ways this has been beneficial, but I need to think through them systematically.

First, one obvious benefit is increased reach. By having an online presence, retailers can now sell their products to people who may not live near their physical locations. This means they can tap into a larger customer base, potentially increasing their sales and market share.

Second, convenience is a big factor. Online shopping allows customers to browse and buy products at any time of day, without having to physically go to the store. This is especially appealing to busy individuals or those who prefer the comfort of their own homes.

Third, data and analytics. Online channels provide retailers with a wealth of data about customer behavior, preferences, and purchasing patterns. This information can be used to improve marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize inventory management.

Fourth, cost efficiency. While setting up an e-commerce platform may require initial investment, it can lead to long-term cost savings. For example, online sales don't require the same level of overhead as physical stores, such as rent, utilities, and a large in-store staff.

Fifth, integration of online and offline experiences. Many retailers are now offering omnichannel experiences, where online and in-store operations are seamlessly integrated. This can include features like buy online pick up in store (BOPIS), returns in store for online purchases, and in-store browsing with online ordering.

Sixth, expanded product offerings. Online channels allow retailers to offer a wider range of products without the space constraints of a physical store. This can attract customers who are looking for specific items that may not be available in local stores.

Seventh, competitive advantage. In today's digital age, having an online presence is almost essential for retail businesses. By adding internet channels, traditional retailers can compete more effectively with pure-play e-commerce companies and other competitors who already have a strong online footprint.

Eighth, enhanced customer engagement. Social media and other online platforms provide opportunities for retailers to engage with their customers in new ways, build brand loyalty, and receive immediate feedback.

Ninth, access to new markets. Online channels can help retailers reach international markets more easily, provided they have the logistics and infrastructure in place to handle cross-border shipments.

Tenth, improved operational efficiency. E-commerce platforms often come with advanced tools for managing orders, tracking inventory, and streamlining fulfillment processes, which can lead to better overall operational efficiency.

Wait a minute, I might be missing some specific examples or statistics to support these points. Maybe I should look up some information to bolster my answer.

Let me consider conducting a search to find some data or case studies that illustrate these benefits.

Online Retailing Advantages And Key…
Sep 28
E-Commerce WebsitesOnline Business
Even though the notion of retailing online is not new, many retailers still do not operate an e-commerce website. There are many online retailing advantages and key benefits that retailers could harness by operating successful online retail stores.
There are some key benefits that are hard to ignore, when it comes to online retailing. Selling online is just very efficient, has lower barriers to entry, streamlined communication, improved customer service, and so much more.
Start-up businesses and smaller companies especially benefit from online retailing. Selling directly to the customer often gives a business the highest profit margins vs. brick and mortar distribution deals. Here are some of the major online retailing advantages and key benefits.
Lower business overhead and operating costs.
In comparison to getting a brick and mortar store started to retail, selling online is extremely cost-effective. Even with a marketing budget for the first 2 years, it is often still less than opening up a physical store. Online retailing is cost-effective, fast to launch, quick reach to the market, and the overhead and operating costs are minimal in comparison.
Greater sales reach and customer accessibility.
Retailing products online gives a business much larger sales reach. At the same time customers have a greater experience and accessibility to products and services. E-commerce websites represent a brand 24/7, every day of the year, and worldwide. This would be hard to beat with a brick and mortar retail business.
Improved communications channels.
When retailing online, communication is often improved across multiple channels. Through email, chat, online forms, and the website brands quickly publish information streamlined. Online retailing allows brands to efficiently take orders, process shipments, payments, and communicate with suppliers, vendors, and potential customers.
Ability to integrate valuable reporting tools.
Online retailing allows for a complete integration of reporting tools such as Google Analytics, which provide statistics and critical metrics to retail successfully online. These tools make it very easy for business owners to gain valuable insights to their businesses.
To gain more insight into getting started with online retailing, entrepreneurs and businesses can obtain help through consulting services. A consultant can quickly shed light onto options and assist with tasks and processes. Consulting services enable companies to gain the valuable insights prior to allocating money or making decisions.
Retailing online can be a lucrative business, when done right. Consultants can run all the right reports to gain the facts on demand, competition, and online opportunities for their clients. Clients get the facts prior to investing into retailing online. It is a more secure and save method to get started with an online business and retailing online.

When manufacturers sell directly to consumers online, retailers benefit
Jun 10, 2014
More than half of manufacturers that sell directly to consumers via the web say they’ve avoided angering retailers that sell their goods—quite the opposite, in fact, according to a new study.
One reason many manufacturers have hesitated to sell directly to consumers via the web is the fear that doing so would negatively impact retailers who sell their products, and possibly lead those merchants to turn to other suppliers. But that conventional wisdom might not be true.
More than half of manufacturers who report selling directly to consumers on their own e-commerce sites report it has had a positive effect on relationships with other sales channels, according to a study commissioned by Digital River Inc. and completed by Forrester Research Inc. Only 9% reported a negative effect while 36% reported the effect was neutral.
Forrester conducted an online survey of 109 U.S. sales channel decision-makers at brand manufacturing organizations for the report from March to April 2014. Overall, customer satisfaction drove manufacturers to launch a direct-to-consumer sales channel, with 72% of respondents citing a closer relationship with consumers as a reason for creating a direct-to-consumer sales channel. And it worked. 82% of respondents said selling directly to consumers improved their customer relationships, and 76% reported that it improved customer experience.
They also sell a lot. “One of the most striking findings in the study was that an overwhelming majority of companies that have implemented direct-to-consumer e-commerce channels—76 percent—reported that their programs either met or exceeded revenue targets,” said Scott Heimes, Digital River senior vice president and chief marketing officer.
Of those respondents saying they met or exceeded revenue targets, about 3.9% said revenue was well above target, 40.8% said revenue was somewhat above target, and 55.3% said revenue met target.

“The research also addressed a key barrier to direct-to-consumer channel adoption—the fear that it would conflict with other channels,” says Heimes. “Instead, the study found that if handled appropriately, direct-to-consumer channels can actually enhance the performance of other channels.”
The manufacturers citing an improved relationship noted several reasons. 54% said “channel partners”—that is, retailers that sell the manufacturers’ products—saw incremental sales because the manufacturer routed some or all of its direct-to-consumer online channel orders to retailers for fulfillment. 49% said direct-to-consumer sales have increased brand awareness and created incremental sales for channel partners. 49% said direct-to-consumer sales have increased brand awareness and created incremental leads and visitors for merchants that sell their products. 27% report retailers are able to focus on items that are profitable for them to sell while letting the manufacturers themselves offer the lower-volume products. And 14% reported the ability to test new products before passing on new items to retailers as a positive benefit.

The Advantages of Online Retailing and Sales Channels
The Advantages of Online Retailing and Sales Channels
Small Business

Running a Business

Sales
By Fraser Sherman
Online United States commerce in 2009 totaled $145 billion, according to the Census Bureau's figures. Online sales are part of everyday business life for everyone from toy stores to groceries to engineering firms. Your business can gain considerable advantage by maintaining an online sales presence, including multiple sales channels.
Online Retailing
Businesses with an interest in online retailing can go any one of several routes. Some businesses, such as Amazon and Netflix, dispense with the cost and staffing requirements of a brick-and-mortar store and exist only on the Internet. Other companies, such as Barnes & Noble, use their store and their website as two separate sales channels. In addition to conventional retail, online sales also include business-to-business transactions and consumer to consumer sales, such as eBay offers.
Online Advantages
Using the Internet as your primary sales channel offers multiple advantages. Building a website is cheaper than opening a store, and you can reach customers online anywhere in the world. Shopping is easy and comfortable for customers, and you can customize their experience based on past sales and preferences. Some businesses still work better offline, however: Clothes shopping, where there's no way to confirm the fit until the customer tries the outfit on, doesn't adapt as well to e-commerce as selling books or ordering flowers.
Multiple Channels
Instead of adding a second sales channel to your brick-and-mortar operation, online retailing may be able to add several. The TWO Chemical Logistics firm, for example, has set up a web portal that chemical producers and other companies in the industry can use to sell their services or products. Users can use TWO's portal rather than set up their own online sales site or they can use it as a second channel.
Considerations
Even if your brick-and-mortar store is your major sales channel, there are still advantages to having an online presence. Consumers who don't want to shop online may still do research, looking up product specs, studying dress designs and comparing your prices to those of your competition. If you decide to move into e-commerce with your own website, you'll have to do it right: An attractive site that's easy to use and to navigate is essential if you want visitors to return.

Why Businesses Must Embrace Omnichannel Retail
Businesses need to adopt omnichannel retail strategies to connect with customers, increase foot traffic, drive sales, and survive in the digital age.
The retail industry is constantly changing. Major retailers are recognizing that the industry has become very competitive, partly due to technological disruptions, demanding customers, and changing shopping behavior. Retailers that are unable to adapt and respond to these challenges now find it challenging to thrive and survive in the industry.
Those in the industry that are able to thrive are the ones that are strategically responding and adapting to digital forces by creating a better retail experience for their customers, building modern retail supply chains, and, most importantly, using omnichannel retail strategies. Omnichannel allows retailers to achieve more availability, drive sales and traffic, and integrate digital touchpoints.
An omnichannel retail strategy improves the customer experience and provides more channels for customer purchase––whether it is on mobile, web, or in stores. The availability of multiple purchasing channels leads to an increase in sales and traffic. In fact, omnichannel customers spend 15 to 30% more than single or multi-channel customers. A joint study by Google, Ipsos MediaCT, and Sterling Brands also found that 75% of consumers are more likely to visit a store if they come across local retail information on the web. By leveraging multiple  channels, omnichannel retail not only increases revenue from online retail, but also drives significant traffic to stores, further increasing revenue.

Additionally, omnichannel retail allows consumers to start and complete purchases on different channels. A customer can now see that an item is available in store, and reserve it online to pick it up from the nearest store location. This constant information creates a better retail journey for customers, because retailers can build a relationship with their customer-base and are able to engage with them on a personal, immediate level through a variety of purchasing channels.
Another study – conducted by Harvard – found that omnichannel customers are also more likely to engage with a retailer’s channels, specifically their digital touchpoints. This includes using mobile applications, downloading coupons, and even engaging with price-checkers, self-serve kiosks, and other in store digital touchpoints. Similarly, the study, which examined 46,000 shoppers, concluded that omnichannel customers are more valuable than single-channel customers .
In order to thrive in the competitive retail industry, retailers must build omnichannel retail strategies that look beyond having an online- or store-only presence. Instead, they should provide an integrated and seamless shopping experience for their customers by maintaining a strong physical store presence (e.g. brick-and-mortar store) and leveraging multiple online channels (e.g. social media or text messages), devices (e.g. mobile or desktop), while – most importantly – leveraging the latest digital touchpoints (e.g. kiosks or smart shelf technologies).
Multiple types of digital touchpoints are entering and disrupting the retail industry. This includes interactive kiosks, smart shelf technologies, and self-serve tablets. According to a study by Forrester, digital touchpoints affect approximately 49% of total U.S. retail sales. Additionally, a Nielsen consumer survey found that stores with digital signs near checkout lines, for example, have witnessed increases in sales of up to 33%. This demonstrates that a successful omnichannel retail strategy does not end with establishing a store and online presence; rather, it begins when retailers supplement their strategies with the latest digital touchpoints and drive sales by catering content to customers at the right time and place.
Overall, the retail industry is a competitive space that is constantly changing and subject to multiple competitive pressures, technological and otherwise. The competition is stronger than ever, digital forces are changing how we shop, and consumer purchasing habits are more restrained. The retail environment is changing and players must find innovative ways to respond to digital forces, consumer behavioral patterns, and other challenges; and, as demonstrated, omnichannel retail is one effective solution.
How to Achieve Omnichannel Retail
Becoming a successful omnichannel retailer is challenging. It requires retailers to build multiple touchpoints, standardize their customer experience, integrate their online store presence with their physical one, and create a better retail experience for each customer––all in one place.
This is challenging to do, especially in an age where all this information lies in data silos. For example, a retailer may have an on-premise legacy system that needs to be integrated to a mobile application, as well as a CRM system, a social media platform management system, and so on. As a result, retailers are forced to combine various applications, systems, and processes. And as newer systems emerge, this integration challenge becomes more daunting.
This challenge might lend itself to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach. In this solution, the application logic is broken down into individual services, and later reused across multiple channels. However, SOA is heavyweight and lacks future-proof capabilities, which makes it a suboptimal solution for creating a successful omnichannel retail strategy.
This is why we recommend an API-led connectivity approach to integration, which takes the principles of SOA, and makes them more achievable with the modern API. This approach to integration unifies connectivity and orchestration services through reusable building blocks that are uncovered by APIs.
Through API-led connectivity, retailers can standardize their digital retail experience and link their online and physical presences through plug-and-play functionality by connecting various systems and applications––including websites, mobile applications, and ERPs easily. This allows retailers to bring online multiple experiences and applications in an agile, sustainable, reusable, and future-proof fashion.
Several businesses are already using API-led connectivity to further their omnichannel retail strategies. An example of this would be one of our customers in North America. This retailer has a business model of bricks-and-mortar stores that show goods that customers can rent instead of purchase. You pay a monthly fee to lease sofas, TVs, desks, and other furniture items. Due to technological innovations and changing consumer habits, however, this retailer needed to rethink their business model and incorporate elements of omnichannel retail.
Our customer realized that their revenue growth potential is limited by the number of brick-and-mortar stores they have, so they decided to enter into a number of different partnerships with other retailers. The partnership entailed installing integrated digital touchpoints – specifically digital kiosks and booths – in partner retail stores. This allowed our customer to employ an effective omnichannel strategy and those retailers also benefited from the partner’s services through the digital kiosk.
Ultimately, our customer was able to create an effective omnichannel retail strategy with an API-led connectivity approach to open up new purchasing channels––from customers buying items in the kiosks to actual purchase orders being generated on the back-end. They could now engage their customers in new and innovative ways.

5 Key Benefits of Running an Online Retailing Business

5 Key Benefits of Running an Online Retail Business
Ezra Cabrera
Updated: November 22, 2019
The idea of retailing online isn’t something new. However, countless sellers out there still choose not to operate their e-commerce websites. Many of those who continue to dismiss online retailing find themselves applying for retail business loans to keep their brick-and-mortar doors open for business.
If you’re one of them, you’ll need to start thinking about trading online because today’s consumers are shifting to ordering products on the internet. A quarter of today’s total retail market is accounted for by online sales. In the United States alone, over 60% of consumers purchase items online from the comfort of their home 24-7.
This increasing demand for online purchasing compels both small and large businesses to move from brick-and-mortar stores to e-stores. We can safely say that online retailing shows no signs of stopping its expansion anytime soon. It will continue to grow at an astonishing rate well into the future.
If you’re an owner of a business, you can harness many benefits if you decide to develop your own online retailing business. Any industry vertical can enjoy the complete range of benefits that e-commerce can offer.
Here are some key advantages of operating an online retailing business.
1. Reduced Business Overhead and Operating Costs
Getting physical stores started to retail can easily become capital-intensive because you’ll need to hire customer-facing staff and acquire expensive retail locations. With online retailing, you won’t be required to do either. The overhead and operating costs involved in selling your products online will be minimal.
This gives you plenty of opportunities to invest your money in business solutions that help improve your marketing strategies while providing a better customer experience on your e-commerce site. What’s even better is, when you sell directly to a customer, you’ll enjoy higher profit margins compared to brick-and-mortar distribution set-ups.
2. Provides Accessibility for Customers 24-7/365
If you decide to retail your products online, you’ll find out that your business will have a much greater sales reach. Unlike brick-and-mortar retail businesses that operate within certain business hours, e-commerce websites can represent your brand 24/7 each day of the year. This means that online selling will make it easier for your target customers to gain access to your products and services.
Plus, you can also choose to set up an online shop at popular digital marketplaces that include Amazon and eBay. It only takes a few clicks for you to generate numerous business transactions from your customers.
3. No Geographical Limitations When It Comes to Selling
With online retailing, your customers can reach you through multiple channels that include chat, email, and online forms. You’ll also be allowed to efficiently process shipments, take orders, and coordinate with vendors and suppliers with greater ease.
Furthermore, selling products across the world won’t be an issue. Running physical stores will limit any merchant from offering products and services beyond its geographical area. However, with online retailing businesses, sellers can showcase their complete range of products without dealing with any geographical limits.
The ability to expand your market beyond local customers may cause you to reach out to consumers from other countries as well. When a strong demand for your products takes place abroad, you can simply offer your website in another language. Some merchants decide to team up with overseas companies to respond to these demands.
4. Consumer Buying Habits are Monitored
One of the awesome things about an online retailing business is that you can easily monitor a consumer’s purchasing habits. Once you can identify the key interests, online merchants can create offers that perfectly fit their prospective customer’s requirements. Constant satisfaction of their needs is crucial to improving ongoing relationships with your buyers and building long-lasting relationships with them.
5. Integration of Valuable Reporting Tools
Since online retailing allows merchants to integrate reporting tools such as Google Analytics, capturing critical metrics and statistics can be automatically generated. This will make it easier for online sellers to gain insights that will help them make sound business decisions.
Curious to Know More About Retail Business Loans?
E-commerce is one of the many profitable businesses today. When done right, it can provide entrepreneurs with a lot of advantages like higher profits and lesser overhead costs. With the increasing use of the internet today, it’s the perfect time for brick-and-mortar businesses to think about going online.
Do you want to get your online retailing business off the ground with a running start? Perhaps you’re looking to increase your working capital or purchase new inventory or even additional equipment. If you have any of these concerns, you can get all the details regarding retail business loans. Not only will it help you start your business on a good note, but it will also open a lot of opportunities for your company.

Alright, so from the search results, I can see that there are several benefits that traditional store-based retailers can gain by adding internet channels to their operations. Let me try to summarize and organize these benefits.

First, there's the issue of increased reach and accessibility. By having an online presence, retailers can reach customers beyond their physical location. This means they can serve people who live far away or those who prefer shopping from home. One of the documents mentions that online retailing allows for a "greater sales reach" and provides "accessibility for customers 24-7/365." So, basically, customers can shop anytime, anywhere, which can lead to more sales opportunities.

Second, cost efficiency seems to be a significant advantage. Setting up an e-commerce platform might require some initial investment, but overall, it can be more cost-effective than maintaining physical stores. For example, online retailers don't have to pay for rent, utilities, and a large in-store staff. This can lead to lower overhead and operating costs, allowing retailers to potentially pass savings on to customers or increase their profit margins.

Third, data and analytics play a crucial role in online retailing. E-commerce platforms can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and preferences. This data can be used to improve marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and optimize inventory management. One of the documents notes that online retailing allows for the "integration of valuable reporting tools" like Google Analytics, which can help retailers make informed decisions.

Fourth, integrating online and offline channels can create a seamless shopping experience. Many retailers are adopting omnichannel strategies, where online and in-store operations are connected. This can include features like buy online pick up in store (BOPIS), returns in store for online purchases, and in-store browsing with online ordering. This integration can enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Fifth, expanded product offerings are possible with online channels. Physical stores have limited space, but online platforms allow retailers to offer a wider range of products without the constraints of physical storage. This can attract customers who are looking for specific items that may not be available in local stores.

Sixth, competitive advantage is another benefit. In today's digital age, having an online presence is almost essential for retail businesses. By adding internet channels, traditional retailers can compete more effectively with pure-play e-commerce companies and other competitors who already have a strong online footprint.

Seventh, enhanced customer engagement is possible through social media and other online platforms. Retailers can interact with their customers in new ways, build brand loyalty, and receive immediate feedback.

Lastly, access to new markets, including international markets, is facilitated through online channels. Retailers can reach customers worldwide, provided they have the logistics and infrastructure to handle cross-border shipments.

It's also worth noting that some manufacturers who sell directly to consumers online have reported positive effects on their relationships with other retailers. One of the documents mentions that more than half of manufacturers selling directly to consumers online say it has had a positive effect on relationships with other sales channels. This could be because retailers benefit from increased brand awareness and potentially incremental sales.

In conclusion, adding internet channels to traditional store-based retail operations can lead to increased reach, cost efficiency, better data insights, integrated shopping experiences, expanded product offerings, competitive advantage, enhanced customer engagement, and access to new markets. These benefits collectively contribute to improved business performance and customer satisfaction.
