As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and arguments for both sides of this issue to help you form your own opinion.

Firstly, let's understand what is being asked. The question is whether the state government should provide resources to unemployed, under-employed, and financially struggling Texans. This involves considering the role of government in supporting its citizens, especially those who are facing economic hardships.

**Arguments in Favor:**

1. **Social Responsibility:** One argument is that the state has a social responsibility to care for its most vulnerable citizens. By providing resources to those who are unemployed, under-employed, or financially struggling, the government can help ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare.

2. **Economic Stability:** Supporting those who are struggling can also have broader economic benefits. For example, providing unemployment benefits can help maintain consumer spending during economic downturns, which can stabilize the economy.

3. **Investment in Human Capital:** By providing resources such as job training and education, the state can help individuals improve their employability and contribute more to the economy in the long run.

4. **Reducing Inequality:** Targeted support can help reduce income inequality and promote a more equitable society.

**Arguments Against:**

1. **Cost and Taxation:** Providing resources to those who are struggling can be expensive, and may require increased taxation. Some argue that this places an unfair burden on taxpayers, especially those who are already struggling themselves.

2. **Dependency:** There is a concern that providing too much support can create dependency, discouraging people from seeking employment or improving their skills.

3. **Meritocracy:** Some believe that a merit-based system is the best way to allocate resources, and that providing support to those who are not working or not working enough may undermine this principle.

4. **Limited Resources:** State governments have limited resources, and some may argue that these resources should be allocated to other priorities, such as infrastructure, education, or public safety.

**Conclusion:**

Ultimately, whether the state government should provide resources to unemployed, under-employed, and financially struggling Texans is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. It requires careful consideration of the state's resources, the needs of its citizens, and the potential impact on the economy and society as a whole.

\boxed{\text{The decision should be based on a balanced consideration of social responsibility, economic stability, and the efficient use of state resources.}}
