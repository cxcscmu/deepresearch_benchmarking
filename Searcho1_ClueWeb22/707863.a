So I have this question: "Why are public goods a market failure?" Hmm, I'm not super confident about this, but let's see. I know that public goods are things like parks or street lights that everyone can use and enjoy, right? So, why would that be a problem for markets?

First, I need to understand what market failure is. Market failure happens when the allocation of goods and services by the free market isn't efficient. That means the quantity of a good or service produced isn't what society needs or wants. There are different reasons for market failure, like externalities, monopoly power, and, apparently, public goods.

So, public goods are different from private goods. Private goods are things like apples or cars—when one person buys an apple, no one else can eat it. It's exclusive and rivalrous. But public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means you can't prevent people from using them, like a lighthouse guiding ships. Non-rivalrous means one person's use doesn't reduce another's ability to use it, like a public park.

Now, why does this cause market failure? Well, in a free market, businesses produce goods and services that people are willing to pay for. But with public goods, since anyone can use them without paying, there's a problem. People might say, "I'll let someone else pay for it, and I'll just use it for free." This is called the free-rider problem.

So, if everyone thinks like that, no one pays for the public good, and eventually, no one provides it. That's why the market fails to produce the optimal amount of public goods. It's a situation where the private sector doesn't have an incentive to supply something that would benefit society as a whole.

Let me think of an example. Take national defense. It's a public good because it protects everyone, and one person's protection doesn't reduce another's. Also, it's hard to exclude people from being protected by the military. So, if national defense were left to the market, some people might not pay for it, expecting others to do so. As a result, national defense might be underprovided or not provided at all.

Another example is public parks. If a park is built, everyone can enjoy it, whether they paid for it or not. So, individuals might not see a direct benefit from paying for the park, leading to underfunding.

I recall that public goods are often provided by the government because the government can collect taxes from all citizens and provide these goods for the common good. This way, everyone contributes to the cost, even if some try to free-ride.

But why can't the market provide public goods adequately? It's because of the characteristics of public goods. Since they're non-excludable, companies can't charge users directly. And since they're non-rivalrous, one more person using the good doesn't affect anyone else's usage, so there's no natural price mechanism to limit usage.

Let me try to think about it differently. Suppose there's a company that wants to provide a public good, like a fireworks display. To recoup the costs, they might try to charge admission, but that would make it excludable, which goes against the nature of a public good. If they don't charge, how do they pay for it?

Maybe in some cases, private charities or donations could fund public goods, but relying on donations might not always ensure sufficient funding, especially for large-scale public goods like infrastructure.

I think another issue is that public goods can have positive externalities. Externalities are costs or benefits that affect parties who did not choose to incur those costs or benefits. For public goods, the benefits spill over to everyone, not just the payers. So, the social benefit is greater than the private benefit, and the market only responds to private benefits.

Therefore, the market will undersupply public goods because it doesn't account for the full social benefit. Only the government, acting in the interest of society, can correct this market failure by providing or subsidizing public goods.

Wait a minute, but not all public goods are provided by the government. For example, open-source software is a public good created by volunteers and developers who contribute their time and effort without necessarily receiving direct payment. So, maybe there are exceptions where public goods can be provided without government intervention.

However, even in such cases, there might be elements of coordination or collective action that are needed to pool resources or efforts. It's not entirely through the free market mechanism.

Let me see if I can find more information on this. Maybe I should look up some definitions or examples to confirm my understanding.

Market Failure - Definition, Causes, and How to Address
Home › Resources › Knowledge › Economics › Market Failure
What is Market Failure?
Market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In a typical free market, the prices of goods and services are determined by the forces of supply and demand, and any change in one of the forces results in a price change and a corresponding change in the other force. The changes lead to a price equilibrium.
Market failure occurs when there is a state of disequilibrium in the market due to market distortion. It takes place when the quantity of goods or services supplied is not equal to the quantity of goods or services demanded. Some of the distortions that may affect the free market may include monopoly power, price limits, minimum wage requirements, and government regulations.
Causes of Market Failures
Market failure may occur in the market for several reasons, including:
1. Externality
An externality refers to a cost or benefit resulting from a transaction that affects a third party that did not decide to be associated with the benefit or cost. It can be positive or negative. A positive externality provides a positive effect on the third party. For example, providing good public education mainly benefits the students, but the benefits of this public good will spill over to the whole society.
On the other hand, a negative externality is a negative effect resulting from the consumption of a product, and that results in a negative impact on a third party. For example, even though cigarette smoking is primarily harmful to a smoker, it also causes a negative health impact on people around the smoker.
2. Public goods
Public goods are goods that are consumed by a large number of the population, and their cost does not increase with the increase in the number of consumers. Public goods are both non-rivalrous as well as non-excludable. Non-rivalrous consumption means that the goods are allocated efficiently to the whole population if provided at zero cost, while non-excludable consumption means that the public goods cannot exclude non-payers from its consumption.
Public goods create market failures if a section of the population that consumes the goods fails to pay but continues using the good as actual payers. For example, police service is a public good that every citizen is entitled to enjoy, regardless of whether or not they pay taxes to the government.
3. Market control
Market control occurs when either the buyer or the seller possesses the power to determine the price of goods or services in a market. The power prevents the natural forces of demand and supply from setting the prices of goods in the market.
On the supply side, the sellers may control the prices of goods and services if there are only a few large sellers (oligopoly) or a single large seller (monopoly). The sellers may collude to set higher prices to maximize their returns. The sellers may also control the quantity of goods produced in the market and may collude to create scarcity and increase the prices of commodities.
On the demand side, the buyers possess the power to control the prices of goods if the market only comprises a single large buyer (monopsony) or a few large buyers (oligopsony). If there is only a single or a handful of large buyers, the buyers may exercise their dominance by colluding to set the price at which they are willing to buy the products from the producers. The practice prevents the market from equating the supply of goods and services to their demand.
4. Imperfect information in the market
Market failure may also result from the lack of appropriate information among the buyers or sellers. This means that the price of demand or supply does not reflect all the benefits or opportunity cost of a good. The lack of information on the buyer’s side may mean that the buyer may be willing to pay a higher or lower price for the product because they don’t know its actual benefits.
On the other hand, inadequate information on the seller’s side may mean that they may be willing to accept a higher or lower price for the product than the actual opportunity cost of producing it.
Solutions to Market Failures
In order to eliminate market failures, several remedies can be implemented. They include:
1. Use of legislation
One of the ways that governments can manage market failures is by implementing legislation that changes behavior. For example, the government can ban cars from operating in city centers, or impose high penalties to businesses that sell alcohol to underage children, since the measures control unwanted behaviors.
2. Price mechanism
Price mechanisms are designed to change the behavior of both the consumers and producers. For products that cause harm to consumers, the government can discourage their consumption by increasing taxes. For example, taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are periodically increased to discourage their consumption and reduce their harmful effects on unrelated third parties.

Winston on Market Failure and Government Failure, on EconTalk, December 2009.
Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution talks about the ideas in his book, Market Failure vs. Government Failure, with EconTalk host Russ Roberts. Winston summarizes a large literature on antitrust, safety regulation and environmental regulation. He finds that government regulation often fails to meet its objectives. While markets are imperfect, so is government. Winston argues that idealized theories of government intervention based on textbook theories of market failure are not the way regulation turns out in practice. He argues that special interest politics explains much of the disappointing outcomes of government regulation.
Public goods and externalities. What is an externality? Public Goods and Externalities, from the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics
Most economic arguments for government intervention are based on the idea that the marketplace cannot provide public goods or handle externalities. Public health and welfare programs, education, roads, research and development, national and domestic security, and a clean environment all have been labeled public goods….
Externalities occur when one person’s actions affect another person’s well-being and the relevant costs and benefits are not reflected in market prices. A positive externality arises when my neighbors benefit from my cleaning up my yard. If I cannot charge them for these benefits, I will not clean the yard as often as they would like. (Note that the free-rider problem and positive externalities are two sides of the same coin.) A negative externality arises when one person’s actions harm another. When polluting, factory owners may not consider the costs that pollution imposes on others….

What is a public good? Defense, from the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics
National defense is a public good. That means two things. First, consumption of the good by one person does not reduce the amount available for others to consume. Thus, all people in a nation must “consume” the same amount of national defense (the defense policy established by the government). Second, the benefits a person derives from a public good do not depend on how much that person contributes toward providing it. Everyone benefits, perhaps in differing amounts, from national defense, including those who do not pay taxes. Once the government organizes the resources for national defense, it necessarily defends all residents against foreign aggressors….
Market-clearing vs. sticky prices: New Keynesian Economics, from the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics
The primary disagreement between new classical and new Keynesian economists is over how quickly wages and prices adjust. New classical economists build their macroeconomic theories on the assumption that wages and prices are flexible. They believe that prices “clear” markets—balance supply and demand—by adjusting quickly. New Keynesian economists, however, believe that market-clearing models cannot explain short-run economic fluctuations, and so they advocate models with “sticky” wages and prices. New Keynesian theories rely on this stickiness of wages and prices to explain why involuntary unemployment exists and why monetary policy has such a strong influence on economic activity….
Markets can fail if there are no property rights and negotiation is costly. The Coase Theorem: Ronald H. Coase, biography from the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics
“The Problem of Social Cost,” Coase’s other widely cited article (661 citations between 1966 and 1980), was even more path-breaking. Indeed, it gave rise to the field called law and economics. Economists b.c. (Before Coase) of virtually all political persuasions had accepted British economist Arthur Pigou’s idea that if, say, a cattle rancher’s cows destroy his neighboring farmer’s crops, the government should stop the rancher from letting his cattle roam free or should at least tax him for doing so. Otherwise, believed economists, the cattle would continue to destroy crops because the rancher would have no incentive to stop them.
But Coase challenged the accepted view. He pointed out that if the rancher had no legal liability for destroying the farmer’s crops, and if transaction costs were zero, the farmer could come to a mutually beneficial agreement with the rancher under which the farmer paid the rancher to cut back on his herd of cattle. This would happen, argued Coase, if the damage from additional cattle exceeded the rancher’s net returns on these cattle. If for example, the rancher’s net return on a steer was two dollars, then the rancher would accept some amount over two dollars to give up the additional steer. If the steer was doing three dollars’ worth of harm to the crops, then the farmer would be willing to pay the rancher up to three dollars to get rid of the steer. A mutually beneficial bargain would be struck….
An Education in Market Failure, by Morgan Rose. Teacher’s Corner at Econlib, March 11, 2002.
Markets are fantastic at allocating resources well by making sure that if there is a good or a service that a person values more highly than it would cost to produce it, then somebody (maybe the same person, but most likely not) will decide to produce it, a market exchange will take place, and both parties will be better off. If I think an order of chicken wings is worth more than six dollars….
Markets can be problematic where the net private benefit of a market transaction does not equal the net social benefit, which is the social benefit (the sum of private benefits of all individuals in a society) minus the social cost (the sum of private costs of all individuals in a society)….
In the News and Examples
There exists a tendency to automatically assume that the “solution” to a market failure is necessarily some form of government intervention. Not so fast… Is Market Failure a Sufficient Condition for Government Intervention? by Art Carden and Steven Horwitz at Econlib. April 1, 2013.
Externalities, public goods, asymmetric information, and market power provide necessary—but insufficient—conditions for intervention to be justified. They certainly are not talismans that provide interventionists with carte blanche to tinker with the members of a society as if they were pieces on a chessboard. Too often, critics of markets think that merely invoking these terms destroys the case for free markets.

Coase on Externalities, the Firm, and the State of Economics on EconTalk, May 2012.
Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase of the University of Chicago talks with EconTalk host Russ Roberts about his career, the current state of economics, and the Chinese economy. Coase, born in 1910, reflects on his youth, his two great papers, “The Nature of the Firm” and “The Problem of Social Cost”. At the end of conversation he discusses his new book on China, How China Became Capitalist (co-authored with Ning Wang), and the future of the Chinese and world economies.
“The Failure of Market Failure,” Part I and Part II, by Anthony de Jasay at Econlib. October 2, 2006 and November 2, 2006, respectively.
Received wisdom advances two broad reasons why government is entitled to impose its will on its subjects, and why the subjects owe it obedience, provided its will is exercised according to certain (constitutional) rules. One reason is rooted in production, the other in distribution—the two aspects of social cooperation. Ordinary market mechanisms produce and distribute the national income, but this distribution is disliked by the majority of the subjects (notably because it is ‘too unequal’) and it is for government to redistribute it (making it more equal or bend it in other ways, a function that its partisans prefer to call ‘doing social justice’). However, the market is said to be deficient even at the task of producing the national income in the first place. Government is needed to overcome market failure. A society of rational individuals would grasp this and readily mandate the government to do what was needful (e.g. by taxation, regulation and policing) to put this right.
In this two-part essay, I claim that at least some, if not the whole, of the market failure argument fails to prove its case. In Part I, I look at the problem of contract enforcement and in Part II at the provision of public goods. There have been other writings using related arguments to the same effect, but one more such will not be too many.

Market failure occurs where free markets fail to allocate scarce resources efficiently. Market failure can come in many forms, the main four are public goods, Merit goods, Externalities and imperfect competition. In this report, I will investigate the relationship between these four main factors and the free market.
Public goods are goods and services that cannot be provided by the private sector. Public goods can be classified as pure public goods and quasi-public goods. Pure public goods are not at all provided by the private sector – hence there is a market failure due to ‘missing markets’. This is partly due to the ‘free rider’ principle – i.e people are able to access, consume and benefit from public goods without being required to pay for them. Pure public goods have two stands out characteristics, these are;
? Non-rival – consumption of the good by one person does not reduce the amount available for consumption by another person. Eg. Terrestrial television services provided by the BBC.
? Non-excludable – where it is not possible to provide a good or service to one person without it thereby being available for others to enjoy – if you cannot exclude the non-payers, a profit-motivated business may decide not to supply these products e.g defense systems, lighthouse protection.
Quasi-public goods are goods that are not purely public, this means that they are public in nature but do not display fully the characteristics of non-excludability and non-rivalry. An example of this would be roads, they may become rivals at peak time.
Merit goods are goods and services which are deemed to be socially desirable, and which are expected to be under-produced and under-consumed. Examples of merit goods would be education, health care, welfare services and public parks. In contrast to pure public goods, merit goods could be, and indeed are, provided through the market but not necessary in sufficient quantities to maximize social welfare. Merit goods have a tendency to be underprovided by the market because;
? They generate positive externalities
? There is an unequal distribution of income
? Consumers may lack perfect information
? Consumers may be uncertain as to their future needs
An externality is an impact on a person not connected to the initial transaction. An externality arises when a person engages in an activity that influences the well-being of a bystander and yet neither pays nor receives any compensation for that effect. When the effect on the bystander is unfavorable, the externality is called a negative externality. When the effect on the bystander is beneficial, the externality is called a positive externality.
Positive externalities include;
? Education
? Perfume
? Parks
Negative externalities include;
? Pollution
? Anti-social behavior
Imperfect competition is a competitive market situation where there are many sellers, but they are selling heterogeneous (dissimilar) goods as opposed to the perfectly competitive market scenario. As the name suggests, competitive markets that impact in nature.
Impact competition is the real world completion. Today some of the industries and sellers follow it to earn surplus profits. In this market scenario, the seller enjoys the luxury of influencing the price in order to earn more profits. If a seller is selling a nonidentical good in the market, then he can raise the prices and earn profits. High profits attract other sellers to enter the market and sellers, who are incurring losses, can very easily exit the market.
There are four types of imperfect markets;
? monopoly (only one seller)
? Oligopoly (few sellers of goods)
? Monopolistic competition (many sellers with highly differentiated)
? Monopsony (only one buyer of a product)
Universal Credit is a government policy on welfare. Universal Credit was brought in to replace 6 benefits, these were; child tax credit, housing benefit, income support, income-based jobseekers allowance, income-related employment and support allowance and working tax credit. The initial idea was outlined by the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith at the Conservative Party annual conference in 2010. The aim was for the policy to be brought in fully over four years, two parliaments and to merge the previously mentioned benefits. Universal Credit was brought in to streamline the benefits system and to make claiming benefits easier as you did not have to apply six times you only had to apply once.
Universal Credit was part of the 2012 Welfare Reform Act. Universal Credit works by having one monthly payment. This payment is made up of basic ‘standard allowance’ and extra payments that might apply depending on the circumstances of the claimant. With universal credit, there is a 7-day waiting period where you do not receive any money, you then may have to wait up to seven weeks to get the first payment.
There has been a lot of criticism about universal credit mainly regarding the long waiting period between first applying for it and the first payment. The government claims that this time is necessary for the claim to be assessed. In the period from applying to getting the benefits people who rely on the government to pay their rent have to pay it themselves and this can lead people into serious debt. In figures obtained by the Labour Party, it was revealed that half of all council tenants on universal credit are at least a month in arrears with their rent.
Universal Credit has been regularly criticised by newspapers and opinion shows. This is because of the long wait between application and payment. Research shows that people waiting for the payments have fallen into debt and when the payment does eventually come through they have to spend a proportion of that money to try and get them out of debt.

What Is A Public Good?
Any commodity or service that any organization, individual, or government provides to the public for free without any profit is called a public good. In most cases, the government pays for these kinds of services using public taxes.
However, economists do not consider all goods financed through taxes as public goods. To them, any product that contains the two following characteristics is good enough to include in this category:
Non-excludable
Non-rivalrous
Therefore, to define any commodity or service as a public good, you must ensure that they fulfill the two essential traits.
A public good is non-excludable because the public can use the service regardless of whether they pay for it or not. No one can be excluded from using the service based on any form of discrimination as well.
On top of this, a public good is also non-rivalrous. It means that when one person uses a public good, it does not stop another from using it. These services do not dwindle in supply no matter how many people use them.

What Do You Mean By Market Failure?
When there is an insufficient distribution of goods and resources in the free market, the situation is termed a market failure. In any free market, the supply and demand of goods determine the prices. If there is more demand, then the price increases and vice versa. Thereby, the market maintains an equilibrium.
However, the problem arises when the supply of goods and services diminishes in comparison to the demand. Market failures occur when individuals or groups base their actions on self-interest and produce less than the optimum number of products. As a result, these individuals end up incurring too many costs or less benefit.
You can know more about market failure from our economics sample papers available online. Our professional economists will provide you the perfect guidance to write an excellent essay on market failure.

What Are The Causes Of Market Failure?
Many causes can lead to market distortion and market failure when the supply cannot meet the demand. Let's look at some of these:
Externalities
Externalities are the consequences of industrial or commercial activity that affect third parties without them consenting to be associated with the benefit or cost. Externalities can be of two types:
Positive externalities – These externalities end up affecting the third party positively. For example, any company or organisation that employs homeless people helps to reduce the social problem.
Negative externalities – This happens when producing a good provides an external cost to the third party. For example, cutting down trees to make houses and furniture destroys the forest cover on earth, thereby harming the balance of nature.
Public goods
Public goods are non-excludable. Therefore, you will not be able to exclude anyone from using the services. These goods have a hand in market failure when some people who use the commodities or services do not pay for them. For example, everyone is entitled to enjoy the benefits of the police and army whether they pay taxes or not.
Monopoly of control
The monopoly of control happens when a single prominent seller controls the market and determines the price of the products depending on their whims. The seller might decide to sell the product at high costs to maximize the returns or control the availability of the product in the market to manipulate the demands.
This monopoly of control can happen from the buyer's side when one single large buyer exercises their dominance by determining what prices they are willing to buy the product.
Lack of information
Sometimes, market failure may occur when there is a lack of information between the buyer and the seller. As a result, the buyer cannot make an informed choice as they are not aware of the product's actual benefits. This can lead to inaccurate supply and demand.
Moral hazard
Moral hazard occurs when individuals make risky decisions knowing that they will not be affected by the negative consequences of their choices. For example, when you do not have full insurance on your house, you will be more careful because you will have to incur the costs of any damage. However, when your house is fully insured, you will feel less responsible for taking care of the place as someone else will compensate for the loss.
These are some of the leading causes of market failure that you can study for your assignment. On top of this, you also have macroeconomic stability, factor immobility, principle-agent problem, and other causes that can also lead to market failure.

Two Examples Of Public Goods
If you look around your environment, you'll notice that you use many public goods in your daily life. Let's look at five such examples:
Streetlights
Streetlights are one of the best examples of public goods. It is both non-rivalrous in consumption and non-excludable. Everyone enjoys the light regardless of whether they pay taxes or not, and many people can use it at once.
Lighthouses
Lighthouses help to show the path to ships and assist them in navigating through rocky waters. These lighthouses do not pick and choose which ship gets to take advantage of its light. It shines equally for everyone. As a result, it is a textbook definition of a public good.
It is easier to hire a professional writer than spend hours trying to determine the importance of public goods and their examples. At MyAssignmentHelp.com, we provide you with the best plagiarism-free assignments that you could want. So don't hesitate and give us a try.
Two Examples Of Market Failure
There are many examples of market failure that you can study to understand the phenomenon better. Let's have a look at two such examples.
Air Pollution
Air pollution is a textbook example of negative externality where the external cost is not reflected in the products that increase air pollution. However, the third parties have to bear that cost to survive in low quality air.
De-merit goods
There is a market failure when the companies fail to establish the actual cost of their products to the consumers. For example, in the case of smoking, the consumers do not understand the true cost of the products, which can give them lung cancer.

Market failure - Wikipedia
Market failure
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
While factories and refineries provide jobs and wages, they are also an example of a market failure, as they impose negative externalities on the surrounding region via their airborne pollutants.
In neoclassical economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not Pareto efficient, often leading to a net loss of economic value.[1] Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient –  that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. [2] [3] The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, [4] but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher Henry Sidgwick.[5] Market failures are often associated with public goods,[6] time-inconsistent preferences,[7]information asymmetries,[8] non-competitive markets, principal–agent problems, or externalities.[9]
The existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular market.[10] [11] Economists, especially microeconomists, are often concerned with the causes of market failure and possible means of correction. [12] Such analysis plays an important role in many types of public policy decisions and studies.
However, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, wage and price controls, and regulations, may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called government failure.[13] Most mainstream economists believe that there are circumstances (like building codes or endangered species) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome. Several heterodox schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of ideology. [14]
An ecological market failure exists when human activity in a market economy is exhausting critical non-renewable resources, disrupting fragile ecosystems, or overloading biospheric waste absorption capacities. In none of these cases does the criterion of Pareto efficiency obtain. [15]

Categories[edit]
Different economists have different views about what events are the sources of market failure. Mainstream economic analysis widely accepts that a market failure (relative to Pareto efficiency) can occur for three main reasons: if the market is "monopolised" or a small group of businesses hold significant market power, if production of the good or service results in an externality (external costs or benefits), or if the good or service is a "public good ". [16]
Nature of the market[edit]
Main articles: Market structure and market power
Agents in a market can gain market power, allowing them to block other mutually beneficial gains from trade from occurring. This can lead to inefficiency due to imperfect competition, which can take many different forms, such as monopolies,[17] monopsonies, or monopolistic competition, if the agent does not implement perfect price discrimination.
It is then a further question about what circumstances allow a monopoly to arise. In some cases, monopolies can maintain themselves where there are "barriers to entry" that prevent other companies from effectively entering and competing in an industry or market. Or there could exist significant first-mover advantages in the market that make it difficult for other firms to compete. Moreover, monopoly can be a result of geographical conditions created by huge distances or isolated locations. This leads to a situation where there are only few communities scattered across a vast territory with only one supplier. Australia is an example that meets this description. [18] A natural monopoly is a firm whose per-unit cost decreases as it increases output; in this situation it is most efficient (from a cost perspective) to have only a single producer of a good. Natural monopolies display so-called increasing returns to scale. It means that at all possible outputs marginal cost needs to be below average cost if average cost is declining. One of the reasons is the existence of fixed costs, which must be paid without considering the amount of output, what results in a state where costs are evenly divided over more units leading to the reduction of cost per unit. [19]
Nature of the goods[edit]
Non-excludability[edit]
Some markets can fail due to the nature of the goods being exchanged. For instance, some goods can display the attributes of public goods [17] or common goods,[20] wherein sellers are unable to exclude non-buyers from using a product, as in the development of inventions that may spread freely once revealed, such as developing a new method of harvesting. This can cause underinvestment because developers cannot capture enough of the benefits from success to make the development effort worthwhile. This can also lead to resource depletion in the case of common-pool resources, whereby the use of the resource is rival but non-excludable, there is no incentive for users to conserve the resource. An example of this is a lake with a natural supply of fish: if people catch the fish faster than the fish can reproduce, then the fish population will dwindle until there are no fish left for future generations .
Externalities[edit]
A good or service could also have significant externalities,[9] [17] where gains or losses associated with the product, production or consumption of a product, differ from the private cost. These gains or losses are imposed on a third-party that didn't take part in the original market transaction. These externalities can be innate to the methods of production or other conditions important to the market. [3]
“The Problem of Social Cost” illuminates a different path towards social optimum showing the Pigouvian tax is not the only way towards solving externalities. It is hard to say who discovered externalities first since many classical economists saw the importance of education or a lighthouse, but it was Alfred Marshall who wanted to explore this more. He wondered why long-run supply curve under perfect competition could be decreasing so he founded “external economies” ([21] [22] ). Externalities can be positive or negative depending on how a good/service is produced or what the good/service provides to the public. Positive externalities tend to be goods like vaccines, schools, or advancement of technology. They usually provide the public with a positive gain. Negative externalities would be like noise or air pollution. Coase shows this with his example of the case Sturges v. Bridgman it pertained a confectioner and doctor. The confectioner had lived there many years and soon the doctor several years into residency decides to build a consulting room; it is right by the confectioner’s kitchen which releases vibrations from his grinding of pestle and mortar ([23] [24] ). The doctor wins the case by a claim of nuisance so the confectioner would have to cease from using his machine. Coase argues there could have been bargains instead the confectioner could have paid the doctor to continue the source of income from using the machine hopefully it is more than what the Doctor is losing ([25] [26] ). Vice versa the doctor could have paid the confectioner to cease production since he is prohibiting a source of income from the confectioner. Coase used a few more examples similar in scope dealing with social cost of an externality and the possible resolutions.
Traffic congestion is an example of market failure that incorporates both non-excludability and externality. Public roads are common resources that are available for the entire population's use (non-excludable), and act as a complement to cars (the more roads there are, the more useful cars become). Because there is very low cost but high benefit to individual drivers in using the roads, the roads become congested, decreasing their usefulness to society. Furthermore, driving can impose hidden costs on society through pollution (externality). Solutions for this include public transportation, congestion pricing, tolls, and other ways of making the driver include the social cost in the decision to drive. [3]
Perhaps the best example of the inefficiency associated with common/public goods and externalities is the environmental harm caused by pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.[3]
Nature of the exchange[edit]
Some markets can fail due to the nature of their exchange. Markets may have significant transaction costs, agency problems, or informational asymmetry.[3] [17] Such incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency, but also have a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From contract theory, decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other is considered "asymmetry". This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are adverse selection [27] and moral hazard. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of principal–agent problems. George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz developed the idea and shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. [28]
Bounded rationality[edit]
Main article: Bounded rationality
In Models of Man, Herbert A. Simon points out that most people are only partly rational, and are emotional/ irrational in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states "boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information" (Williamson, p. 553, citing Simon). Simon describes a number of dimensions along which "classical" models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while sticking within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:
limiting what sorts of utility functions there might be.
recognizing the costs of gathering and processing information.
the possibility of having a "vector" or "multi-valued" utility function.
Simon suggests that economic agents employ the use of heuristics to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation, and their inability to process and compute the expected utility of every alternative action. Deliberation costs might be high and there are often other, concurrent economic activities also requiring decisions.
Coase theorem[edit]
The Coase theorem, developed by Ronald Coase and labeled as such by George Stigler, states that private transactions are efficient as long as property rights exist, only a small number of parties are involved, and transactions costs are low. Additionally, this efficiency will take place regardless of who owns the property rights. This theory comes from a section of Coase's Nobel prize-winning work The Problem of Social Cost. While the assumptions of low transactions costs and a small number of parties involved may not always be applicable in real-world markets, Coase's work changed the long-held belief that the owner of property rights was a major determining factor in whether or not a market would fail. [29] The Coase theorem points out when one would expect the market to function properly even when there are externalities.
A market is an institution in which individuals or firms exchange not just commodities, but the rights to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. [...] Markets are institutions which organize the exchange of control of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities. [11]
As a result, agents' control over the uses of their goods and services can be imperfect, because the system of rights which defines that control is incomplete.  Typically, this falls into two generalized rights – excludability and transferability.  Excludability deals with the ability of agents to control who uses their commodity, and for how long – and the related costs associated with doing so.  Transferability reflects the right of agents to transfer the rights of use from one agent to another, for instance by selling or leasing a commodity, and the costs associated with doing so.  If a given system of rights does not fully guarantee these at minimal (or no) cost, then the resulting distribution can be inefficient. [11] Considerations such as these form an important part of the work of institutional economics.[30] Nonetheless, views still differ on whether something displaying these attributes is meaningful without the information provided by the market price system. [31]
Business cycles[edit]
Macroeconomic business cycles are a part of the market. They are characterized by constant downswings and upswings which influence economic activity. Therefore, this situation requires some kind of government intervention. [18]
Interpretations and policy examples[edit]
The above causes represent the mainstream view of what market failures mean and of their importance in the economy. This analysis follows the lead of the neoclassical school, and relies on the notion of Pareto efficiency,[32] which can be in the "public interest ", as well as in interests of stakeholders with equity.[12] This form of analysis has also been adopted by the Keynesian or new Keynesian schools in modern macroeconomics, applying it to Walrasian models of general equilibrium in order to deal with failures to attain full employment, or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.
Policies to prevent market failure are already commonly implemented in the economy. For example, to prevent information asymmetry, members of the New York Stock Exchange agree to abide by its rules in order to promote a fair and orderly market in the trading of listed securities.  The members of the NYSE presumably believe that each member is individually better off if every member adheres to its rules – even if they have to forego money-making opportunities that would violate those rules.
A simple example of policies to address market power is government antitrust policies. As an additional example of externalities, municipal governments enforce building codes and license tradesmen to mitigate the incentive to  use cheaper (but more dangerous) construction practices, ensuring that the total cost of new construction includes the (otherwise external)  cost of preventing future tragedies.  The voters who elect municipal officials presumably feel that they are individually better off if everyone complies with the local codes, even if those codes may increase the cost of construction in their communities.
CITES is an international treaty to protect the world's common interest in preserving endangered species – a classic "public good" – against the private interests of poachers, developers and other market participants who might otherwise reap monetary benefits without bearing the known and unknown costs that extinction could create.  Even without knowing the true cost of extinction, the signatory countries believe that the societal costs far outweigh the possible private gains that they have agreed to forego.
Some remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures.  For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the patent system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.
Objections[edit]
See also: Government failure
Public choice[edit]
Economists such as Milton Friedman from the Chicago school and others from the Public Choice school, argue[citation needed] that market failure does not necessarily imply that the government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of government failure might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (rent seekers) both in the private sector and in the government bureaucracy.  Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by coercive government intervention.  Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.
Austrian[edit]
Some advocates of laissez-faire capitalism, including many economists of the Austrian School, argue that there is no such phenomenon as "market failure". Israel Kirzner states that, "Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals." [33] Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals. [34] This definition of efficiency differs from that of Pareto efficiency, and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the first welfare theorem are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of entrepreneurship driven by the profit motive; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting. [35]
Marxian[edit]
Objections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as Marxian analysis. Colloquial uses of the term "market failure" reflect the notion of a market "failing" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency – for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a "market failure", yet are not Pareto inefficient, and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream
economics. [3] In addition, many Marxian economists would argue that the system of private property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of "market failure" which focuses on specific situations – typically seen as "abnormal" – where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically unwanted outcomes – viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy – and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.

In ecological economics, the concept of externalities is considered a misnomer, since market agents are viewed as making their incomes and profits by systematically 'shifting' the social and ecological costs of their activities onto other agents, including future generations. Hence, externalities is a modus operandi of the market, not a failure: The market cannot exist without constantly 'failing'.
The fair and even allocation of non-renewable resources over time is a market failure issue of concern to ecological economics. This issue is also known as 'intergenerational fairness'. It is argued that the market mechanism fails when it comes to allocating the Earth's finite mineral stock fairly and evenly among present and future generations, as future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. [36] : 375  [37] : 142f  In effect, today's market prices do not, and cannot, reflect the preferences of the yet unborn. [38] : 156–160  This is an instance of a market failure passed unrecognized by most mainstream economists, as the concept of Pareto efficiency is entirely static (timeless). [39] : 181f  Imposing government restrictions on the general level of activity in the economy may be the only way of bringing about a more fair and even intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock. Hence, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, the two leading theorists in the field, have both called for the imposition of such restrictions: Georgescu-Roegen has proposed a minimal bioeconomic program, and Daly has proposed a comprehensive steady-state economy.[36] : 374–379  [39] However, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly, and other economists in the field agree that on a finite Earth, geologic limits will inevitably strain most fairness in the longer run, regardless of any present government restrictions: Any rate of extraction and use of the finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources will diminish the remaining stock left over for future generations to use. [36] : 366–69 [40] : 369–371  [41] : 165–167  [42] : 270  [43] : 37 
Another ecological market failure is presented by the overutilisation of an otherwise renewable resource at a point in time, or within a short period of time. Such overutilisation usually occurs when the resource in question has poorly defined (or non-existing) property rights attached to it while too many market agents engage in activity simultaneously for the resource to be able to sustain it all. Examples range from over-fishing of fisheries and over-grazing of pastures to over-crowding of recreational areas in congested cities. This type of ecological market failure is generally known as the 'tragedy of the commons '. In this type of market failure, the principle of Pareto efficiency is violated the utmost, as all agents in the market are left worse off, while nobody are benefitting. It has been argued that the best way to remedy a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure is to establish enforceable property rights politically – only, this may be easier said than done. [15] : 172f 
The issue of anthropogenic global warming presents an overwhelming example of a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure: The Earth's atmosphere may be regarded as a 'global common' exhibiting poorly defined (non-existing) property rights, and the waste absorption capacity of the atmosphere with regard to carbon dioxide is presently being heavily overloaded by a large volume of emissions from the world economy.[44] : 347f  Historically, the fossil fuel dependence of the Industrial Revolution has unintentionally thrown mankind out of ecological equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's biosphere (including the atmosphere), and the market has failed to correct the situation ever since. Quite the opposite: The unrestricted market has been exacerbating this global state of ecological dis -equilibrium, and is expected to continue doing so well into the foreseeable future. [45] : 95–101  This particular market failure may be remedied to some extent at the political level by the establishment of an international (or regional) cap and trade property rights system, where carbon dioxide emission permits are bought and sold among market agents. [15] : 433–35 
The term 'uneconomic growth' describes a pervasive ecological market failure: The ecological costs of further economic growth in a so-called 'full-world economy' like the present world economy may exceed the immediate social benefits derived from this growth. [15] : 16–21 
Chang's criticism[edit]
Chang[who?] states that "it is (implicitly) assumed the state knows everything and can do everything.” [18] Thus, this implies several assumptions about government in relation to market failures. There are three main statements. First of all, government representatives are able to evaluate the scope of market failures and to what extent it differs from efficient outcome. Secondly, having acquired the aforementioned knowledge they have capacity to re-establish market efficiency. Lastly, there has arisen an idea according to which decisions of policy-makers are not influenced by self-interest, but they are driven by altruism.[citation needed]
Lipsey and Lancaster's criticism[edit]
Lipsey and Lancaster came up with the theory of  the so-called the “second best.” They refuse Chang's theory and state that is it not possible to restore Pareto optimality even if policy makers possess the sufficient knowledge, intervene efficiently and altruism serves as stimulus for their decisions. On the other hand, the “second best” theory holds that when market failure occurs in one branch of the economy, it should be feasible to increase social welfare in another branch of the economy by violating Pareto efficiency instead of restoring Pareto efficiency by government intervention. [46]
Zerbe and McCurdy[edit]
Zerbe and McCurdy connected criticism of market failure paradigm to transaction costs. Market failure paradigm is defined as follows:
"A fundamental problem with the concept of market failure, as economists occasionally recognize, is that it describes a situation that exists everywhere.”
Transaction costs are part of each market exchange, although the price of transaction costs is not usually determined. They occur everywhere and are unpriced. Consequently, market failures and externalities can arise in the economy every time transaction costs arise. There is no place for government intervention. Instead, government should focus on the elimination of both transaction costs and costs of provision. [47]

Market Failures – in Price Theory, an intermediate text by David D. Friedman

Alright, I've got these search results. Let's see what I can gather from them to answer the question: "Why are public goods a market failure?"

First, from Doc 1, it seems that market failure occurs when the market doesn't allocate goods and services efficiently. It lists several causes, including public goods, which are non-rivalrous and non-excludable. That means when one person uses a public good, it doesn't prevent others from using it, and you can't stop people from using it even if they don't pay for it. Because of this, the market might not provide enough of these goods because companies can't make profits from them.

Doc 2 talks about externalities, which are costs or benefits that affect third parties not involved in the transaction. Positive externalities are good for others, like education benefiting society, while negative externalities harm others, like pollution. Public goods and externalities are related to market failures.

In Doc 3, it explains that public goods are provided by the government because the private sector won't supply them adequately due to the free-rider problem. People can benefit from public goods without paying for them, so they might not愿意 contribute, leading to under-provision of these goods.

Doc 4 seems to be from an educational website, providing definitions and examples of public goods and market failures. It reiterates that public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous and that market failures occur when the market doesn't allocate resources efficiently.

Finally, Doc 5 is from Wikipedia, which confirms that public goods are a key cause of market failure due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. It also mentions that externalities and imperfect competition are other causes of market failure.

So, to sum it up, public goods are a market failure because:

1. **Non-excludability**: Since it's hard to prevent people from using public goods, even if they don't pay, there's an incentive for people to free-ride, meaning they let others pay while they enjoy the benefits without contributing.

2. **Non-rivalry**: One person's use of the good doesn't diminish another's ability to use it, which means that the market has trouble定价because there's no direct competition for the good.

3. **Under-provision**: Because of the free-rider problem, private markets may not provide enough public goods, leading to a situation where society as a whole is worse off.

Therefore, the market fails to provide the optimal amount of public goods, and this is why they are considered a market failure.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Public goods are a market failure because they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, leading to the free-rider problem and under-provision by the market.}} \]
