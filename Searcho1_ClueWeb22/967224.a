Alright, so I need to figure out why there's an energy shortage. Energy shortage—what does that even mean? I guess it means there isn't enough energy to meet the demand. But why would that happen? Let me think.

First off, energy comes from various sources like fossil fuels, renewable sources, nuclear power, and maybe some others. So, could it be that we're running out of these sources? Wait, but I know that for fossil fuels, they take millions of years to form, and we've been using them for over a century. So, maybe we are depleting those reserves. But I also hear about renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Are those not sufficient to meet the demand?

Hmm, perhaps the transition from non-renewable to renewable sources isn't happening fast enough. Maybe there's a gap between phasing out fossil fuels and scaling up renewables. That could lead to shortages if the new sources aren't keeping up with the energy demands.

Alternatively, maybe there are issues with energy infrastructure. Like, maybe the grid can't handle the current demand, or there are problems with distribution. I remember hearing about blackouts in some areas during peak usage times. Is that related?

Also, population growth could be a factor. As the world population increases, more people need energy for their daily lives, transportation, and industries. So, if the energy production doesn't keep up with population growth, that could lead to shortages.

Economic factors might play a role too. If there's an economic boom, industries may consume more energy, increasing the demand. Conversely, during economic downturns, energy consumption might decrease, but I think in this case, we're talking about shortages, which suggest high demand.

Geopolitical issues could affect energy supply. For example, conflicts in regions rich in fossil fuels could disrupt production and supply chains, leading to shortages elsewhere.

Weather conditions might impact energy production, especially for renewables. Like, if there's less sunlight or wind than usual, solar and wind farms might produce less energy, causing shortages.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe do some research to get concrete examples and statistics.

Let me try searching for "reasons for energy shortage" and see what comes up.

This article is about energy crises in general. For other uses, see Oil crisis.
This article's lead section may be too short to adequately summarize the key points. Please consider expanding the lead to provide an accessible overview of all important aspects of the article.(October 2021)
An energy crisis or energy shortage is any significant bottleneck in the supply of energy resources to an economy. In literature, it often refers to one of the energy sources used at a certain time and place, in particular, those that supply national electricity grids or those used as fuel in industrial development and population growth have led to a surge in the global demand for energy in recent years. In the 2000s, this new demand – together with Middle East tension, the falling value of the US dollar, dwindling oil reserves, concerns over peak oil, and oil price speculation – triggered the 2000s energy crisis, which saw the price of oil reach an all-time high of $147.30 per barrel ($926/m 3) in 2008.[citation needed]

Causes[edit]
The gasoline shortages of World War II brought about the resurgence of horse-and-wagon delivery.
Most energy crises have been caused by localized shortages, wars and market manipulation. Some have argued that government actions like tax hikes, nationalisation of energy companies, and regulation of the energy sector, shift supply and demand of energy away from its economic equilibrium. [1] However, the recent historical energy crisis listed below were not caused by such factors. Market failure is possible when monopoly manipulation of markets occurs. A crisis can develop due to industrial actions like union organized strikes and government embargoes. The cause may be over-consumption, aging infrastructure, choke point disruption or bottlenecks at oil refineries and port facilities that restrict fuel supply. An emergency may emerge during very cold winters due to increased consumption of energy.
Large fluctuations and manipulations in future derivatives can have a substantial impact on price. Large investment banks control 80% of oil derivatives as of May 2012, compared to 30% only a decade ago. [2] This increase contributed to an improvement of global energy output from 117 687 TWh in 2000 to 143 851TWh in 2008. [3] Limitations on free trade for derivatives could reverse this trend of growth in energy production. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Hani Hussein stated that "Under the supply and demand theory, oil prices today are not justified," in an interview with Upstream. [4]
Pipeline failures and other accidents may cause minor interruptions to energy supplies. A crisis could possibly emerge after infrastructure damage from severe weather. Attacks by terrorists or militia on important infrastructure are a possible problem for energy consumers, with a successful strike on a Middle East facility potentially causing global shortages. Political events, for example, when governments change due to regime change, monarchy collapse, military occupation, and coup may disrupt oil and gas production and create shortages. Fuel shortage can also be due to the excess and useless use of the fuels.
Historical crises[edit]
North Korea has had energy shortages for many years.
Zimbabwe has experienced a shortage of energy supplies for many years due to financial mismanagement.
20th century[edit]
1970s energy crisis – caused by the peaking of oil production in major industrial nations (Germany, United States, Canada, etc.) and embargoes from other producers
1973 oil crisis – caused by an OAPEC oil export embargo by many of the major Arab oil-producing states, in response to Western support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War
1979 oil crisis – caused by the Iranian Revolution
1990 oil price shock – caused by the Gulf War
2000s[edit]
2000 fuel protests in the United Kingdom in 2000 were caused by a rise in the price of crude oil combined with already relatively high taxation on road fuel in the UK.
2000s energy crisis – Since 2003, a rise in prices caused by continued global increases in petroleum demand coupled with production stagnation, the falling value of the US dollar, and a myriad of other secondary causes.
2000–2001 California electricity crisis – Caused by market manipulation by Enron and failed deregulation; resulted in multiple large-scale power outages
2000–2008 North American natural gas crisis
2004 energy crisis in Argentina
2005, 2008 China experienced severe energy shortages towards the end of 2005 and again in early 2008. During the latter crisis they suffered severe damage to power networks along with diesel and coal shortages. [5] Supplies of electricity in Guangdong province, the manufacturing hub of China, are predicted to fall short by an estimated 10 GW. [6] In 2011 China was forecast to have a second quarter electrical power deficit of 44.85 – 49.85 GW. [7]
2007 Political riots occurring during the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests were sparked by rising energy prices.
Kuwait 's Al Burqan Oil Field, the world's second-largest oil field
2008 energy crisis in Central Asia, caused by abnormally cold temperatures and low water levels in an area dependent on hydroelectric power.  At the same time the South African President was appeasing fears of a prolonged electricity crisis in South Africa. [8]
2008. In February, the President of Pakistan announced plans to tackle energy shortages that were reaching crisis stage, despite having significant hydrocarbon reserves,. [9] In April 2010, the Pakistani government announced the Pakistan national energy policy, which extended the official weekend and banned neon lights in response to a growing electricity shortage. [10]
2008 South African energy crisis. The South African crisis led to large price rises for platinum in February 2008 and reduced gold production. [11] and continues as of 2022.
2010s[edit]
2012 United Kingdom fuel crisis
2015 – Nepal experienced a major energy crisis in 2015 when India imposed an economic blockade on Nepal. Nepal faced shortages of various kinds of petroleum products and food materials which severely affected Nepal's economy.
2017 – The Gaza electricity crisis is a result of the tensions between Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority/Fatah, which rules the West Bank over custom tax revenue, funding of the Gaza Strip, and political authority. Residents receive electricity for a few hours a day on a rolling blackout schedule. [12] [13] [14] [15]
2019 California energy crisis
2020s[edit]
2021 Texas power crisis
2021 United Kingdom natural gas supplier crisis and 2021 United Kingdom fuel supply crisis
2021 global energy crisis. The record-high energy prices were driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia. [16] [17] [18]
The Lebanese liquidity crisis lead to shortages of fuel for electricity plants, resulting in the 2021 Lebanese blackout and public utilities being able to offer power for only a few hours a day. [19]
Emerging oil shortage[edit]
Main articles: Oil depletion and Peak oil
"Peak oil" is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, after which the rate of production enters terminal decline. It relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum.  This, combined with increasing demand, significantly increases the worldwide prices of petroleum-derived products.  Most significant is the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation.
The US Department of Energy in the Hirsch report indicates that "The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past 'energy crisis' experience will provide relatively little guidance." [20]
Mitigation efforts[edit]
Main article: Mitigation of peak oil
To avoid the serious social and economic implications a global decline in oil production could entail, the 2005 Hirsch report emphasized the need to find alternatives, at least ten to twenty years before the peak, and to phase out the use of petroleum over that time. Such mitigation could include energy conservation, fuel substitution, and the use of unconventional oil. Because mitigation can reduce the use of traditional petroleum sources, it can also affect the timing of peak oil and the shape of the Hubbert curve .
Energy policy may be reformed leading to greater energy intensity, for example in Iran with the 2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran, Canada and the National Energy Program and in the US with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 also called the Clean Energy Act of 2007. Another mitigation measure is the setup of a cache of secure fuel reserves like the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in case of national emergency. Chinese energy policy includes specific targets within their 5-year plans.
Andrew McKillop has been a proponent of a contract and converge model or capping scheme, to mitigate both emissions of greenhouse gases and a peak oil crisis. The imposition of a carbon tax would have mitigating effects on an oil crisis.[citation needed] The Oil Depletion Protocol has been developed by Richard Heinberg to implement a powerdown during a peak oil crisis. While many sustainable development and energy policy organisations have advocated reforms to energy development from the 1970s, some cater to a specific crisis in energy supply including Energy-Quest and the International Association for Energy Economics. The Oil Depletion Analysis Centre and the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas examine the timing and likely effects of peak oil.
Ecologist William Rees believes that
To avoid a serious energy crisis in coming decades, citizens in the industrial countries should actually be urging their governments to come to an international agreement on a persistent, orderly, predictable, and steepening series of oil and natural gas price hikes over the next two decades.
Due to a lack of political viability on the issue, government-mandated fuel prices hikes are unlikely and the unresolved dilemma of fossil fuel dependence is becoming a wicked problem. A global soft energy path seems improbable, due to the rebound effect. Conclusions that the world is heading towards an unprecedented large and potentially devastating global energy crisis due to a decline in the availability of cheap oil lead to calls for a decreasing dependency on fossil fuel .
Other ideas concentrate on design and development of improved, energy-efficient urban infrastructure in developing nations. [21] Government funding for alternative energy is more likely to increase during an energy crisis, so too are incentives for oil exploration. For example, funding for research into inertial confinement fusion technology increased during the 1970s.
Kirk Sorensen and others [22] have suggested that additional nuclear power plants, particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors have the energy density to mitigate global warming and replace the energy from peak oil, peak coal and peak gas.  The reactors produce electricity and heat so much of the transportation infrastructure should move over to electric vehicles.  However, the high process heat of the molten salt reactors could be used to make liquid fuels from any carbon source.
2010s oil glut[edit]
Main article: 2010s oil glut
Rather counterintuitively, the world economy has had to deal with the unforeseen consequences of the 2015–2016 oil glut also known as 2010s oil glut, a major energy crisis that took many experts by surprise. This oversupply crisis started with a considerable time-lag, more than six years after the beginning of the Great Recession: "the price of oil [had] stabilized at a relatively high level (around $100 a barrel) unlike all previous recessionary cycles since 1980 (start of First Persian Gulf War). But nothing guarantee[d] such price levels in perpetuity ". [23]
Social and economic effects[edit]
Main articles: Energy economics and Renewable energy commercialization
The macroeconomic implications of a supply shock -induced energy crisis are large, because energy is the resource used to exploit all other resources. Oil price shocks can affect the rest of the economy through delayed business investment, [24] sectoral shifts in the labor market, [25] or monetary policy responses. [26] When energy markets fail, an energy shortage develops. Electricity consumers may experience intentionally engineered rolling blackouts during periods of insufficient supply or unexpected power outages, regardless of the cause.
Industrialized nations are dependent on oil, and efforts to restrict the supply of oil would have an adverse effect on the economies of oil producers. For the consumer, the price of natural gas, gasoline (petrol) and diesel for cars and other vehicles rises. An early response from stakeholders is the call for reports, investigations and commissions into the price of fuels. There are also movements towards the development of more sustainable urban infrastructure .
In 2006, survey respondents in the United States were willing to pay more for a plug-in hybrid car.
Global new investments in renewable energy, 2004–2010 [27]
In the market, new technology and energy efficiency measures become desirable for consumers seeking to decrease transport costs. [28] Examples include:
In 1980 Briggs & Stratton developed the first gasoline hybrid electric automobile; also appearing are plug-in hybrids.
the growth of advanced biofuels.
innovations like the Dahon, a folding bicycle
modernized and electrifying passenger transport
Railway electrification systems and new engines such as the Ganz-Mavag locomotive
variable compression ratio for vehicles
Other responses include the development of unconventional oil sources such as synthetic fuel from places like the Athabasca Oil Sands, more renewable energy commercialization and use of alternative propulsion. There may be a relocation trend towards local foods and possibly microgeneration, solar thermal collectors and other green energy sources.
Tourism trends and gas-guzzler ownership varies with fuel costs. Energy shortages can influence public opinion on subjects from nuclear power plants to electric blankets. Building construction techniques—improved insulation, reflective roofs, thermally efficient windows, etc.—change to reduce heating costs.

Crisis management[edit]
An electricity shortage is felt most acutely in heating, cooking, and water supply. Therefore, a sustained energy crisis may become a humanitarian crisis .
If an energy shortage is prolonged a crisis management phase is enforced by authorities. Energy audits may be conducted to monitor usage. Various curfews with the intention of increasing energy conservation may be initiated to reduce consumption. For example, to conserve power during the Central Asia energy crisis, authorities in Tajikistan ordered bars and cafes to operate by candlelight. "Crisis Looms as Bitter Cold, Blackouts Hit Tajikistan". NPR. Retrieved 10 February 2008.
In the worst kind of energy crisis energy rationing and fuel rationing may be incurred. Panic buying may beset outlets as awareness of shortages spread. Facilities close down to save on heating oil; and factories cut production and lay off workers. The risk of stagflation increases.[citation needed]

What Causes Energy Scarcity? (with pictures)
What Causes Energy Scarcity?
Esther Ejim
Last Modified Date: April 02, 2022
Presence of large number of energy-consuming products such as cars increases demand and contributes to energy scarcity.
Talk about energy refers mainly to the energy that is derived from fossil-fuel derivatives that include materials like crude oil and its products, such as petroleum and natural gas. Causes of energy scarcity refer to those factors that contribute to the scarcity of these types of energy sources. Some of these factors include a high burden of demand on the energy sources, the fact that these energy sources are mostly non-renewable, and a lack of proper management that results in wastage. Energy sources continue to depreciate in availability in direct relation to the level of demand that is placed on them through consumption.
Energy sources like oil are pumped from the ground and are not renewable.
One of the main factors that contributes to the growth of an energy crisis is the fact that the demand placed on the available natural resources is more than the rate of supply can meet. Energy is the foundation of modern society, because practically every aspect of modern life is dependent on different forms of energy, from the time each individual wakes up to the activities for the day—whether work or play—to the time the individual goes to bed at night. Energy is used for functions like lighting, heating and powering vehicles and industrial machinery. This incessant and relentless demand for ever-increasing energy places a huge demand burden on the level of supply of such energy, leading to an imbalance in the two forces, consequently resulting in energy scarcity.
There are multiple steps from extracting to refining that oil must undergo to be useful to people as an energy source.
Another factor that contributes to energy scarcity is the fact that most of the sources of energy come from sources that do not lend themselves to duplication or renewal. In other words, any portion of the current reservoir of such energy that is used up is gone and will not be easily recovered, certainly not in this lifetime with the current technology. This can be attributed to the fact that the reservoir of crude oil that is the source of energy was formed so long ago that forming it through that same means is simply out of the question, since the current stockpile would be long depleted before that time.
Is Amazon actually giving you the best price? This little known plugin reveals the answer.
Excess consumption can lead to scarcity.
The lack of development of other more reliable sources of energy is also a cause of energy scarcity since such development would present consumers with other choices, reducing the energy scarcity. Some other options for deriving energy that have not benefited from the kind of attention that fossil-fuel derivatives have enjoyed include solar, hydro and nuclear forms of energy. The adequate development of these sources will go a long way in the alleviation of the energy scarcity.

Energy Crisis: Definition and Causes - Assignment Point
Energy Crisis: Definition and Causes
Subject: Economics Topic: Article
Energy crisis
An energy crisis is a society-wide economic problem caused by a constricted supply of energy, leading to diminished availability and increased price to consumers.
The energy crisis is the concern that the world’s demands on the limited natural resources that are used to power industrial society are diminishing as the demand rises. These natural resources are in limited supply. While they do occur naturally, it can take hundreds of thousands of years to replenish the stores. Governments and concerned individuals are working to make the use of renewable resources a priority, and to lessen the irresponsible use of natural supplies through increased conservation.
Since the mid-1960s, the world has faced numerous energy crises. Faced with the eventual end of carbon-based fuels like oil and gas, oil exporters and importers should work together to find a solution. In this lesson, we will look at what an energy crisis is and explore conservation and innovative ideas that might provide nearly inexhaustible energy.
Major Causes are :
Limited oil resources which are being exploited are controlled by a few countries.
Prolonged drought which lowers production of Hydro Electric Power as a result of less water hence calling for more demand on petroleum.
Artificial shortages may be created by the oil-producing countries by withholding the oil.
Rapid depletion of oil reserves.
Political disagreement leading to shortage of oil due to delays at border points.
Inadequate alternative sources of energy that can fit the position of oil causes over reliance on oil and oil products.
Briefly description of Causes of the Energy Crisis
It would be easy to point a finger at one practice or industry and lay the blame for the entire energy crisis at their door, but that would be a very naive and unrealistic interpretation of the cause of the crisis.
Over-consumption: The energy crisis is a result of many different strains on our natural resources, not just one. There is a strain on fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal due to over-consumption – which then in turn can put a strain on our water and oxygen resources by causing pollution.
Overpopulation: Another cause of the crisis has been the steady increase in the world’s population and its demands for fuel and products. No matter what type of food or products you choose to use – from fair trade and organic to those made from petroleum products in a sweatshop – not one of them is made or transported without a significant drain on our energy resources.
Poor Infrastructure: Aging infrastructure of power generating equipment is yet another reason for energy shortage. Most of the energy producing firms keep on using outdated equipment that restricts the production of energy. It is the responsibility of utilities to keep on upgrading the infrastructure and set a high standard of performance.
Unexplored Renewable Energy Options: Renewable energy still remains unused is most of the countries. Most of the energy comes from non-renewable sources like coal. It still remains the top choice to produce energy. Unless we give renewable energy a serious thought, the problem of energy crisis cannot be solved. Renewable energy sources can reduce our dependance on fossil fuels and also helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Delay in Commissioning of Power Plants: In few countries, there is a significant delay in commissioning of new power plants that can fill the gap between demand and supply of energy. The result is that old plants come under huge stress to meet the daily demand for power. When supply doesn’t matches demand, it results in load shedding and breakdown.
Wastage of Energy: In most parts of the world, people do not realize the importance of conserving energy. It is only limited to books, internet, newspaper ads, lip service and seminars. Unless we give it a serious thought, things are not going to change anytime sooner. Simple things like switching off fans and lights when not in use, using maximum daylight, walking instead of driving for short distances, using CFL instead of traditional bulbs, proper insulation for leakage of energy can go a long way in saving energy. Read here about 151 ways of saving energy.
Poor Distribution System: Frequent tripping and breakdown are result of a poor distribution system.
Major Accidents and Natural Calamities: Major accidents like pipeline burst and natural calamities like eruption of volcanoes, floods, earthquakes can also cause interruptions to energy supplies. The huge gap between supply and demand of energy can raise the price of essential items which can give rise to inflation.
Wars and Attacks: Wars between countries can also hamper supply of energy specially if it happens in Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, UAE or Qatar. That’s what happened during 1990 Gulf war when price of oil reached its peak causing global shortages and created major problem for energy consumers.
Miscellaneous Factors: Tax hikes, strikes, military coup, political events, severe hot summers or cold winters can cause sudden increase in demand of energy and can choke supply. A strike by unions in an oil producing firm can definitely cause an energy crisis.

Almost the whole world is facing energy crisis at this time. It has become a challenge to meet the energy requirements due to the lack of natural gas and somewhere coal.
In India too, it is being said that the supply of coal is being reduced at many power plants. State governments have expressed concern about this and many power plants are facing shortage of coal.
Similarly, the supply of natural gas is also becoming a big challenge. While on one hand its supply is not sufficient, its demand is also increasing and the prices have increased.

Europe Of countries’ problems
European countries are currently facing a big crisis of natural gas. These countries mostly depend on renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear power for their energy needs. Most of it is from natural gas.
However, at present the supply of natural gas in European countries is not in line with the demand. This demand is going to increase further in winter, which may hit the middle and low income groups the most.
The prices of natural gas are increasing continuously, the burden of which is bound to fall on the consumers.
Electricity prices are going to rise in the UK. According to a report, more than one million households in Britain will not be able to use electricity or other energy sources by the beginning of next year.
Last month, nine companies operating in this sector closed down. She could not bear the rising cost due to rising prices.

Along with this, there is talk of removing the limit on prices so that companies can be saved from closure due to losses.
In Germany also power plants were closed and it is facing an energy crisis. Natural gas prices have increased in the US.
The energy needs of a country are met not only by keeping in mind the present but also the future. But, now suddenly the whole world is facing energy crisis. Production is low and prices are rising.
Experts do not consider any one reason responsible behind this, but many factors have together created these situations.

increasing demand for natural gas
There has been an increase in the demand for energy around the world due to many reasons. Experts attribute this to the increasing demand for products and services in normal life after the corona epidemic, change in weather and reduction in coal production.
Economies came to a halt during the Corona pandemic. Both demand and production were low. The condition of the economies was deteriorating. But, when the impact of the epidemic subsided, countries gave economic reform packages to accelerate the economy.
In America, a trillion dollar economic package was given to improve the infrastructure, the effect of which was also seen on other industries. This spurred the construction and service industry and increased the demand for energy.
At the same time, change in weather has also been seen in many places. In many countries, the demand started increasing in the last winter itself.
For example, many areas in the Northern Hemisphere saw long cold weather, due to which electrical appliances were used to provide heat. Last summer, hot winds blew in America and Europe, which increased the use of air conditioners. Due to this the power consumption also started increasing.
At the same time, there was an increase in the use of private vehicles to protect against corona, due to which the consumption of CNG increased.
Vivek Jain, Director (Corporates), India Ratings and Research, says, “Historically, demand has never increased this much before. No one expected consumption so much. There was always one to two per cent growth in demand. The demand has grown exponentially.”

increased coal
At the same time, a major contributor to this is the low production of coal. Like other countries, energy consumption and demand have increased in Asian countries too. China and India are two such large countries that account for 40 percent of the entire population of the world.
Both these countries largely depend on coal for their energy needs. In terms of coal imports, China is at number one in the world and India at number three. At the same time, China and India also come at number one and two respectively in terms of coal production.
But, moving towards green energy and decreasing interest of investors in coal production has reduced coal production here.
The world is working on alternatives to coal to deal with climate change. For this, dependence on solar and wind energy, natural gas and nuclear energy is being increased. In such a situation, investors are also losing interest in coal, they are getting less profit. Therefore, the production of coal has reduced a lot.
Vivek Jain explains, “This change has come in a long time. Companies investing in coal and oil have come down. In the last 10 years, these companies have come down to about 66 percent. If you don’t invest to extract the mineral. are living and demand rises, imbalance is created.”
The demand for energy has increased in India and China, and in such a situation, the consumption of both coal and natural gas has increased here. In view of climate change, China had earlier decided to import only instead of producing coal, but in the current situation, it is also going to start about 90 mines.

Russia’s role
Russia’s role in dealing with the natural gas crisis in Europe has increased.
European countries depend on Russia for about 43 percent of their natural gas supply. But, amid the increasing demand for energy, the supply from Russia has also decreased.
Natural gas is delivered to European countries through pipelines from Russia. This pipeline goes through Ukraine and Poland. But Russia’s relations with these two countries continue to be strained.
In such a situation, Russia has prepared a pipeline ‘Nord Stream 2’ which goes directly to Germany. This could improve gas supply, but European countries have not yet approved this pipeline.
America has also been critical of this pipeline. It says that if the direct pipeline is approved, Ukraine and Poland may suffer economic losses.
Even before the demand for natural gas has increased in Europe, Russia has increased the supply accordingly. But this year, Russia’s state-owned power generation company Gazprom has accepted fewer orders for additional supplies.
It is also being seen as pressure from Russia. Critics say it is an attempt to show the importance of ‘Nord Stream 2’ in the supply of natural gas in the midst of the energy crisis in Europe so that its approval can be easier.
However, Russia denies this and has denied any role in the energy supply shortage. Russia has also assured to increase supply according to the demand in Europe.
At the same time, energy consumption has increased in Russia as well and production has been affected here during the Corona epidemic.

How did the crisis get here
The serious impact of this energy crisis can be seen on many big countries. The whole world is going through its effects. In such a situation, no one had any idea of ​​such a big crisis or has there been a mistake somewhere?
Vivek Jain says, “Coal mines were closed due to low production during the corona epidemic. Many mines were already being closed slowly. But when you close the mine or reduce the production, then it is called It takes time to restart or pick up speed.
“It does not happen in the production of minerals that if you stop today, you will start tomorrow. Suppose you decide in the second quarter that you want to start it, then it will take six months as soon as it starts. It is not that it was not known at the global level but no one expected such high demand.”

what will happen next
Experts believe that an immediate solution to this problem will be found, but long-term measures will also have to be taken into account.
Vivek Jain says that coal production is being increased and the whole world is working on it, but these conditions have made one thing clear that it is not so easy to remove coal from our needs.
“There will come a time in between when we have to live with coal and other energy resources. Right now we can’t shift 100 percent because natural gas production is limited and renewable energy has its limits,” he says.
“At the same time, the prices have gone up, so this is a good opportunity for the suppliers to make a profit. The companies that had closed the mines, if they increase production there, then they can benefit a lot.

power crisis in india
Due to the shortage of coal in India, the crisis of power shortage is being told for the last several days. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also wrote a letter to the central government apprehension of power shortage in the coming days.
In Uttar Pradesh also eight power plants have been closed due to shortage of coal. There is also talk of three or four days of coal left in the country.
However, it has been said by the Ministry of Coal that sufficient quantity of coal is available to meet the energy needs of the country.
The Coal Ministry said, “The apprehension of power supply disruption is completely false. About 72 lakh tonnes of coal is present in power plants, which is enough for four days. While, Coal India Limited has 400 lakh tonnes of coal, which is further supplied.” This year (by September 2021) the domestic coal based power generation has increased by about 24%.
However, experts do not agree with this. They say that this crisis is not of today but has been made in the past.
Regarding the situation in India, senior journalist and economic affairs expert Pranjoy Guha Thakurta says that concerns have been expressed from state governments to power companies about the crisis of energy supply in India. Yet the government has been denying it.
He says, “There are many reasons behind the energy crisis in India. As the global and domestic demand has increased after the lockdown opened. At the same time, this year there has also been more rain, which has made coal wet. Even the companies are in debt, so production is decreasing.
“But, this crisis did not come overnight. Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Tamil Nadu wrote to the Indian government with anguish that the power plants would be shut down. Everyone has only two or three days of coal left. But Coal Minister Prahlad Joshi and Energy Minister RK Singh denied any trouble. Said it would be fine in a couple of days. But, if there is no crisis then why are people so worried.
Experts also fear that some companies will benefit from these situations. With the increase in demand for coal, its prices will increase, which will be taken advantage of by the coal producing companies.
But, for the time being, the attention of the whole world is on dealing with this crisis so that in the coming times, there is no cut in electricity or other needs.

quarreled in lalu prasad yadav’s family: Lalu Family Controversy News: kya parivar par kamajor pad rahi hai lalu ki pakad?, Lalu Family Controversy News: Is Lalu’s grip on the family weakening?

New Delhi
Is Lalu Prasad Yadav’s hold on his own political family weakening?  Can Lalu Prasad’s weakening hold affect RJD?  Can this lead to family breakdown, disintegration and separation?  All these questions arose when, in the past, Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder of Lalu Prasad Yadav, once again made some serious allegations.  Without taking names, he hinted at the differences between his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav versus other family members.  He even said that Lalu Prasad Yadav is being deliberately kept away from the activities of the party, but neither Lalu Prasad nor Tejashwi Yadav paid any attention to this whole matter.
Other family members active in Lalu’s absence
Actually, Lalu Prasad has stayed away from active politics due to first being in jail and later due to serious illness.  Most of his time has been spent in Delhi.  During this time he was rarely associated with the activities of the party.  In such a situation, the activity of other members of his family increased.  Tejashwi Yadav became the face of the party and continued to grow stronger.  Now he is taking all the decisions unquestioningly.  It is believed that understanding the situation, somewhere Lalu Prasad’s consent is also there for this.  He is reducing his hold under his strategy, so that there is no pressure on him to take a decision.
Tej Pratap Yadav vs Tejashwi Yadav: Know when the incident started increasing Lalu Yadav and Tejashwi – Distance between Tej Pratap
Lalu has been giving preference to Tejashwi from the beginning
Looking back, close family members believe that even when Lalu Prasad Yadav was looking for his successor in 2013, he preferred Tejashwi Yadav over Misa Bharti and Tej Pratap Yadav.  A close family member told that Tejashwi has always been Lalu’s favorite.  However, then it was also said that the choice of Rabri Devi is her elder son Tej Pratap Yadav.  On the other hand, Misa Bharti kept trying to make a separate identity in politics from the beginning, but Lalu gave the first big indication of this when in 2015, he preferred Tejashwi instead of Misa.
Mother Rabri came from 1000 km away to resolve Tejashwi-Tej Pratap’s quarrel, why did the big darlings get cut off?
Lalu Prasad had brought Tejashwi from Raghopur taking a big risk.
Before the Bihar assembly elections, when all three were in line to take Lalu’s legacy together, Lalu Prasad took a big risk and fielded Tejashwi from Raghopur, where Rabri Devi had lost the last election to Satish Rai.  The math behind this was that if Tejashwi wins against the popular and strong BJP candidate Satish Rai, then his stature will increase.  After Tejashwi won the election, Lalu Prasad had decided to hand over his legacy to him at the same time.  However, Tej Pratap also won the election from his seat.  Then there was a lot of discussion in the political circles about how Tej Pratap himself got a ministerial post in the Nitish government by giving pressure even after Lalu Prasad did not want to.  Lalu, after the election, gave Misa Bharti a Rajya Sabha seat and fixed a different role for her too.
Big blow to Tej Pratap, Sanjay Yadav withdraws his name after meeting Tejashwi
Tej Pratap kept challenging Tejashwi’s leadership
Since then, the graph of Tejashwi Yadav has steadily climbed up, but Tej Pratap Yadav always challenged the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav in between and considered Lalu Prasad as his leader.  In this exercise of Tej Pratap, there has been talk of indirect support of some other family members too, but Lalu Prasad always ignored it.  Lalu Prasad Yadav has faced the battle of power in the family in the nineties, when he went to jail in the fodder scam and made Rabri Devi the CM in his place.  At that time Sadhu Yadav and Subhash Yadav (brother of Rabri Devi) had made their own camp in RJD and made it the center of power.  Subhash Yadav was also very close to Rabri.  At that time both were accused of running the party on their own terms, due to which many leaders left the party.  Learning from the old mistakes, this time Lalu Prasad Yadav did not allow separate centers of strength to be created in the party and allowed Tejashwi Yadav to become stronger.
Tejashwi Yadav News: Tejashwi’s reply to Tej Pratap as soon as he reaches Patna, ‘Lalu Yadav is not a person to be held hostage’
Till now Lalu and Tejashwi have been seen on the same pitch
Although there was talk of difference of opinion on some names in deciding the names of candidates for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the assembly elections held in 2020, but till now Lalu and Tejashwi have been seen completely on a pitch.  In such a situation, it is also believed that under a strategy, Lalu Prasad Yadav allowed his hold on the family to weaken.  In the 2020 assembly elections, Tejashwi Yadav contested the entire election in his name, even at that time questions were raised about the disappearance of the names of Rabri and Lalu Prasad from the party’s poster.  Even though RJD failed to form the government in that election, it emerged as the single largest party and Tejashwi Yadav was unanimously accepted as the leader.  Since then, Lalu Prasad has not only accepted the weakening grip on the party-family, but has also presented it as a necessity.

13 days passed, keeping the body of an Afghan woman in the mortuary.  The funeral could not take place.  Usually such a situation comes only when either the dead body is unclaimed or there is no one nearby.  But the dead body of Janjera Jadran, kept in the mortuary of Safdarjung Hospital, has a daughter as well as a son.  The police also get the unclaimed dead body cremated after 72 hours after completing the necessary formalities.  But, in the case of Janjera Zadran, the borders of the countries are coming in the way.  Government paper formalities moving with turtle movements remain a hindrance.  The crisis of hunger and thirst has arisen in front of daughter Maryam, who has been battling for 10 days to take the dead body of her mother.  No money left.  The only way left for the body to reach Afghanistan is via Pakistan via the Wagah border.
To do this in the soil of the land
Maryam told NBT that she is wandering from door to door in Delhi along with her brother Farhad to take the dead body of her mother to her country and hand it over.  They are residents of Taimani, 100 km from Kabul city.  Maryam, 30, has done law.  There was an advocate.  She is the second wife of her husband.  Have 5 kids.

How to take the dead body, where to take it
Maryam told that as soon as she kept going around the hospitals from here to there.  The oxygen level dropped to 40.  The mother died on 26 March.  The dead body has been kept in the mortuary of Safdarjung Hospital since then.  The hospital is repeatedly pressurizing to take the body.  There is no money to eat, drink or live.

Chang E-5 Mission: China Brought Fresh Samples From Moon Rocks To Earth After 40 Years
Published

By
Press24 News
The Chang’e-5 mission, launched by the Chinese space agency, brought the first fresh samples of volcanic rock (lava) to the Moon after more than 40 years.
Scientists on this study on Moon rocks include Brad Jolliff of the University of Washington, who determined the age of the Moon’s volcanic rock to be about two billion years. The findings of these studies have been published in the journal Science. Jolief, a US resident, is a co-author of the analysis of moon rocks led by the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.
The Chang’e-5 mission is designed to collect rocks from the youngest volcanic surfaces on the Moon and bring them back to Earth, explains Jolliff. Of course this is a new mission now, but its findings are significant.
Chang’e-5 mission collects two billion year old volcanic rock samples
He said that all the volcanic rocks collected in the Apollo missions were more than three billion years old. At the same time, the rock samples found in this young mission are two billion years old, which indicates its effectiveness. The samples collected from the Chang’e-5 mission are important not only for the study of the Moon but also for the study of other rocky planets in the Solar System.
It is important to find out the age of rocks
The Moon itself is about 4.5 billion years old, almost as old as Earth, Jolliff points out. But unlike Earth, the Moon doesn’t have the rock formation process that would indicate years of volcanism.
Scientists took samples of the Moon’s permanent volcanism to estimate the age of different regions on its surface, based on what the region appeared to be. The study showed that the lunar rocks brought by the Chang’e-5 mission were two billion years old, knowing that scientists will now be able to give more precise shape to their important probe instruments.
Easy to know volcano history
Jolliff said the laboratory in Beijing where the new analyzes were conducted is the best in the world. It has done unprecedented work in characterizing and analyzing samples of volcanic rock found on the Moon. Another interesting finding of this analysis is that the samples collected from it have revealed the composition of basalt, making it easier to trace the volcanic history of the Moon.
What is Chang’e-5 mission
The Chang’e-5 mission was launched by China on 24 November to bring samples of volcanic rock from the Moon to Earth. This is the first time in nearly four decades that a country has excavated the surface of the Moon and brought these samples to Earth.

Global Energy Shortage: Why is Everyone Talking About a Power Crunch? - Bloomberg
Why Is Everyone Talking About a Global Power Shortage?

Contributors: Stephen Stapczynski
Updated on September 28, 12:52 AM EDT
What You Need To Know
There is a worrying shortage of energy from Europe to Asia, caused by supply restraints from the world’s top producers, and that’s poised to shutter factories and boost power bills. While there is no single reason for the shortage — things like customer demand, technical problems and a lack of investment are all playing a part — the crisis is threatening to spread to more nations and upend the global economic recovery.
The price of natural gas and coal, used to power factories and heat homes, has surged to multi-year highs as the post-pandemic rebound collides with supply constraints in the run-up to the Northern Hemisphere winter.
The crisis has forced some fertilizer producers in Europe to reduce output, while Chinese power grids are rationing supplies to factories, which will curb production. What’s worrying is that it isn’t even cold yet. Energy consumption usually peaks when frigid temperatures boost demand for heating.
Already, China is looking to adopt measures to try to cool sky-high coal prices and ease its own power shortage, while utilities around the world are working tirelessly to try to secure more fuel supplies.

By The Numbers
1,300% The surge in European benchmark natural gas futures since May 2020
$100 per million British thermal units Natural gas in Asia and Europe could surge to this price in the event of a particularly cold winter, or roughly a four-fold increase from current levels, according to Citigroup
2017 The year China&amp;#x2019;s seasonal coal inventories were last at such a low level, according to Morgan Stanley
Why It Matters
Even a normally cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to exacerbate the shortage and drive up energy prices across the world. Since the world runs on fuel and electricity, the energy crisis threatens to touch every corner of the global economy, squeezing supply chains and even increasing food prices, all of which means a jump in inflation.
In a worst case scenario, Europe could face blackouts and China’s industrial users, including chip makers and aluminum smelters, may shut factories, with repercussions echoing around the globe. Economies that can’t afford the fuel — such as Pakistan or Bangladesh — could simply grind to a halt.
A crisis that’s largely playing out in industries could soon spread to the political arena, as higher utility bills and the price of goods could trigger public unrest. Lower hydroelectric power output in Brazil, for example, has forced the nation to increase dependence of pricey natural gas, boosting power bills for households, which could hurt President Jair Bolsonaro’s chances in next year’s election.

Alright, I've got some information from these search results. Let's see what they're saying about energy shortages.

First, from the Wikipedia article, it talks about energy crises in general, mentioning that they often result from a bottleneck in energy supply to an economy. It lists various factors like depletion of fossil fuels, geopolitical issues, and infrastructure problems. It also mentions that market manipulation and regulatory actions can affect energy prices and availability.

The Wise Geek article simplifies it by saying that energy scarcity happens when demand exceeds supply, especially for non-renewable resources like oil and gas, which can't be replenished quickly. It suggests that developing renewable energy sources could alleviate this issue.

The Assignment Point article provides a list of causes, including limited oil resources controlled by a few countries, drought affecting hydroelectric power, artificial shortages, rapid depletion of oil reserves, political disagreements, inadequate alternative energy sources, delayed commissioning of new power plants, wastage of energy, poor distribution systems, major accidents, and natural calamities.

The Press24 news article focuses on a specific instance of natural gas shortage affecting Europe and mentions factors like increased demand post-COVID, weather changes, reduced coal production, and Russia's role in supplying gas.

Lastly, the Bloomberg article discusses a global energy shortage affecting Europe and Asia, attributing it to supply constraints from major producers and heightened customer demand, especially as the Northern Hemisphere approaches winter.

So, synthesizing these, it seems that energy shortages occur when the demand for energy exceeds the available supply, often exacerbated by factors like depletion of non-renewable resources, geopolitical tensions, infrastructure issues, and natural disasters. The situation can be mitigated by developing renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and better managing energy distribution and consumption.

Given that, I think the core reasons for energy shortages are:

1. **Demand exceeding supply:** As populations and economies grow, energy demand increases, but supply may not keep pace, especially for finite resources like fossil fuels.

2. **Depletion of non-renewable resources:** Fossil fuels take millions of years to form, and our current consumption rates are unsustainable in the long term.

3. **Geopolitical factors:** Conflicts and political tensions in regions rich in energy resources can disrupt supply chains and lead to shortages.

4. **Infrastructure limitations:** Aging or inadequate energy infrastructure can fail to meet growing demands or be inefficient in distribution.

5. **Climate and weather events:** Droughts can reduce hydroelectric power, while extreme weather can damage energy infrastructure.

6. **Market manipulation:** Speculation and manipulation by market players can drive up prices and create artificial shortages.

7. **Transition challenges:** The shift from non-renewable to renewable energy sources may not be happening fast enough to meet increasing demands, leading to gaps in supply.

To address these issues, a multifaceted approach is needed, including investment in renewable energy, improvements in energy efficiency, better management of existing resources, and perhaps international cooperation to stabilize supplies and prices.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Energy shortages occur when demand exceeds supply, often due to depletion of non-renewable resources, geopolitical tensions, infrastructure limitations, and climate impacts. Addressing this requires transitioning to renewable energy, improving efficiency, and better resource management.}} \]
