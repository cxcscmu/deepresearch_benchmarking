Alright, so I need to figure out how Canada got involved in World War II. I know that Canada is a country in North America, and World War II was a global conflict that started in 1939. But I'm not exactly sure about Canada's role or how they became involved. Maybe I should start by understanding when and why Canada joined the war.

First, I recall that Canada is a member of the Commonwealth, which is an association of countries that were formerly part of the British Empire. Since Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, and Canada had a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as its head of state, perhaps Canada was automatically at war when Britain was. But I think I remember that Canada had become more independent by that time, so maybe their involvement wasn't automatic.

Let me think about the political situation in Canada at that time. In 1939, William Lyon Mackenzie King was the Prime Minister of Canada. He was leading a Liberal government. I think that Canada, like many countries, was dealing with the aftermath of the Great Depression and may have been focused on domestic issues. So, how did international events lead to Canada's participation in the war?

Maybe I should look into when Canada declared war on Germany. I have a rough memory that it was shortly after Britain declared war, but I'm not sure about the exact date. It might be helpful to look that up.

Also, I should consider public opinion in Canada at the time. Was there support for entering the war, or was there opposition? Were there any specific events or catalysts that prompted Canada to join the war effort?

Another angle could be Canada's military preparedness at the time. How ready was Canada to participate in a large-scale conflict? Did they have a significant military force, or was it small compared to other nations?

Furthermore, I should think about Canada's contributions to the war effort. What roles did Canadian forces play in various battles and campaigns during WWII? Understanding their involvement might help clarify why and how they got involved in the first place.

Perhaps I should also consider economic factors. Did Canada play a role in supplying resources or materials to the Allied powers during the war? Their involvement might have been influenced by economic ties and dependencies.

Additionally, I should think about Canada's relationship with the United States. The U.S. played a major role in WWII, and Canada's proximity and economic ties with the U.S. might have influenced their decision to enter the war.

Let me try to outline this step by step:

1. Determine when Canada declared war on Germany.

2. Understand the political climate in Canada at the time.

3. Examine public opinion regarding involvement in the war.

4. Assess Canada's military readiness and capabilities.

5. Investigate Canada's contributions to the war effort.

6. Consider economic factors and dependencies.

7. Examine relationships with other countries, particularly Britain and the U.S.

Starting with the first point, I need to find out when Canada declared war on Germany. I believe it was around September 1939, but I'm not certain. Let me see if I can find the exact date.

I think it was September 10, 1939, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look that up.

Wait, I have access to search tools. Maybe I can perform a search to get accurate information.

Let me try that.

Canadian declaration of war on Germany - Wikipedia
Canadian declaration of war on Germany
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The "proclamation" of George VI "declaring that a State of War with the German Reich exists and has existed in Our Dominion of Canada as and from the tenth day of September, 1939". The Great Seal of Canada is affixed above the Attorney General 's signature and the signature of the Governor-General Lord Tweedsmuir is at the top as a witness.
A recommendation for a declaration of war by Canada on Nazi Germany was announced in a speech made by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 3 September 1939. [1] Though Mackenzie King was in Ottawa at the time of his speech, it was broadcast over the radio.  There was also a Canadian announcement in the Canadian newspaper, the Canada Gazette.[2] The declaration of war was made on 10 September 1939, just 7 days after the United Kingdom and France declared war.
Canada did not declare war on Germany in 1914 at the outset of World War I, as it had no authority to do so at the time; as part of the British Empire, it entered the war with the United Kingdom in consequence of its own declaration of war. Canada gained this authority with the Statute of Westminster 1931 .

Background and procedure[edit]
After Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, the United Kingdom and France declared war on September 3. [3] [4] To assert Canada's independence from the UK, as already established by the Statute of Westminster 1931, Canada's political leaders decided to seek the approval of the federal parliament to declare war. [5] [3] [6] [7] Parliament was not scheduled to return until October 2, but returned to session early on September 7 to consider the declaration of war. [3] [4] [6] [7] [8]
On September 9, the House of Commons and Senate approved authorization for a declaration of war. The Cabinet then drafted an Order in Council to that effect. On September 10, Vincent Massey, Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, brought the document to King George VI, at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, for his signature, [9] [10] whereupon Canada had officially declared war on Germany. [3] [4] [6] [7] [8] [11] In his capacity as the government's official recorder for the war effort, Leonard Brockington noted: "King George VI of England [sic] did not ask us to declare war for him—we asked King George VI of Canada to declare war for us." [12] [13] [14]

Prime Minister King's speech[edit]
Below is the speech, given by William Lyon Mackenzie King :
Recommendation of Canadian Declaration of War on Germany
For months – indeed for years – the shadow of impending conflict in Europe has been ever present. Through these troubled years no stone has been left unturned, no road unexplored in patient search for peace.
Unhappily for the world, Herr Hitler and the Nazi regime in Germany have persisted in their attempt to extend their control over other peoples and countries, and to pursue their aggressive designs in wanton disregard of all treaty obligations, and peaceful methods of adjusting international disputes. They have had to resort increasingly to agencies of deception, terrorism and violence. It is this reliance upon force, this lust for conquest, this determination to dominate throughout the world which is the real cause of the war that today threatens the freedom of mankind.
The fate of a single city, the preservation of the independence of a particular nation are the occasion, not the real cause, of the present conflict. The forces of evil have been loosed in the world in a struggle between the pagan conception of a social order which ignores the individual and is based upon the doctrine of might and a civilization based upon the Christian conception of the brotherhood of man, with its regard for the sanctity of contractual relations and the sacredness of human personality.
As President Roosevelt said on opening Congress on January 4: "There comes a time in the affairs of men when they must prepare to defend, not their homes alone, but the tenets of faiths and humanity on which their churches, their Governments, and their very civilizations are founded. The defense of religion, of democracy, and of good faith among nations is all the same fight. To save one we must make up our minds to save all."
This, I believe, is the position in which all nations that cherish free institutions, individual liberty and social justice find themselves today.
I need not review the events of the last few days. They must be present in the minds of all. Despite her unceasing efforts to preserve the peace of Europe, the United Kingdom has today, in the determination to honour her pledges and meet her treaty obligations, become involved in war.
This morning the King [George VI ], speaking to his peoples at home and across the seas, appealed to all to make their own the cause of freedom, which Britain again has taken up. Canada has already answered that call. On Friday last, the Government, speaking on behalf of the Canadian people, announced that in the event of the United Kingdom becoming engaged in war in the effort to resist aggression, they would, as soon as Parliament meets, seek its authority for effective cooperation by Canada at the side of Britain.
As you are aware, I have all along felt that the danger of war was such that Parliament should not be dissolved, but be available to consider any emergency that might arise. Parliament will meet Thursday next. Between now and then all necessary measures will be taken for the defense of Canada. Consultations with the United Kingdom will be continued. In the light of all the information at its disposal, the government will then recommend to Parliament the measures which it believes to be the most effective for cooperation and defence.
That Parliament will sanction all necessary measures, I have not the least doubt. Already I have received from the Leader of the Opposition [Robert James Manion ], and from representatives of the other parties in the House of Commons, assurances of their full appreciation of the gravity of the situation, and of their desire to see that such measures are adopted as in the present crisis will best serve the national interest.
Our first concern is with the defence of Canada. To be helpful to others, we must ourselves be strong, secure and united. In anticipation of a state of war, the Government has already availed itself of the provisions of the War Measures Act, to take essential measures for the defense of our coasts, our land and our people. As has already been announced, the militia of Canada, the naval service and the air force are already on active service.
This morning these measures were supplemented by others including the proclamation of the Defence of Canada Regulations. Measures have also been taken to prevent profiteering in the necessaries of life. Of the latter measures my colleague, the Minister of Labour, will speak to you in a moment.  In what manner and to what extent Canada may most effectively be able to cooperate in the common cause is, as I have already stated, something which Parliament itself will decide. All I need to add at the moment is that Canada, as a free nation of the British Commonwealth, is bringing her cooperation voluntarily.
Our effort will be voluntary. The people of Canada will, I know, face the days of stress and  strain which lie ahead with calm and resolute courage. There is no home in Canada, no family, and no individual whose fortunes and freedom are not bound up in the present struggle. I appeal to my fellow Canadians to unite in a national effort to save from destruction all that makes life itself worth living, and to preserve for future generations those liberties and institutions which others have bequeathed to us.

Historical Context
After Hitler's rise to power, starting in 1933, he began to look towards other countries.  In 1934, Poland and Germany signed the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.  According to the pact, Germany and Poland were to it was made to "
introduce a new phase in the political relationships between Germany and Poland...."  The pact also stated that Germany and Poland were to "not hinder the peaceful development of their mutual relations...."  It also agreed that, "should any disputes arise between them and agreement theron not be reached by any direct negotiation, they will in each particular case, on the basis of mutual agreement, seek a solution by other peaceful means, without prejudice to the possibility of applying, if necessary, those methods of procedure in which provision is made for such cases in other agreements in force between them.  In no circumstances, however, will they proceed to the application of force for the purpose of reaching a decision in such disputes."  The treaty was supposed to last ten years, after which, it could be renewed.  It only lasted five. [2]

CANADA GOES TO WAR
1939
Canada declared war 
on Germany in September 
1939.
Britain’s 
declaration of war did not automatically 
commit Canada, as had been the case in 
1914. But there was never serious doubt 
about Canada’s response: the government 
and people were united in support of 
Britain and France. After Parliament 
debated the matter, Canada declared war 
on Germany on 10 September. Prime Minister 
William Lyon Mackenzie King promised 
that only volunteers would serve overseas.
Canada 
was unprepared for war. The regular army 
of 4500 men, augmented by 51,000 partly-trained 
reservists, possessed virtually no modern 
equipment. The air force had fewer than 
20 modern combat aircraft while the navy’s 
combat potential consisted of only six 
destroyers, the smallest class of ocean-going 
warships. It was a modest beginning.

Declaration of war by Canada
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A declaration of war by Canada is a formal declaration issued by the Government of Canada (the federal Crown-in-Council) indicating that a state of war exists between Canada and another nation. It is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative on the constitutional advice of the ministers of the Crown in Cabinet and does not require the direct approval of the Parliament of Canada, though such can be sought by the government. Since gaining the authority to declare war under the Statute of Westminster 1931, Canada has declared war only during the Second World War.[1] [2]

Nazi Germany[edit]
Main article: Canadian declaration of war on Germany
Prime Minister Mackenzie King 's request to King George VI for approval that war be declared against Germany, 10 September 1939.
After Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, the United Kingdom and France declared war on September 3. [2] [3] To assert Canada's independence from the UK, as already established by the Statute of Westminster 1931, Canada's political leaders decided to seek the approval of the federal parliament to declare war. [1] [2] [4] [5] Parliament was not scheduled to return until October 2, but returned to session early on September 7 to consider the declaration of war. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
On September 9, the House of Commons and Senate approved authorization for a declaration of war. The Cabinet then drafted an Order in Council to that effect. On September 10, Vincent Massey, Canada's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, brought the document to King George VI, at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, for his signature, [7] [8] whereupon Canada had officially declared war on Germany. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [9] In his capacity as the government's official recorder for the war effort, Leonard Brockington noted: "King George VI of England [sic] did not ask us to declare war for him—we asked King George VI of Canada to declare war for us." [10] [11] [12]
Fascist Italy[edit]
On June 10, 1940, Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom. [2] [3] [9]Canadian National Defence Minister Norman Rogers had been killed in a plane crash that day. [9] Both houses of parliament approved a declaration of war and the Cabinet issued the Order in Council the same day. It was submitted to the King and the proclamation was read by the Prime Minister to parliament the following day. [2] [3] [9]
Finland, Hungary, Romania[edit]
Parliament adjourned on November 14, 1941, and was not scheduled to return until January 21, 1942. [2] At the urging of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom declared war on Finland on December 6, 1941. [13] At the UK's urging, the Canadian Cabinet the next day issued a proclamation declaring war on Finland, [13] Hungary, and Romania.[2]
Japan[edit]
On December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan), the Empire of Japan began an undeclared war upon the United Kingdom (invading Hong Kong and Malaya ), Canada, and the United States (attacking Pearl Harbor ). [3] Mackenzie King and the Cabinet decided to go to war with Japan that evening and issued a proclamation the following day declaring that, as of December 7, a state of war existed between Japan and Canada. [2] [3] [14] One day later, the US and UK also declared war on the Japanese Empire. [3] These proclamations were presented by Mackenzie King to the House of Commons when parliament returned on January 21, 1942. [2]

In the late evening of December 7, 1941, the Canadian Prime Minister,            W. L. Mackenzie King, announced the Cabinet's decision to declare war            on Japan. The King approved Canada's declaration of war in the following            proclamation issued on December 8, 1941.
Whereas by and with the advice of our Privy Council for Canada we have                                    signified our approval of the issue of a proclamation in the Canada                                    Gazette declaring that a state of war with Japan exists and has existed                                    in Canada as and from the 7th day of December, 1941.
Now, therefore, we do hereby declare and proclaim that a state of war                                    with Japan exists and has existed as and from the seventh day of December,                                    1941.
Of all which our loving subjects and all others whom these presents                                    may concern are hereby required to take notice and to govern themselves                                    accordingly.

Okay, so from the search results, I've gathered some key points about how Canada got involved in World War II.

First, I found out that Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, just seven days after the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany following its invasion of Poland. This is mentioned in multiple sources, including Wikipedia and the Canadian War Museum's website.

Before that, I thought that maybe Canada was automatically at war when Britain declared war, but it seems that's not the case. The Statute of Westminster 1931 gave Canada autonomy in foreign affairs, so Canada had to make its own declaration of war. That's interesting; it shows that Canada was asserting its independence within the British Commonwealth.

According to the documents, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King announced his intention to seek Parliament's approval for declaring war. He called Parliament back into session early, on September 7, to discuss this matter. Both the House of Commons and the Senate approved the declaration of war on September 9, and the official declaration was made on September 10.

I also came across a speech by Prime Minister King where he explains the reasons for Canada's involvement. He talks about the threat posed by Nazi Germany and the need to defend freedom and democratic values. He also emphasizes that Canada's first concern is its own defense but that cooperating with Britain is essential.

Moreover, the proclamation of war was signed by King George VI, who was also the King of Canada at that time. This shows the constitutional relationship between Canada and the British Crown, even though Canada had gained independence in foreign affairs.

Looking beyond Germany, Canada also declared war on other Axis powers. For instance, after Italy declared war on France and the UK on June 10, 1940, Canada followed suit the same day. Similarly, Canada declared war on Japan on December 7, 1941, shortly after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and its invasion of British territories in Asia.

What's noteworthy is that for Japan, the declaration of war was made without waiting for Parliament's approval because it was an urgent matter. The Cabinet issued the declaration, and it was later presented to Parliament when it reconvened.

Overall, Canada's entry into World War II was a deliberate act by its government and Parliament, reflecting its commitment to the Allied cause and its growing sense of national identity separate from Britain.

Now, to sum it up: Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, after Nazi Germany invaded Poland and Britain declared war. Canada, having gained independence in foreign affairs through the Statute of Westminster 1931, chose to make its own declaration of war, asserting its autonomy within the Commonwealth. Prime Minister Mackenzie King sought and received Parliament's approval for this declaration. Canada also declared war on other Axis powers, including Italy in 1940 and Japan in 1941.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, after Nazi Germany invaded Poland and Britain declared war.}} \]
