I've been pondering this question about whether intelligence is genetic or environmental. It's a pretty big topic, and I know there must be a lot of research on it. I think intelligence is probably influenced by both genes and environment, but I'm not sure about the specifics. Maybe I should look up some studies or articles on this.

First, I need to define what intelligence means because it can be interpreted in different ways. Some people might think of intelligence as just IQ, while others might include emotional intelligence or other types of cognitive abilities. So, perhaps I should start by understanding how intelligence is generally defined in scientific research.

Let me consider doing a search to get a better grasp of how intelligence is defined and what factors influence it.

Definitions of Intelligence
Intelligence is an aspect that has been known for quite some time now. However, there has been no consensus on the definition of the concept. This has seen various scholars come up with different definitions regarding the concept of intelligence.
It can be noted that tracing the origin of the aspect of intelligence has remained unresolved. In the same breadth, the valuation of validity and accuracy regarding intelligence has not been defined. There are many definitions regarding the concept of intelligence from different scholars.
According to Gardner (1999), intelligence refers to when an individual can get and apply knowledge. From a different perspective, the concept of intelligence is referred to as the aspect that can be measured by intelligence tests.
Usually, the definitions are used in a general sense. However, these definitions can be criticized in various aspects. For instance, there are cases where individuals suffer from certain diseases that affect their intelligence in one way or the other. This includes autistic individuals or those who may appear to be mentally challenged.
These individuals can have exceptional skills in certain areas of life and poor in others (Angela, 2003). In addition, it has to be noted that the environment is very important in the life of an individual. Therefore, it is possible for individuals to perform certain things due to the opportunities presented by their environment as opposed to being intelligent.
For instance, a kid that has been bought a play station will know how to operate it compared to that kid who does not have one. Furthermore, some people can perform certain things due to inherited traits as opposed to being intelligent.
The health condition of an individual may have an impact on intelligence. Lastly, there are those who have been raised in a given environment, but cannot make use of the opportunities presented in the environment to perform certain things. Such individuals are normally referred to as less intelligent.

The theory of multiple intelligences has been seen as the best option given my instruments of choice. This theory was propounded by Howard Gardner. He came up with 7 constituents of intelligence. These elements are independent, and people possess each element to a varying amount (Gardner, 2000).
The seven elements include “the visual-spatial intelligence, the verbal-linguistic intelligence, the bodily-kinetic intelligence, the logical-mathematical intelligence, the interpersonal, and the musical, intrapersonal and naturalistic intelligence” (Stremba & Bisson, 2009, p. 26).
Instruments Used to Test Intelligence and Achievement
The instruments chosen include the ACER Test of Reasoning ability and the Constructive Thinking Inventory (CTI) for intelligence. The ACER Test of Reasoning ability has multiple choice items. This is meant to gauge the capability of young learners between the ages of nine and eleven.
The one being tested is required to answer all the questions provided. This instrument is widely used in Australia. Attention is given on scores. The outcome is used to determine the necessary vocational training for learners.
The CTI has over 100 self-reporting items and is commonly used by adults. In this case, the individual is required to respond to the statements given. The scale rates from 1 to 5. The outcome of the assessment can be by psychotherapists, as well as in counseling sessions.
This test is meant to evaluate an individual’s capacity to think in a constructive or destructive manner (Simons, 1998). It can be noted that several assessments for evaluating the intelligence levels have been proposed. They focus on the knowledge and abilities of individuals in general, as well as on certain areas with specificity.
On the other hand, the Basic Achievement Skills Inventory (BASI) and the Test of Academic Performance (TOAP) were chosen for achievement. The administration of the BASI instrument is done in a group. This instrument is critical in the identification of learning frailties among students.

On its part, TOAP is instrumental in the estimation of the academic performances among students. The instrument can be used to classify students based on their performances. TOAP make use of 6 subjects whereby the test is to be implemented within a designated period, and in an efficient manner (Reynolds & Miller, 2003).
Reliability and Validity of the Intelligence Instruments
The evaluation of testing instruments is critical to the validity and reliability of the tests. Therefore, the ACER Test of Reasoning ability can be subjected to the reliability test. In this case, various items that are said to measure the same aspect should be put to test to evaluate whether they can produce congruent outcomes.
In the case of the ACER Test of Reasoning ability, the individuals are tested based on the seventy items. The focus is on the intelligence and the general knowledge. This test has been given a score of over 80% in terms of reliability.
The aspect of validity has been defined as the strength of the conclusions or inferences (Oswald, 2001). In this regard, a relationship should be feasible between students’ scores and the ratings given by the instructor. Reliability and validity of a test should be used in determining issues in the education sector such as vocational training.
The normative aspect of the tests related to the selection of the individuals who are to be tested. The test is likely to be implemented in an expansive area with different demographics and cultural aspects. Thus, there is a possibility that anomalies will occur on the outcome.
The aspect of bias can be noted in gender issues. In this case, there are those disciplines where a certain gender will perform better and not in others.
On the part of the Constructive Thinking Inventory, the aspect of reliability can also be tested. The scale has items that are aimed at testing different aspects. These items measure what they were intended to measure. In addition, the items should be sufficient to measure the variables.
Validity is closely associated with correlation studies. In this case, there are various items that can be used to test the emotional and physical aspects of an individual. Bias can be noted in various aspects including age, educational level, and gender. The bias should be eliminated from the test to be accepted.

The Difference Between the Achievements and Intelligence Tests
Intelligence tests and achievement tests can be difficult to differentiate. Nonetheless, the two tests have recognizable differences when closely analyzed. Notably, the achievement tests evaluate what an individual has already learnt. On the other hand, the intelligence tests are meant to evaluate an individual’s potential.
In addition, there is a variation in the score of the two tests. In this case, the intelligence tests rely on the standard deviation in measuring individuals. On the other hand, the achievement tests only require an individual to score high marks to show that what is being measured has been grasped by the individual.
Ethical Consideration
It has to be acknowledged that any human undertaking has its ethical aspects. Therefore, there are several ethical issues that can be related to the achievement and intelligence tests. This is especially in an academic setting. It should be acknowledged that examination can have serious consequences in the life of individuals.
In this case, before the administration of any examination, the examiner should take the necessary precautionary measures. For instance, for those students whose performance is low, they can be given special attention to ensure that their needs are well addressed.
In this case, such students cannot learn at the same speed as the normal students and thus require special attention. Furthermore, when the test is affected by cultural bias, there is a high chance that the performance of the affected students being affected.
Thus, the aspect of bias while administering the test should be avoided. The IQ tests are usually considered culturally biased. However, they are widely used and have an impact on the performance of the individuals being tested.
The assessments done on students should have undisputed validity and reliability to ensure that they are widely accepted. This will remove any bias and doubts that may affect the applicability of the assessments.
Notably, it is clear that intelligence has been defined differently. In this case, there is no one definition of the concept, which has been agreed upon by various scholars. There are also numerous theories that have been put forward in an effort to comprehend intelligence.
Furthermore, numerous tests and measures have been established to help in measuring intelligence. These tests should be used appropriately to come up with reliable and valid outcomes.

Generally people have a perceptive notion of what intelligence is, and a lot of words in the English language differentiate between different levels of intellectual skill: bright, dull, smart, unintelligent, intelligent, slow, and so on. Up till now no universally accepted definition of intelligence is present, and people carry on to debate what, exactly, it is. Fundamental questions stay on. Is intelligence one general ability or several independent systems of abilities? Is intelligence a property of the brain, a characteristic of behaviour, or a set of knowledge and skills? Kagan, J., Havemann, E. & Segal, J. 1984, 152-153

The plain definition proposed is that intelligence is anything intelligence tests measure. But this meaning does not describe the ability well, and it has several problems. First, it is circular: The tests are assumed to authenticate the existence of intelligence, which in turn is computable by the tests. Second, various different intelligence tests exist, and they do not all calculate the similar thing. In fact, the makers of the first intelligence tests did not commence with a particular idea of what they wanted to measure. Finally, the definition states very slight about the precise nature of intelligence. In my view, the definition of intelligence is best described as defined by David Wechsler as the “capacity to understand the world and is the resourcefulness to cope with its challenges.” Siefker, J.M. 1996, 29-35
Theories of Intelligence
Scholars have tried to understand the nature of intelligence for many years, but they still do not agree on a single theory or definition. Some theorists try to understand intelligence by analyzing the results of intelligence tests and identifying clusters of abilities. Other theorists believe that intelligence encompasses many abilities not captured by tests. In recent years, some psychologists have tried to explain intelligence from a biological standpoint. The below table illustrates briefly the various theories formed in time:
General intelligence (Charles Spearman, 1904) – Intelligence is one general mental capability represented as g. The g factor underlies performance on all intellectual tasks. Berryman.J, et al, 2002, 201-206
Primary mental abilities (Louis L. Thurstone, 1938 ) – Intelligence consists of seven independent primary abilities: verbal, comprehension, verbal fluency, number or arithmetic ability, memory, perceptual speed, inductive reasoning, and spatial visualization. Davison.G. Neale.J. Kring.A. 2004, 302-309
Fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence (Raymond B. Cattell and John Horn 1966) – Intelligence consists of two broad abilities. 1- Fluid intelligence is one’s biologically based capacity for reasoning and memory. 2- Crystallized intelligence is the knowledge and skills acquired through experience and learning. Berryman.J, et al, 2002, 201-206
Multiple intelligences (Howard Gardner, 1983.) – There are seven kinds of intelligence: linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and interpersonal intelligence. Most activities draw on several kinds of intelligence.
Triarchic theory of intelligence (Robert Sternberg, 1985) – Intelligence consists of three major parts. 1- Analytic intelligence is skill in reasoning and in processing information. 2- Creative intelligence is skill in using past experiences to achieve insight and deal with new situations. 3- Practical intelligence is skill in everyday living and in adapting to life demands. Davison.G. Neale.J. Kring.A. 2004, 302-309
Studying briefly the various theories as stated above, Multiple Intelligences theory by Gardner drew my attention as I opine, together with Thurston’s theory, correctly describe that intelligence is not a single ability but a combination of several different abilities. Berryman.J, et al, 2002, 201-206
In 1983 American psychologist Howard Gardner proposed a theory that sought to broaden the traditional definition of intelligence. He felt that the concept of intelligence, as it had been defined by mental tests, did not capture all of the ways humans can excel. Gardner argued that we do not have underlying general intelligence but instead have multiple intelligences, each part of an independent system in the brain. Davison.G. Neale.J. Kring.A. 2004, 302-309
In formulating his theory, Gardner placed less emphasis on explaining the results of mental tests than on accounting for the range of human abilities that exist across cultures. He drew on diverse sources of evidence to determine the number of intelligences in his theory. For example, he examined studies of brain-damaged people who had lost one ability, such as spatial thinking, but retained another, such as language. The fact that two abilities could operate independently of one another suggested the existence of separate intelligences. Gardner also proposed that evidence for multiple intelligences came from prodigies and savants. Berryman.J, et al, 2002, 201-206 Prodigies are individuals who show an exceptional talent in a specific area at a young age, but who are normal in other respects. Savants are people who score low on IQ tests-and who may have only limited language or social skills-but demonstrate some remarkable ability, such as extraordinary memory or drawing ability. To Gardner, the presence of certain high-level abilities in the absence of other abilities also suggested the existence of multiple intelligences. Davison.G. Neale.J. Kring.A. 2004, 302-309
Gardner initially identified seven intelligences and proposed a person who exemplified each one. Linguistic intelligence involves aptitude with speech and language and is exemplified by poet T. S. Eliot. Logical-mathematical intelligence involves the ability to reason abstractly and solve mathematical and logical problems. Physicist Albert Einstein is a good example of this intelligence. Spatial intelligence is used to perceive visual and spatial information and to conceptualize the world in tasks like navigation and in art. Painter Pablo Picasso signifies a person of high spatial intelligence. Smith.E. et, al 2004, 402-410 Musical intelligence, the skill to carry out and appreciate music, is represented by composer Igor Stravinsky. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence is the ability to use one’s body or portions of it in various activities, such as dancing, athletics, acting, surgery, and magic. Martha Graham, the famous dancer and choreographer, is a good example of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. Interpersonal intelligence involves understanding others and acting on that understanding and is exemplified by psychiatrist Sigmund Freud. Intrapersonal intelligence is the ability to understand one’s self and is typified by the leader Mohandas Gandhi. In the late 1990s Gardner added an eighth intelligence to his theory: naturalist intelligence, the ability to recognize and classify plants, animals, and minerals. Naturalist Charles Darwin is an example of this intelligence. According to Gardner, each person has a unique profile of these intelligences, with strengths in some areas and weaknesses in others. Smith.E. et, al 2004, 402-410
There are several objections that could be stated on the multiple intelligences theory. Firstly, Gardner based his ideas more on reasoning and intuition than on empirical studies. From what I understand, there are no tests available to identify or measure the specific intelligences and that the theory largely ignores decades of research that show a tendency for different abilities to correlate evidence of a general intelligence factor. In addition, some of the intelligences Gardner identified, such as musical intelligence and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, should be regarded simply as talents because I opine that they are not usually required to adapt to life demands. Smith.E. et, al 2004, 402-410
Intelligence Tests
The first intelligence tests were short-answer exams planned to predict which students might require special attention to be successful in school. Because intelligence tests were used to make significant decisions about people’s lives, it was approximately inevitable that they would become contentious. Today, intelligence tests are widely used in education, business, government, and the military. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 99-103 However, psychologists continue to debate what the tests actually measure and how test results should be used. The most widely used modern tests of intelligence are the Stanford-Binet, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (Kaufman-ABC). The most suitable test that can adequately justify Gardner’s but also Thurston’s theory, is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) developed by David Wechsler who also believed that intelligence is an aggregate of abilities and should be measured as such. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 99-103
The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) is an individually administered instrument used as part of a cognitive assessment or general psychological or neuropsychological assessment to measure capacity for intelligent behaviour. It is commonly used to obtain IQ scores, to make diagnoses of mental retardation, to identify intellectually gifted individuals and as part of neuropsychological test batteries. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 99-103
The WAIS-R is composed of eleven tests that are referred as subtests. These sub-tests are divided into six verbal ones and five non-verbal. The verbal section can also be administered by itself to persons who are visually impaired or have impaired ability to manipulate objects. The individual sub-tests included are:
Verbal Scale Performance Scale
1. Information 7. Picture Completion
2. Digit Span 8. Picture Arrangement
3. Vocabulary 9. Block Design
4. Arithmetic 10. Object Assembly
5. Comprehension 11. Digit Symbol
6. Similarities
Test Characteristics:
Format: Oral questions are presented, there is a printed vocabulary list, pictures, blocks painted with geometric figures to be arranged according to the prescribed designs, jig-saw-like puzzles paper and pencil work. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 222-226
Administration: The test is administered individually. It cannot be given in a group. It usually requires 60 to 90 minutes to administer depending on the person tested. The verbal and non-verbal groups of subtests may be administered separately or together to yield respectively, a Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ. The Performance tests may be given by themselves to individuals who are limited in their use of English (such as individuals with hearing impairments or those whose native language is not English. Some tests may be unsuitable for individuals with certain types of disabilities, especially visual, hearing and upper extremity mobility impairments. Valid results may still be obtained if not all of the tests are administered. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 222-226

Scoring: Responses from the person tested are compared to scoring keys for some tests (i.e. block design, digit symbol, object assembly, arithmetic, etc). For tests that require more open-ended responses (i.e. comprehension, similarities, vocabulary), sample responses are given. Raw scores are converted to scaled scores using conversion tables. Scaled scores on subtests are added and converted to IQs using tables. Scores are given for Verbal, Performance and Full Scale IQs. Sometimes, scaled scores from the individual tests are profiled to show differences in abilities as reflected by subtest scores. A difference of three or more scaled score points is necessary to achieve statistical significance at the 15% level of confidence. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 222-226 Kaufman, J.et, al 2005, 179-186
Norms: The WAIS-R was formed on a population of older adolescents and adults that is demographically representative of the population of the United States and later on of the population of the United Kingdom. All age groups are represented according to their stratification in their own country according to the variables of age, gender, race, geographic region, occupation, education and urban/rural residence. In addition, certain populations (such as institutionalized persons with mental retardation, individuals diagnosed with head injuries or severe behavioural or emotional problems, or those who have physical impairments that restrict their ability to respond to test items) were not included in the standardization sample. Norms are given for nine age groups (16-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-69, and 70-74).
Reliability – Validity: Verbal IQ and Full Scale IQ have higher average reliability coefficients (.97) than Performance (.93). Validity studies compared the WAIS-R to earlier editions of the same test and to the Stanford-Binet. These studies again show high correlation. Kaufman, J.et, al 2005, 179-186
Selection Criteria: The test is suitable for all ages between 16 years 0 months and 74 years 11 months. People older than 75 may be tested but no norms are available. The WAIS-R is not intended to make fine discrimination among adults of extremely high ability because it has a natural ceiling. IQs above 150 are not provided for in the IQ tables. Smith.P. Cowie.H. Blades.M. 2003, 222-226
Skills Needed: The following basic skills or abilities are needed for each of the eleven tests. Depending on the disability, additional skills may be required.
Information : Hearing and speaking
Picture Completion: Vision
Digit Span: Hearing and speaking
Picture Arrangement: Vision
Vocabulary: Hearing and speaking
Block Design: Vision
Arithmetic: Hearing and speaking
Object Assembly: Vision, ability to use hands to manipulate objects
Comprehension: Hearing and speaking
Digit Symbol: ability to use a pencil
Similarities: hearing and speaking
One criticism of intelligence tests is that they do not really measure intelligence but only a narrow set of mental capabilities. For example, intelligence tests do not measure wisdom, creativity, common sense, social skills, and practical knowledge-abilities that allow people to adapt well to their surroundings and solve daily problems. Kaufman, J.et, al 2005, 179-186Another criticism of IQ tests is that some people may not perform well because they become anxious when taking any timed, standardized test. Their poor performance may reflect their anxiety rather than their true abilities. Furthermore, IQ tests tend to be misinterpreted and misused. Because IQ tests reduce intelligence to a single number, many people mistakenly regard IQ as if it were a fixed, real trait such as height or weight, rather than an abstract concept that was originally designed to predict performance in school. Kaufman, J.et, al 2005, 179-186 Finally, some people might view IQ as a measurement of a person’s intrinsic worth or potential, even though many factors other than those measured by IQ tests contribute to life success.
Conclusion
In judging the uses of intelligence tests, one must compare how decisions would be made without using the tests. When tests are used to make a decision, there should be evidence that the decision made using the test is better with the test than without it.

Intelligence Definition | What is Intelligence? | Brain Metrix
Intelligence Definition
What is intelligence?
Intelligence is defined as general cognitive problem-solving skills. A mental ability involved in reasoning, perceiving relationships and analogies, calculating, learning quickly… etc. Earlier it was believed that there was one underlying general factor at the intelligence base (the g-factor ), but later psychologists maintained that it is more complicated and could not be determined by such a simplistic method. Some psychologists have divided intelligence into subcategories. For example Howard Gardner maintained that it is comprised of seven components: musical, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical, linguistic, spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Other definitions are: “Intelligence is what you do when you don't know what to do.” “Intelligence is a hypothetical idea which we have defined as being reflected by certain types of behavior.”
Is Intelligence Inherited?
It is generally accepted that intelligence is inherited but can also be related to the environment. While studies showed that heredity is an important factor in determining intelligence; it was also suggested that environment is a critical factor in determining the extent of its expression. An investigation done recently revealed that 70 percent of the differences in the twins' I.Q. scores were attributable to inherited traits. Previous studies had suggested that about 50 percent of the differences in scores were inherited. Studies showed that the grey matter volume is strongly determined by genes, and reflected cognitive performance. It was also suggested that there is a strong genetic influence on IQ, verbal and spatial abilities, So in short our genes determine the quality of our intelligence, our ability to integrate and process information. The level of our intelligence determines how well we cope with changes in our environment. It is believed that race and culture have their share in intelligence as well, but so far there is no confirmed conclusion that intelligence varies from race to race. Environmental factors can play a role as well, but in fact they are capable of slowing down our mental processes more than enhancing it. There is no evidence to indicate that our environment can increase intelligence to a relatively high level.  It is also inherently easier to degrade brain tissue than to create more complex brain tissue. Enhancements in brain structure require long periods of evolutionary selection, in addition to the availability of extraneous sources of energy. While brain degradation can happen in a relatively shorter time.
Intelligence Tests
A number of psychologists have argued that intelligence can be quantified, primarily through testing. In 1905, Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon devised a system for testing intelligence, with scoring based on average mental levels for various age groups. However the German psychologist L. Wilhelm Stern was the first to coin the term intelligence quotient (IQ), a figure derived from the ratio of mental age to chronological age. Although Stern's method for determining IQ is no longer in common use, the term IQ is still used today to describe the results in several different tests. Today, an average IQ score is considered to be 100, with deviations based on this figure. Intelligence tests do not measure creativity, character, personality, or other important differences among individuals, nor are they intended to. While there are different types of intelligence tests, they all measure the same intelligence. Some use words or numbers and require specific cultural knowledge (like vocabulary). Others do not, and instead use shapes or designs and require knowledge of only simple, universal concepts. Most people cluster around the average (IQ 100). Few are either very bright or very dull: About 3% of Americans score above IQ 130. Intelligence tests are not culturally biased against any race, for example in America, IQ scores predict equally and accurately for all Americans (African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics …), regardless of race and social class. Individuals who do not understand English well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language. The main criticism of intelligence testing is that it is difficult to insure that test items are equally meaningful or difficult for members of different sociocultural groups. Testing is often considered validated in part, however, by the finding that the quantity measured by the tests can be closely correlated in American society with career and academic achievement.
Can we Increase our Intelligence?
There are certainly ways to increase one's intelligence, also called intelligence amplification/ enhancing, by practicing many proven cognitive tools such as mnemonics, problem-solving heuristics, creativity techniques and decision-making tools. An increase in the intelligence level can only result in a better life, health, and standard of living. Below you will find some simple intelligence boosters:
Deep thinking : in life it's not enough to just react to events, and situations, rather we should have a conscious objective and select our actions to get nearer our objective. Also it's important to think about consequences of our actions, to minimize the possibilities of errors and regret. Deep thinking would normally help you live better, and reach your goal
Good reasoning : it is the key to success, especially if performed consciously and in the proper order: 1) have an objective, 2) make a general sensing about it, 3) determine your decision based on your sensing, 4) make alternate plans (along the main objective), 5) select the best response/ plan. 5) start by carrying out your plan, 6) observe results, 7) store experiences (for future reference).
Learning from past experience : it is believed that many inventions were actually re- nventions; for example Egyptians 2000-4000 years ago were using some unique techniques to build their temples, buildings… but since the early Egyptians were not good at keeping records of what they were doing, many of their inventions/ techniques were lost, and they had to be reinvented many centuries after them, which means that we had to start from point zero again because we didn't keep records of our discoveries. You can apply that to your own life, learning from the past experience either bad or good is very beneficial, and can save you a lot of time and effort. A good way to do that is journal writing which is a useful way to develop self understanding, and to analyze events, in addition to provide a record of how we change over time.
Practice : you cannot learn swimming from a book, the same thing should be taken into consideration when dealing with “thinking”; you cannot learn to think without practicing. And as mentioned earlier, a good way to start is with cognitive tools such as brain exercises: mnemonics, problem-solving heuristics, creativity techniques,  brainstorming,  puzzles, brain teasing games … etc.
Intelligence Pills? Smart Drugs?
It would sure be nice if we just take a smart pill and get smarter, instead of going through all those brain teasers and problem-solving training. In fact, scientists are indeed studying substances that may improve mental abilities. These substances are called “cognitive enhancers” or “smart drugs”. The supposed effects of these intelligence drugs can be several things, for example, it can improve memory, learning, attention, concentration, problem solving, reasoning, social skills, decision making and planning. In most cases, smart drugs have been used to treat people with neurological or mental disorders, but there is a growing number of healthy, “normal” people who use these substances in hopes of getting smarter. However it's arguable if the cognitive enhancers have some effects if any. Results from different laboratories show mixed results; some labs show positive effects on memory and learning; other labs show no effects. The intelligence pills are supposed to work by increasing brain metabolism, increasing cerebral circulation, or protection of the brain from physical and chemical damage, and as a consequence they result in increased mental energy, increased alertness, decreased depression, improved memory, and improved learning ability. There are many names in the market of these smart pills, and the number is growing bigger day after day. Many of them are made of herbal as well as chemical substances. Below is a list of some intelligence enhancers in their natural state:
Ginko Biloba extracts : apparently have vasodilatory effects, and have in some studies shown it could treat some symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. They also appear to have some effects on short term memory. But no study to confirm these results yet.
Choline : A natural amine, often classed in the vitamin B complex. There is evidence that drugs that stimulate the cholinergic systems improve certain memory tasks, and there is much speculation that adding extra choline to the diet would lead to better general memory performance.
Caffeine : caffeine acts as a mild stimulant to the nervous system, blocking the neurotransmitter adenosine and resulting in a feeling of well-being and alertness. It increases the heart rate, blood pressure. Although it's not smart to take it as a smart drug, it is however probably relevant anyway, simple, relatively safe if not taken excessively. May be one cup or less a day is considered to be within the safe range.
Glucose : has been shown to improve memory when given in certain dosages in association with a learning task; how to exploit this to improve cognition in general is a more complex problem, because it can have negative effects as well.
Definitions related to Intelligence:
Gifted : used to describe individuals having great natural ability or talent, usually the equivalent of “intelligent”, this term is used often with children ”a gifted child”, also other possible equivalent words are “smart”, “nerd”, “brainy”, “genius”…etc.
Giftedness : is an intellectual ability significantly higher than average. The fact of having a mind ahead of the physical growth, and could be simply the equivalent of “intelligence”.
Creativity : mental process of generating new ideas or concepts,or new associations between existing ideas or concepts.
Super-brain : also called mega-brain is used as a term to refer to machines or individuals who can perform/ process complicated tasks in a relatively faster speed.
High Intelligence Society : usually refers to a community where people with higher I.Q/ geniuses meet and exchange their ideas for the benefit of humanity, and to encourage the uses of intelligence. Usually a certain I.Q score should be obtained to join one of those societies.
IQ (intelligence quotient) : is used to refer to tests “measuring” intelligence, and scoring it. Please refer to my home page.
G-Factor : is an expression used to quantify what is common to the scores of all intelligence tests. G is the abbreviation of “general intelligence factor”
Brainstorming : the process performed by a person or a group of people to solve a problem by rapidly generating a variety of possible solutions.
Intelligence : (in differnent languages) Dutch (intelligentie), French (intelligence), German (Intelligenz), Greek (ευφυϊα), Italian (notizia), Portuguese (inteligência), Russian (умственныеспособности), Spanish (inteligencia), Swedish (intelligens), Chinese (智力, 智力), Japanese (理解力), Arabic (ذكاء),  Hebrew (תבונה).
Artificial Intelligence : generally used to refer to the ability of a computer or other machine to perform activities that normally require intelligence, or automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Artificial intelligence is also abbreviated into “AI”.

Alright, so I've got this question: "Is intelligence genetic or environmental?" Hmm, that's a big one. I think intelligence is probably a mix of both genes and environment, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some studies or articles to get a better understanding.

First off, I need to know what intelligence really is. It seems like a straightforward concept, but I recall that psychologists have different definitions for it. So, perhaps I should start by figuring out how intelligence is defined in psychology.

I'll do a search to find out how intelligence is defined.
