So I have this question: "How did the transatlantic slave trade start?" Hmm, I know that the transatlantic slave trade involved the forced migration of millions of Africans to the Americas, but I'm not exactly sure how it all began. I think I need to do some research to get a accurate understanding of its origins.

First, I should probably look up some basic information about the transatlantic slave trade. Maybe start with a general search to get an overview. Let me try that.

Question: When did the atlantic slave trade start?
Question: When did the atlantic slave trade start?
The transatlantic slave trade began during the 15th century when Portugal, and subsequently other European kingdoms, were finally able to expand overseas and reach Africa. The Portuguese first began to kidnap people from the west coast of Africa and to take those they enslaved back to Europe.05-Oct-2012
From 1500 to 80 C.E. somewhere between ten and 12 million slaves were forcibly moved from Africa to the Americas. “The Atlantic Slave Trade, over a period of three centuries, brought more than 10 million enslaved Africans to the shores of the Americas” (AAS 31).
When did the Atlantic trade begin?
Transatlantic slave trade, segment of the global slave trade that transported between 10 million and 12 million enslaved Africans across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas from the 16th to the 19th century.
When was the Atlantic slave trade at its peak?
During the peak years of the slave trade, between 1740 and 1810, Africa supplied 60,000 captives a year–outnumbering European migrants by a ratio of 4 or 5 to 1. By the beginning of the 18th century, black slaves could be found in every New World area colonized by Europeans, from Nova Scotia to Buenos Aires.
When did the Slave Trade Act start?
The Slave Trade Act of 1794 was a law passed by the United States Congress that limited American involvement in the international slave trade. It was signed into law by President George Washington on March 22, 1794. This was the first of several anti- slavery trade -acts of Congress.
What factors led to the Atlantic slave trade?
These seven factors led to the development of the slave trade: The importance of the West Indian colonies. The shortage of labour. The failure to find alternative sources of labour. The legal position. Racial attitudes. Religious factors. Military factors.
Where did most African slaves come from?
Volume of Transatlantic Slave Trade by Region of Embarkation (in thousands) 1519–1700. The majority of all people enslaved in the New World came from West Central Africa. Before 1519, all Africans carried into the Atlantic disembarked at Old World ports, mainly Europe and the offshore Atlantic islands.
Where did most of the slaves from Africa go?
The majority of enslaved Africans went to Brazil, followed by the Caribbean. A significant number of enslaved Africans arrived in the American colonies by way of the Caribbean, where they were “seasoned” and mentored into slave life. They spent months or years recovering from the harsh realities of the Middle Passage.
Which European nation would go on to play the biggest role in the Atlantic slave trade?
The most active European nation in the trans-Atlantic slave trade was Portugal, which used the forced labor of Africans in their Latin American colonies in present-day Brazil. Almost 3.9 million enslaved Africans were forced to embark on Portuguese ships.
How were slaves captured in Africa?
Enslavers ambushed and captured local people in Africa. Most slave ships used British ‘factors’, men who lived full-time in Africa and bought enslaved people from local leaders. Enslaved peoples might have been captured during warfare or raids on their homes.
When did slavery start in Africa?
Sometime in 1619, a Portuguese slave ship, the São João Bautista, traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with a hull filled with human cargo: captive Africans from Angola, in southwestern Africa.
Who ended slavery?
Lincoln moved to end slavery on New Year’s Day 1863. It went on for three more years. On New Year’s morning of 1863, President Abraham Lincoln hosted a three-hour reception in the White House. That afternoon, Lincoln slipped into his office and — without fanfare — signed a document that changed America forever.
When did it become illegal to import slaves?
After Congress prohibited the foreign importation of slaves into the United States in 1808, slaves were still sold and transported within the boundaries of the United States.
Why did England stop slavery?
Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. The results of these inquiries contributed greatly to the abolition of slavery with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.
Who benefited from the slave trade?
In the mid-18th century, a third of the British merchant fleet was engaged in transporting 50,000 Africans a year to the New World. But it wasn’t just slave traders or New World planters who benefited from the slave trade. American ship owners, farmers, and fisherman also profited from slavery.
What items did European traders trade for African slaves?
Africans were either captured in warring raids or kidnapped and taken to the port by African slave traders. There they were exchanged for iron, guns, gunpowder, mirrors, knives, cloth, and beads brought by boat from Europe.
Why did the slave trade last so long?
MPs. The main reason it took so long to abolish the slave trade was simply because the pro- slave trade lobby had too many important and powerful figures in the establishment.

Introduction
Slavery predated European forays into the Atlantic world, but the system that developed during the 16th and 17th centuries was a more exploitative, inhumane, and racially tinged institution than anything that had previously existed in Europe, Africa, or the Americas. The European conquest of the Americas and establishment of colonies was profit oriented. Indigenous peoples were initially preyed upon for their labor in the Caribbean and throughout the Americas, especially in the silver mines of Mexico and the Andes. Bound European laborers were also employed by the thousands, particularly by the French and the British in their West Indian and mainland colonies, where they were used primarily as plantation laborers. Historians agree that a combination of factors (most notably the deaths of Indians from epidemic diseases and the expansion of labor-intensive plantation agricultural enterprises, especially sugar cultivation) led to the decline of these earlier forms of bound labor and the emergence of a new predatory system of slavery that relied on bound African laborers. The unwillingness or inability to treat white Europeans in a slavish fashion also encouraged Europeans to look elsewhere for a labor force that could be totally dominated and compelled to serve the needs of the labor-starved American planters. Though it began in the 16th century as a relatively small-scale enterprise, the transatlantic slave trade erupted in the 17th and 18th centuries to satisfy the demand for human beings to cut cane and tend the sugar mills in Brazil and the West Indies, to work the tobacco fields and rice paddies of North America, and generally to perform the often backbreaking and dehumanizing tasks that Europeans were unwilling to do themselves. The specific labor regimes and legal systems that developed in different parts of the Americas varied greatly, but everywhere Europeans came to agree that African peoples were uniquely valuable commodities whose labor, as slaves, was integral to the wealth and power of both Europe and the emerging states in the Americas.
General Overviews
There are a number of important general surveys of the larger history of slavery in the Americas, although many tend to concentrate on one or two nations and pay much more attention to the mature slave system than its early development. Black 2006 provides researchers with a good overview of the best in journal literature. Curtin 1990 and Davis 2006 emphasize the importance of Mediterranean precedents, particularly with sugar cultivation but also with the exploitation of African slaves. Eltis 2000 and Blackburn 1997 are similarly interested in the paradoxical emergence and expansion of slavery in the Atlantic world when the institution was largely irrelevant in western Europe. Patterson 1982 is interested in those things that make slavery alike in different times and places, while Turley 2000 seeks to establish the qualities that make slavery distinctive in separate arenas.

Atlantic slave trade
From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Reproduction of a handbill advertising a slave auction in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1769.
The Atlantic slave trade was the selling of African slaves by Europeans that happened in and around the Atlantic Ocean. It lasted from the 15th century to the 19th century. Most slaves were shipped from West Africa and brought over to the New World on a slave ship. The slaves were transported on a ship on which slaves lived in bad conditions. The journey by ship was known as the Middle Passage .

Sources of slaves[change | change source]
Some slaves were captured in battles or through raids and kidnapping.[1] Some were sold into slavery as punishment or to pay a debt, usually by other Africans. [1] Then they were shackled together and marched to the coast on journeys lasting weeks or months. [1] When they arrived they were imprisoned in forts where they were purchased by Europeans. Most historians today think that between 12 million and 13 million Africans arrived in the New World. [2]
The Dahomian army was involved and traded slaves for weapons to protect themselves. King Gezo of Dahomey said in the 1840s:
The slave trade is the ruling principle of my people. It is the source and the glory of their wealth...the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery... [3]
Slave trade[change | change source]
The slave-trade is sometimes called the Maafa by African and African-American scholars.[4] It means catastrophe in the Swahili language.[4] Some slave ships worked a three-part economic cycle often called the triangular trade.[5] It tied the economies of several regions and continents together. [5] The main triangular trading countries were England, The Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal.[5] Other ships just worked the slave trade.
Christopher Columbus first came to the Americas in 1492 while seeking the West Indies. This led to an economic reason for the transatlantic slave trade. Slaves were first imported in large numbers for mining and later to grow sugarcane in plantations. Slavery is much more ancient than the transatlantic trade. Slaves were used in many ancient societies. [6]
Abolition and illegal trade[change | change source]
In the 18th century, a small opposition developed against the slave trade in Britain, America, and some parts of Europe. [7] In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as William Wilberforce. People who protested against the trade were opposed by the owners of land in the Americas. [8] After 1772, slaves became free upon entering the British isles. [9] Abolitionism became stronger in the 19th century.
Denmark was the first European country to ban the slave trade, in 1792, which took effect in 1803. On 22 February 1807, the work of William Wilberforce was rewarded with victory. By an overwhelming 283 votes for to 16 against, the motion for the Slave Trade Act to abolish the Atlantic slave trade was carried in the House of Commons.[10] The United States abolished it later that year. The Royal Navy set up a Blockade of Africa to stop the trade, and treaties with other nations allowed the blockade ships to stop their slave trade. However, smuggling of slaves was very common and hundreds of thousands of black people were enslaved illegally. New York City was a center for this illegal slave trade, and judges in New York avoided punishing slave traders through the 19th century. [11] Many slaves continued to be sent to Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico and Cuba as well as much of South America.[12]

Name:____________________________________________________ Date:_______ Period:____ Unit 4: Causes & Impacts of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Inquiry Lesson Homework Reading Article: “An African Country Reckons with Its History of Selling Slaves” by Kevin Sieff via Washington Post Instructions: In preparation for the inquiry lesson and subsequent discussion, please read THIS article and respond to the questions below. Be aware that any of these questions could be further addressed during the class discussion. 1. Where did the de Souza family originate? The Souza family originated from Brazil, which was a portguese colony.
Brazil.
The De Souza family can be traced back to Brazil.
A legendary Brazilian figure Francisco came to exert immense power over the whole slave coast in the first half of the nineteenth century.
The family spread to Benin and Togo.
2. Why do you think de Souza emigrated to Benin in the late 1700s?
I believe that de Souza emigrated to Benin to make money off of the Slave Trade.
To become a slave merchant
Francisco Félix de Sousa was a major slave trader and merchant who traded in palm oil, gold and slaves. He migrated from Brazil to what is now the African republic of Benin. He has been called "the greatest slave trader". Trading slaves from what was then the Dahomey region, he was known for his extravagance and was reputed to have had at least 80 children with women in his harem. De Sousa continued to market slaves after the trade was abolished in most jurisdictions. [4] He was apparently so trusted by the locals in Dahomey that he was awarded the status of a trbal chief in Benin.
3. What countries bought slaves from Benin in the 17th and 18th centuries?
France, Britain, Portugal.
Your answer is correct but a bit of addition.
These countries were Portugal, Britain and France. The slave trade took place for over 200 years and the kingdoms in Benin were capturing and selling women, men and children of the neighboring kingdom in exchange for goods from the Portuguese, British and French merchants.
4. Where were the slaves typically sent?
Brazil, Hati, and the United States
Brazil, Haiti and the United States
During the Atlantic slave trade, from about 1526 to 1867, about 12.5 million slaves were shipped from Africa and 10.7 million came to America. The Atlantic slave trade was probably the most expensive of all long-distance migrations in the world.
Africans brought to Brazil came mainly from Angola. Africans transported to North America, including the Caribbean, traveled mainly from West Africa.
More than 90 percent of enslaved Africans were imported into the Caribbean and South America. Only about 6 percent of African prisoners were sent directly to British North America.
The African slaves brought to Haiti were mainly from West Africa and a handful from Central Africa, some from various areas from Senegal to the Congo.

5. Why do you think the descendants of slave merchants remain Benin’s most influential people, 200 years later?
The rich can control the history, and can make it seem like they are good people, they are also rich, and the rich have a major influence in any society.
The rich can control the history , and can make it seem like they are good people , they are also rich , and the rich have a major influence in any society .
6. What are two reasons Benin’s history of slavery was misrepresented in the past?
● Reason 1: Refusal to acknolege slavery’s effect on the people from Beinin, and the people learn mostly about there history from people travling from the west. ● Reason 2: France controlled Benin for a period of time and didn’t want to draw attention on themselves for slavery.
Benin, a history of province which provides prodigious information about the rich values of an ancient cultures. As we know, it was targeted by the unhappy act of slave trade. At the same time, in the past the Benin's history of slavery misrepresented by various historians due to the two main reasons.
The entire west was involved in the slave trade, which happened in the region. They did not wanted to highlight them just for the sake not to make them gaze bad.
The analyst along with above mentioned thing, were facing problems in representing the history with a more clear and strong words due to the forces present inside in Benin and outside the region.
(Earlier in the past, there was an empire in Africa, it was rich and considered the most powerful in the region. The ruler of that region had the manpower, along with the riches to defend their country. But, that happened - when there came crises (economic and financial) people were made slaves as foreigner were there to purchase slaves from the leaders who are willing to let their people in exchange of gold and other favors from the Portuguese, French and the British).
As mentioned above.
7. What is the Benin government’s motivation for creating two museums based on slavery?
To help acknoledge the effects that Benin had on slavery.
Benin's government was interested in promoting and keeping African culture and reminding its people about the slave trade. The main purpose of the museums was to remind the people of the Benin kind of expression their fellow Africans went through in the period of the slave trade. Therefore, the museums were to store and preserve the history of the people of Benin and their culture.

8. Describe the ways in which the legacy of the trans-Atlantic slave trade is causing tensions in modern-day Benin. The trans-Atlantic slave trade is causing tenssions in mordern day Beinin, as people that suffered from the slave trade hated the people who were in charge of it, and the people who were in charge of it don’t want to acknowledge it.
The answer is as posited below. kindly have a look at it.
The legacy of the trans- Atlantic slave trade is prompting people in Benin to have issues about the country which is restricting tourism and money flow to the nation.
9. Should the de Souza family embrace their past and apologize or is the past the past (should they move on and forget it)? Explain your reasoning and thoughts in complete sentences. I feel the de Souza family should embrace their past and apologize, and then move past it. Apologizing for the past is something that needs to be done and could help lower tensions, but they need to move past it all they can do is apologize, the past is in the past.
The de Souza family should acknowledge and apologize for their past.
I suppose that descendants should comprehend and recognize that their forefathers' actions were gravely inappropriate and should not be discounted. Additionally, I believe they are not their forefathers and mothers, nor are they the ones who became slave traders or expanded a heinous system. It is consequently best for them to play their part and avoid becoming entangled in unimportant ideas of others.
10.Do you think the situation in Benin with the de Souza family is comparable to the history of the Civil War and/or slavery in the South? Why or why not. Explain your reasoning and thoughts in complete sentences. I think it is similar because the tensions are the same the whites in America compare to the de Souza family, and the African Americans are comparable to the families split up in Benin. In America the process for getting better treatment for the African Americans is slow, the same as the slow acklongement of slavery in Benin. Note: Many students read this article and feel it is appropriate to place the burden of the horrors of the trans-Atlantic slave trade on the shoulders of West Africans. But remember, without demand for slaves from Europeans, West Africans would not be supplying them with slaves. Consider basic economic tenants before making conclusions.
Answer:
Slave circumstances in both Benin and the South of the United States were horrible if they can be compared in any manner. Africans and African Americans were treated inhumanely. Francisco Félix de Souza dealt with slaves and served Guezo faithfully in order to battle his brother, King Adondazan, who ruled in Dahomey, as Benin was originally known.

Alright, so I've got this question: "How did the transatlantic slave trade start?" I need to figure this out based on the information I've gathered from my searches. Let's see what I have here.

First, from Doc 1, it says that the transatlantic slave trade began during the 15th century when Portugal and other European kingdoms were able to expand overseas and reach Africa. The Portuguese started kidnapping people from the west coast of Africa and taking them back to Europe. So, it seems like the Portuguese were among the first to engage in this practice.

Another point from Doc 1 is that from 1500 to 1800, somewhere between 10 and 12 million slaves were forcibly moved from Africa to the Americas. That's a huge number. It really highlights the scale of this tragic period in history.

Doc 1 also mentions that by the beginning of the 18th century, black slaves could be found in every New World area colonized by Europeans, from Nova Scotia to Buenos Aires. This shows how widespread the slave trade was and how it affected the entire Americas.

Moving on to Doc 2, which seems to be from Oxford Bibliographies. It provides more context about the origins of slavery in the Atlantic world. It notes that slavery predated European exploration, but the system that developed in the 16th and 17th centuries was more exploitative and racially tinged.

The document mentions that the European conquest of the Americas led to the establishment of colonies that were profit-oriented. Initially, indigenous peoples were used for labor, especially in the Caribbean and the Americas, particularly in silver mines. However, due to factors like disease and the demands of plantation agriculture, especially sugar cultivation, there was a shift towards using African slave labor.

This makes sense because sugar plantations were labor-intensive, and there was a high demand for workers who could handle the arduous tasks involved in sugar production. Indigenous populations were decimated by diseases brought by Europeans, so there was a labor shortage that needed to be filled.

Doc 2 also talks about how Europeans started using bound European laborers, but eventually turned to African slaves because they could be more totally dominated and compelled to work. This racial element seems to have played a significant role in the development of the slave trade.

Doc 3 is from FindAnyAnswer.com, and it reiterates some of the points already made. It emphasizes that the demand for labor in the New World, coupled with the decline of the indigenous population due to disease, led to the Atlantic slave trade.

It also mentions that the cultivation of sugar was central to the development of plantation societies on both sides of the Atlantic, which aligns with what I read in Doc 2.

Doc 4 is from Simple English Wikipedia, and it provides a concise overview of the Atlantic slave trade. It mentions that the slave trade was sometimes called the Maafa by African and African-American scholars, which means catastrophe in Swahili.

This doc also talks about the triangular trade, which I recall is a term used to describe the economic relationships between Europe, Africa, and the Americas during the era of slavery. It involved Europe sending manufactured goods to Africa, Africa providing slaves to the Americas, and the Americas sending raw materials back to Europe.

Doc 5 seems to be a homework assignment related to the impacts of the transatlantic slave trade, with questions based on an article about Benin's history of slavery. While it doesn't directly answer how the slave trade started, it does provide some context about the ongoing legacy of slavery in modern times.

From these documents, I can piece together that the transatlantic slave trade began in the 15th century, with Portugal taking the lead in exploring and establishing trade routes to Africa. They started bringing enslaved Africans back to Europe, and as European colonization of the Americas expanded, the demand for labor in these new colonies grew.

Given that the indigenous populations were being decimated by disease and forced labor, there was a need for a new source of labor. African slaves became the solution to this labor shortage, especially for the demanding work on plantations, particularly those cultivating sugar.

So, to sum it up, the transatlantic slave trade started in the 15th century with European exploration and colonization, initially involving the Portuguese kidnapping Africans for labor in Europe. As European colonies in the Americas required more labor, especially for plantation agriculture, the demand for African slaves increased, leading to the大规模的跨大西洋奴隶贸易。

**Final Answer**
