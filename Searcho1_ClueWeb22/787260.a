Alright, so I've got this question about nursing interventions to improve feeding and eating for a client. Now, I'm not a nurse, but I can try to think this through step by step, right? First off, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about helping clients eat better or maybe have a better experience while eating. Maybe some clients have trouble eating on their own or need assistance.

So, nursing interventions probably involve different strategies or actions that nurses can take to ensure that their patients are getting proper nutrition and that their feeding experiences are as positive and safe as possible. I guess it depends on the client's specific needs and conditions. For example, some clients might have difficulty swallowing, others might not feel like eating, and some might need help with holding utensils or bringing food to their mouth.

Let me see if I can categorize some of these interventions. Maybe start with assessing the client's needs. Before applying any intervention, it's important to know why the client is having trouble eating or feeding themselves. Is it due to a physical disability, a mental health issue, dementia, or something else? Each cause might require a different approach.

So, first step: assessment. Nurses need to evaluate the client's ability to eat independently, identify any barriers or challenges they face, and determine what kind of assistance is needed. This could involve observing the client during mealtime, talking to them about their preferences and difficulties, and reviewing their medical history.

Next, based on the assessment, nurses can develop a care plan tailored to the client's needs. This plan would outline specific interventions to address the identified problems. For instance, if a client has difficulty swallowing, measures to ensure safe swallowing and prevent aspiration might be necessary.

Some possible interventions could include:

1. **Assisting with feeding:** For clients who cannot feed themselves due to physical limitations, nurses may need to feed them, ensuring that they receive adequate nutrition and hydration.

2. **Modifying the environment:** Making sure the dining area is comfortable, free from distractions, and arranged in a way that facilitates eating. This might involve adjusting the lighting, reducing noise levels, or arranging furniture to make access easier.

3. **Adapting utensils and dishes:** Using specially designed utensils or plates that are easier for clients with motor impairments to use. For example, utensils with larger handles might be easier to grip, and plates with raised edges can help contain food.

4. **Nutritional support:** Working with dietitians to ensure that the client receives a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs. This might involve pureed foods, liquid supplements, or other forms of nutrition if oral intake is insufficient.

5. **Encouraging independence:** Helping clients maintain as much autonomy as possible in their eating habits, which can boost their confidence and overall well-being.

6. **Monitoring and documentation:** Keeping track of the client's eating patterns, any difficulties encountered, and the effectiveness of interventions. This information is crucial for making adjustments to the care plan as needed.

7. **Education and training:** Teaching clients or their caregivers techniques to improve feeding skills, such as proper positioning, pacing during meals, or exercises to strengthen oral muscles.

8. **Addressing psychological factors:** Sometimes, issues like depression or anxiety can affect a person's appetite or ability to eat. Nurses may need to address these underlying psychological issues to improve eating habits.

9. **Collaboration with interdisciplinary teams:** Working with speech therapists, occupational therapists, and other healthcare professionals to provide comprehensive care tailored to the client's needs.

I should probably look up some reputable sources to confirm these interventions and see if there are any specific protocols or best practices that nurses should follow. Maybe there are standardized assessment tools or intervention frameworks that are commonly used in nursing practice.

Let me consider doing a quick search to gather more information. Perhaps I can look for nursing textbooks, professional nursing organizations' guidelines, or research articles on this topic.

1 ATI Video Case Studies ADLs a. What nursing interventions can be used to improve feeding and eating for the client? Place the patient in high fowlers position to ease access to food and prevent aspiration and choking[ CITATION ATI201 \l 1033 ]. Evaluating the patient’s risk for aspiration. Provide oral hygiene to stimulate and ease swallowing food[ CITATION ATI201 \l 1033 ]. Determine what accommodations your patient may need, do they need help opening food packages or do they require further assistance such as cutting their food, or do they require full assistance and need the nurse to feed them[ CITATION ATI20 \l 1033 ].
Nursing interventions to improve feeding and eating according to Contributor, N. T. (2021),
The nurse can palpate the patient's throat while the patient is swallowing food and evaluate whether or not swallowing is impaired. The nurse can determine what would be the best choice of food according to the patient's medical condition and diet. This will allow in easier digestion and lower the risk of aspiration.
Assist the patient to sit in an upright position at a table in a dining room, in a chair by the bed or upright in bed if the patient cannot get up. This helps with swallowing and protects the airway (Dougherty and Lister, 2015). Eating in a dining room also makes the meal a social occasion.
Ask how the patient would like to receive the food; some may prefer a fork, others a spoon. It is important to let the patient feel in control of the mealtime.
If the patient use dentures ensure they are clean and offer assistance to insert them if necessary. Offer the patient a chance to clean their teeth and dentures or if this is not possible, perform mouth care.

b. Develop a list of risk factors for impaired nutrition that would be important considerations when completing a nutritional assessment. Poor dentition can cause an impaired ability to chew and thus cause malnutrition[ CITATION ATI20 \l 1033 ]. Cognitive disorders such Alzheimer’s disease or dementia can cause a patient to refuse to eat or only eat a small
selection of food which will create a nutritional deficit[ CITATION ATI20 \l 1033 ]. These same disorders may also make it difficult for these individuals to be able to feed their selves without aid, additionally they may have difficulty swallowing (Potter et al., 2017 pp1061). Thirst sensation is diminished in elderly making them less likely to consume the amount of hydration they require and putting them at risk for dehydration (Potter et al., 2017 pp1060). Medications can cause an alteration in appetite, taste, or nutrients that are absorbed so its important to consider what medications a patient takes and how that may affect their nutritional

2 status (Potter et al., 2017 pp1061). Additionally, weight loss, modified diet, food preferences, patient personal values regarding food, and presence of altered nutritional symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation all have an impact on risk of nutritional impairment (Potter et al., 2017 pp1061). c. Discuss client safety factors associated with nutrition, feeding, and eating and provide a rationale. A patient with dysphagia is at risk for aspiration so it is important to feed the patient slowly and allow them to take smaller bites and give them plenty of time for each bite (Potter et al., 2017 pp1073). Patients with dysphagia should avoid straws to allow them to swallow slowly[ CITATION ATI202 \l 1033 ]. Patients may need thickeners added to their liquids if they have dysphagia so that the liquids can be swallowed slowly.[ CITATION ATI202 \l 1033 ].

A nurse is caring for a client that exhibits signs and symptoms of aspiration during their enteral feeding. What is a priority intervention the nurse should carry out? Priority intervention is to immediately stop feeding and assess respiratory status
4. Stopping the feeding, turning the patient to the side for positioning, suctioning the airway, providing oxygen if indicated or needed, monitoring vital signs for temperature rises or rapid respiratory rate, monitoring for decreased oxygen saturation, auscultating breath sounds for increased congestion, notifying the provider, and obtaining a chest x-ray.
5. Following bronchoscopy, the nurse should be aware of the following post-procedure nursing interventions:
Assess bleeding episodes.
Assess respiratory status.
Monitor vital signs.
Position the patient.
Reinforce diet.
Prevent aspiration.
Provide anxiety relief and comfort methods.
4. Enteral feedings give nutrition directly into the gastrointestinal system via a tube. They're prescribed for a client who have a healthy GI system but can't get enough nourishment through their diet. The feeding tube may be left in place for a few days or for the rest of the patient's life.
The use of a gastrostomy (G) tube for feeding might result in pulmonary aspiration. Aspiration can be caused by a variety of factors, including a recent hemorrhagic stroke, a large gastric residual volume (GRV), large bolus feeding volumes, supine positioning, and esophageal sphincter disorders (such as an indwelling endotracheal or tracheostomy tube with dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter and a nasogastric or an enteral tube traversing both esophageal sphincters).
In patients receiving continuous tube feedings, check GRV every 4 hours (or according to protocol) to assist limit risk.
If you encounter tube feeding contents in the patient's mouth when performing dental care, you should suspect reflux, which raises the risk of aspiration. When feasible, keep the head of the bed elevated 30 degrees or higher to help prevent this condition.
Turn off tube feeding during patient transport or when laying the head of the bed flat for patient repositioning, especially if the patient has a high risk of aspiration. Be aware, however, that there is no clear evidence that halting tube feeding during repositioning lowers the risk of aspiration in individuals with high GRVs.
5.
Assess bleeding episodes. Observe the patient's sputum for any significant bleeding and report it. Explain that a small bit of blood streak is typical and expected for the first several hours following the surgery.
Assess respiratory status. Face crepitus, hypoxemia, bleeding, and chest tightness are all symptoms of bronchial spasm or bronchial perforation.
Monitor vital signs. Any changes in the patient's vital signs, as well as any di
Suggested Fundamentals Learning Activity: Enteral Feeding A nurse is providing preoperative teaching to a client. What information should be included in this education?
The nurse should explain the procedure, answer appropriate questions the client may have and provide emotional support. Provide written outcomes. Have client stop medications 72 hours prior. No alcohol, NSAIDs, tobacco or anticoagulants 5 days prior.
To give nursing workers providing the preoperative patient with standardized teaching content and to establish standards for documenting in the medical record.
During the preoperative appointment, inform outpatients that they should do or not :
Unless your doctor says otherwise, don't take aspirin or aspirin-containing products for two weeks before surgery.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be stopped 48 to 72 hours before surgery.
Bring a list of current drugs (or a container) with you.
If they are undergoing an outpatient treatment with sedation or general anesthesia, they should have an adult accompaniment who can drive.
Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that can be readily removed (eg, avoid clothing that pulls on and off over the head)
Discuss the type of anaesthetic that will be used (local or general). All patients undergoing general anesthesia will be evaluated by an anesthesiologist prior to surgery.
Instructions the patient to shower/bathe/shampoo the night before or the morning of the surgery. Men should shave their heads clean.
Instructions the patient about the restrictions on oral intake and the medication schedule as prescribed.
The Day of Surgery Lounge and other designated waiting locations should be informed to the patient's family.
Inform the patient of the location of his or her postoperative recuperation.
Educate Inform the patient about the postoperative care options.
In the medical record, note that regular preoperative training has been done and that the patient understands.

Suggested Fundamentals Learning Activity: Cardiovascular Assessment What principles of wound care should the nurse include when completing wound care for a client with sutures?  Protect wound from infection  Reduce the risk of infection (aseptic technique, hand hygiene)  Cover your wound so that stitches or staples do not catch on clothing  Protect the area as it heals  Wash your hands before touching the dressing.  Work on clean surface  Keep wound dry  While changing the dressing wear on the gloves, do not touch the wound after removing of dressing.  Always keep the wound clean and dry.
It is critical for the RN to cut the sutures as near to the skin as possible when removing them from a patient.
At the distal end of the knot, cut under it as close to the skin as possible. To determine whether or not the sutures should be removed, the health care provider must inspect the wound. During the suture removal process, the wound line must be checked for separations as it is cut close to the skin as possible. The primary health care provider must order the sutures to be removed . Prior to the procedure, a written order to remove sutures must be acquired, and a thorough examination of the wound site must be completed before the health care provider removes the sutures.

Abstract
Background: Dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, is a serious and life-threatening medical condition that affects a significant number of individuals with acute neurological impairment, largely from stroke. Dysphagia is not generally considered a major cause of mortality; however, the complications that result from this medical condition, namely, aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition, are among the most common causes of death in the older adults.
Methods: This is an update of an existing systematic review. The standard systematic review methods of the Joanna Briggs Institute were used. Methods were specified in advance in a published protocol. A wide range of databases were searched for quantitative research articles examining the effectiveness of nursing interventions to identify and manage dysphagia in adult patients with acute neurological dysfunction, published between 2008 and 2013.
Results: Four new studies were added in this update, for a total of 15 included studies. Strong evidence was found to show that nurse-initiated dysphagia screening is effective for reducing chest infections in patients with dysphagia (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45, 95% CI [0.33, 0.62], p < .00001). Nurse-initiated dysphagia screening by trained nurses may be effective for detection of dysphagia, and training nurses in dysphagia screening improves the number and accuracy of screens conducted. The presence of formal dysphagia guidelines in a health facility is likely to reduce inpatient deaths (OR = 0.60, 95% CI [0.43, 0.84], p = .003) and chest infections (OR = 0.68, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p = .008); however, it does not appear that formal guidelines have an effect on length of stay.
Conclusions: Nurse-initiated dysphagia screening for patients with acute neurological dysfunction is effective for a range of important patient outcomes. The presence of formal guidelines for the identification and management of dysphagia may have a significant effect on serious adverse outcomes such as chest infections and death. Training nurses to conduct dysphagia screening will improve patient outcomes.
