Alright, so I need to figure out how inflation affects the housing market. Inflation is basically when the general price level of goods and services rises, meaning each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Now, how does that relate to houses and the housing market?

First, maybe I should understand what the housing market consists of. It's where people buy and sell houses, right? So, there are sellers who want to sell their houses and buyers who want to buy them. There are also agents, builders, and financiers involved. Inflation might affect different parts of this market in different ways.

Let me think about prices. If inflation is happening, prices of most things are going up. So, probably, the prices of houses would also go up, because everything else is getting more expensive. But is it that simple?

Wait, I remember that inflation can affect interest rates. Central banks might raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which could affect people's ability to get mortgages for buying houses. So, that might slow down the housing market.

But on the other hand, if inflation is making house prices rise, people might rush to buy houses before they get even more expensive. That could boost demand and drive prices up further.

Also, construction costs might increase with inflation, because materials and labor become more expensive. That could lead to higher prices for new builds.

I should probably look into this more deeply. Maybe do some research to see what experts say about the relationship between inflation and the housing market.

By SF Gate Contributor Updated July 13, 2021
Housing prices tend to rise with inflation. Absent economic and supply-and-demand pressures, the price of goods remains the same. If the only change introduced to the economy is the addition of money, the price of goods will rise. Of course, the economy is dynamic — nothing ever stays the same. And there are a host of pressures starting and changing every day. But when the influence of other factors is small, more money moving around more quickly will increase the price of nearly everything, including housing prices.
Housing Is a Good Asset During Inflation
Housing is generally viewed as a good asset when it comes to inflation, in part because the home's value will rise with the inflation rate and in part because it is a leveraged asset. So with a good interest rate that doesn't change, the amount you pay for your home may not increase although the value of it might. When you buy real estate, you make a down payment of perhaps 20 to 30 percent of the house price.
The house price rises by the rate of inflation times the cost of the house, not by the cost of your down payment. So if inflation doubled the value of the house, it may have quadrupled the value of your down payment. If you took out a fixed-rate mortgage, you have done even better because you are making a payment that dropped in inflation-adjusted dollars. You are paying less for the loan than you did when you took it out.
Supply and Demand Comes Into Play
Supply and demand influence prices. Even if inflation is high, an oversupply of housing will bring home prices down. Interest rates and rental costs tend to go up with inflation. Business Insider explains that mortgage rates follow the same path as long-term bond yields. If mortgage rates go up too high, people won't take out home loans. Demand will decrease; home prices will fall.
Inflation Needs to End at Some Point
Continued and rampant inflation harms an economy on the large scale and on the personal scale, says Forbes. It has devastating effects on people with fixed incomes, notably seniors. It makes it difficult to compete on an international scale because the currency becomes so devalued. And so at some point, whether through the course of events borne through devaluation or aggressive action by monetary policy to reduce the currency supply, inflation ends. It cannot, and historically never has, gone on forever.
You Can't Predict Inflation
Because there are so many complex, dynamic, interactive factors influencing the economy, it isn't really possible to predict inflation. But harbingers include substantial influx of spending by the government within a short time frame and an increase in the introduction of money by the treasury. These are actions taken to counteract a contraction in spending in the private sector. Once the private sector recovers to a normal pattern of spending, one might expect the combination of all three actions to result in inflation.

With rising inflation and a hot housing market, here’s what you need to know about buying a home right now

Higher prices are almost everywhere.
Americans are paying more these days for products like food and gasoline, thanks to rising inflation.
Of course, this rising inflation will also impact the cost of buying a new home.
"With inflation rising so aggressively and the fact that people's salaries and weekly income are not rising at the same rate, we end up with less discretionary money to spend each month," said George Ratiu, manager of economic research at Realtor.com.
At the same time, home prices have also been rising. The consumer price index, which measures the cost of goods and services, shows that shelter rose 0.5% in October. It takes into account rent and owners' equivalent rent, which is what owners would pay to rent their home.
Separately, home prices were up 19.8% year-over-year in August, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indices.

So what does this all mean for home buyers?
For one, you may have to lower your budget, Ratiu said.
Not only will you have less money to spend every month, since you are paying higher prices elsewhere, mortgage rates are also climbing. Buyers of a median-priced home are spending $160 more on a monthly mortgage payment than a year ago, a Realtor.com analysis shows. Ratiu expects those rates to continue to climb.
"Generally as we see inflation go higher, we are going to see mortgage rates go higher," he said.
An inflation hedge
Real estate has historically been viewed as a hedge against inflation.
Home values traditionally at least keep up with inflation, and when you have a mortgage, you lock in a fixed monthly payment for the length of the loan.
"Homes are expensive now ... but for most people the comparison that is most important is how that cost of home ownership is going to compare to the cost of renting," Zillow senior economist Jeff Tucker said.

Rents for single-family homes skyrocket
Rent is more unpredictable than a mortgage and is more likely than not to go up, he said. He anticipates broader inflation will impact rent prices.
"If wages are rising or if the cost of building materials and appliances and light bulbs and paint is rising, all of these to some extent will flow into the cost of maintaining and building rental homes," Tucker said.
Supply and demand also has an impact on rental prices, which already rose 10.2% nationally in September year over year, according to CoreLogic.
Advice to homebuyers

Whether or not it is worth buying a home right now depends on your situation, Ratiu said.
For most people, owning a home is about having shelter, although historically it has been a good investment. That said, there have also been times when home values have declined, he pointed out.
Therefore, it's best to think about your budget and your time frame. If you plan to stay there for at least three years to five years, it makes sense, especially in light of favorable interest rates, Ratiu said.
To be sure, buyers have faced stiff competition and bidding wars since there are a limited number of houses on the market. Yet Realtor.com is predicting an easier time by next spring.
A Realtor survey this fall of 1,300 American homeowners found that 26% plan to sell their home in the next 12 months. That's more than double the findings in its March 2021 survey.
"I think 2022 has the promise of providing less competition, a lot more homes to choose from and, as a result, a lot more approachable prices," Ratiu said.

That said, there is some good news for those in the market right now. While there are fewer listings to choose from between now and the beginning of January, there are even fewer competing buyers, Tucker said.
"Historically, you are likely to get some of the best bargains of the year," he said.
Just don't talk yourself into a house that may not be right for you because it may be available at a good price.
"The house is the place where your family is going to live every day," Tucker said.

How inflation can increase house prices
How inflation can affect the housing market
Ned Browne 17 August 2021
Inflation is rising, and that could have a knock-on effect on the housing market —here's how
In June 2021, inflation rose to 2.5%, pushing even further above the government target of 2%. Most economists agree that inflation is likely to rise to at least 4%, but that’s where the agreement ends. Some economists think inflation will come and go as global supply chains recover post pandemic; whereas others think inflation may wreak economic havoc in the years to come.
How does inflation affect homeowners and aspiring homeowners?
The big question is this: what’s the impact of rising inflation on interest rates? If climbing inflation does turn out to be a short-term blip, it’s likely the Bank of England will keep interest rates low, not wanting to risk destabilising an already-fragile economy. However, if the inflation rise turns out to be more pernicious, it’s likely that interest rates will rise too. This will push up the cost of borrowing, which is likely to suppress the housing market.
For aspiring homeowners, rising interest could be both a blessing and a curse. It would make property prices look more affordable, but monthly mortgage payments would be higher.
Who determines interest rates?
The Bank of England, source: Wikimedia Commons
Each month, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) analyses a number of economic indicators such as economic growth, the rate of inflation and the level of unemployment and, based on these, decides the base rate. If the MPC thinks the economy is overheating, it will increase interest rates, and vice versa.
Lessons from history
It’s worth noting that, when the Bank of England lowered the base rate to a historic low of 0.5% on Thursday 5th March 2009, few would have predicted that it would still be below 1% more than a decade later. Fewer still would have predicted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
On 10 March 2020 the MPC slashed the base rate to 0.25%. Ten days later the MPC dropped the base rate again to 0.1%. Bear in mind that interest rates have never before been below 1% since the Bank of England was founded in 1694.
Act to protect yourself
Interest rates have remained low for a long time, but there is no guarantee they will continue to do so. If you are concerned about the impact of future rate rises you should get your mortgage fixed for as long as possible.
The mortgages available change on a daily basis and all borrowers should shop around for the best deal. Loyalty does not pay when it comes to mortgages. In fact, it rarely pays with any financial product.
Even if you have a repayment mortgage, you should also consider making additional over-payments every month. Almost all mortgages allow this, and you should not underestimate the value of compound interest. Here’s a hypothetical example: if you overpaid £1,000 a month on a mortgage that charged 4% interest you would pay £144,000 less in interest payments over a 25-year period.
Are there any benefits of rising inflation?
Definitely yes if you are a saver. But, oddly, there are benefits as a borrower too: inflation erodes the value of money, meaning mortgage debt reduces in real terms in line with inflation.
The known knowns
It’s impossible to predict with any certainty what will happen with inflation and interest rates. Yet we do know this: currently the base rate is just 0.1%, meaning it’s unlikely to get any lower.
So, as mentioned above, take advantage of this and secure a fixed rate mortgage. After all, being able to afford your monthly payments is what counts.

Fast-rising housing costs have helped cause the largest increase in inflation since 2008. But the way that government statisticians track the price of consumer goods may be missing just how explosive home-price growth really has been in recent months.
The cost of shelter rose by 0.5% between May and June, according to the latest edition of the monthly consumer price index released Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Compared with last year, however, shelter costs were up 2.6%.
Altogether, the rise in housing prices accounted for roughly a fifth of the overall increase in inflation in June, a reflection of how heavily government economists weight this spending category.
But much of that increase was actually driven by the rising cost of hotels and motel stays, which are factored into the overall shelter figure. Between May and June, the cost of a hotel room increased nearly 8%. Comparatively, housing costs for renters and homeowners rose 0.2% and 0.3% respectively, per the government’s inflation measure.
If those figures seem off based on your own experience of buying a home or signing a new lease as of late, it’s not a surprise. Not everyone agrees on the rate of house-price growth.
The latest edition of the consumer price index indicated housing prices have risen 2.6% over the past year, while other reports suggest home prices are up more than 13%.
Other data suggested a much faster pace of home price appreciation and rental growth, well in excess of that level.
The most recent report from the Case-Shiller Home Price Index for April showed that home prices were up 14.6% nationally, which marked the highest increase in the more than 30 years of S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data.
So how does the CPI calculate housing? First, housing units themselves are not included the CPI market basket.
Second, rental data to establish how prices are changing are collected every six months. The calculations for most other CPI items are collected monthly or bimonthly.
“Like most other economic series, the CPI views housing units as capital (or investment) goods and not as consumption items,” the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. “Spending to purchase and improve houses and other housing units is investment and not consumption.”
“The cost of shelter for renter-occupied housing is rent. For an owner-occupied unit, the cost of shelter is the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes,” the bureau adds.
The government pollsters ask homeowners: “If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?”
And they ask renters: “What is the rental charge to your [household] for this unit including any extra charges for garage and parking facilities? Do not include direct payments by local, state or federal agencies. What period of time does this cover?”
Housing isn’t like other goods
“The rate of house price appreciation is not akin to inflation,” said Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurance company First American Financial Services FAF.
For a start, housing is a very basic necessity. “Demand for shelter doesn’t go away — it just moves around,” Fleming said. In other words, if the price of airfares surges 2.7%, as it did over the past month, families could decide against going on that summer getaway.
That choice isn’t so simple when it comes to housing. As the cost of shelter increases it can have a “cascading effect on extremely low-income renters,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Some 9.2 million ‘extremely low-income’ renters are spending more than a third of their income on shelter-related expenses
— Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition
Research from Aurand’s organization has shown that more than 9.2 million “extremely low-income” renters are cost burdened by their housing, meaning they spent more than a third of their income on shelter-related expenses. Many of these households spend upwards of 50% on housing, leaving little money behind for other purchases.
The alternative for these households would be losing the roof over their heads. In recent years, that has become the reality for many Americans. A 2019 study released by the Trump administration estimated that more than 500,000 people sleep outdoors each night across the country, while many more couch surf or utilize shelters for unhoused people.
Meanwhile, for people who own their homes, buying a property isn’t the same as buying, say, a banana. Owning that banana won’t benefit you financially in the long-run, whereas with a house you can expect to see its value increase and to profit off that. But a home isn’t a pure investment asset like a stock — it’s a mix of both.
Home prices can rise both because the actual structure itself may be worth more — thanks to the rising cost of labor and lumber — but also because people see value in it as a capital investment.
Home prices can rise both because the actual structure itself may be worth more — thanks to the rising cost of labor and lumber — but also because people see value in it as a capital investment.
As a result, there can be a mismatch in the way economists or government statistician view rising home prices, and what that means to a consumer.
“In a market environment where prices are rising so quickly to buy a home the economist would say that’s the increase in the price of the capital good,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. “But to the buyer, it represents a higher cost of living.”
Why housing inflation is different
People experience inflation vis-à-vis housing differently to most other products, and that makes it a challenging to measure.
For the typical homeowner, their housing costs likely haven’t changed too much over the past year.
“If you have a fixed mortgage, on your home, year over year, how much does your cost of living in that home change? Not very much,” Fleming said. “The only things that change year over year are your escrows for taxes and insurance.”
Even with renters, the price of housing doesn’t shift higher or lower from month to month. That’s why the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects housing data more infrequently than most other items in the CPI basket of goods.
For renters and buyers, you encounter the changing cost when something about your living arrangement changed: When you move to a new home, sign a new lease or refinance your mortgage.
Americans need to know how much housing costs are rising or falling — not the least of which because residential real-estate makes up such a huge portion of the nation’s economy.
But Americans do need to know how much housing costs are rising or falling — not the least of which because residential real-estate makes up such a huge portion of the nation’s economy.
The government’s Consumer Price Index calculates the “imputed rent” — essentially the amount a homeowner is paying for their housing rather than paying a landlord.
If it did not do so, GDP would actually fall, Dietz said, “because money that would be a rental payment in the marketplace paid by a renter suddenly disappears.”
To bridge this challenge, the government relies on survey data to produce its estimates of housing costs for renters and homeowners. In renters’ cases, they are simply asked how much they pay for housing.
But owners aren’t asked what their mortgage payment is — after all, not everyone has a mortgage. Instead, that’s why they are asked to estimate how much they would be able to charge for rent to lease out their current home.
Government statisticians survey the same cohort of Americans periodically to produce their findings and track changes over time to estimate housing costs.
“Inflation and [changes in] housing prices have generally been matched up,” said Jonathan Needell, President and Chief Investment Officer of KIMC, a private real-estate investment company. He added that rising housing prices has “exceeded inflation in some circumstances.”
Some researchers have argued, however, that this approach can also understate and/or be slow to identify true inflation occurring in the housing market.
A new analysis from Fannie Mae FNMA, -12.86% showed that there is typically a lag between when home prices are actually rising, and when that price growth is reflected in inflation reports like the consumer price index.
The role played by COVID-19
The shifts in housing preferences and needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also complicated our ability to gauge the effect of inflation in the housing market.
Wealthier Americans, many of whom suddenly found themselves able to work remotely, chose to move away from major cities into larger and cheaper homes in the suburbs, often saving money in the process. As a result, rental rates declined in pricier neighborhoods.
But in more affordable areas, rents actually increased. Americans who lost their jobs because of the pandemic rushed to find cheaper housing, pushing rents higher for the least expensive apartments and homes in the suburbs.
Those effects are beginning to dissipate, but will continue to weigh on official measures like the consumer price index given the time lags that occur.
Americans who lost their jobs because of the pandemic rushed to find cheaper housing, pushing rents higher for the least expensive apartments and homes in the suburbs.
So is housing quickly becoming more expensive? The answer, economists agree, is yes. First American Financial Services has its own measure, the Real House Price Index, which compares nominal-price gains with Americans’ ability to afford to purchase a property based on the prevailing interest rates and household income.
For a period of time between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the Real House Price Index was falling, because Americans’ buying power was rising faster than home prices, Fleming said. That’s not the case anymore.
“Deflation has turned into inflation, not because interest rates have gone up — they’ve only gone up a little bit — but because house prices are just crazy,” Fleming said.
The reason home prices are rising so fast is fairly simple. After the Great Recession, home-building activity all but drew to a standstill as the construction industry worked to recover.
‘Deflation has turned into inflation, not because interest rates have gone up — they’ve only gone up a little bit — but because house prices are just crazy.’
— Mark Fleming, chief economist at First American Financial Services
As a result, the construction of new homes did not keep pace with population growth and the formation of new households.
That left the housing market with a serious shortage of homes, just as millennials have begun getting married and having kids — traditional hallmarks of home-buying interest.
With the pandemic, the shift to remote working and low interest rates have only exacerbated things.
The primary solution to address runaway inflation in housing will be to build more homes — something that’s easier said than done. “Some of the challenges that we face on the supply side of the residential construction industry are going to persist well into 2022,” Dietz said.
Those challenges run the gamut from the high cost of lumber to the lack of skilled workers to complete construction projects. Another factor: Zoning regulations across the country prevent the construction of more dense housing in many cities, effectively driving up home prices and rents in the process.
Finally, new-home construction alone won’t make matters easier for all Americans. Because of the high costs, it’s easier for builders to construct more expensive homes, even though the demand and competition is strongest for entry-level properties.
Over time, that increased concentration in the bottom-tier of the housing market is driving up prices for those who can least afford it.
“There’s this argument that if you just build more supply to meet the demand, it will eventually help extremely low and very low-income renters,” Aurand said. “But the market is not going to adequately serve mostly extremely low-income renters.”

Here’s how inflation could affect your next real estate move
Perspective by David Mount
January 4, 2022 at 7:03 p.m. EST
If you're buying and expect to keep the home for the long haul, you should expect the same value increases that existing owners are experiencing. If you are looking at a shorter investment time horizon — perhaps through flipping the property, for example — then we should caution “buyer beware.” (Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg)
Article
If you have bought, sold, invested or otherwise participated in the economy lately, you have likely seen the forces of inflation in action.
But in plain terms, what does inflation really mean, and how will it impact the already crowded housing market? Here are some considerations to help you understand whether you’re making the right moves to hedge against inflation:
What is inflation?
Inflation refers to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, reflected in an increase of the price of goods and services in the economy. So, as inflation ticks up, every dollar you earn loses value and therefore impacts your ability to spend.
More Mount: What to consider before investing in the real estate market
While the housing market was already seeing short supply and high demand before 2020, it is safe to say that the pandemic’s arrival exacerbated these trends. Many renters entered the housing market in search of a home of their own, while plenty of homeowners sought opportunities to trade up and increase their space. As this increasing demand took shape, we saw many existing homeowners staying put, therefore limiting the supply of available properties.
Advertisement
The resulting housing market inflation amounts to a basic case of supply and demand at work, adding fuel to an already raging fire.
How does inflation impact the market?
For homeowners:
For several reasons, inflation is actually a good development for property owners. The most obvious benefit is the fact that the value of your home rises with the inflation rate. With supply low and demand high, sellers can shoot for the moon with their asking prices, and in many cases, receive offers for or even above that asking price. This makes it a great time to sell, but a much more difficult time to buy.
For investors:
If you are invested in a property as a leveraged asset, especially with financing rates as low as they currently are, you will find yourself paying the same fixed rate even as your property’s value steadily rises. In this current inflationary market, we are not yet seeing financing rates rise alongside inflation, and as a result, your return on investment (ROI) can be expected to soar.
Advertisement
For prospective investors:
Not surprisingly, the circumstances for prospective investors in an inflationary market are very different from those for existing owners. With that reality in mind, the most important factor this group must consider is timing.
More Mount: Should you tap into your home equity to fund your retirement?
How long do you plan to own the prospective property? If you are in it for the long haul, you should expect the same value increases that existing owners are experiencing. If you are looking at a shorter investment time horizon — perhaps through flipping the property, for example — then we should caution “buyer beware.”
One of the dangers of short-term investing in an inflationary real estate market is the risk of getting caught in a real estate bubble. New home buyers should expect closing costs to run as high as 6 percent of the home price, and if you do not possess enough equity to absorb those costs, then you may find yourself at risk of losing money when the bubble bursts.
Advertisement
Housing prices have seen historic rises over such a short period of time. And while that may not be inherently concerning, it underscores the importance of understanding your expected investment time horizon and adjusting your plans accordingly.
So what’s next?
As we map out the market’s near- and long-term future, it is certainly understandable for the ghosts of 2008’s housing bubble to haunt buyers, sellers and investors alike. Yet while a market decline is difficult to predict, it’s worth noting that there isn’t much data suggesting one is imminent.
For starters, the current asset market is vastly different from what we saw in 2008, right before the Great Recession. Although labor is in short supply, the economy is growing, unemployment remains low and optimism remains high as reopening efforts continue and better opportunities emerge.

Alright, so I've read through these articles, and I'm trying to piece together how inflation affects the housing market. Let's see.

First, inflation is when the general price level of goods and services goes up, meaning each dollar buys less. In the context of housing, this could mean that houses become more expensive over time.

One article mentions that housing is seen as a good asset during inflation because the value of the house increases with inflation. Also, if you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your monthly payments stay the same even as the house's value rises, which effectively lowers the real cost of your payments over time.

But, inflation can also affect interest rates. If inflation is high, central banks might raise interest rates to control it. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which could deter potential homebuyers and slow down the housing market.

On the other hand, if inflation is making house prices rise, some people might rush to buy houses before they get even more expensive, which could boost demand and drive prices up further.

Construction costs might also increase with inflation, making new houses more expensive to build. This could reduce the supply of new homes, which might further drive up prices in the existing housing market.

I also noticed that inflation can affect rental prices. As the cost of living increases, landlords might raise rents to keep up with their own expenses. This could make renting less attractive, potentially driving more people to buy homes instead.

However, if wages don't keep up with inflation, people might have less disposable income to spend on housing, whether buying or renting. This could temper housing demand and prices.

One article talked about how the government's way of measuring inflation, through the Consumer Price Index (CPI), might not fully capture the rapid increase in home prices. They use a method called "owner's equivalent rent" to estimate the cost of housing, which might not reflect the actual market prices immediately. So, there could be a delay in recognizing how much housing prices are really increasing due to inflation.

Another point is that inflation can erode the real value of mortgage debt over time. If you have a fixed mortgage and inflation goes up, the money you're paying back is worth less in real terms, which benefits the borrower.

But for first-time buyers, rising house prices due to inflation might make it harder to enter the market, especially if their incomes aren't keeping up with price increases.

Also, inflation can affect the cost of materials and labor for home builders, increasing construction costs and potentially leading to higher prices for new homes.

Moreover, inflation can influence people's expectations about future price increases, which might accelerate buying decisions to avoid even higher prices later on.

But it's important to note that not all types of inflation affect the housing market in the same way. For example, if inflation is driven by increased demand in the housing market specifically, that's different from general inflation across the economy.

Additionally, government policies, like interest rate adjustments by the central bank, can mitigate or exacerbate the effects of inflation on the housing market.

In summary, inflation can have multiple effects on the housing market:

1. **House Prices:** Tend to rise with inflation, making housing more expensive.

2. **Mortgage Rates:** Central banks might raise interest rates to combat inflation, making borrowing more costly and potentially slowing down the housing market.

3. **Construction Costs:** Increase with inflation, making new homes more expensive to build.

4. **Rental Prices:** May increase as landlords pass on higher costs to tenants.

5. **Purchasing Power:** If incomes don't keep up with inflation, buyers may have less money to spend on housing.

6. **Debt Burden:** Fixed mortgage payments become less burdensome over time as inflation reduces the real value of the debt.

7. **Market Dynamics:** Can lead to increased competition among buyers, driving up prices further.

It's a complex interplay of these factors, and the net effect can vary depending on the specific economic conditions and policies in place.

I think that covers the main points. If I had to summarize in a box, I'd say:

\boxed{\text{Inflation generally leads to higher house prices and construction costs, but can also increase interest rates, affecting affordability and market dynamics.}}

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Inflation generally leads to higher house prices and construction costs, but can also increase interest rates, affecting affordability and market dynamics.}} \]
