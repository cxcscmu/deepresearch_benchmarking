So I have this question: "Can the Pope change Church doctrine?" Hmm, interesting. I'm not entirely sure about this, but I think it has something to do with the authority of the Pope in the Catholic Church. I know that the Pope is considered the leader of the Catholic Church, but I'm not clear on exactly what that means in terms of changing doctrines.

First, I should probably understand what Church doctrine is. Doctrine, I believe, are the beliefs and teachings that the Church holds to be true and important for its members to follow. These are like the core principles of the faith. So, if someone asks whether the Pope can change these core beliefs, that seems like a big deal.

I recall that the Catholic Church believes in the infallibility of the Pope under certain conditions. I think it's called papal infallibility. From what I remember, papal infallibility means that when the Pope speaks ex cathedra— which I think means "from the chair" in Latin, referring to his authority as the bishop of Rome—on matters of faith and morals, his teachings are free from error because they are guided by the Holy Spirit.

But I'm not sure how this relates to changing doctrine. Maybe if the Pope is infallible in certain situations, does that mean he can define or change doctrines without error? Or is there more to it than that?

I should probably look into what papal infallibility actually entails. Maybe do some research to get a clearer picture. Let me try searching for "papal infallibility" and see what comes up.

Infallibility: What does it mean?
The word itself means exactly what the dictionary tells us, “incapability of error or deception.”  Interestingly enough, no person on the face of the earth, except the Vicar of Christ, would dare insist on such a prerogative of office, and get away with it. Non-Catholics are constrained by force of truth to reverence the man who claims to speak for Jesus Christ on earth, whether they accept his authority or not. No matter how great a leader, in his own realm, the head of any false religion might be, he would be laughed to scorn if he ever had the audacity to claim that his solemn words were guaranteed protection from error by God Himself. The head of the Roman Catholic Church maintains such; and he is not laughed to scorn, though he is hated by many; rather, he is treated quite seriously wherever he goes.  And no matter how proud certain heads of state might be, they suddenly become a little less sure of themselves when awaiting a papal audience in the Vatican. The atmosphere of authority, a divine atmosphere, is overwhelming, as many non-Catholics have testified.
In its most strict application, the attribute of infallibility is possessed supereminently, and essentially, in no one but God, Who is Absolute Truth.  By way of a gift, or a sharing, this divine prerogative has been granted by the Author of creation to an office, occupied (the Papacy), and to a Book, inspired (the Bible).  Philosophically speaking, everything that exists must he essentially true, infallibly declaring its essence (that is, what it is) by its very existence. A rock is infallibly a rock; it is not a fish. A piece of plastic that looks like a rock is infallibly a piece of plastic that looks like a rock; it can be nothing else. Sounds silly, hut the fact of this communication of truth from the Creator to His creature, that what God has made must manifest truly what it is, is a sharing by creation in the Absolute Veracity of God.
With the Sacred Scriptures, which are the very thoughts of God, the contents are more than infallible; they are divinely inspired. In other words, the thoughts conveyed by the holy writers are God’s thoughts, clothed in a man’s literary style. Infallibility however, as it is applied to the Pope, and to the Catholic Church which is in union with him, is not the same thing as inspiration. It is a protection, a safeguard, from error, which is clearly something different than inspiration. We might think of inspiration (that is, the kind intended for the edification and/or instruction of others) as an impulse from heaven to communicate verbally a particular message from Creator to creature.  Inspiration and infallibility are the same only in that they are gifts from God that He uses to reveal Himself, and His will, to men.
The devil is quite aware of how desperate man is for communication from the eternal world beyond.  Hence, in his attempts to obfuscate the true revelation, he hoists up counterfeit sources of revelation, lying pretensions, such as the Talmud of the Jews, the Koran of the Moslems, the Vishna books of the Hindus and, most recently, the Book of Mormon of the Latter Day Saints. The prince of darkness knows that the true revelation alone can save and, since he is the “ape of God”, he continuously devises other “infallible” authorities (always dead authorities who cannot speak, but must be read), by which to deceive those who find it convenient to be deceived.
Infallibility: The Dogma
Before proceeding any further, let us read the definition of papal infallibility as it was promulgated at the First Vatican Council in 1870:
Faithfully adhering to the tradition received from the beginning of the Christian faith … we teach and define that it is a dogma divinely revealed that the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra, that is when in discharge of the office of pastor and teacher of all Christians, by virture of his supreme Apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine regardging faith and morals to be held by the universal Church, by the divine assistance promised him in Blessed Peter, is possessed of that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer willed that His Church should be endowed for degining doctrine regarding faith and morals; and that, therefore, such definitions of the Roman Pontiffs are irreformable of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church.
How foolish are those blind heretics whose “humble righteousness” is offended by such uncompromising insistence on the God-given authority supremely vested in the successor of Saint Peter!  Are they so blind as to pretend not to see that this truth cannot but be so, if indeed the Savior of men did establish one Church for the salvation of the world? Is it not obvious that this dogma must be concomitant with our faith in the Divinity of Our Redeemer?  Need we point out to the ”separated” Christians the clarity of the Godpels on this point, and its perfect reasonableness in the face of the comforting promise of Christ Himself that the Spirit of Truth woud remain with His Church always?  How then, could one put one’s unhesitating faith in an instutition, to which we are bound in obedience, if such an institution were merely human, and therefore subject to the fancies of times and seasons?  Witness the outcome of Popeless Christianity!  All the thousands (who can guess the number!) of non-Catholic denominations are constrained by force of  history to refer to themselves by the generic title of Protestant, as well as the specific appellation of the names of their founders.  And what is it that all seperated Christians share in common — indeed, the only thing they share in common?  They will not have the Pope!  In their refusal to submit to the secure teaching authority of the one man designated as supreme shepherd by Christ Himself, they have actually conferred such awesome authority upon themselves — individually!
Infallibility: Foundation of Divine Authority
The Vicar of Christ must remain true to his call, in the person of Saint Peter, he has been commissioned by the Son of God to ”confirm thy brethren.”  (Luke 22:32)  And, bearing such an onerous responsibility, must he not imitate Jesus the Master, and speak, as He did, “with authority”?  Now how could Saint Peter and the other apostles “teach all nations,” as they are commanded to do by Christ, unless the God Who sent them preserved their doctrine pure? Indeed their message demanded the assent of faith from those who heard them teach — if the instructed wished to save their souls.  And how, too, could our Incarnate God give such power to men, as to commit heaven itself to ratify their decisions, were not such decisions guaranteed the guidance of the Holy Ghost?  “Amen I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind upon earth, it shall be bound in heaven …” (Matt. 18:18)
Moreover, Christ commands the faithful of all time to obey the Church, and its supreme shepherd, as He commanded His disciples to obey the high priest who sat in the chair of Moses.  And, in the Old Testament, when the high priest spoke from the Chair of Moses, arming himself with the ephod of authorty over the people of God, he too was infallible, and had to be obeyed. Now the Chair of Moses protected a revelation that was but a shadow of greater things to come. If, therefore, the figure enjoyed the gift of infallibility, how much more so the fulfillment, the Chair of Peter, which was established by the Son of God Himself. Whereas, before, God had commanded His people to “hear” Moses, or the prophets, or the high-priest, now, by the very voice of the Messiah, all men to the end of time are commanded to ”hear the Church”, for “he that heareth not the Church” is to be treated as a “publican or a heathen.”
It is crystal clear, as we can see in the history recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, that there did exist in the Apostolic age a visible authority to which the early Christians were to go in order to resolve doctrinal and moral uncertainties. And when that authority was resisted, or deceived — as in the case of Ananias and Saphira (Acts 5) — drastic chastisements fell from heaven.
It is beyond the scope of this article, however, to prove what is so clear from Scripture, namely, that there was a supreme authority in the infant Church, and it was the person of Peter or his successors.
Infallibility: Possessed by all the Apostles
The doctors and the fathers of the Church teach that not only was Saint Peter blessed with the gift of infallibility, but so were all the twelve apostles, and Saint Paul.  However, they also clearly teach that only in the successors of Saint Peter was this special grace to be perpetuated.  And for good reason.  Had the successors of each of the apostles received this gift which the founders of their Churches possessed, we would have not one Catholic Church, under one supreme shepherd, but twelve Churches, under as many supreme shepherds.
It was more than fitting, indeed it was necessary, that all of the apostles should he granted immunity from doctrinal error.  The salvation of all the nations to which they were sent depended on it.  For if there is no salvation in any other name, as Saints Peter and John preached in Jerusalen (Acts 4:12), then the true doctrine of Jesus Christ must be known before an act of faith can he made.  And Saint Paul assures us, as he himself had been taught by Christ, that “without faith it is impossible to please God.”  (Hebrews 11:6) Even still, infallibility was explicitly promised by the Savior to His apostles when he said, “he that heareth you, heareth me.” (Luke 10:16)
Infallible authority is so essential to the true Christian Church that without it there would be no visible divine Church at all. For if Our Lord has left His Church in the hands of men, which is a fact uncontested by Catholics and most Protestants, then He also has to commit himself to safeguarding dogmatic accuracy.  Otherwise faith would be a mere human thing and would have nothing to do with the grace of God.  For if the act of faith is more God’s act in us than our own, then our faith is true, for God cannot by grace initiate a meritorious act based upon a lie.  But “faith cometh by hearing.”  Therefore a visible authority teaching in God’s Name must always be present in the world until the end of time, if we are to have the opportunity of making a divine act of faith.
How is this Note of Infallibility excercised?
This grace given to the Vicar of Christ on earth does not guarantee that every time the Pope speaks on a matter of faith or morals he is engaginig infallibility. If such were the case, then there would be no need for distinguishing ex cathedra pronouncements from ordinary locutions, or the solemn from the ordinary magisterium. The following four criteria must be present in order for a papal teaching to be considered ex cathedra , that is, infallible.
The Pope must teach as supreme doctor (teacher) of the whole world. For, as Christ’s Vicar, he has the entire human race for his flock. He it is who, most eminently, must teach ”all nations.”  As supreme lawgiver, however, he can only bind the baptized. He does not legislate for non-Christians. Therefore, all separated Christians are required to obey the disciplinary, as well as the doctrinal, teaching of the Church in order to be saved. The grace of their baptism is working on them to accept the papal authority. The successor of Saint Peter is not infallible when he speaks merely as a private theologian, a simple priest, the Bishop of Rome, the Archbishop of the Roman province, the Primate of Italy, or the Patriarch of the West, all of which offices he holds.
The Pope must be defining a doctrine of faith or morals. No other subject matter pertains to our salvation. Note too, that infallibility is engaged only on such positive acts, not on any lack of action. The Supreme Pontiff can be infallible when he teaches with words not when he teaches by silence. Indeed, in the latter case, silence can be a grave scandal. Therefore, as we said before, infallibility is a different thing than inspiration. It is the guarantee of God’s protection from teaching error. Inspiration is a direct moving grace from God, not sanctifying the recipient, but enlightening him by a private revelation, or by infused knowledge, to communicate a divine message to men.
The Pope must make his intention known by clear words that he is defining a doctrine contained in the deposit of faith, and binding upon the consciences of men. Such ex cathedra introductions as “We declare,” “We define,” or “We pronounce,” are customarily prefixed to the actual definition.
The deposit of faith (depositum fidei) is that body of revelation, containing truths to be believed (faith) and principles of conduct (morals), which was given by Our Savior to His Apostles, to be preserved by them and their successors, with the guarantee of the guidance and protection of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth, in the visible Church for all times and to the end of time.
The Pope must attach the sanction of anathema to the decree, either explicitly or implicitly. In other words, since obedience to superiors is necessary for salvation, the anathema means that the representative of Christ on earth intends to avail himself of the full height of his God-given authority and command our intellectual assent.
Interestingly enough, the Pope is greater in believing what he has defined than in defining. For the grace of infallibility does not, when engaged, make the Pope any holier. It is a grace freely given by God (gratia gratis data), such as is prophecy, tongues. or healing, and it is meant primarily for the edification of the faithful and, secondarily, for non-believers. Infallibility is a gift that is directed at strengthening the virtue of Faith in others; and naturally, that will redound upon the Faith of the Pope himself. As supreme teacher, the Pope is the highest pinnacle in the hierarchy of the Church teaching (ecclesia docens), which extends all the way, from an infallible definition, down to a mother teaching her child catechism. All of the faithfull share the responsibility of ecclesia docens. In believing what has been defined, or what has been transmitted universally down through the centuries (depositum fidei), we, all the children of the Church, are the Church learning (ecclesia docens). As believers we are greater than teachers. Just as a priest is greater in receiving Holy Communion than in distibuting It. For in the reception of the sacraments we are made holier. We receive an increase of sanctifying grace, which is a gratia gratum faciens, that is, a grace making one pleasing (to God). We might also mention here that for a Pope to engage the grace of infallibility, it is not a prerequisite that he be in a state of grace. This is strictly theologically speaking. There is no guarantee from Christ either that His Vicar can never lose the faith himself, or that he will be immune from sin. Infallibility is not the same as impecability. Only Our Lord, as God, was impeccable, that is, incapable of sinning. Our Lady was not impeccable; but she was immaculate.  She could have sinned (but not by way of concupiscence for she was free of that), but she didn’t. She alone, of all the children of men, was free of all sin, original as well as personal.
Infallibility: Its Purpose
This great gift of Our Lord to his Church, and to His Vicar, is for our salvation. For if we must believe in order to be saved, then the Light of our salvation must provide for us a beacon to guide us along the right road to heaven. Now the order of the Church’s infallibility and the Pope’s is this: The Church must be infallible when she echoes unsullied, the teaching she has received in the sacred deposit from Apostolic times. Therefore, her infallibility is not distinct from that of the Pope, but is essentially derived from her union with him — the Bishop of Rome. However, only the Vicar of Christ is personally guaranteed immunity from error when defining a dogma. The Bishops of the Church have no such guarantee, except when they profess the truths found in the sacred deposit. Neither does an ecumenical council have such immunity from error, except when the Pope approves, with his supreme authority, decrees on faith or morals that the collective episcopate has decided open. And, in such a case, the Pope must make it clear that these decrees he has approved are binding upon the consciences of men. The decrees of Vatican II were never stamped with the note of infallibility, Pope Paul VI having personally requested that this council not he considered doctrinal, but only pastoral.
Although the Holy Ghost is continually flooding the Vicar of Christ with special graces, such graces (which are lights enlightening, not only grace sanctifying) are not irresistible. The Pope is a mortal man and is, therefore, free to accept or reject grace. This is why we must pray for the Pope. For if his cooperation with grace were guaranteed, we would need not pray for him at all, for he would always do what is right and good. This is manifestly not the case. Christ Himself, as Head of the Mystical Body, prayed for Peter that his “faith would fail not.” However, when the Pope ascends the Apostolic Chair to teach all men, or to legislate the morals of Christians, the grace then given to him is irresistible. And how could it be otherwise? Is the promise of Christ in vain when he assures us in the Gospel, “But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things …” (John 14; 26) — that is, all things necessary for salvation, which is everything. And again, “I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you forever. The Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive … he shall abide with you … ,” for, “I shall not leave you orphans.” (John 14:16-18)
Infallibility: On Morals
Then too, in order to be saved. we must keep the commandments of God and of the Church. For it is not enough merely to believe that we might be saved, we must also love. ”If you love me keep my commandments,” Christ said. (John 14:15) Therefore, the Church, through its visible head, must also teach us how to live. On this point of moral authority, the true Church of Christ has always insisted on a most elevated code of ethics: the indissolubility of marriage, purity of morals, justice and charity, forbidding, as Christ himself did forbid, even evil thoughts. The moral teaching of the Church is not strictly a part of revelation, since man ought to know by the law of his conscience how to live righteously. But because of our fallen nature the voice of conscience easily becomes dulled, and eventually it can become perverted. Therefore, the Savior of men did dwell, in many of His sermons, on how His disciples were to conduct themselves in their land of exile. Due to the crystal clarity of the Scriptures in the Old, and more especially in the New Testament, the Popes who have governed the Church for these two thousand years have seldom found it necessary to place anathemas on teachings contrary to Christian morality, for there were not many men so bold and audacious as to challenge the traditions on these points. But when there were enough who did not refrain from so doing (and they are legion today), the papal authority had to stamp out the contagion. Thus we have the decrees of Pope Innocent XI (March 4, 1679) which condemned from the Chair of Peter perverse moral practices, including the murdering of infants in the womb during any stage of pregnancy. Humanae Vitae, the encyclical of Pope Paul VI, though lacking anathemas, was unquestionably infallible teaching, for it reechoed the traditional position of the true religion on that subject, which always held that birth control was morally evil.
In summary: Papal infallibility conveys to us the very means of salvation — that is a knowledge of what we are to believe by faith, and how we are to live in obedience and charity. The Vicar of Christ, therefore, is the supreme lawgiver on earth, for his decrees are conducive not merely temporal peace, but to eternal life. And no man need answer to His Maker on the Day of Judgment for having erred in any other fields but those of faith and morals.
Arguments against Infallibility as presented at Vatican I
Those within the Church who opposed the teaching concerning papal infallibility presented their case, before the dogma was defined, at the sessions of the First Vatican Council (1869-1870). After great scrutiny of the Church’s history, they were able to come up with only a few questionable cases which, they thought, contradicted the belief. We are skipping over the arguments of Protestants who oppose not only infallibility, but papal supremacy as well. Their objections are easily refuted, but we will save that refutation for another essay we plan to publish, addressed specifically to Protestants and schismatics.
The first difficult case put forth at the Council by opponents of infatlibility was that of Pope Liberius (352- 366), who, at one point, appeared to oppose the effort of Saint Athanasius in combating the semi-Arians. The heresy, you will recall, taught that the Son of God is like the Father, but not equal to Him. The problematic point was that Liberius, as Pope, had signed the creed of the local Synod of Sirmium, which creed purposely had avoided identifying the Son of God as “consubstantial” with the Eternal Father. This consubstantiality (identity of nature, or substance, or whatess) of the Father and the Son had been infallibly defined for all time at the first Ecumenical Council, Nicaca I, in 325. Liberals at the time of Liberius were pretending that, since the Bishop of Rome had signed the evasive symbol of Sirmium, Saint Athanasius (who had previously condemned this very Syood for its calculated omission) was wrong. The facts of the case, however, were different from the appearances:
The Pope had signed the Creed under duress, even threats, as Saint Athanasius later discovered and publicized. Liberius had actually been seized as a prisoner by the Arian prefect Leontius, precisely because he had refused to repudiate the faith declared at Nicaea.
The formula of Sirmiurn was not heretical in itself. It was insufficient. It was scandalous because of its deliberate omission of the word consubstantial.
Pope Liberius, in order to safeguard the Faith as professed at Nicaea, had actually subjoined an addendum to the Creed of Sirmium to which he affirmed his faith in the consubstantiality of the Persons of the Holy Trinity. The German historian Hefele, who, interestingly enough, was one of the leading theologians opposed to the definition of infallibility at the First Vatican Council, recorded in his History of the Councils that Liberius had indeed added this saving declaration.
The next case put forth to oppose the dogma was that of Pope Honorius (625-638), who was condemned for negligence by the sixth Ecumenical Council in 681. His condemnation was not for teaching heresy, but for failure in extinguishing a heresy. As the Fathers of that Council explained, Honorius “failed to illuminate the world with the apostolic doctrine.” The heresy that this Pope was negligent in combating was that of Monothelitism, which was a compromise of the more overt error of the Monophysites, who maintained that there was no human nature in Christ, but only the divine. The Monothelites proposed the less blatant, but equally dangerous, opinion that there was indeed a human nature in Christ, but an incomplete one, because, they argued, Christ did not have a human will (mono-one, thelema-will). The heresy was propagated by the Patriarch Sergius, of Constantinople. In two letters written by the Pope to this heresiarch it is clearly evident that Honorius did not understand the heresy latent in Sergius’ doctrine, but instead credited the turmoil it caused to a mere quibbling over words — semantics — hardly worth upsetting the peace and unity of the Catholic empire. Consequently the error was allowed to flourish. Historians point out that in the letters to Sergius the Pope made it emphatically clear that he was not defining any dogma in the correspondence.
Which brings us to another point worth interjecting here: The Pope is not restricted to pronouncing definitions only during ecumenical councils. He can define a dogma at any time he chooses — in a bull, in an encyclical, in a constitution, a brief, or a simple letter, so long as he states his intention of defining a dogma, and he meets all the other aforesaid requirements.
Another case that appeared to present a difficulty was the unorthodox teaching of Pope John XXII (1316- 1334). This Pope was one of the French Popes who ruled the Church from France during the Avignon exile (1309-1377). The second Sovereign Pontiff to reign from the palace on the River Seine, instead of on the Tiber, John XXII promoted an error concerning the state of consciousness of the departed souls. Once, on All Saints Day, he preached a sermon from the Avignon cathedral, in which he stated that the blessed departed would not enjoy the full sight of God until after the General Judgment and the Resurrection of their bodies. Although several of the Church Fathers had flirted with this theory, the vast testimony of the Church’s tradition was against it. It took some time before this Pope decided to change his opinion. In fact, he went so far as to imprison a Dominican friar who labeled the teaching heresy. In his recantation John XXII affirmed that, in promoting this error, he was speaking only as a private theologian, in an area which he wrongly had considered open to opinion.
Finally, we will mention the controversial cases of Popes Paul V (1605-1621) and Urban VIII (1623-1644), who both condemned the teaching of Galileo. This objection is very easily refuted. In the decrees imposed against the scientist’s theories, there was never manifested any intention of defining a dogma. The controversial decree of 1616 involved the Index, wherein there was a prohibition of books that promoted the Copernican theory. The Pope was certainly not using his infallibilily to teach science. The controversy surrounding the Galileo episode (which has afflicted our time more than Galileo’s — someone dubbed it the Galileo complex) will be explained in a future Center publication. For now, it is enough to know that the issue involved discipline, strictly speaking, not doctrine. The Index of Pope Paul V prescribed only what one must do, not what me must believe. Even if the reasons behind the prohibition of certain books were doctrinal, the reasons never formed part of the decrees themselves. Furthermore, the decrees were clearly non-definitional in nature.
In forbidding Christians to read the works of Galileo, the Pope was not requiring his flock to act against reason, hut rather he was defending faith. For the proud scientist had challenged the inspiration of the Scriptures themselves (a common enough practice among heretical theologians of our day), and had flatly stated that Josue could not have stopped the movement of the sun. This was, in effect, saying that the Bible was not an absolute, but must be judged by science. In 1651, the Jesuit theologian Riccioli, in one of his scholarly expositions, summarized the Seventeenth Century perplexity thus, “As in this matter there has been no definition by the Sovereign Pontiff, nor by a Council directed or approved by him, it is by no means of faith that the sun moves and that the earth is immovable, at least in virtue of the decree.”
Finally, we must stress that, in these cases cited, and in all other controversial cases involving papal infallibility that have arisen in the course of Church history, in not one instance in which the Pope has heen wrong, has the Supreme Pontiff ever engaged the power of the keys by way of binding the consciences of the faithful.
Even if the Pope were wrong in the case of Galileo (and who can tell for sure, since the entire universe is in revolving motion, and all motion is relative to some other point — and Scripture makes that point earth),  matters of discipline require obedience, not faith. Indeed, Popes Paul and Urban did engage the power of the keys in a matter not involving infallibility, and all Christians were bound to obey their prescriptions. Otherwise there would be an exception to the law of Christ, “Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth is bound in heaven,” and such divine precepts can admit of no contradiction. Therefore, it is more than clear that these Popes were riot exacting faith in a teaching that contradicted proven evidence of science. It is not as if the Pope were commanding Christians to believe that the moon is made of cheese, or some such absurdity. These Popes were using their God-given authority to safeguard the literal meaning of the Scriptures, and to condemn any book that thought that God could not do what He inspired the sacred writers to describe as having been done.
Disciplinary laws of the Church are, therefore, morally binding, but not absolutely so. They are not propositions dealing with truth or falsehood, right or wrong. They are commands — do this or do that. Consequently, they cannot be absolute, since there could arise occasions when it would be impossible, or even detrimenral to faith, to obey a given command, even from a Pope.
Let us explain
Take the Church’s canons, which are its official laws of government, bringing (in normal circumstances) the needed order to the visible Kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth. What if such laws of discipline were used to weaken, or what is worse, destroy, faith or morals? Ought they not be resisted? Of course, that is common sense. Canon law is not infallible, precisely because it presents norms of action, not belief. When the Church commands us to attend Mass on the Lord’s day, would one call such a command infallible? Of course not! One cannot reply true or false to a command. But, if I say that Our Lady was immaculately conceived, I state a proposition that is either true or false. And when defined by the Pope it becomes infallible. Laws are not definitions, nor could they be; they do not explain what we are to believe, but what we are to do.
Now this is a crucial point: All law, especially ecclesiastical law, must serve the Truth and moral teaching of the Church. A command cannot be obeyed which would offend truth or right conduct, even if the law cited in the command is ecclesiastical.  Saint Robert Bellarmine put it this way:
Although it clearly follows from the circumstances that the Pope can err at times and command things which must not be done, that we are not to be simply obedient to him in all things, that does not show that he must not be obeyed by all when his commands are good. To know in what cases he is to be obeyed and in what not … it is said in the Acts of the Apostles. “One ought to obey God rather than man:” therefore, were the Pope to command anything against Holy Scripture, or the articles of faith, or the truths of the Sacraments, or the commands of natural or divine law, he ought not to be obeyed, but in such commands, to be passed over (despiciendus).   [as quoted in Turrencremata’s Summa de Eccles.]
And, again, he repeated the same in another work
It is lawful to resist him (the Pope) if he assaulted souls, or troubled the state, and much more if he strove to destroy the Church. It is lawful, I say, to resist him by not doing what he commands and hindering the execution of his will.  [Cardinal Saint Robert Bellarmine (de Rom. Pont.)]
One unfortunate effect of the dogma on infallibility is to give the impression that the Pope should be obeyed with docility only when speaking ex cathedra. Somewhat wary of this opening for abuse, Pope Pius IX, who later defined infallibility, issued a very strong, though not infallible, Letter, Tuas Libenter, in 1863, to the Archbishop of Munich, wherein he stressed the necessity of submission of conscience to even the ordiniary (non-ex cathedra) teaching authority of the Bishop of Rome and his Curial Congregatioins. In this Letter Pius IX was careful to include the essential distinction that such ordinary teaching must obviously be “divinely revealed” and in “common and constant agreement” with the teaching of Catholic theologians over the past centuries.
In other words, there is no human tribunal to judge the Holy See but the Holy See. So, if a Pope, in his ordinary teaching, contradicts the “revealed” doctrines of the past, either as manifested in solemn decrees of past Popes or Councils, or as manifested clearly in Scripture, or as upheld constantly by tradition, the error must be brought to his attention. If he persists in teaching a novelty, he must be resisted and his heresy exposed. But we cannot depose him or judge him to be ipso facto deposed. We can only resist, pray, and patiently await a Divine intervention, or the Pope’s conversion.
In such a situation, (and we have it today), confusion is sure to arise among the faithful. But we must, nevertheless, confidently believe that God will not leave us “orphans,” and that He will provide, for men of good will, indications that will warn them against being led into error. For, although we are not individually inspired as to what we are to believe or reject, we do have the grace of our baptism, one effect of which is to smell the smoke of heresy by the infused virtue of Faith working within us.  God permits the devil to go only so far in disseminating his mischief. As, at the time of Moses, the magicians of Pharaoh did indeed perform preternatural prodigies, but the wonders performed by the great Patriarch and lawgiver were greater, destroying the artifices of Satan in the land of Egypt.
Infallibility: Testimony from the universal Church in post-apostolic times
The Bishop of Rome has always and everywhere been accepted as the final arbiter of the faith of Christians. The exceptions here do indeed prove the rule. For up until the Greek schism (9th Century), there was no mass opposition to this tradition. Every one of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church during the past two thousands years of history, both in the East and the West, testified to the supreme doctrinal authority of the Roman bishop. The first eight ecumenical councils, which were all held in the East, first received the approval of the Pope before their convocation, and, upon their conclusion, they all awaited his final determination of orthodoxy before their decrees could become binding upon the universal Church they represented.
The Fourth Council of Constantinople (869) taught that, “in the Apostolic See the Catholic religion has ever been preserved free from stain.”
The Third Council of Constantinople (680) declared that “Peter’s Apostolic Church has never departed from the way of truth into any error whatsoever.”
The bishops of the Council of Chaleedon (151), not far from Constantinople, responded to the reading of Pope Leo’s dogmatic Letter to his representative, Bishop Elavian, with the unanimous outburst of faith, “Peter hath spoken through the mouth of Leo.”
The Council of Ephesus (431) called Pope Celestine (422-432), “the guardian of the faith,” who teaches right doctrine, because he is the successor of Blessed Peter the Apostle, the head of the whole faith, and the head of the Apostles.”
Rome: By divine right a solitary claim
Nor has any other apostolic see ever claimed primacy of honor and jurisdiction except that of Rome. Now how could this be if Rome were not in fact always considered by the universal Church to be supreme authority? How could a Pope as early as Saint Clement (died in the year 100), who was a disciple of Saint Peter, have taken such authority upon himself as to write, as he did in the year 96, these words to the Church of Corinth; “If any man should be disobedient unto the words spoken by God through us, let them understand that they will entangle themselves in no slight transgression and danger.” Moreover, he commands them to “render obedience unto the things written by us through the Holy Spirit.” Was not Bishop Clement taking for granted that the Corinthians, who were Greeks, would accept his juridical authority? (The particular Letter cited involved this Eastern Church’s reception, back to their offices, of certain bishops who bad been unjustly deposed by a rebellious faction.)
The case of Pope Clement’s famous Epistle to the Corinthians is the earliest extant document (other than the New Testament itself) proving papal supremacy. From the beginning of the second century on such documents increased and abounded to such an extent that no unbiased author could ever question the fact that the early Church recognized a visible head, a supreme “feeder of the sheep,” a supreme “confirmer of the brethren,” and a supreme possessor of the “keys,” in the Bishop of Rome. And the foundation for this universel belief of the early Church in the Roman authority was not due to any “accident of history,” as desperate opponents allege, but rather to the universally known fact that Rome was the permanent See of Peter. To this all the Fathers testify unanimously.
Saint Peter was also the Bishop of Antioch in Syria, was he not? Yes, he was. For a brief time (36-42) he had established his residence in the Syrian capital as he traveled about the world “confirming the brethren.” It was in Rome, however, in the year 42, that he established his permenent Chair. And, as every historian worthy of the name admits (even the anti-Catholic Professors Hornack and Lightfoot of our century), it was in Rome, on Vatican Hill, where the Prince of the Apostles was crucified in the year 67.
A fact that Protestant apologists conveniently pass over is that no apostolic see (that is, a Church founded by one of the Twelve), not even that of Antioch, the foundation of whose Patriarchate is traced to Saint Peter, ever claimed primacy of honor and jurisdiction over Rome. Even at the time of the initial stages of the Greek schism under Photius of Constantinople (9th century), the proto-schismatic Patriach never claimed a supremacy over the universal Church. The Greek separatists attacked Rome’s claim, not of inheriting the permanent See of Peter, which honor they were rational enough not to doubt, but of having a primacy of legislation and jurisdiction over all Easten Churches as well as those of the West. This was the first time in the nine hundred years of the Church’s existence that there was any united resistence to the authoritative role of the Bishop of Rome. His universal primacy was a tradition too overpowering to resist.  And, enforcing it, in the Scriptures, was the crystal clear pre-eminence of Peter over the other apostles. Leave it to the Protestant divines who “enlightened” Christendom, fifteen hundred years after the Savior had established His indefectible Church, to figure out what the situation realty was in apostolic times. Can we call this presumptuousness anything less than self-serving audacity!
Papal infallibility? Yes, O Modernists, who visibly stand within the Church, but who are spiritually without! Yes, O self-inspired, separated, non-Catholic “Christians,” who are visibly without, but whose baptismal graces lure you lovingly to come within! The One True Church needs an infallible magisterium, that she may be One and True. The apostles needed the gift for themselves. And the post-apostolic Church, especially in our time, needs it in the person of the successor of Saint Peter, so that he can continuously feed Jesus’ lambs — the children of God; and the Savior’s sheep — the hierarchy of bishops. Without infallibility, how can we have the virtue of Faith? How can we defend ourselves against the subtle snares of the father of lies, who so cleverly insinuates false doctrine among those who are not well-grounded?
Let us loyalists, who defend the authority of Saint Peter’s Chair amidst the modern-day babel, take courage. Let us refresh our faith in the indefectibility of Christ’s promise to Saint Peter by meditating upon the fisherman’s profession (Matthew 16:16). For this can be viewed as the proto-type, the first of all papal definitions. In pronouncing the infallible truth that Jesus was indeed “the Christ, the Son of the living God,” Peter was not echoing the conclusions of his reasonings. Rather it was the Holy Trinity speaking in him and through him, inspiring and perfecting his own faith, and preparing him for his doctoral office. “Blessed are thou, Simon Bar-Jona.” Why Simon Bar-Jona? Why was Peter being so graced? Why not Nathaniel, who had even before Peter, made the same profession of faith in Christ’s Divinity? (John 1:49) Why was Saint John the Baptist not so declared? Or for that matter, why not Saint Martha, who also made such a strong profession of faith in Christ’s full identity? (John l1:27)  Why was Simon Bar-Jona singled out for his profession? Why was only his name changed to “Rock” (Cephas), and not the others who had professed faith in Christ? (And remember, his name was changed the very first time Jesus met him — three years before his profession at Caesarea-Philippi.)
In the continuation of the discourse, Jesus reveals why Peter’s profession was so blessed, “Because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my Father Who is in heaven. And I say to thee: that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” And the Father will continue to protect His revealed truths through Peter and his successors to the end of time. Peter and his successors are to be the unique participators in the infallibility of the Rock, Christ Himself. And whosoever wishes to be one with Jesus Christ must join that divine society that is built upon the foundation the Savior Himself laid — Saint Peter.

Please prove, with scholarly historical documentation, including archeology, that the Miter of the Pope comes from the pagan god, Dagon. That one I really would like to see. Really.
do you still beleive that the pope is infaillibilty today???
If you believe that the Scriptures are "true," i.e., without error, then you believe that the men who were the inspired authors were infallible when they were writing. This conclusion is logically unavoidable. Either all of the human writers of Holy Scripture were "without error" when writing, or the Bible is not guaranteed to be inerrant.

Papal Infallibility | Catholic Answers
Papal Infallibility
Listen to the audio version of this content
The Catholic Church’s teaching on papal infallibility is one that is generally misunderstood by those outside the Church. In particular, Fundamentalists and other “Bible Christians” often confuse the charism of papal “infallibility” with “impeccability.” They imagine Catholics believe the pope cannot sin. Others, who avoid this elementary blunder, think the pope relies on some sort of amulet or magical incantation when an infallible definition is due.
Given these common misapprehensions regarding the basic tenets of papal infallibility, it is necessary to explain exactly what infallibility is not. Infallibility is not the absence of sin. Nor is it a charism that belongs only to the pope. Indeed, infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true. We have this from Jesus himself, who promised the apostles and their successors the bishops, the magisterium of the Church: “He who hears you hears me” (Luke 10:16).
Vatican II’s Explanation
Vatican II explained the doctrine of infallibility as follows: “Although the individual bishops do not enjoy the prerogative of infallibility, they can nevertheless proclaim Christ’s doctrine infallibly. This is so, even when they are dispersed around the world, provided that while maintaining the bond of unity among themselves and with Peter’s successor, and while teaching authentically on a matter of faith or morals, they concur in a single viewpoint as the one which must be held conclusively. This authority is even more clearly verified when, gathered together in an ecumenical council, they are teachers and judges of faith and morals for the universal Church. Their definitions must then be adhered to with the submission of faith” (Lumen Gentium 25).
Infallibility belongs in a special way to the pope as head of the bishops (Matt. 16:17–19; John 21:15–17). As Vatican II remarked, it is a charism the pope “enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith (Luke 22:32), he proclaims by a definitive act some doctrine of faith or morals. Therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly held irreformable, for they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, an assistance promised to him in blessed Peter.”
The infallibility of the pope is not a doctrine that suddenly appeared in Church teaching; rather, it is a doctrine that was implicit in the early Church. It is only our understanding of infallibility that has developed and been more clearly understood over time. In fact, the doctrine of infallibility is implicit in these Petrine texts: John 21:15–17 (“Feed my sheep . . . ”), Luke 22:32 (“I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail”), and Matthew 16:18 (“You are Peter . . . ”).
Based on Christ’s Mandate
Christ instructed the Church to preach everything he taught (Matt. 28:19–20) and promised the protection of the Holy Spirit to “guide you into all the truth” (John 16:13). That mandate and that promise guarantee the Church will never fall away from his teachings (Matt. 16:18, 1 Tim. 3:15), even if individual Catholics might.
As Christians began to more clearly understand the teaching authority of the Church and the primacy of the pope, they developed a clearer understanding of the pope’s infallibility. This development of the faithful’s understanding has its clear beginnings in the early Church. Saint Augustine succinctly captured the ancient attitude when he remarked, “Rome has spoken; the case is concluded” (Sermons 131, 10).
Some Clarifications
An infallible pronouncement—whether made by the pope alone or by an ecumenical council—usually is made only when some doctrine has been called into question. Most doctrines have never been doubted by the large majority of Catholics.
Pick up a catechism and look at the great number of doctrines, most of which have never been formally defined. But many points have been defined, and not just by the pope alone. There are, in fact, many major topics on which it would be impossible for a pope to make an infallible definition without duplicating one or more infallible pronouncements from ecumenical councils or the ordinary magisterium (teaching authority) of the Church.
At least the outline, if not the references, of the preceding paragraphs should be familiar to literate Catholics, to whom this subject should appear straightforward. It is a different story with “Bible Christians.” For them papal infallibility often seems a muddle because their idea of what it encompasses is often incorrect.
Some ask how popes can be infallible if some of them lived scandalously. This objection, of course, illustrates the common confusion between infallibility and impeccability. There is no guarantee that popes won’t sin or give bad example.
Other people wonder how infallibility could exist if some popes disagreed with others. This, too, shows an inaccurate understanding of infallibility, which applies only to solemn, official teachings on faith and morals, not to disciplinary decisions or even to unofficial comments on faith and morals. A pope’s private theological opinions are not infallible; only what he solemnly defines is considered to be infallible teaching.
Even Fundamentalists and Evangelicals who do not have these common misunderstandings often think infallibility means that popes are given some special grace that allows them to teach positively whatever truths need to be known, but that is not quite correct, either. What infallibility does do is prevent a pope from solemnly and formally teaching as “truth” something that is, in fact, error. It does not help him know what is true, nor does it “inspire” him to teach what is true.
Peter Not Infallible?
As a biblical example of papal fallibility, Fundamentalists like to point to Peter’s conduct at Antioch, where he refused to eat with Gentile Christians in order not to offend certain Jews from Palestine (Gal. 2:11–16). For this Paul rebuked him. Did this demonstrate papal infallibility was non-existent? Not at all. Peter’s actions had to do with matters of discipline, not with issues of faith or morals. Furthermore, the problem was Peter’s actions, not his teaching. Paul acknowledged that Peter very well knew the correct teaching (Gal. 2:12–13).
Fundamentalists must also acknowledge that Peter did have some kind of infallibility—they cannot deny that he wrote two infallible epistles of the New Testament while under protection against writing error. So, if his behavior at Antioch was not incompatible with this kind of infallibility, neither is bad behavior contrary to papal infallibility in general.
Turning to history, critics of the Church cite certain “errors of the popes.” Their argument is really reduced to three cases, those of Popes Liberius, Vigilius, and Honorius, the three cases to which all opponents of papal infallibility turn, because they are the only cases that do not collapse as soon as they are mentioned. There is no point in giving the details here, but it is enough to note that none of the cases meet the requirements outlined by the description of papal infallibility given at Vatican I (see Pastor Aeternus 4).
Their “Favorite Case”
According to Fundamentalist commentators, their best case lies with Pope Honorius. They say he specifically taught Monothelitism, a heresy that held that Christ had only one will (a divine one), not two wills (a divine one and a human one) as all orthodox Christians hold.
But that’s not at all what Honorius did. Even a quick review of the records shows he simply decided not to make a decision at all. As Ronald Knox explained, “To the best of his human wisdom, he thought the controversy ought to be left unsettled, for the greater peace of the Church. In fact, he was an inopportunist. We, wise after the event, say that he was wrong. But nobody, I think, has ever claimed that the pope is infallible in not defining a doctrine.”
The rejection of papal infallibility by “Bible Christians” stems from their view of the Church. They do not think Christ established a visible Church, which means they do not believe in a hierarchy of bishops headed by the pope.
This is no place to give an elaborate demonstration of the establishment of a visible Church. But it is simple enough to point out that the New Testament shows the apostles setting up, after their Master’s instructions, a visible organization, and that every Christian writer in the early centuries—in fact, nearly all Christians until the Reformation—fully recognized that Christ set up an ongoing organization.
One example of this ancient belief comes to us from Ignatius of Antioch. In his second-century letter to the church in Smyrna, he wrote, “Wherever the bishop appears, let the people be there; just as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church” (Letter to the Smyrnaeans, 8, 1 [A.D. 110]).
If Christ did set up such an organization, he must have provided for its continuation, for its easy identification (that is, it had to be visible so it could be found), and, since he would be gone from earth, for some method by which it could preserve his teachings intact.
All this was accomplished through the apostolic succession of bishops, and the preservation of the Christian message, in its fullness, was guaranteed through the gift of infallibility, of the Church as a whole, but mainly through its Christ-appointed leaders, the bishops (as a whole) and the pope (as an individual).
It is the Holy Spirit who prevents the pope from officially teaching error, and this charism follows necessarily from the existence of the Church itself. If, as Christ promised, the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church then it must be protected from fundamentally falling into error and thus away from Christ. It must prove itself to be a perfectly steady guide in matters pertaining to salvation.
Of course, infallibility does not include a guarantee that any particular pope won’t “neglect” to teach the truth, or that he will be sinless, or that mere disciplinary decisions will be intelligently made. It would be nice if he were omniscient or impeccable, but his not being so will fail to bring about the destruction of the Church.
But he must be able to teach rightly, since instruction for the sake of salvation is a primary function of the Church. For men to be saved, they must know what is to be believed. They must have a perfectly steady rock to build upon and to trust as the source of solemn Christian teaching. And that’s why papal infallibility exists.
Since Christ said the gates of hell would not prevail against his Church (Matt. 16:18b), this means that his Church can never pass out of existence. But if the Church ever apostasized by teaching heresy, then it would cease to exist; because it would cease to be Jesus’ Church. Thus the Church cannot teach heresy, meaning that anything it solemnly defines for the faithful to believe is true. This same reality is reflected in the Apostle Paul’s statement that the Church is “the pillar and foundation of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15). If the Church is the foundation of religious truth in this world, then it is God’s own spokesman. As Christ told his disciples: “He who hears you hears me, and he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me” (Luke 10:16).

Papal Infallibility - Catholic Faith and Reason
Papal Infallibility
Misconceptions?
Non-Catholics often confuse the pope’s gift of ‘infallibility’ with ‘impeccability’. They think the Catholic Church is claiming her Popes are sinless or that the Pope is claiming inspiration from God for every pronouncement he makes. This is not the case. In fact, infallibility is attached to his office, not his person. It is a protective gift, not a creative one introducing new revelation. Peter Kreeft observes that the Church should not be mistaken for a political body because it is an organic body and no organic body can be a democracy. It must have a head. Christ gave the Church a head.
What is the gift of infallibility?
The dogma of infallibility was formally proclaimed at the First Vatican Council in 1870. There are several requirements for a dogmatic, papal infallible pronouncement: (1) The pronouncement must be made by the lawful successor to Peter. (2) The subject matter must be in the area of faith and morals. (3) The pope must be speaking ex cathedra, that is from the very seat and office of Peter. In this way he must be specifically intending to proclaim a doctrine, binding the entire Church to its assent. If one or more of these elements is missing, there is no infallible pronouncement. Most "examples" of papal "errors" emerge when critics ignore the necessity of these three points. (Madrid, pp. 135-136, Pope Fiction)
Biblical Basis and Tradition
The infallibility of the pope is certainly a doctrine that has been more clearly understood over time, but is not one that was invented in 1870. It is clear in Scripture that Christ promised the protection of the Holy Spirit, saying, "I will ask the Father and he will give you another Paraclete—to be with you always; the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot accept, since it neither sees him nor recognizes him because he remains with you and will be within you . . . . the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send will remind you of all that I have told you" (John 14: 16-17, 26). "When the Spirit of truth comes He will guide you to all truth . . ." (John 16:14 ). Peter shares the gift of infallibility (a negative gift in the sense it keeps him from teaching error on matters of faith and morals) with the other apostles and their successors, the bishops.
The "pope" (an Italian word meaning "father") and the bishops together are the magisterium of the Church, that is, the teaching authority. As Jesus said, "He who listens to you, listens to me" (Luke 10:16 ); "all that you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven" (Mt. 18:18 ). When bishops of the world meet together summoned by the papacy, they meet in ecumenical council, which if held at the Vatican is referred to as a Vatican council. They are usually called infrequently only at times of pivotal or critical moments in the life of the Church.
For example, the Council of Jerusalem about 50 A.D. discussed in Acts of the Apostles, chapter15 was a precursor of later councils. After that Council made its decision to not require Gentile Christians to be circumcised as desired by the Judaizers, it wrote to the Church that " . .it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden . . ." The first formal ecumenical council was that of Nicaea in 325 A.D., which condemned the Arian heresy and declared that Christ was consubstantial with the Father.
The Nestorian and Pelagian heresies were condemned at Ephesus in 431 A.D. and Mary was formally given the title "Mother of God." Thus Councils are called to decide matters of doctrine and discipline for the whole Church. It was St. Paul who described the Church as the "pillar and foundation of truth" in 1 Timothy 3:15. The Second Vatican Council’s Constitution of the Church puts it this way: "Although the individual bishops do not enjoy the prerogative of infallibility, they can nevertheless proclaim Christ’s doctrine infallibly. This is so, even when they are dispersed around the world, provided that while maintaining the bond of unity among themselves and with Peter’s successor, and while teaching authentically on a matter of faith or morals, they concur in a single viewpoint as the one which must be held conclusively" (Lumen Gentium, 25).
Authority in Virtue of  the Office
Infallibility belongs to the Pope in a special way since Christ gave him primacy (Mt. 16:17-10 "you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the powers of death [gates of hell] shall not prevail against it.") Only Peter is given the keys to the kingdom of heaven (see Isaiah 22) and only Peter is declared the rock (see Jn 1:42 where the Aramaic term Cephas or rock is given to him by Jesus). This primacy is seen in John 21: 15-17, where Jesus instructs Peter as chief shepherd of the flock, his Church, to"feed my lambs…tend my sheep." [Note: The Greek word for "tend," poimanao, means "to rule." The same Greek word is used in Matt 2:6, Rev 2:27, 12:5, and 19:15, where it is applied to Jesus himself.] Together with the apostles he enjoys the power to "bind and loose" on earth and in heaven. Vatican II puts it this way: " [Infallibility] is something he enjoys in virtue of his office, when, as the supreme shepherd and teacher of all the faithful, who confirms his brethren in their faith. (Luke 22:32 "…but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers."), he proclaims by a definitive act some doctrine of faith or morals. Therefore his definitions, of themselves, and not from the consent of the Church, are justly held irreformable, for they are pronounced with the assistance of the Holy Spirit, an assistance promised to him in blessed Peter."
Doctrinal Understanding over Time
The doctrine is one that developed as the Church got a clearer understanding of the teaching authority of the bishops and the primacy of the Pope. St. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage writing about 256 A.D. said, "Would the heretics dare to come to the very seat of Peter whence apostolic faith is derived and whither no errors can come?" Augustine reflected this same Tradition when he said at , "Rome has spoken; the cause is concluded." In 433 A.D. Pope Sixtus III declared that assenting to the Bishop of Rome’s decision on matters of faith and morals was as assent to Peter, "who lives in his successors and whose faith does not fail." Leslie Rumble and Charles M. Carty, the famous radio priests of the 1930’s, declared that:
"Before the definition of infallibility in 1870, the Popes did not know they were infallible with the same full certainty of faith as that possessed by later Popes. But they were infallible in fact. The gift of papal infallibility was essential to the Church, not the definition of the gift. You wonder why was it defined only in 1870. But definitions are not given unnecessarily. If no discussion arises on a given point, and no one disputes it, there is no need for a definition. But in the seventeenth century the question of the Pope’s doctrinal authority came more and more to the front, until in 1870, the Vatican Council was asked to settle this question once and for all. The time had come for the Church to know herself fully on this point" (Rumble and Carty, Radio Replies 3: 95 ).
Infallible papal pronouncements are few because they could not be made without merely endorsing earlier infallible pronouncements from other sources, namely ecumenical councils or the unanimous teaching of the Early Church Fathers. An example of an important papal document that is not infallible would be Pope Paul VI’s encyclical Humanae Vitae. This encyclical on human life does not meet the strict requirements for an infallible pronouncement, but it nonetheless teaches infallible truths because they can be enunciated in a document that is not itself infallible. Infallible teachings are not defined by the Holy Father unless they are already in the deposit of faith, either in Sacred Scripture or in the Apostolic Tradition and there is an evident need.  For a greater understanding of papal infallibility provided by Catholic Answers, Click Here.
Testimony of the Early Church Fathers
Although the two radio priests stated that the early Popes did not know they were infallible with the same certainty of faith as later Popes, some might believe, that the popes, as well as others, did understand their own authority in the Church. The following passages are a testimony to this:
Pope Clement I: "Owing to the sudden and repeated calamities and misfortunes which have befallen us… Accept our counsel and you will have nothing to regret … If anyone disobeys the things which have been said by him [God] through us [that you must reinstate your leaders], let them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and in no small danger… You will afford us joy and gladness if being obedient to the things which we have written through the Holy Spirit, you will root out the wicked passion of jealousy…" (Letter to the Corinthians 1:1, 58:2-59:1,63:2[A.D.80]).
As men received clearer understanding of the teaching authority of the church and the primacy of the Pope, they also got a clearer understanding of the Pope’s infallibility. For example, quoting from the early Church Fathers:
Ignatius of Antioch: "… to the Church also which holds the presidency, in the location of the country of the Romans, worthy of God, worthy of honor, worthy of blessing, worthy of praise, worthy of success, worthy of sanctification, and, because you hold the presidency in love, named after Christ and after the Father" (Letter to the Romans 1:1 [A.D. 110]).
Cyprian of Carthage: " Would the heretics dare to come to the very seat of Peter whence apostolic faith is derived and whither no errors can come?"
Cyprian of Carthage: "the Lord says to Peter;  ’I say to you,’ he says, ‘that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell will not overcome it. And to you I will give the keys of the kingdom of Heaven; and whatever things you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth, they shall be loosed also in heaven’ [Matt 16:18-19 ]) … On him [Peter] he builds the Church, and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep [John 21:17 ], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were also what Peter was [i.e. apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, whereby it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair. So too, all [the apostles] are shepherds, and the flock is shown to be one, fed by all the apostles in single-minded accord. If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he imagine that he still holds the faith? If he [should] desert the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built can he still be confident that he is in the Church? (The Unity of the Catholic Church 4; 1st edition [A.D. 251]).
Christ instructed the Church to preach everything he taught (Matt. 28:19-20 "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nation . . . teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you…"), and promised the protection of the Holy Spirit (John. 16:13 ). That command and Jesus’ promise guarantee that the Church will never fall away from His teachings, even if an individual Catholic might. There is no guarantee that popes won’t sin or give bad examples.  What infallibility does do is prevent a pope from formally teaching as the "truth" something that is not. It does not help him know, what is true, he has to do his homework the way we all do to find this out. "It doesn’t even guarantee that the pope, when he does teach, will be as effective or persuasive, or as clear as he should be in what he teaches (Madrid, p. 138, Pope Fiction)." A pope’s private personal or theological opinions are not infallible.
Many incorrectly think that the popes are given a special power that helps them in teaching infallibly. This is confused with "inspiration". "While inspiration gives information, infallibility protects information. It doesn’t provide the Pope with the information he needs to teach, that comes from his own efforts to study and understand the deposit of Faith. It does make sure that when he formally teaches the doctrines of Faith, he’ll do so without error. The only pope who was inspired and who received revelation from God to be given to the whole Church was Peter. All the other popes who followed Peter and sat in his chair, had to do their teaching the hard way— studying and then learning it first!" (Madrid, pp. 139-140, Pope Fiction ).
Cases against Infallibility?
Now let’s turn to history and point out some favorite cases cited against papal infallibility.
What about Peter’s conduct at Antioch, certainly this would be a perfect example of papal infallibility being non-existent.
Remember Peter’s conduct at Antioch, when he refused to eat with the Gentile Christians in order to not offend certain Jews (Gal . 2:11-16 ). Paul reprimanded him, not because of his lack of papal infallibility, but because Peter’s actions had to do with matters of discipline, not with issues of faith or morals. It was Peter’s actions that were being brought into question, not his teaching. Paul acknowledged that Peter was well aware of the correct teaching (Gal . 2:15-16),the problem was that Peter wasn’t living up to his own teachings! "Another example of this is found in the Gospel of Matthew, when Jesus points out the Jewish leaders and reminds all that they possessed a God-given authority to teach, even though many of them were corrupt. Jesus later calls them ‘hypocrites’ and ‘a brood of vipers’ but that they nonetheless had an office with authority.  Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples saying, "‘The Scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of Moses. Therefore do, and observe all the things, whatsoever they tell you , but do not follow their example. For they preach but they do not practice.’"  Through God's providence there have only been a few bad apples in the papacy, these bad popes stand out so much because they are so rare. Even so, infallibility has nothing to do with sin. Thankfully the overwhelming majority of popes have been very holy men. Some unfortunately, were very heavy sinners, who lived horrible lives, but they were prevented by this grace of the Holy Spirit from formally teaching error to the Church." (Madrid, pp. 132-33, 139, Pope Fiction)
"Catholics claim that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals, yet Pope Liberious signed an Arian creed, thereby endorsing a heretical view of Christ. Obviously, then, papal infallibility is a fallicy." (Madrid, p. 145, Pope Fiction)
"Allegedly Pope Liberius not only held to an incorrect view of Jesus, but actually endorsed this by signing onto a heretical creed. The fourth century was a hard time for the Catholic Church. Despite all hopes of orthodox Catholics, the Arian movement was growing, especially when Emperor Constantius made it his business to spread Arianism throughout the empire. He was gaining strong ecclesiastical support, but he wasn’t able to change Pope Liberius’ mind. Constantius had Liberius arrested and taken to Milan to appear before him. He was pressured to comply with his will, but Pope Liberius resisted, thus Constantius banished Liberius to live in exile. After 2 years of imprisonment, harassment and exile Liberius was released. Why was he released—did he finally give in and sign this heretical creed, or did the emperor finally give up this battle of the wills? Although it’s possible that Liberius did buckle under the pressure the following evidence indicates he didn’t.  Patrick Madrid writes, "Had he really given in to the emperor during his exile, the emperor would have published his victory far and wide; there would have been no possible doubt about it….." So if Pope Liberius did end up signing this creed, why was there only silence? While it’s true that this is an argument from silence, it can’t be ignored. Assuming the worst case scenario is true, Pope Liberius only signed the creed after two years of harassment, exile and coercion. The signing didn’t come from his own free will, and for this reason papal infallibility isn’t an issue" (Pope Fiction, pp. 144-147 ).
"How can the Catholic Church claim infallibility when it officially condemned Galileo for heresy when he declared that the Earth revolves around the sun? Add to this fact that Galileo was cruelly imprisoned and force to recant under pains of torture. Modern science show that Galileo was right and the ‘infallible pope’ was wrong." (Madrid, p. 178, Pope Fiction)
"Galileo was a brilliant physicist and astronomer who’s heliocentric theories were contrary to the understanding of the Church of his day, true, but his ideas were also contrary to the Ptolemaic school of thought which was accepted by all contemporary scientists of his day." (Madrid, p. 179, Pope Fiction) Interestingly another scientific peer, Johannes Kepler, a Protestant, was vehemently condemned 10 years earlier by a Protestant University of Tubingen, for advocating the very same theory, and we don’t hear the same blown-out-of proportion stories, that Galileo has led us to. Actually for many years, Galileo was held in high regard by many Roman officials, and his work received high honors from three successive popes. So why was he condemned?
"First of all, is that Galileo’s heliocentric theory, although completely opposed by theologians, wasn’t the real source of his difficulties with the Church. Actually it was a presumption to teach that God was merely accidental, and not substantial. Galileo confused truths with scientific discoveries by saying that in the Bible ‘are found propositions which, when taken literally, are false; that Holy Writ out of regard for the incapacity of the people, expresses itself inexactly…’. Thus it was Galileo’s attack on theology that brought about the heated response from the Church." (Madrid, pp. 181-82, Pope Fiction )  Even with all of this the Church neither violated nor compromised the doctrine of infallibility. Remember that in order for a pope to exercise the charism of infallibility, he must offically be defining a doctrine relating to faith or morals—the pope is not infallible when it comes to science or any other field of thought, furthermore, the other two conditions to pronounce an infallible doctrine were not present.
As Frs. Rumble and Carty in Radio Replies explain: "All his [Galileo] arguments [of the day] gave probability only. In the present state of general education we all know that there is no doubt on the subject, and that the movement of the Earth is in no way opposed to Sacred Scripture, rightly understood. But people did not know that then, and they were not ready for the new knowledge. It’s general publication could result only in widespread disturbance due to a lack of preparatory knowledge . . . the conservatism of the Church was prudence itself in the face of these novelties not yet proved."
Wasn't Galileo imprisoned and brutally tortured to get a confession from him?  He was imprisoned but there is no evidence that he was tortured because he provided a retraction of his original statements against the Church regarding his scientific theories.
"The Galileo story when wrongly understood seems to stain the credibility of the Church, but when understood correctly, it proves nothing, except that the Catholic Church is very serious in her efforts to safeguard the flock from error or scandal. Throughout the Galileo ordeal, the Pope Urban VIII, was not acting in his capacity of teacher, but of protective guardian. So as disturbing as this case was it doesn’t conflict with the Catholic teaching of infallibility." (Madrid, pp. 188-89, Pope Fiction ).
"What about when Pope Sixtus V issued a botched revision of the Latin Vulgate Bible. This edition was so filled with errors, omissions and deformities of the text, that it was hastily recalled after his death by embarrassed Roman cardinals. But the damage was done. Sixtus V had formally taught that the defective edition was to be the only Bible used for the entire Church. If that isn’t a perfect example of a pope fulfilling all the necessary ingredients for teaching ‘infallibly’, nothing else in papal history is. The pope clearly taught error." (Madrid, p. 242, Pope Fiction)
Sixtus V reigned as pope from 1585-1590. He has been described as a "brilliant leader in political and ecclesiastical arenas, a tireless innovator in agriculture, engineering and law, he effectively enacted and enforced laws, created an impressive aqueduct system, reformed clergy and the Church’s liturgical customs, tackled building projects, drained the swamps near Rome to eliminate the siege of malaria, spent large amounts of money on charitable works and missions, and oversaw the completion of the St. Peter’s Basilica."  Unfortunately he had an ego to match and this got him into serious trouble when a revision of the Latin Vulgate edition of the holy Bible was begun.  "Historian Francis Gasquet explains the background of the Vulgate: ‘The Latin text of the Sacred Scriptures had existed from the earliest times of Christianity.’ The translators were unknown to St. Augustine and St. Jerome; but the former says that the old Latin version had certainly come ‘from the first days of the Faith’, and the latter that it ‘ had helped strengthen the Faith of the infant Church.’ Made and copied without any official supervision these western texts soon became corrupt or doubtful."
Since the Church was much threatened by Protestant doctrines that were fast appearing throughout much of Europe and since there were numerous editions of the Vulgate in circulation, Pope Sixtus recognized that the Church required best biblical translation possible to meet Protestant arguments.  He acted forthrightly in assembling a team of scholars and linguists, headed by eminent theologians like Cardinal Robert Bellarmine and others.  They compiled as many Greek manuscripts as could be assembled and finished the revision process by the end of 1588. But apparently overcome by pride, the pope found the ten thousand readings they had diligently chosen inadequate, and angrily announced he would personally revise the Vulgate. He declared, ‘We, weighing the importance of the matter, and considering carefully the great and singular privilege we hold of God, and our true and legitimate succession from Blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles . . . Are the proper and specially constituted Person to decide this whole question."
Ill equipped for the task, Sixtus eliminated all the work done by the former commission, and started fresh. Unfortunately his abilities to translate, edit and make all the appropriate decisions were beyond his capabilities and the result was an error filled translation presented to the cardinals in early 1590.
Cardinal Bellarmine and Fr. Toledo, another Jesuit scholar revealed their fears "…that by such mutilation he [Sixtus] was laying himself open to the attacks of the heretics, and was giving more serious scandal to the faithful than anything else the pope could do . . . "  If Sixtus had formally promulgated this distorted version, it would have allowed a strong case to be argued against the doctrine of papal infallibility since the Pope would have fulfilled the three requirements layed out by Vatican I for an infallible teaching.  But the weight of opposition was sufficient, thanks to Bellarmine and others, to stope the Pope from releasing it.  Still, he worked on correction of typographical errors with the apparent intention of releasing a corrected version soon. Patrick Madrid writes, "Expectation was at a boiling point. The news in Rome had it that the official promulgation would happen any day. Advance copies of the new Vulgate had been bound and delivered to all the cardinals in Rome along with advance copies of the bull officially publishing it. Everything was ready for the pope to promulgate the new version. Nothing could stop him."  But at the last moment Sixtus, whose health and vigor were never questioned, took to his bed, dying on August 27, 1590 after a brief illness.  The Holy Spirit's promise to guide the Church to all truth seems to have been fulfilled again.  "Only God knows if Sixtus’ sudden death was dramatic proof of divine intervention-- the evidence that papal infallibility isn’t just a Catholic idea, but that God Himself will prevent, by death if necessary, the pope from teaching an error formally to the Church." (Madrid, pps. 242-51, Pope Fiction ).
The reason for the gift
"The rejection of papal infallibility by non-Catholics stems from their views of the Church. They do not think Christ established a visible church, which means they do not believe in a hierarchy of bishops headed by the pope. It should be enough to point out that the New Testament shows the apostles setting up, after the Master’s instruction, a visible organization. Every Christian in the early centuries until the Reformation took for granted, that Christ set up an on-going organization" (Catholic Answers, p. 3, Papal Infallibility ).  Doubtless, our Lord also set up a means, once he ascended into heaven, by which the teachings he provided could be preserved.
"All this was accomplished through the apostolic succession of the popes, and the preservation of the Christian message, was guaranteed through the gift of infallibility. If the Church is to do what Christ said it would do, and not do what he said it would not do, such as have the gates of hell prevail against it, it must be able to teach infallibly The Church cannot teach heresy, or it ceases to be Jesus’ church. As Paul stated "the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth". The Pope must be able to teach rightly. For men to be saved, they must know what is to be believed. And that is why papal infallibility exists" (Catholic Answers, p. 3, Papal Infallibility). ​ Click Here to read more from Catholic Answers.

V. WHAT TEACHING IS INFALLIBLE?
Infallibility, (in general) exemption or immunity from liability to error or failure; (in particular) in theological usage, the supernatural prerogative by which the Church of Christ is, by a special Divine assistance, preserved from liability to error in her definitive dogmatic teaching regarding matters of faith and morals. In this article the subject will be treated under the following heads: I. True Meaning of Infallibility; II. Proof of the Church ‘s Infallibility; III. Organs of Infallibility—(A) ecumenical Councils; (B) The Pope; IV. Scope and Object of Infallibility; V. What Teaching is Infallible?
I. TRUE MEANING OF INFALLIBILITY
It is well to begin by stating the ecclesiological truths that are assumed to be established before the question of infallibility arises. It is assumed (a) that Christ founded His Church as a visible and perfect society; (b) that He intended it to be absolutely universal and imposed upon all men a solemn obligation actually to belong to it, unless inculpable ignorance should excuse them; (c) that He wished this Church to be one, with a visible corporate unity of faith, government, and worship; (d) and that in order to secure this threefold unity, He bestowed on the Apostles and their legitimate successors in the hierarchy—and on them exclusively—the plenitude of teaching, governing, and liturgical powers with which He wished this Church to be endowed. And this being assumed, the question that concerns us is whether, and in what way, and to what extent, Christ has made His Church to be infallible in the exercise of her doctrinal authority. It is only in connection with doctrinal authority as such that, practically speaking, this question of infallibility arises; that is to say, when we speak of the Church ‘s infallibility we mean, at least primarily and principally, what is sometimes called active as distinguished from passive infallibility. We mean in other words that the Church is infallible in her objective definitive teaching regarding faith and morals, not that believers are infallible in their subjective interpretation of her teaching. This is obvious in the case of individuals, any one of whom may err in his understanding of the Church ‘s teaching; nor is the general or even unanimous consent of the faithful in believing a distinct and independent organ of infallibility. Such consent, indeed, when it can be verified as apart, is of the highest value as a proof of what has been, or may be, defined by the teaching authority, but, except in so far as it is thus the subjective counterpart and complement of objective authoritative teaching, it cannot be said to possess an absolutely decisive dogmatic value. It will be best therefore to confine our attention to active infallibility as such, as by so doing we shall avoid the confusion which is the sole basis of many of the objections that are most persistently and most plausibly urged against the doctrine of ecclesiastical infallibility. (See below II, C.)
Infallibility must be carefully distinguished both from Inspiration (q.v.) and from Revelation (q.v.). Inspiration signifies a special positive Divine influence and assistance by reason of which the human agent is not merely preserved from liability to error but is so guided and controlled that what he says or writes is truly the word of God, that God Himself is the principal author of the inspired utterance; but infallibility merely implies exemption from liability to error. God is not the author of a merely infallible, as He is of an inspired, utterance; the former remains a merely human document. Revelation, on the other hand, means the making known by God, supernaturally, of some truth hitherto unknown, or at least not vouched for by Divine authority; whereas infallibility is concerned with the interpretation and effective safeguarding of truths already revealed. Hence when we say, for example, that some doctrine defined by the pope or by an ecumenical council is infallible, we mean merely that its inerrancy is Divinely guaranteed according to the terms of Christ’s promise to His Church, not that either the pope or the Fathers of the Council are inspired as were the writers of the Bible or that any new revelation is embodied in their teaching. It is well further to explain (a) that infallibility means more than exemption from actual error; it means exemption from the possibility of error; (b) that it does not require holiness of life, much less imply impeccability in its organs; sinful and wicked men may be God ‘s agents in defining infallibly; (c) and finally that the validity of the Divine guarantee is independent of the fallible arguments upon which a definitive decision may be based, and of the possibly unworthy human motives that in cases of strife may appear to have influenced the result. It is the definitive result itself, and it alone, that is guaranteed to be infallible, not the preliminary stages by which it is reached. If God bestowed the gift of prophecy on Caiphas who condemned Christ (John, xi, 49-52; xviii, 14), surely He may bestow the lesser gift of infallibility even on unworthy human agents. It is, therefore, a mere waste of time for opponents of infallibility to try to create a prejudice against the Catholic claim by pointing out the moral or intellectual shortcomings of popes or councils that have pronounced definitive doctrinal decisions, or to try to show historically that such decisions in certain cases were the seemingly natural and inevitable outcome of existing conditions, moral, intellectual, and political. All that history may be fairly claimed as witnessing to under either of these heads may freely be granted without the substance of the Catholic claim being affected.
II. PROOF OF THE CHURCH’S INFALLIBILITY
That the Church is infallible in her definitions on faith and morals is itself a Catholic dogma, which, although it was formulated ecumenically for the first time in the Vatican Council, had been explicitly taught long before and had been assumed from the very beginning without question down to the time of the Protestant reformation. The teaching of the Vatican Council is to be found in Sess. III, cap. iv (Denzinger-Bannwart, “Enchiridion”, 1800), where it is declared that “the doctrine of faith, which God has revealed, has not been proposed as a philosophical discovery to be improved upon by human talent, but has been committed as a Divine deposit to the spouse of Christ, to be faithfully guarded and infallibly interpreted by her”; and in Sess. IV, cap. iv (Enchiridion, 1839), where it is defined that the Roman pontiff when he teaches ex cathedra “enjoys, by reason of the Divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer wished His Church to be endowed in defining doctrine regarding faith and morals”. Even the Vatican Council, it will be seen, only introduces the general dogma of the Church ‘s infallibility as distinct from that of the pope obliquely and indirectly, following in this respect the traditional usage according to which the dogma is assumed as an implicate of ecumenical magisterial authority. Instances of this will be given below and from these it will appear that, though the word infallibility as a technical term hardly occurs at all in the early councils or in the Fathers, the thing signified by it was understood and believed in and acted upon from the beginning. We shall confine our attention in this section to the general question, reserving the doctrine of papal infallibility for special treatment (see III, B. This arrangement is adopted not because it is the best or most logical, but because it enables us to travel a certain distance in the friendly company of those who cling to the general doctrine of ecclesiastical infallibility while rejecting the papal claims. Taking the evidence both scriptural and traditional as it actually stands, one may fairly maintain that it proves papal infallibility in a simpler, more direct, and more cogent way than it proves the general doctrine independently; and there can be no doubt but that this is so if we accept as the alternative to papal infallibility the vague and unworkable theory of ecumenical infallibility which most High- Church Anglicans would substitute for Catholic teaching. Nor are the Eastern schismatical Churches much better off than the Anglican in this respect, except that each has retained a sort of virtual belief in its own infallibility, and that in practice they have been more faithful in guarding the doctrines infallibly defined by the early ecumenical councils. Yet certain Anglicans and all the Eastern Orthodox agree with Catholics in maintaining that Christ promised infallibility to the true Church, and we welcome their support as against the general Protestant denial of this truth.
A. Proof from Scripture
(1) In order to prevent misconception and thereby to anticipate a common popular objection which is wholly based on a misconception, it should be premised that when we appeal to the Scriptures for proof of the Church ‘s infallible authority we appeal to them merely as reliable historical sources, and abstract altogether from their inspiration. Even considered as purely human documents they furnish us, we maintain, with a trustworthy report of Christ’s sayings and promises; and, taking it to be a fact that Christ said what is attributed to Him in the Gospels, we further maintain that Christ’s promises to the Apostles and their successors in the teaching office include the promise of such guidance and assistance as clearly implies infallibility. Having thus used the Scriptures as mere historical sources to prove that Christ endowed the Church with infallible teaching authority, it is no vicious circle, but a perfectly legitimate logical procedure, to rely on the Church ‘s authority for proof of what writings are inspired. (2) Merely remarking for the present that the texts in which Christ promised infallible guidance especially to Peter and his successors in the primacy might be appealed to here as possessing an a fortiori value, it will suffice to consider the classical texts usually employed in the general proof of the Church ‘s infallibility; and of these the principal are: Matt., xxviii, 18-20, and xvi, 18; John, xiv, xv, and xvi; I Tim., iii, 14-15; and Acts, xv, 28 sq.
(a) In Matt., xxviii, 18-20, we have Christ’s solemn commission to the Apostles delivered shortly before His Ascension: “All power is given to me in heaven and in earth. Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.” In Mark, xvi, 15-16, the same commission is given more briefly with the added promise of salvation to believers and the threat of damnation for unbelievers; “Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned.” Now it cannot be denied by anyone who admits that Christ established a visible Church at all, and endowed it with any kind of effective teaching authority, that this commission, with all it implies, was given not only to the Apostles personally for their own lifetime, but to their successors to the end of time, “even to the consummation of the world”. And assuming that it was the omniscient Son of God Who spoke these words, with a full and clear realization of the import which, in conjunction with His other promises, they were calculated to convey to the Apostles and to all simple and sincere believers to the end of time, the only reasonable interpretation to put upon them is that they contain the promise of infallible guidance in doctrinal teaching made to the Apostolic College in the first instance and then to the hierarchical college that was to succeed it.
In the first place it was not without reason that Christ prefaced His commission by appealing to the fullness of power He Himself had received: “All power is given to me”, etc. This is evidently intended to emphasize the extraordinary character and extent of the authority He is communicating to His Church —an authority, it is implied, which He could not personally communicate were not He Himself omnipotent. Hence the promise that follows cannot reasonably be understood of ordinary natural providential guidance, but must refer to a very special supernatural assistance. In the next place there is question particularly in this passage of doctrinal authority—of authority to teach the Gospel to all men—if Christ’s promise to be with the Apostles and their successors to the end of time in carrying out this commission means that those whom they are to teach in His name and according to the plenitude of the power He has given them are bound to receive that teaching as if it were His own; in other words they are bound to accept it as infallible. Otherwise the perennial assistance promised would not really be efficacious for its purpose, and efficacious Divine assistance is what the expression used is clearly intended to signify (see Murray, “De Ecclesia”, vol. II, p. 199 sqq., where a long catena of parallel texts illustrating this point will be found). Supposing, as we do, that Christ actually delivered a definite body of revealed truth, to be taught to all men in all ages, and to be guarded from change or corruption by the living voice of His visible Church, it is idle to contend that this result could be accomplished effectively—in other words that His promise could be effectively fulfilled—unless that living voice can speak infallibly to every generation on any question that may arise affecting the substance of Christ’s teaching.
Without infallibility there could be no finality regarding any one of the great truths which have been identified historically with the very essence of Christianity; and it is only with those who believe in historical Christianity that the question need be discussed. Take, for instance, the mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation. If the early Church was not infallible in her definitions regarding these truths, what compelling reason can be alleged today against the right to revive the Sabellian, or the Arian, or the Macedonian, or the Apollinarian, or the Nestorian, or the Eutychian controversies, and to defend some interpretation of these mysteries which the Church has condemned as heretical? One may not appeal to the inspired authority of the Scriptures, since for the fact of their inspiration the authority of the Church must be invoked, and unless she be infallible in deciding this one would be free to question the inspiration of any of the New Testament writings. Nor, abstracting from the question of inspiration, can it be fairly maintained, in face of the facts of history, that the work of interpreting scriptural teaching regarding these mysteries and several other points of doctrine that have been identified with the substance of historical Christianity is so easy as to do away with the need of a living voice to which, as to the voice of Christ Himself, all are bound to submit.
Unity of Faith was intended by Christ to be one of the distinctive notes of His Church, and the doctrinal authority He set up was intended by His Divine guidance and assistance to be really effective in maintaining this unity; but the history of the early heresies and of the Protestant sects proves clearly, what might indeed have been anticipated a priori, that nothing less than an infallible public authority, capable of acting decisively whenever the need should rise and pronouncing an absolutely final and irreformable judgment, is really efficient for this purpose. Practically speaking the only alternative to infallibility is private judgment, and this after some centuries of trial has been found to lead inevitably to utter rationalism. If the early definitions of the Church were fallible, and therefore reformable, perhaps those are right who say today that they ought to be discarded as being actually erroneous or even pernicious, or at least that they ought to be reinterpreted in a way that substantially changes their original meaning; perhaps, indeed, there is no such thing as absolute truth in matters religious! How, for example, is a Modernist who takes up this position to be met except by insisting that definitive teaching is irreversible and unchangeable; that it remains true in its original sense for all time; in other words that it is infallible? For no one can reasonably hold that fallible doctrinal teaching is irreformable, or deny the right of later generations to question the correctness of earlier fallible definitions and call for their revision or correction, or even for their total abandonment.
From these considerations we are justified in concluding that if Christ really intended His promise to be with His Church to be taken seriously, and if He was truly the Son of God, omniscient and omnipotent, knowing history in advance and able to control its course, then the Church is entitled to claim infallible doctrinal authority. This conclusion is confirmed by considering the awful sanction by which the Church ‘s authority is supported: all who refuse to assent to her teaching are threatened with eternal damnation. This proves the value Christ Himself set upon His own teaching and upon the teaching of the Church commissioned to teach in His name; religious indifferentism is here reprobated in unmistakable terms. Nor does such a sanction lose its significance in this connection because the same penalty is threatened for disobedience to fallible disciplinary laws, or even in some cases for refusing to assent to doctrinal teaching that is admittedly fallible. Indeed, every mortal sin, according to Christ’s teaching, is punishable with eternal damnation. But if one believes in the objectivity of eternal and immutable truth, he will find it difficult to reconcile with a worthy conception of the Divine attributes a command under penalty of damnation to give unqualified and irrevocable internal assent to a large body of professedly Divine doctrine, the whole of which is possibly false. Nor is this difficulty satisfactorily met, as some have attempted to meet it, by calling attention to the fact that in the Catholic system internal assent is sometimes demanded, under pain of grievous sin, to doctrinal decisions that do not profess to be infallible. For, in the first place, the assent to be given in such cases is recognized as being not irrevocable and irreversible, like the assent required in the case of definitive and infallible teaching, but merely provisional; and in the next place, internal assent is obligatory only on those who can give it consistently with the claims of objective truth on their conscience—this conscience, it is assumed, being directed by a spirit of generous loyalty to genuine Catholic principles. To take a particular example, if Galileo, who happened to be right, while the ecclesiastical tribunal which condemned him was wrong, had really possessed convincing scientific evidence in favor of the heliocentric theory, he would have been justified in refusing his internal assent to the opposite theory, provided that in doing so he observed with thorough loyalty all the conditions involved in the duty of external obedience. Finally, it should be observed that fallible provisional teaching, as such, derives its binding force principally from the fact that it emanates from an authority which is competent, if need be, to convert it into infallible definitive teaching. Without infallibility in the back-ground it would be difficult to establish theoretically the obligation of yielding internal assent to the Church ‘s provisional decisions.
In Matt., xvi, 18, we have the promise that “the gates of hell shall not prevail” against the Church that is to be built on the rock; and this also, we maintain, implies the assurance of the Church ‘s infallibility in the exercise of her teaching office. Such a promise, of course, must be understood with limitations according to the nature of the matter to which it is applied. As applied to sanctity, for example, which is essentially a personal and individual affair, it does not mean that every member of the Church or of her hierarchy is necessarily a saint, but merely that the Church, as a whole, will be conspicuous among other things for the holiness of life of her members. As applied to doctrine, however—always assuming, as we do, that Christ delivered a body of doctrine the preservation of which in its literal truth was to be one of the chief duties of the Church —it would be a mockery to contend that such a promise is compatible with the supposition that the Church has possibly erred in perhaps the bulk of her dogmatic definitions, and that throughout the whole of her history she has been threatening men with eternal damnation in Christ’s name for refusing to believe doctrines that are probably false and were never taught by Christ Himself. Could this be the case‚ would it not be clear that the gates of hell can prevail and probably have prevailed most signally against the Church?
In Christ’s discourse to the Apostles at the Last Supper several passages occur which clearly imply the promise of infallibility: “I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever. The spirit of truth … he shall abide with you, and shall be in you” (John, xiv, 16, 17). “But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you” (ibid., 26). “But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach you all truth” (John, xvi, 13). And the same promise is renewed immediately before the Ascension (Acts, i, 8). Now what does the promise of this perennial and efficacious presence and assistance of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of truth, mean in connection with doctrinal authority, except that the Third Person of the Blessed Trinity is made responsible for what the Apostles and their successors may define to be part of Christ’s teaching? But in so far as the Holy Ghost is responsible for Church teaching, that teaching is necessarily infallible: what the Spirit of truth guarantees cannot be false.
(d) In I Tim., iii, 15, St. Paul speaks of “the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth”; and this description would be something worse than mere exaggeration if it had been intended to apply to a fallible Church; it would be a false and misleading description. That St. Paul, however, meant it to be taken for sober and literal truth is abundantly proved by what he insists upon so strongly elsewhere, viz., the strictly Divine authority of the Gospel which he and the other Apostles preached, and which it was the mission of their successors to go on preaching without change or corruption to the end of time. “When you had received of us”, he writes to the Thessalonians, “the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed” (I Thess., ii, 13). The Gospel, he tells the Corinthians, is” intended to bring “into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ” (II Cor., x, 5). Indeed, so fixed and irreformable is the doctrine that has been taught that the Galatians (i, 8) are warned to anathematize any one; even an angel from heaven, who should preach to them a Gospel other than that which St. Paul had preached. Nor was this attitude—which is intelligible only on the supposition that the Apostolic College was infallible—peculiar to St. Paul. The other Apostles and Apostolic writers were equally strong in anathematizing those who preached any other Christianity than that which the Apostles had preached (cf. II Peter, ii, 1 sqq.; I John, iv, 1 sqq.; II John, 7 sqq.; Jude, 4); and St. Paul makes it clear that it was not to any personal or private views of his own that he claimed to make every understanding captive, but to the Gospel which Christ had delivered to the Apostolic body. When his own authority as an Apostle was challenged, his defense was that he had seen the risen Savior and received his mission directly from Him, and that his Gospel was in complete agreement with that of the other Apostles (see, v. g., Gal., ii, 2-9). Finally, the consciousness of corporate infallibility is clearly signified in the expression used by the assembled Apostles in the decree of the Council of Jerusalem: “It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you”, etc. (Acts, xv, 28). It is true that the specific points here dealt with are chiefly disciplinary rather than dogmatic, and that no claim to infallibility is made in regard to purely disciplinary questions as such; but behind, and independent of, disciplinary details there was the broad and most important dogmatic question to be decided, whether Christians, according to Christ’s teaching, were bound to observe the Old Law in its integrity, as orthodox Jews of the time observed it. This was the main issue at stake, and in deciding it the Apostles claimed to speak in the name and with the authority of the Holy Ghost. Would men who did not believe that Christ’s promises assured them of an infallible Divine guidance have presumed to speak in this way?—And could they, in so believing, have misunderstood the Master’s meaning?
B. Proof from Tradition
If, during the early centuries, there was no explicit and formal discussion regarding ecclesiastical infallibility as such, yet the Church, in her corporate capacity, after the example of the Apostles at Jerusalem, always acted on the assumption that she was infallible in doctrinal matters and all the great orthodox teachers believed that she was so. Those who presumed, on whatever grounds, to contradict the Church ‘s teaching were treated as representatives of Antichrist (cf. I John, ii, 18 sq.), and were excommunicated and anathematized. It is clear from the letters of St. Ignatius of Antioch how intolerant he was of error, and how firmly convinced that the episcopal body was the Divinely ordained and Divinely guided organ of truth; nor can any student of early Christian literature deny that, where Divine guidance is claimed in doctrinal matters, infallibility is implied. So intolerant of error was St. Polycarp that, as the story goes, when he met Marcion on the street in Rome, he did not hesitate to denounce the heretic to his face as “the firstborn of Satan”. This incident, whether it be true or not, is at any rate. thoroughly in keeping with the spirit of the age, and such a spirit is incompatible with belief in a fallible Church. St. Irenaeus, who in the disciplinary Paschal question favored compromise for the sake of peace, took an altogether different attitude in the doctrinal controversy with the Gnostics; and the great principle on which he mainly relies in refuting the heretics is the principle of a living ecclesiastical authority, for which he virtually claims infallibility. For example he says: “Where the Church is, there also is the Spirit. of God, and where the Spirit of God is there is the Church, and every race: for the Spirit is truth”‘ (Adv. Hr., III, xxiv, 1); and again, “Where the charismata of the Lord are given, there must we seek the truth, i.e. with those to whom belongs the ecclesiastical succession from the Apostles, and the unadulterated and incorruptible word. It is they who are the guardians of our faith … and securely [sine periculo] expound the Scriptures to us” (op. cit., IV, xxvi, 5). Tertullian, writing from the Catholic standpoint, ridicules the suggestion that the universal teaching of the Church can be wrong: “Suppose now that all [the Churches] have erred . [This would mean that] the Holy Spirit has not watched over any of them so as to guide it into the truth, although He was sent by Christ, and asked from the Father for this very purpose—that He might be the teacher of truth” (doctor veritatis—” De Praescript”, xxxvi, in P.L., II, 49). St. Cyprian compares the Church to an incorruptible virgin: “Adulterari non potest sponsa Christi, incorrupta est et pudica” (De unitate eccl.). It is needless to go on multiplying citations, since the broad fact is indisputable that in the ante-Nicene, no less than in the post-Nicene, period all orthodox Christians attributed to the corporate voice of the Church, speaking through the body of bishops in union with their head and center, all the fullness of doctrinal authority which the Apostles themselves had possessed; and to question the infallibility of that authority would have been considered equivalent to questioning God ‘s veracity and fidelity. It was for this reason that during the first three centuries the concurrent action of the bishops dispersed throughout. the world proved to be effective in securing the condemnation and exclusion of certain heresies and maintaining Gospel truth in its purity; and when from the fourth century onwards it was found expedient to assemble ecumenical councils, after the example of the Apostles at Jerusalem, it was for the same reason that the doctrinal decision of these councils were held to be absolutely final and irreformable. Even the‚Ä¢ heretics, for the most part, recognized this principle in theory; and if in fact they often refused to submit, they did so as a rule on the ground that this or that council was not really ecumenical, that it did not truly express the corporate voice of the Church, and was not, therefore, infallible. This will not be denied by anyone who is familiar with the history of the doctrinal controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries, and within the limits of this article we cannot do more than call attention to the broad conclusion in proof of which it would be easy to cite a great number of particular facts and testimonies.
C. Objections Alleged
Several of the objections usually urged against ecclesiastical infallibility have been anticipated in the preceding sections; but some others deserve a passing notice here. (I) It has been urged (v. g. Martineau, “Seat of Authority in Religion “, pp. 66-68) that neither a fallible individual nor a collection of fallible individuals can constitute an infallible organ. This is quite true in reference to natural knowledge and would be also true as applied to Church authority if Christianity were assumed to be a mere product of natural reason. But we set out from an entirely different standpoint. We assume as antecedently and independently established that God can supernaturally guide and enlighten men, individually or collectively, in such a way that, not-withstanding the natural fallibility of human intelligence, they may speak and may be known with certainty to speak in His name and with His authority, so that their utterance may be not merely infallible but inspired. And it is only with those who accept this standpoint that the question of the Church ‘s infallibility can be profitably discussed.
Again, it is said that even those who accept the supernatural view-point must ultimately fall back on fallible human reasoning in attempting to prove infallibility; that behind any conclusion that is proposed on so-called infallible authority there always lurks a premise which cannot claim for itself more than a merely human and fallible certainty; and that, since the strength of a conclusion is no greater than that of its weaker premise, the principle of infallibility is a useless as well as an illogical importation into Christian theology. This is a line of argument frequently used by Salmon (Infallibility, pp. 47-49, 57 sq., 79, 279, etc.), one of the subtlest of the recent opponents of infallibility who have written from what might be described as the orthodox Protestant standpoint. In reply it is to be observed that this argument, if valid, would prove very much more than it is here introduced to prove; that it would indeed undermine the very foundations of Christian faith. For example, on purely rational grounds I have only moral certainty that God Himself is infallible or that Christ was the infallible mediator of a Divine Revelation; yet if I am to give a rational defense of my faith, even in mysteries which I do not comprehend, I must do so by appealing to the infallibility of God and of Christ. But according to the logic of the objection this appeal would be futile and the assent of faith considered as a rational act would be no firmer or more secure than natural human knowledge. The truth is that the inferential process here and in the case of ecclesiastical infallibility transcends the rule of formal logic that is alleged. Assent is given not to the logical force of the syllogism, but directly to the authority which the inference serves to introduce; and this holds good in a measure even when there is question of mere fallible authority. Once we come to believe in and rely upon authority we can afford to overlook the means by which we were brought to accept it, just as a man who has reached a solid standing place where he wishes to remain no longer relies on the frail ladder by which he mounted. It cannot be said that there is any essential difference in this respect between Divine and ecclesiastical infallibility. The latter of course is only a means by which we are put under subjection to the former in regard to a body of truth once revealed and to be believed by all men to the end of time, and no one can fairly deny that it is useful, not to say necessary, for that purpose. Its alternative is private judgment, and history has shown to what results this alternative inevitably leads.
Again, it is urged that the kind of submission demanded by infallible authority is incompatible with the rights of reason and of legitimate inquiry and speculation, and tends to give to one’s faith in his Creed a dry, formal, proud, and intolerant character which contrasts unfavorably with the warm-hearted, humble, and tolerant faith of the man who believes on conviction after free personal inquiry. In reply it is sufficient to say that submission to infallible authority implies no abdication of reason, nor does it impose any undue check on the believer’s freedom to pursue inquiry and speculation. Were it so, how could one believe in revealed doctrine at all without being accused, as unbelievers do accuse Christians, of committing intellectual suicide? If one believes in revelation at all one does so in deference to God ‘s authority, an authority that is surely infallible; and so far as the principle of the objection is concerned there is no difference between ecclesiastical and Divine infallibility. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that professing Christians should recur to such an argument, which, if consistently urged, would be fatal to their own position. And as regards freedom of inquiry and speculation in reference to revealed doctrines themselves, it should be observed that true freedom in this as in other matters does not mean unbridled licence. Really effective authoritative control is always necessary to prevent liberty from degenerating into anarchy, and in the sphere of Christian doctrine—we are arguing only with those who admit that Christ delivered a body of doctrine that was to be held as eternally true—from the very nature of the case, the only effective barrier against Rationalism —the equivalent of political anarchy—is an infallible ecclesiastical authority. This authority, therefore, by its decisions merely curtails personal freedom of inquiry in religious matters in the same way, and by an equally valid title, as the supreme authority in the State, restricts the liberty of private citizens.
Moreover, as in a well ordered state there remains within the law a large margin for the exercise of personal freedom, so in the Church there is a very extensive domain which is given over to theological speculation; and even in regard to doctrines that have been infallibly defined there is always room for further inquiry so as the better to understand, explain, defend, and expand them. The only thing one may not do is to deny or change them. Then, in reply to the charge of intolerance, it may be said that if this be taken to mean an honest and sincere repudiation of Liberalism and Rationalism, infallibilists must plead guilty to the charge; but in doing so they are in good company. Christ Himself was intolerant in this sense; so were His Apostles; and so were all the great champions of historical Christianity in every age. Finally, it is altogether untrue, as every Catholic knows and feels, that faith which allows itself to be guided by infallible ecclesiastical authority is less intimately personal or less genuine in any way than faith based on private judgment. If this docile loyalty to Divine authority which true faith implies means anything, it means that one must listen to the voice of those whom God has expressly appointed to teach in His name, rather than to one’s own private judgment deciding what God ‘s teaching ought to be. For to this, in final analysis, the issue is reduced; and he who chooses to make himself, instead of the authority which God has instituted, the final arbiter in matters of faith is far from possessing the true spirit of faith, which is the foundation of charity and of the whole supernatural life.
Again, it is urged by our opponents that infallibility as exercised by the Catholic Church has shown itself to be a failure, since, in the first place, it has not prevented schisms and heresies in the Christian body, and, in the second place, has not attempted to settle for Catholics themselves many important questions, the final settlement of which would be a great relief to believers by freeing them from anxious and distressing doubts. In reply to the first point it is enough to say that the purpose for which Christ endowed the Church with infallibility was not to prevent the occurrence of schisms and heresies, which He foresaw and foretold, but to take away all justification for their occurrence; men were left free to disrupt the unity of Faith inculcated by Christ in the same way as they were left free to disobey any other commandment, but heresy was intended to be no more justifiable objectively than homicide or adultery. In reply to the second point we would observe that it seems highly inconsistent for the same objector to blame Catholics in one breath for having too much defined doctrine in their Creed and, in the next breath, to find fault with them for having too little. Either part of the accusation, in so far as it is founded, is a sufficient answer to the other. Catholics as a matter of fact do not feel in any way distressed either by the restrictions, on the one hand, which infallible definitions impose or, on the other hand, by the liberty as to non-defined matters which they enjoy, and they can afford to decline the services of an opponent who is determined at all costs to invent a grievance for them. The objection is based on a mechanical conception of the function of infallible authority, as if this were fairly comparable, for example, to a clock which is supposed to tell us unerringly not only the large divisions of time such as the hours, but also, if it is to be useful as a time-keeper, the minutes and even the seconds. Even if we admit the propriety of the illustration, it is obvious that a clock which records the hours correctly, without indicating the smaller fractions of time, is a very useful instrument, and that it would be foolish to refuse to follow it because it is not provided with a minute or a second hand on the dial. But it is perhaps best to avoid such mechanical illustrations altogether. The Catholic believer who has real faith in the efficiency of Christ’s promises will not doubt but that the Holy Ghost Who abides in the Church, and Whose assistance guarantees the infallibility of her definitions, will also provide that any definition that may be necessary or expedient for the safeguarding of Christ’s teaching will be given at the opportune moment, and that such definable questions as are left undefined may, for the time being at least, be allowed to remain so without detriment to the faith or morals of the faithful.
(5) Finally, it is objected that the acceptance of ecclesiastical infallibility is incompatible with the theory of doctrinal development which Catholics commonly admit. But so far is this from being true that it is impossible to frame any theory of development, consistent with Catholic principles, in which infallible authority is not recognized as a guiding and controlling factor. For development in the Catholic sense does not mean that the Church ever changes her definitive teaching, but merely that as time goes on and human science advances, her teaching is more deeply analyzed, more fully comprehended, and more perfectly coordinated and explained in itself and in its bearings on other departments of knowledge. It is only on the false supposition that development means change in definitive teaching that the objection has any real force. We have confined our attention to what we may describe as the rational objections against the Catholic doctrine of infallibility, omitting all mention of the interminable exegetical difficulties which Protestant theologians have raised against the Catholic interpretation of Christ’s promises to His Church. The necessity for noticing these latter has been done away with by the growth of Rationalism, the logical successor of old-time Protestantism. If the infallible Divine authority of Christ, and the historicity of His promises to which we have appealed, be admitted, there is no reasonable escape from the conclusion which the Catholic Church has drawn from those promises.
III. ORGANS OF INFALLIBILITY
Having established the general doctrine of the Church ‘s infallibility, we naturally proceed to ask what are the organs through which the voice of infallible authority makes itself heard. We have already seen that it is only in the episcopal body which has succeeded to the college of Apostles that infallible authority resides, and that it is possible for the authority to be effectively exercised by this body, dispersed throughout the world, but united in bonds of communion with Peter’s successor, who is its visible head and center. During the interval from the council of the Apostles at Jerusalem to that of their successors at Nicaea this ordinary every-day exercise of episcopal authority was found to be sufficiently effective for the needs of the time, but when a crisis like the Arian heresy arose, its effectiveness was discovered to be inadequate, as was indeed inevitable by reason of the practical difficulty of verifying that fact of moral unanimity, once any considerable volume of dissent had to be faced. And while for subsequent ages down to our own day it continues to be theoretically true that the Church may, by the exercise of this ordinary teaching authority, arrive at a final and infallible decision regarding doctrinal questions, it is true at the same time that in practice it may be impossible to prove conclusively that such unanimity as may exist has a strictly definitive value in any particular case, unless it has been embodied in a decree of an ecumenical council, or in the ex cathedra teaching of the pope, or, at least, in some definite formula such as the Athanasian Creed. Hence, for practical purposes and in so far as the special question of infallibility is concerned, we may neglect the so-called “magisterium ordinarium” and confine our attention to ecumenical councils and the pope.
A. Ecumenical Councils
(1) An ecumenical or general, as distinguished from a particular or provincial council, is an assembly of bishops which juridically represents the universal Church as hierarchically constituted by Christ; and, since the primacy of Peter and of his successor, the pope, is an essential feature in the hierarchical constitution of the Church, it follows that there can be no such thing as an ecumenical council independent of, or in opposition to, the pope. No body can perform a strictly corporate function validly without the consent and cooperation of its head. Hence (a) the right to summon an ecumenical council belongs properly to the pope alone, though by his express or presumed consent given ante or post factum, the summons may be issued, as in the case of most of the early councils, in the name of the civil authority. For ecumenicity in the adequate sense all the bishops of the world in communion with the Holy See should be summoned, but it is not required that all or even a majority should be present. (b) As regards the conduct of the deliberations, the right of presidency, of course, belongs to the pope or his representative; while as regards the decisions arrived at unanimity is not required. (c) Finally, papal approbation is required to give ecumenical value and authority to conciliar decrees, and this must be subsequent to conciliar action, unless the pope, by his personal presence and conscience, has already given his official ratification (for details see General Councils ).
(2) That an ecumenical council which satisfies the conditions above stated is an organ of infallibility will not be denied by anyone who admits that the Church is endowed with infallible doctrinal authority. How, if not through such an organ, could infallible authority effectively express itself—unless indeed through the pope? If Christ promised to be present with even two or three of His disciples gathered together in His name (Matt., xviii, 20), a fortiori will He be present efficaciously in a representative assembly of His authorized teachers; and the Paraclete whom He promised will be present, so that whatever the council defines may be prefaced with the Apostolic formula, “it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us”. And this is the view which the councils held regarding their own authority and upon which the defender of orthodoxy insisted. The councils insisted on their definitions being accepted under pain of anathema, while St. Athanasius, for example, says that “the word of the Lord pronounced by the ecumenical synod of Nicaea stands for ever” (Ep. ad Afros, n. 2, in P.G., XXVI, 1031), and St. Leo the Great proves the unchangeable character of definitive conciliar teaching on the ground that God has irrevocably confirmed its truth—”universae fraternitatis irretractabili firmavit assensu” (Ep. cxx, 1, in P.L., LIV, 1047).
(3) It remains to be observed, in opposition to the theory of conciliar infallibility usually defended by High Church Anglicans, that once the requisite papal confirmation has been given the doctrinal decisions of an ecumenical council become infallible and irreformable; there is no need to wait perhaps hundreds of years for the unanimous acceptance and approbation of the whole Christian world. Such a theory really amounts to a denial of conciliar infallibility, and sets up in the final court of appeal an altogether vague and ineffective tribunal. If the theory be true, were not the Arians perfectly justified in their prolonged struggle to reverse Nicaea, and has not the persistent refusal of the Nestorians down to our own day to accept Ephesus and of the Monophysites to accept Chalcedon been sufficient to defeat the ratification of those councils? No workable rule can be given for deciding when such subsequent ratification as this theory requires becomes effective; and even if this could be done in the case of some of the earlier councils whose definitions are received by the Anglicans, it would still be true that since the Photian schism it has been practically impossible to secure any such consensus as is required—in other words that the working of infallible authority, the purpose of which is to teach every generation, has been suspended since the ninth century, and that Christ’s promises to His Church have been falsified. It is consoling, no doubt, to cling to the abstract doctrine of an infallible authority, but if one adopts a theory which represents that authority as unable to fulfil its appointed task during the greater part of the Church ‘s life, it is not easy to see how this consolatory belief is anything more than a delusion.
B. The Pope
(1) The Vatican Council has defined as “a divinely revealed dogma” that “the Roman Pontiff, when he speaks ex cathedra —that is, when in the exercise of his office as pastor and teacher of all Christians he defines, by virtue of his supreme Apostolic authority, a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the whole Church —is, by reason of the Divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, possessed of that infallibility with which the Divine Redeemer wished His Church to be endowed in defining doctrines of faith and morals; and consequently that such definitions of the Roman Pontiff are irreformable of their own nature (ex sese) and not by reason of the Church ‘s consent” (Denzinger, no. 1839—old no. 1680). For the correct understanding of this definition it is to be noted, in the first place, that what is claimed for the pope is infallibility merely, not impeccability or inspiration (see above under I). In the next place the infallibility claimed for the pope is the same in its nature, scope, and extent as that which the Church as a whole possesses; nor does his ex cathedra teaching, in order to be infallible, require to be ratified by the Church ‘s consent. The pope teaching ex cathedra is an independent organ of infallibility. In the third place, infallibility is not attributed to every doctrinal act of the pope, but only to his ex cathedra teaching; and the conditions required for ex cathedra teaching are mentioned in the Vatican decree: (a) The pontiff must teach in his public and official capacity as pastor and doctor of all Christians, not merely in his private capacity as a theologian, preacher or allocutionist, nor in his capacity as a temporal prince or as a mere ordinary of the Diocese of Rome. It must be clear that he speaks as spiritual head of the Church universal. (b) Then it is only when in this capacity, he teaches some doctrine of faith or morals that he is infallible (see below, IV). (c) Further it must be sufficiently evident that he intends to teach with all the fullness and finality of his supreme Apostolic authority, in other words that he wishes to determine some point of doctrine in an absolutely final and irrevocable way, or to define it in the technical sense (see Theological Definition ). These are well-recognized formulae by means of which the defining intention may be manifested. (d) Finally for an ex cathedra decision it must be clear that the pope intends to bind the whole Church, to demand internal assent from all the faithful to his teaching under pain of incurring spiritual shipwreck (naufragium fidei ), according to the expression used by Pius IX in defining the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. Theoretically, this intention might be made sufficiently clear in a papal decision which is addressed only to a particular Church; but in present day conditions, when it is so easy to communicate with the most distant parts of the earth and to secure a literally universal promulgation of papal acts, the presumption is that unless the pope formally addresses the whole Church in the recognized official way, he does not intend his doctrinal teaching to be held by all the faithful as ex cathedra and infallible.
It should be observed in conclusion that papal infallibility is a personal and incommunicable charisma, which is not shared by any pontifical tribunal. It was promised directly to Peter, and to each of Peter’s successors in the primacy, but not as a prerogative the exercise of which could be delegated to others. Hence doctrinal decisions or instructions issued by the Roman congregations, even when approved by the pope in the ordinary way, have no claim to be considered infallible. To be infallible they must be issued by the pope himself in his own name according to the conditions already mentioned as requisite for ex cathedra teaching.
(2) Proof of Papal Infallibility.—(a) From Holy Scripture .—From Holy Scripture, as already stated, the special proof of the pope’s infallibility is, if anything, stronger and clearer than the general proof of the infallibility of the Church as a whole, just as the proof of his primacy is stronger and clearer than any proof that can be advanced independently for the Apostolic authority of the episcopate.
(i)” … thou art Peter (Kepha)”, said Christ, “and upon this rock (kepha) I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it” (Matt., xvi, 18). Various attempts have been made by opponents of the papal claims to get rid of the only obvious and natural meaning of these words, according to which Peter is to be the rock-foundation of the Church, and the source of its indefectibility against the gates of hell. It has been suggested, for example, that “this rock” is Christ Himself, or that it is Peter’s faith (typifying the faith of future believers), not his person and office, on which the Church is to be built. But these and similar interpretations simply destroy the logical coherency of Christ’s statement and are excluded by the Greek and Latin texts, in which a kind of play upon the words Petpos (Petrus) and petra is clearly intended, and still more forcibly by the original Aramaic which Christ spoke, and in which the same word Kepha must have been used in both clauses. And granting, as the best modern non- Catholic commentators grant, that this text of St. Matthew contains the promise that St. Peter was to be the rock-foundation of the Church, it is impossible to deny that Peter’s successors in the primacy are heirs to this promise—unless, indeed, one is willing to admit the principle, which would be altogether subversive of the hierarchical system, that the authority bestowed by Christ on the Apostles was not intended to be transmitted to their successors, and to abide in the Church permanently. Peter’s headship was as much emphasized by Christ Himself, and was as clearly recognized in the infant Church, as was the enduring authority of the episcopal body; and it is a puzzle which the Catholic finds it hard to solve, how those who deny that the supreme authority of Peter’s successor is an essential factor in the constitution of the Church can consistently maintain the Divine authority of the episcopate. Now, as we have already seen, the doctrinal indefectibility is certainly implied in Christ’s promise that the gates of hell shall not prevail against His Church, and cannot be effectively secured without doctrinal infallibility; so that if Christ’s promise means anything—if Peter’s successor is in any true sense the foundation and source of the Church ‘s indefectibility—he must by virtue of this office be also an organ of ecclesiastical infallibility. The metaphor used clearly implies that it was the rock-foundation which was to give stability to the superstructure, not the superstructure to the rock.
Nor can it be said that this argument fails by proving too much—by proving, that is, that the pope should be impeccable, or at least that he should be a saint, since, if the Church must be holy in order to overcome the gates of hell, the example and inspiration of holiness ought to be given by him who is the visible foundation of the Church ‘s indefectibility. From the very nature of the case a distinction must be made between sanctity or impeccability, and infallible doctrinal authority. Personal sanctity is essentially incommunicable as between men, and cannot affect others except in fallible and indirect ways, as by prayer or example; but doctrinal teaching which is accepted as infallible is capable of securing that certainty and consequent unity of faith by which, as well as by other bonds, the members of Christ’s visible Church were to be “compacted and fitly joined together” (Eph., iv, 16). It is true, of course, that infallible teaching, especially on moral questions, helps to promote sanctity among those who accept, but no one will seriously suggest that, if Christ had made the pope impeccable as well as infallible, He would thereby have provided for the personal sanctity of individual believers any more efficiently than, on Catholic principles, He has actually done.
Christ said to St. Peter—and to his successors in the primacy: “Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren” (Luke, xxii, 31-32.) This special prayer of Christ was for Peter alone in his capacity as head of the Church, as is clear from the text and context; and since we cannot doubt the efficacy of Christ’s prayer, it follows that to St. Peter and his successors the office was personally committed of authoritatively confirming the brethren—other bishops, and believers generally—in the faith; and this implies infallibility.
In John, xxi, 15-17, we have the record of Christ’s thrice-repeated demand for a confession of Peter’s love and the thrice-repeated commission to feed the lambs and the sheep: “When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs. He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs. He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved, because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep.” Here the complete and supreme pastoral charge of the whole of Christ’s flock—sheep as well as lambs—is given to St. Peter and his successors, and in this is undoubtedly comprised supreme doctrinal authority. But, as we have already seen, doctrinal authority in the Church cannot be really effective in securing the unity of faith intended by Christ, unless in the last resort it is infallible. It is futile to contend, as non-Catholics have often done, that this passage is merely a record of Peter’s restoration to his personal share in the collective Apostolic authority, which he had forfeited by his triple denial. It is quite probable that the reason why Christ demanded the triple confession of love was as a set-off to the triple denial; but if Christ’s words in this and in the other passages quoted mean anything, and if they are to be understood in the same obvious and natural way in which defenders of the Divine authority of the episcopate understand the words elsewhere addressed to the Apostles collectively, there is no denying that the Petrine and papal claims are more clearly supported by the Gospels than are those of a monarchical episcopate. It is equally futile to contend that these promises were made, and this power given, to Peter merely as the representative of the Apostolic college: in the texts of the Gospel, Peter is individually singled out and addressed with particular emphasis, so that, unless by denying with the rationalist the genuineness of Christ’s words, there is no logical escape from the Catholic position. Furthermore, it is clear from such evidence as the Acts of the Apostles supply, that Peter’s supremacy was recognized in the infant Church (see Primacy ), and if this supremacy was intended to be efficacious for the purpose for which it was instituted, it must have included the prerogative of doctrinal infallibility.
(b) Proof from Tradition.—One need not expect to find in the early centuries a formal and explicit recognition throughout the Church either of the primacy or of the infallibility of the pope in the terms in which these doctrines are defined by the Vatican Council. But the fact cannot be denied that from the beginning there was a widespread acknowledgment by other churches of some kind of supreme authority in the Roman pontiff in regard not only to disciplinary but also to doctrinal affairs. This is clear, for example, from Clement’s Letter to the Corinthians at the end of the first century, from the way in which, shortly afterwards, Ignatius of Antioch addresses the Roman Church; from the conduct of Pope Victor in the latter half of the second century, in connection with the paschal controversy; from the teaching of St. Irenaeus, who lays it down as a practical rule that conformity with Rome is a sufficient proof of Apostolicity of doctrine against the heretics (Adv. Haer., III, iii); from the correspondence between Pope Dionysius and his namesake at Alexandria in the second half of the third century; and from many other facts that might be mentioned (see Primacy .) Even heretics recognized something special in the doctrinal authority of the pope, and some of them, like Marcion in the second century and Pelagius and Coelestius in the first quarter of the fifth, appealed to Rome in the hope of obtaining a reversal of their condemnation by provincial bishops or synods. And in the age of the councils, from Nicaea onwards, there is a sufficiently explicit and formal acknowledgment of the doctrinal supremacy of the Bishop of Rome. St. Augustine, for example, voices the prevailing Catholic sentiment when in reference to the Pelagian affair he declares, in a sermon delivered at Carthage after the receipt of Pope Innocent’s letter, confirming the decrees of the Council of Carthage: “ Rome ‘s reply has come: the case is closed” (Inde etiam rescripta venerunt: causa finita est. Serm. cxxxi, c. x, in P.L., XXXVIII, 734); and again when in reference to the same subject he insists that “all doubt has been removed by the letter of Pope Innocent of blessed memory” (C. Duas Epp. Pelag., II, iii, 5, in P.L., XLIV, 574). And what is still more important, is the explicit recognition in formal terms, by councils which are admitted to be ecumenical, of the finality, and by implication the infallibility, of papal teaching. Thus the Fathers of Ephesus (431) declare that they “are compelled” to condemn the heresy of Nestorius “by the sacred canons and by the letter of our holy father and co-minister, Celestine the Bishop of Rome ” (Hardouin, I, 1471). Twenty years later (451) the Fathers of Chalcedon, after hearing Leo’s letter read, make themselves responsible for the statement: “so do we all believe … Peter has spoken through Leo” (Hardouin, II, 306). More than two centuries later, at the Third Council of Constantinople (680-681), the same formula is repeated: “Peter has spoken through Agatho” (Hardouin, III, 1422). After the lapse of still two other centuries, and shortly before the Photian schism, the profession of faith drawn up by Pope Hormisdas was accepted by the Fourth Council of Constantinople (869-870), and in this profession, it is stated that, by virtue of Christ’s promise: “Thou art Peter, etc.”, “the Catholic religion is preserved inviolable in the Apostolic See ” (Thiel, Epp. Rom. Pont., I, 853; Denzinger, 171-2—old no. 141). Finally the reunion Council of Florence (1438-1445), repeating what had been substantially contained in the profession of faith of Michael Palaeologus approved by the Second Council of Lyons (1274) (Denzinger, 466—old no. 389), defined “that the holy Apostolic see and the Roman pontiff holds the primacy over the whole world; and that the Roman pontiff himself is the successor of the blessed Peter, Prince of the Apostles and the true Vicar of Christ, and the head of the whole Church, and the father and teacher of all Christians, and that to him in blessed Peter the full power of feeding, ruling and governing the universal Church was given by our Lord Jesus Christ, and this is also recognized in the acts of the ecumenical council and in the sacred canons (quemadmodum etiam … continetur—Denzinger, 694—old no. 587). Thus it is clear that the Vatican Council introduced no new doctrine when it defined the infallibility of the pope, but merely reasserted what had been implicitly admitted and acted upon from the beginning and had even been explicitly proclaimed and in equivalent terms by more than one of the early ecumenical councils. Until the Photian Schism in the East and the Gallican movement in the West (see Gallicanism) there was no formal denial of papal supremacy, or of papal infallibility as an adjunct of supreme doctrinal authority, while the instances of their formal acknowledgment that have been referred to in the early centuries are but a few out of the multitude that might be quoted.
(c) Objections alleged.—The only noteworthy objections against papal infallibility, as distinct from the infallibility of the Church at large, are based on certain historical instances in which it is alleged that certain popes in the ex cathedra exercise of their office have actually taught heresy and condemned as heretical what has afterwards turned out to be true. The chief instances usually appealed to are those of Popes Liberius, Honorius, and Vigilius in the early centuries, and the Galileo affair at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
(i) Liberius, it is alleged, subscribed an Arian or Semi-Arian creed drawn up by the Council of Sirmium and anathematized St. Athanasius, the great champion of Nicaea, as a heretic. But even if this were an accurate statement of historical fact, it is a very inadequate statement. The all-important circumstance should be added that the pope so acted under pressure of a very cruel coercion, which at once deprives his action of any claim to be considered ex cathedra, and that he himself, as soon as he had recovered his liberty, made amends for the moral weakness he had been guilty of. This is a quite satisfactory answer to the objection, but it ought to he added that there is no evidence whatever that Liberius ever anathematized St. Athanasius expressly as a heretic, and that it remains a moot point which of three or four Sirmian creeds he subscribed, two of which contained no positive assertion of heretical doctrine and were defective merely for the negative reason that they failed to insist on the full definition of Nicaea (see Pope Liberius ).
The charge against Pope Honorius is a double one: that, when appealed to in the Monothelite controversy, he actually taught the Monothelite heresy in his two letters to Sergius; and that he was condemned as a heretic by the Sixth Ecumenical Council, the decrees of which were approved by Leo II. But in the first place it is quite clear from the tone and terms of these letters that, so far from intending to give any final, or ex cathedra, decision on the doctrinal question at issue, Honorius merely tried to allay the rising bitterness of the controversy by securing silence. In the next place, taking the letters as they stand, the very most that can be clearly and incontrovertibly deduced from them is, that Honorius was not a profound or acute theologian, and that he allowed himself to be confused and misled by the wily Sergius as to what the issue really was and too readily accepted the latter’s misrepresentation of his opponents’ position, to the effect that the assertion of two wills in Christ meant two contrary or discordant wills. Finally, in reference to the condemnation of Honorius as a heretic, it is to be remembered that there is no ecumenical sentence affirming the fact either that Honorius’s letters to Sergius contain heresy, or that they were intended to define the question with which they deal. The sentence passed by the fathers of the council has ecumenical value only in so far as it was approved by Leo II; but, in approving the condemnation of Honorius, his successor adds the very important qualification that he is condemned, not for the doctrinal reason that he taught heresy, but on the moral ground that he was wanting in the vigilance expected from him in his Apostolic office and thereby allowed a heresy to make headway which he should have crushed in its beginnings (see Pope Honorius I ).
There is still less reason for trying to found an objection to papal infallibility on the wavering conduct of Pope Vigilius in connection with the controversy of the Three Chapters; and it is all the more needless to delay upon this instance as most modern opponents of the papal claims no longer appeal to it (See Pope Vigilius; Three Chapters ).
As to the Galileo affair (see Galileo Galilei ), it is quite enough to point out the fact that the condemnation of the heliocentric theory was the work of a fallible tribunal. The pope cannot delegate the exercise of his infallible authority to the Roman Congregations, and whatever issues formally in the name of any of these, even when approved and confirmed in the ordinary official way by the pope, does not pretend to be ex cathedra and infallible. The pope, of course, can convert doctrinal decisions of the Holy Office, which are not in themselves infallible, into ex cathedra papal pronouncements, but in doing so he must comply with the conditions already explained—which neither Paul V nor Urban VIII did in the Galileo case.
The broad fact, therefore, remains certain that no ex cathedra definition of any pope has ever been shown to be erroneous.
C. Mutual Relations of the Organs of Infallibility
(1) A few brief remarks under this head will serve to make the Catholic conception of ecclesiastical infallibility still clearer. Three organs have been mentioned: the bishops dispersed throughout the world in union with the Holy See; ecumenical councils under the headship of the pope; and the pope himself separately. Through the first of these is exercised what theologians describe as the ordinarium magisterium, i.e. the common or everyday teaching authority of the Church; through the second and third the magisterium solemne, or undeniably definitive authority. Practically speaking, at the present day, and for many centuries in the past, only the decisions of ecumenical councils and the ex cathedra teaching of the pope have been treated as strictly definitive in the canonical sense, and the function of the magisterium ordinarium has been concerned with the effective promulgation and maintenance of what has been formally defined by the magisterium solemne or may be legitimately deduced from its definitions.
(2) Even the ordinarium magisterium is not independent of the pope. In other words, it is only bishops who are in corporate union with the pope, the Divinely constituted head and center of Christ’s mystical body, the one true Church, who have any claim to share in the charisma by which the infallibility of their morally unanimous teaching is divinely guaranteed according to the terms of Christ’s promises. And as the pope’s supremacy is also an essential factor in the constitution of an ecumenical council—and has in fact been the formal and determining factor in deciding the ecumenicity of those very councils whose authority is recognized by Eastern schismatics and Anglicans—it naturally occurs to enquire how conciliar infallibility is related to papal. Now this relation, in the Catholic view, may be explained briefly as follows: (a) Theories of conciliar and of papal infallibility do not logically stand or fall together, since in the Catholic view the cooperation and confirmation of the pope in his purely primatial capacity are necessary, according to the Divine constitution of the Church, for the ecumenicity and infallibility of a council. This has, de facto, been the formal test of ecumenicity; and it would be necessary even in the hypothesis that the pope himself were fallible. An infallible organ may be constituted by the head and members of a corporate body acting jointly, although neither taken separately is infallible. Hence the pope teaching ex cathedra and an ecumenical council subject to the approbation of the pope as its head are distinct organs of infallibility. (b) Hence, also, the Gallican contention is excluded, that an ecumenical council is superior, either in jurisdiction or in doctrinal authority, to a certainly legitimate pope, and that one may appeal from the latter to the former. Nor is this conclusion contradicted by the fact that, for the purpose of putting an end to the Great Western Schism and securing a certainly legitimate pope, the Council of Constance deposed John XXIII, whose election was considered doubtful, the other probably legitimate claimant, Gregory XII, having resigned. This was what might be described as an extra-constitutional crisis; and, as the Church has a right in such circumstances to remove reasonable doubt and provide a pope whose claims would be indisputable, even an acephalous council, supported by the body of bishops throughout the world, was competent to meet this altogether exceptional emergency without thereby setting up a precedent that could be erected into a regular constitutional rule, as the Gallicans wrongly imagined. (c) A similar exceptional situation might arise were a pope to become a public heretic, i.e., were he publicly and officially to teach some doctrine clearly opposed to what has been defined as de fide catholica. But in this case many theologians hold that no formal sentence of deposition would be required, as, by becoming a public heretic, the pope would ipso facto cease to be pope. This, however, is a hypothetical case which has never actually occurred; even the case of Honorius, were it proved that he taught the Monothelite heresy, would not be a case in point.
IV. SCOPE AND OBJECT OF INFALLIBILITY
(1) In the Vatican definition infallibility (whether of the Church at large or of the pope) is affirmed only in regard to doctrines of faith or morals; but within the province of faith and morals its scope is not limited to doctrines that have been formally revealed. This, however, is clearly understood to be what theologians call the direct and primary object of infallible authority: it was for the maintenance and interpretation and legitimate development of Christ’s teaching that the Church was endowed with this charisma. But if this primary function is to be adequately and effectively discharged, it is clear that there must also be indirect and secondary objects to which infallibility extends, viz., doctrines and facts which, although they cannot strictly speaking be said to be revealed, are nevertheless so intimately connected with revealed truths that, were one free to deny the former, he would logically deny the latter, and thus defeat the primary purpose for which infallibility was promised by Christ to His Church. This principle is expressly affirmed by the Vatican Council when it says that “the Church, which, together with the Apostolic office of teaching received the command to guard the deposit of faith, possesses also by Divine authority (divinitus) the right to condemn science falsely so called, lest anyone should be cheated by philosophy and vain conceit (cf. Col., ii, 8)” (Denz., 1798, old no. 1645).
(2) Catholic theologians are agreed in recognizing the general principle that has just been stated, but it cannot be said that they are equally unanimous in regard to the concrete applications of this principle. Yet it is generally held, and may be said to be theologically certain, (a) that what are technically described as “theological conclusions”, i.e. inferences deduced from two premises, one of which is revealed and the other verified by reason, fall under the scope of the Church ‘s infallible authority. (b) It is also generally held, and rightly, that questions of dogmatic fact, in regard to which definite certainty is required for the safe custody and interpretation of revealed truth, may be determined infallibly by the Church. Such questions, for example, would be: whether a certain pope is legitimate, or a certain council ecumenical, or whether objective heresy or error is taught in a certain book or other published document. This last point in particular figured prominently in the Jansenist controversy, the heretics contending that, while the famous five propositions attributed to Jansenius were rightly condemned, they did not truly express the doctrine contained in his book “Augustinus”. Clement XI, in condemning this subterfuge (see Denz., 1350, old no. 1317) merely reasserted the principle which had been followed by the fathers of Nicaea in condemning the “Thalia” of Arius, by the fathers of Ephesus in condemning the writings of Nestorius, and by the Second Council of Constantinople in condemning the Three Chapters. (c) It is also commonly and rightly held that the Church is infallible in the canonization of saints, that is to say, when canonization takes place according to the solemn process that has been followed since the ninth century. Mere beatification, however, as distinguished from canonization, is not held to be infallible, and in canonization itself the only fact that is infallibly determined is that the soul of the canonized saint departed in the state of grace and already enjoys the beatific vision. (d) As to moral precepts or laws, as distinct from moral doctrine, infallibility goes no farther than to protect the Church against passing universal laws which in principle would be immoral. It would be out of place to speak of infallibility in connection with the opportuneness or the administration of necessarily changing disciplinary laws, although, of course, Catholics believe that the Church receives appropriate Divine guidance in this and in similar matters where practical spiritual wisdom is required.
V. WHAT TEACHING IS INFALLIBLE?
A word or two under this head, summarizing what has been already explained in this and in other articles will suffice. (a) As regards matter, only doctrines of faith and morals, and facts so intimately connected with these as to require infallible determination, fall under the scope of infallible ecclesiastical teaching.
These doctrines or facts need not necessarily be revealed; it is enough if the revealed deposit cannot be adequately and effectively guarded and explained, unless they are infallibly determined. (b) As to the organ of authority by which such doctrines or facts are determined, three possible organs exist. One of these, the magisterium ordinarium, is liable to be somewhat indefinite in its pronouncements and, as a consequence, practically ineffective as an organ. The other two, however, are adequately efficient organs, and when they definitively decide any question of faith or morals that may arise, no believer who pays due attention to Christ’s promises can consistently refuse to assent with absolute and irrevocable certainty to their teaching. (c) But before being bound to give such an assent, the believer has a right to be certain that the teaching in question is definitive (since only definitive teaching is infallible); and the means by which the definitive intention, whether of a council or of the pope, may be recognized have been stated above. It need only be added here that not everything in a conciliar or papal pronouncement, in which some doctrine is defined, is to be treated as definitive and infallible. For example, in the lengthy Bull of Pius IX defining the Immaculate Conception the strictly definitive and infallible portion is comprised in a sentence or two; and the same is true in many cases in regard to conciliar decisions. The merely argumentative and justificatory statements embodied in definitive judgments, however true and authoritative they may be, are not covered by the guarantee of infallibility which attaches to the strictly definitive sentences—unless, indeed, their infallibility has been previously or subsequently established by an independent decision.
