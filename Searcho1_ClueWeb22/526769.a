As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and analysis on how globalization is affecting the balance of power between states and citizens based on available data and research.

First, let's define what globalization is. Globalization refers to the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of countries and people around the world through the exchange of ideas, cultures, goods, services, and capital. It has been facilitated by advances in technology, transportation, and communication.

Now, considering the balance of power between states and citizens, we need to look at how globalization might be shifting this dynamic.

One way globalization affects this balance is through the diffusion of information. With the internet and social media, citizens have access to a vast amount of information that was previously controlled by states. This can empower citizens to hold their governments accountable and demand transparency. For example, social media played a significant role in the Arab Spring uprisings, where citizens organized and shared information bypassing state-controlled media.

On the other hand, states also have tools to control and manipulate information in the digital age. Some governments censor the internet or spread disinformation to maintain control over their citizens. So, while globalization can empower citizens, states are also adapting to maintain their power.

Another aspect is economic power. Globalization has led to the integration of national economies into the global market. This can weaken the power of states to control their own economic policies, as they become more dependent on global markets and multinational corporations. Citizens may benefit from increased economic opportunities, but they may also face greater economic insecurity due to job outsourcing and wage competition.

Moreover, globalization has led to the rise of international institutions and organizations that can constrain state sovereignty. For example, membership in the World Trade Organization requires countries to adhere to certain trade rules, which can limit a state's ability to protect its domestic industries. This can shift power away from individual states towards these international bodies.

At the same time, some states, particularly those with strong economies and military power, can influence these international institutions to serve their own interests. So, while globalization can constrain state power in some ways, it can also enhance the power of certain states on the global stage.

In terms of cultural influence, globalization can lead to the spread of ideas and values that challenge traditional state narratives. For instance, the global human rights movement has put pressure on states to respect the rights of their citizens, sometimes against the states' own preferences.

However, states can also use globalization to project their own cultural influence abroad. Soft power, which refers to a country's ability to shape the preferences of others through cultural or ideological appeal, has become an important aspect of global politics in the age of globalization.

Furthermore, globalization has led to increased migration, which can have both positive and negative effects on the balance of power between states and citizens. On one hand, migrants can bring diverse skills and perspectives that enrich the host society. On the other hand, large influxes of migrants can strain public resources and lead to social tensions, which states may need to manage.

In conclusion, globalization is a complex phenomenon that affects the balance of power between states and citizens in multiple ways. It can empower citizens through increased access to information and economic opportunities, but it can also present challenges such as job insecurity and the need to adapt to cultural changes. States, in turn, must navigate the constraints and opportunities presented by globalization to maintain their authority and sovereignty.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Globalization is shifting the balance of power between states and citizens by empowering citizens through information and economic opportunities, while also constraining state sovereignty through global institutions and economic interdependence.}} \]
