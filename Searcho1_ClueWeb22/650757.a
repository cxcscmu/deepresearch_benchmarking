Alright, I've got this question: "How did businesses adjust to COVID, according to Forbes?" Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like I need to find out how businesses adapted or changed their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically, I should be looking at what Forbes has to say about this topic.

I'm not entirely sure where to start, so maybe I should begin by doing a search to see what Forbes has published on this subject. I know Forbes is a reputable business magazine and website, so they probably have a lot of articles and insights on how businesses have been adjusting to the pandemic.

Let me think about what kinds of adjustments businesses might have made. I guess during COVID, with lockdowns and remote work becoming necessary, many businesses had to shift to online operations, implement remote work policies, maybe invest in technology to facilitate this transition, and perhaps also find new ways to reach their customers since in-person interactions were limited.

Also, some businesses might have had to pivot their entire business models, especially those that were heavily reliant on physical spaces or in-person services. For example, restaurants started offering more takeout and delivery options, while gyms began providing online workout classes.

I should also consider that different types of businesses might have adjusted differently depending on their industry and size. Larger corporations might have more resources to adapt, whereas small businesses might have faced greater challenges.

Now, to get specific information from Forbes, I need to perform a search. Maybe I can look for articles or reports from Forbes that discuss how businesses adjusted to COVID. Perhaps there are some key trends or case studies that Forbes has highlighted.

Let me try formulating a search query for this. I could search for something like "how businesses adjusted to covid forbes" or "forbes covid business adaptations." I want to make sure that the search terms are specific enough to get relevant results.

Once I have the search results, I need to look for articles that provide comprehensive information on this topic. Ideally, I'd look for recent articles, perhaps from the past couple of years, since the pandemic situation is still evolving.

I should also be cautious about the credibility of the sources. Since I'm using Forbes, which is a well-respected publication, I can assume that the information is reliable, but it's always good to cross-verify facts if possible.

After reading through the articles, I need to summarize the key points on how businesses adjusted to COVID, based on what Forbes has reported. Maybe there are some common strategies or innovations that businesses adopted across different industries.

Additionally, it might be interesting to see if Forbes has any data or statistics on the success of these adjustments or how they've impacted businesses financially.

I should also consider the long-term effects of these adjustments. Did some businesses continue with the changes even after the pandemic subsided, or did they revert back to their pre-pandemic operations?

Another angle could be how businesses supported their employees during this time, such as implementing health and safety measures, providing mental health resources, or offering flexibility in work arrangements.

I think it's also important to note any disparities in how different sectors or sizes of businesses adjusted. For instance, tech companies might have had an easier time transitioning to remote work compared to manufacturing or service industries.

Furthermore, I should consider the role of government assistance or regulations in how businesses adjusted. Did certain policies encourage or require specific adjustments from businesses?

In terms of formatting my final answer, I need to make sure it's clear and concise, summarizing the main points from Forbes' perspective. Maybe I can structure it by categories, such as changes in workplace policies, shifts to online operations, innovations in customer engagement, and so on.

I should also give some examples of businesses that Forbes highlighted as successfully adapting to the pandemic.

Lastly, I need to ensure that I'm not copying directly from Forbes or any other source but rather paraphrasing and synthesizing the information in my own words.

Okay, I think I have a plan here. Let me proceed step by step.

First, I'll perform a search to find relevant articles from Forbes on how businesses adjusted to COVID.
