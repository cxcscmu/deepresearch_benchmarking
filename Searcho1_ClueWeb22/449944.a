I need to find out what percentage of women are pro-choice. I guess this has to do with abortion rights, right? I should probably look for recent survey or poll data on women's opinions about abortion in the United States.

First, I should define what "pro-choice" means. Pro-choice is a political stance that supports the right to choose to have an abortion. So, I need to find statistics on how many women support abortion rights.

I think public opinion on this topic can change over time, so I should try to find the most up-to-date information possible. Maybe look for polls from the last year or so.

Also, I should consider that opinions might differ based on age, race, religion, and other factors. But since the question is just asking for the percentage of women who are pro-choice, maybe I don't need to get into those details.

Let me think about which organizations conduct such polls. Gallup, Pew Research Center, and Kaiser Family Foundation often do surveys on sensitive topics like this.

I should also be careful about the wording of the questions in the polls because sometimes the way a question is phrased can influence the answers.

Maybe I should look for a few different polls to see if there's consistency in the results.

Alright, let me start by searching for something like "latest polls on women's opinions on abortion" or "percentage of women who are pro-choice."

I should make sure that the source is reliable and that the sample size is large enough to be representative of the entire population of women in the U.S.

Also, I should check if the poll differentiates between women of different age groups or ethnic backgrounds, but again, if the question is just asking for the overall percentage, maybe I can take a weighted average or look for a consensus figure.

I should be aware that abortion rights are a contentious issue, so it's important to look at non-partisan sources to get an objective view.

Perhaps I can also look at state-level data to see if there are significant differences in opinions based on地域.

But for now, I'll focus on finding the national average.

I should also consider that opinions might have shifted recently due to certain events, like the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.

So, maybe I should look for polls conducted after that decision was made.

Let me try to find some reliable sources that have published such data.

I can also look for articles that summarize multiple polls to get a broader perspective.

It's possible that different polls might have slightly different percentages, so I should perhaps look for a range or an average.

Once I have a few sources that give similar figures, I can feel more confident about the accuracy of the percentage.

I should also note any methodology details that might affect the results, such as how the poll was conducted (phone, online, in-person) and the margin of error.

Alright, I think I have a plan. Let me start searching for the latest polls on women's opinions about abortion.
