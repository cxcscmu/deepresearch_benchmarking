I need to find out why Anwar Sadat was assassinated. I know that he was the president of Egypt and that he played a significant role in the Middle East, but I'm not sure about the specifics of his assassination. I think starting with some basic information about him and the context of his presidency would be helpful.

First, I should recall that Anwar Sadat was the President of Egypt from 1970 until his assassination in 1981. He succeeded Gamal Abdel Nasser and is known for his initiative in pursuing peace with Israel, which led to the Camp David Accords and the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. This peace effort earned him and Menachem Begin the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.

However, this peace initiative was controversial and met with opposition from various quarters, including some within Egypt and the broader Arab world who felt that he had betrayed the Palestinian cause and the broader Arab interests by making peace with Israel unilaterally.

Given this background, I suspect that his assassination was linked to this peace initiative and the opposition it generated. Perhaps extremist groups or individuals within Egypt who were opposed to the peace treaty saw his actions as treasonous or against the interests of Islam and the Arab nation.

To get a more accurate understanding, I should look into the details of the assassination and the motivations of the perpetrators. I recall that the assassination took place during the annual victory parade commemorating the 1973 October War, where Sadat was reviewing the troops. A group of army officers, members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, opened fire and threw hand grenades, killing Sadat and several others.

I need to find out more about Egyptian Islamic Jihad and their motivations for assassinating Sadat. I think searching for information on the group and the trial that followed the assassination would provide insights into why they carried out this act.

Let me consider performing a search to gather more specific information.

Terrorism in Egypt
The assassination of Anwar Sadat occurred on 6 October 1981. Anwar Sadat, the President of Egypt, was assassinated during the annual victory parade held in Cairo to celebrate Operation Badr, during which the Egyptian Army had crossed the Suez Canal and taken back a small part of the Sinai Peninsula from Israel at the beginning of the Yom Kippur War.[1] The assassination was undertaken by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad.[2]

Background[edit]
Following the Camp David Accords, Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin shared the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. However, the subsequent 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty was received with controversy among Arab nations, particularly the Palestinians. Egypt's membership in the Arab League was suspended (and not reinstated until 1989). [3] PLO Leader Yasser Arafat said "Let them sign what they like. False peace will not last." [4] In Egypt, various jihadist groups, such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, used the Camp David Accords to rally support for their cause. [5] Previously sympathetic to Sadat's attempt to integrate them into Egyptian society, [6] Egypt's Islamists now felt betrayed, and publicly called for the overthrow of the Egyptian president and the replacement of the nation's system of government with a government based on Islamic theocracy.[6] A fatwa approving the assassination had been obtained from Omar Abdel-Rahman, a cleric later convicted in the US for his role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.[citation needed]
The last months of Sadat's presidency were marked by internal uprising. He dismissed allegations that the rioting was incited by domestic issues, believing that the Soviet Union was recruiting its regional allies in Libya and Syria to incite an uprising that would eventually force him out of power. Following a failed military coup in June 1981, Sadat ordered a major crackdown that resulted in the arrest of numerous opposition figures. Though he still maintained high levels of popularity in Egypt, it has been said that he was assassinated "at the peak" of his unpopularity. [7]
Egyptian Islamic Jihad[edit]
Earlier in Sadat's presidency, Islamists had benefited from the "rectification revolution" and the release from prison of activists jailed under Gamal Abdel Nasser,[8] but his Sinai treaty with Israel enraged Islamists, particularly the radical Egyptian Islamic Jihad. According to interviews and information gathered by journalist Lawrence Wright, the group was recruiting military officers and accumulating weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch "a complete overthrow of the existing order" in Egypt. Chief strategist of El-Jihad was Abbud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose "plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing—he expected—a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country." [9]
In February 1981, Egyptian authorities were alerted to El-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information. In September, Sadat ordered a highly unpopular roundup of more than 1,500 people, including many Jihad members, but also the Coptic Pope and other Coptic clergy, intellectuals and activists of all ideological stripes. [10] All non-government press was banned as well. [11] The roundup missed a jihad cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who would succeed in assassinating Anwar Sadat that October. [12]
According to Tala'at Qasim, ex-head of the Gama'a Islamiyya interviewed in Middle East Report, it was not Islamic Jihad but his organization, known in English as the "Islamic Group", that organized the assassination and recruited the assassin (Islambouli). Members of the Group's "Majlis el-Shura" ("Consultative Council")—headed by the famed "blind shaykh"—were arrested two weeks before the killing, but they did not disclose the existing plans, and Islambouli succeeded in assassinating Sadat. [13]
Assassination[edit]

On 6 October 1981, a victory parade was held in Cairo to commemorate the eighth anniversary of Egypt's crossing of the Suez Canal during the Yom Kippur War.[1] Sadat was protected by four layers of security and eight bodyguards, and the army parade should have been safe due to ammunition -seizure rules. As Egyptian Air Force Mirage jets flew overhead, distracting the crowd, Egyptian Army soldiers and troop trucks towing artillery paraded by. One truck contained the assassination squad, led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli. As it passed the tribune, Islambouli forced the driver at gunpoint to stop. From there, the assassins dismounted and Islambouli approached Sadat with three hand grenades concealed under his helmet. Sadat stood to receive his salute; Anwar's nephew Talaat El Sadat later said, "The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them", [14] whereupon Islambouli threw all his grenades at Sadat, only one of which exploded (but fell short), and additional assassins rose from the truck, indiscriminately firing AK-47assault rifles and Port Said submachine guns into the stands until they had exhausted their ammunition, and then attempted to flee. After Sadat was hit and had fallen to the ground, people threw chairs around him to shield him from the hail of bullets.
The attack lasted about two minutes. Sadat and ten others were killed outright or suffered fatal wounds, including Major General Hassan Allam, Khalfan Nasser Mohammed (a general from the Omani delegation), Eng. Samir Helmy Ibrahim, Al Anba' Samuel, Mohammed Yousuf Rashwan (the presidential photographer), Saeed Abdel Raouf Bakr, Chinese engineer Zhang Baoyu [ zh],[15] as well as the Cuban ambassador to Egypt, and a Coptic Orthodox bishop, Anba Samuel of Social and Ecumenical Services.
Twenty-eight were wounded, including Vice President Hosni Mubarak, Irish Defence Minister James Tully, and four United States Armed Forces liaison officers. Security forces were momentarily stunned, but reacted within 45 seconds. The Swedish ambassador Olov Ternström managed to escape unhurt. [16] [17] Egyptian state television, which was broadcasting the parade live, quickly cut to military music and Quranic recitations.[18] One of the attackers was killed, and the three others injured and arrested. Sadat was airlifted to a military hospital, [19] where eleven doctors operated on him.[citation needed] He died nearly two hours after he was taken to the hospital. [19] Sadat's death was attributed to "violent nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity, where the left lung and major blood vessels below it were torn." [20]
Aftermath[edit]

In conjunction with the assassination, an insurrection was organized in Asyut in Upper Egypt. Rebels took control of the city for a few days, and 68 policemen and soldiers were killed in the fighting. Government control was not restored until paratroopers from Cairo arrived. Most of the militants convicted of fighting received light sentences and served only three years in prison. [21] The assassination was generally greeted with enthusiasm from governments in the Islamic world, which regarded Sadat as a traitor for the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. The state newspaper of Syria, Tishreen, carried the headline "Egypt Today Bids Farewell to the Ultimate Traitor," while Iran named a street in Tehran after Islambouli. President Siad Barre of Somalia and President Jaafar Nimeiry of Sudan, along with deposed Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, were the only Muslim political leaders to attend Sadat's funeral. [18]
Burial[edit]
Sadat was buried in the Unknown Soldier Memorial, located in the Nasr City district of Cairo. The inscription on his grave reads: "The hero of war and peace". [14] The funeral was attended by three former Presidents of the United States — Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter —as well as Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, French President François Mitterrand, West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Italian President Sandro Pertini, Irish President Patrick Hillery, Spanish Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, and King Baudouin of Belgium.[22] The sitting U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who had survived an assassination attempt of his own several months prior, opted not to attend because of the tense political situation, although his administration would be represented by Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, and Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick. Stevie Wonder and Walter Cronkite also attended. [22] [18]
At first, Sadat was succeeded by Sufi Abu Taleb as Acting President of Egypt for eight days until 14 October 1981, when Sadat's Vice President, Hosni Mubarak, became the new Egyptian President for nearly 30 years until his resignation as a result of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 .
Assassins[edit]
Islambouli and the other assassins were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. They were executed on 15 April 1982, two army men by firing squad and three civilians by hanging.[23]

On October 6, 1981, Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat was shot by Muslim extremists during a military parade commemorating the 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel. In the first hours following the shooting, while Sadat lay in a hospital, the CBS News Bureau in Cairo tries to make sense of conflicting reports on whether the Egyptian leader had died.

Egypt: Was Sadat’s assassination an act of vengeance or a failed coup attempt?

With the trial of Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara’s suspected assassins underway, we revisit the tragic destinies of eight assassinated African presidents. Today we look at Egypt's Anwar el-Sadat, who was killed on 6 October 1981 by a member of the military.
This is part 8 of an 8-part series
6 October 1981. It was a sunny Tuesday when President Anwar el-Sadat, dressed in an army uniform, witnessed a military parade to commemorate the success of his October 1973 battle – an offensive that saw Egypt recover the Sinai from Israel as Cairo signed a peace deal with Tel-Aviv.

It was also on this morning that the 63 year-old president would see his legacy come to an end following a 44-second attack, according to Major General Ahmed el-Fouli, a member of the president’s security team. It would become a black day in Egypt’s contemporary history.
Parade of glory to horror
During the celebration, Sadat looked up at the sky where Egyptian Air Force Mirage jets were flying, while army soldiers and troop trucks paraded by. Suddenly a military truck, containing a kill squad, stopped in front of the tribune. Khaled al-Islambouli, an officer in the Egyptian army, was the first to exit the vehicle. He began shouting and gesticulating angrily at Sadat, as recounted by one of his aides.
In response to the commotion, Sadat reportedly stood up, and shouted back to confront the young soldier. At this point, Khaled al Islamboli threw the first explosives at the Manassa (the stage where Sadat and his aides were sitting), before returning to the vehicle to grab his weapon and shoot directly at the president. His colleagues – who had stayed in the truck – followed suit and began shooting. They were: Lieutenants Abdel Hamid Abdelsalam and Atta Tayel, as well as Sergeant Hussein Abbas.
I think that the removal of Sadat is a step forward to achieve our aims, because he was a big obstacle in our way to achieve and establish democracy.
Though Aboud el-Zomor was not present during the attack, he was involved in the planning of the operation. All of those mentioned were either part of, or hired by the Jama’a al-Islameya: an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Following the assassination, they were all sentenced to death, except Zomor, who was jailed for life.
Events that followed Sadat’s assassination have led many analysts to conclude that a coup was planned in the aftermath of his death.

Islamists create and seize a moment
It was on the same day that Islamists in the country also unleashed their fury on the state. Angered by the peace deal that Cairo had signed with Israel, and inspired by the islamic revolution in Iran that had just taken in place between 1978-79, the Islamic right in Egypt wanted to hit back.
There were efforts by Islamists to take over the Maspero national TV and Radio building in Cairo as well as assassinate the interior minister, Nabawi Ismail. Two cars had driven past his home in Cairo’s Mohandeseen neighbourhood and fired live bullets at his house.

Chaos hit the governorate of Asyut. In an article dated 12 October 1981, just six days after Sadat’s death, reports state that 54 policemen were killed and more than 100 were wounded in clashes between fundamentalists and police authorities in the southern city of Asyut. The authorities downplayed the intensity of the attacks, reporting only 20 deaths.
“I think that the removal of Sadat is a step forward to achieve our aims, because he was a big obstacle in our way to achieve and establish democracy,” Saadeddin el-Shazli, a retired general exiled in Tripoli, said a couple of days after the assassination.
Shazli was Egypt’s chief of staff during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, but later broke ranks with Sadat following the peace accord with Israel. He became the leader of an Egyptian opposition group based abroad that was mainly composed of leftists, which later turned against President Hosni Mubarak.
Shazli was not Sadat’s primary problem
Just one month before his assassination, the former-inmate-turned-president had ordered the arrest of 1,536 Egyptians who opposed his politics, mainly his peace deal with Israel. Many of those arrested included personalities who originated from all over the political spectrum: the Wafd party, Socialists, Christians and the Brotherhood, including renowned Egyptians like feminist activist Nawal el-Saadawi, Pope Shenouda and journalist Hassanein Heikal.

One name that had been flagged was that of Mohamed al-Islamboli, Khaled’s younger brother. He was an influential youngster within Jama’a al Islamiya who knew how to agitate his associates. There were strong sentiments among Islamists that saw Iran’s revolution as the start of an effort to push out nationalist strongmen, starting with Sadat. His efforts to make peace with Israel, and host Iran’s ousted (and ailing) Shah were taken to be major actions of provocation by Egyptian Islamists.

Khaled’s radical opposition to a peace deal with Israel is the major reason that led him to pull the trigger on Sadat. The arrest of his younger brother undoubtedly added to his will to “kill the Pharaoh” – a statement that he shouted after killing the president. Nevertheless, he was not unknown to the Egyptian government. In fact, Mohamed Abu Ghazala, then minister of defence, said military intelligence had been watching Khaled Islambouli “for suspected religious leanings”.
By unleashing the Brotherhood, Sadat opened Pandora’s box
When Pandora opened her husband’s container, she unleashed a slew of curses, according to Hesiod, the Greek poet who wrote the poem ‘Works and Days’. Her curiosity pushed her to open the forbidden box. Sadat’s story with the Muslim Brotherhood followed a similar explosive outcome. He knew that in opening certain boxes, he may not be able to shut them closed again. But he was willing to take the risk.
Sadat was faced with formidable enemies in the aftermath of the passing of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. These included loyal Nasserists, who viewed Sadat as a weak leader, and pro-soviet officials, who doubted Sadat’s socialist leanings. Egypt’s leftists were very vocal in universities and public spaces, chanting pro-Palestine, pro-democracy and anti-US slogans. Following Nasser’s death, Sadat was at the helm of taking over from Egypt’s most charismatic president in (some could argue in the Middle-East’s) modern contemporary history. He was undoubtedly faced with an epic challenge.

While Nasser embraced a pan-Arab Middle-East and forged ties with the Maghreb as well as African states, Sadat turned to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states  – key steps to opening relations with the US. Nasser had cherished his alliance with the Soviets, but Sadat broke Cairo’s ties with Moscow. Nasser believed in gathering third world countries, while Sadat favoured a go-it-alone foreign policy.
Sadat consolidated his shaky rule by unleashing the power of the Islamic right as a hammer against the left, with the generous financial assistance of Saudi Arabia…
Sadat faced an increasingly difficult battle to find new support as he realigned Egypt’s alliances.
He thus needed Egypt’s scattered Islamist community, which had been heavily repressed under Nasser, to help him silence his political opponents. Although the Muslim Brotherhood was not allowed to regain legality or participate as a party in elections, under Sadat it emerged from its repression with a carte blanche to intimidate Egypt’s young liberals and leftists at universities, run for student and professional unions, while appearing more frequently in the media.
READ MORE Egypt: ‘The Muslim Brotherhood has never been more disconnected from society’
“Sadat consolidated his shaky rule by unleashing the power of the Islamic right as a hammer against the left, with the generous financial assistance of Saudi Arabia […] Sadat welcomed the exiled Muslim Brotherhood back to Egypt, reinvigorated the organisation, and built its institutional presence within universities. Before Sadat, Islamists were for the most part fringe-dwelling marginalised radicals, after Sadat, the Muslim Brotherhood and its more radical youth wing, were part of mainstream politics in Egypt,” writes Robert Dreyfus, in his book The Devil’s Game.
Initially, this Islamist community, which had no central leadership, served as an ally to Sadat. However, the re-establishment of ties with the US after the 1973 war, his voyage to Jerusalem to address the Knesset that led to the Camp David peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, and last but not least, his support for the US in Afghanistan against Soviet troops would gradually turn the Islamists against Sadat.

On the morning of his assassination, Jihan al-Sadat asked her husband to wear a bullet proof jacket. The president refused adding he doesn’t need it, because he would be “among his children”. Unfortunately for the president, not all his “children” felt the same way about their new father figure.

Motives
A motive cited for his actions is the Middle East conflict. After his arrest, Sirhan said, "I can explain it. I did it for my country." Sirhan believed he was deliberately betrayed by Kennedy's support for Israel in the June 1967 Six-Day War, which had begun exactly one year to the day before the assassination. During a search of Sirhan's apartment after his arrest, a spiral-bound notebook was found containing a diary entry which demonstrated that his anger had gradually fixated on Robert Kennedy, who had promised to send 50 fighter jets to Israel if he were elected president. Sirhan's journal entry of May 18, 1968, read: "My determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming the more and more of an unshakable obsession...Kennedy must die before June 5th". They found other notebooks and diary entries which contained his growing rage at Zionists, particularly at Kennedy; his journals also contained many nonsensical scribbles, which were thought to be his version of "free writing".
The next day, on June 6, the Los Angeles Times printed an article, which discussed Sirhan's motive for the assassination, confirmed by the memos Sirhan wrote to himself. Jerry Cohen, who authored the article, stated:
When the Jordanian nationalist, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, allegedly shot Kennedy, ostensibly because of the senator's advocacy of U.S. support for Israel, the crime with which he was charged was in essence another manifestation of the centuries-old hatred between Arab and Jew.
M.T. Mehdi, then secretary-general of the Action Committee on American-Arab Relations, believed that Sirhan had acted in justifiable self-defense, stating: "Sirhan was defending himself against those 50 Phantom jets Kennedy was sending to Israel." Mehdi wrote a 100-page book on the subject called Kennedy and Sirhan: Why?.
Later in prison, Sirhan stated that his motivation was anger fueled by liquor. An interview with Sirhan in 1980 revealed new claims that a combination of liquor and anger over the anniversary of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war triggered his actions the night he assassinated RFK. "You must remember the circumstances of that night, June 5. That was when I was provoked," Sirhan says, recorded in a transcript of one of his interviews with Mehdi, later president of the New York-based American-Arab Relations Committee. "That is when I initially went to observe the Jewish Zionist parade in celebration of the June 5, 1967, victory over the Arabs. That was the catalyst that triggered me on that night." Then Sirhan said, "In addition, there was the consumption of the liquor, and I want the public to understand that..."
At a June 30, 2003 hearing, Lawrence Teeter, in an attempt to get Sirhan a new trial, claimed that Sirhan had been hypnotized into firing at Kennedy and that he may have been using blanks; that Sirhan couldn't possibly have fired the fatal shot from where he was standing; that prosecutors blackmailed his defense attorney to throw the case and that police and government agencies whitewashed or bungled investigations. The motion was denied.

Famous quotes containing the word motives:
“ We have done scant justice to the reasonableness of cannibalism. There are in fact so many and such excellent motives possible to it that mankind has never been able to fit all of them into one universal scheme, and has accordingly contrived various diverse and contradictory systems the better to display its virtues. ”
— Ruth Benedict (1887–1948)
“ The proper office of religion is to regulate the heart of men, humanize their conduct, infuse the spirit of temperance, order, and obedience; and as its operation is silent, and only enforces the motives of morality and justice, it is in danger of being overlooked, and confounded with these other motives.”
— David Hume (1711–1776)
“ The motives to actions and the inward turns of mind seem in our opinion more necessary to be known than the actions themselves; and much rather would we choose that our reader should clearly understand what our principal actors think than what they do. ”
— Sarah Fielding (1710–1768)

Alright, I've got some information from these sources. Let me try to piece together why Anwar Sadat was assassinated.

From the Wikipedia article, it seems that Sadat was assassinated during a military parade in 1981. The assassination was carried out by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. The article mentions that Sadat's peace initiative with Israel, leading to the Camp David Accords and the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, was highly controversial and met with opposition from various groups, including some within Egypt and the broader Arab world. These groups felt that Sadat had betrayed the Palestinian cause and Arab interests by making peace with Israel unilaterally.

Another source from History.com confirms that Sadat was shot during a military parade commemorating the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and that he was killed by Muslim extremists. This aligns with the information from Wikipedia.

The article from The Africa Report provides more context about the political climate in Egypt at the time. It explains that Sadat had come to power after the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser and faced challenges from various factions, including leftists and Islamists. To consolidate his rule, Sadat had allowed the Muslim Brotherhood, which had been suppressed under Nasser, to operate more freely. However, when Sadat shifted Egypt's foreign policy, aligning more closely with the United States and making peace with Israel, this turned the Islamists against him.

The source also mentions that just one month before his assassination, Sadat had ordered the arrest of 1,536 Egyptians who opposed his policies, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups. This suggests that there was significant dissent and that Sadat was taking measures to suppress opposition.

In the assassination itself, the shooter was identified as Khaled al-Islambouli, an army officer associated with the Jama’a al-Islamiya, an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. The other perpetrators were also members of this group.

Some sources suggest that the assassination was part of a larger plot, possibly even a coup attempt. The Africa Report article mentions that there were efforts by Islamists to take over the national TV and radio building and to assassinate the interior minister on the same day. There were also clashes in the city of Asyut, resulting in the deaths of police officers.

Furthermore, the article quotes Saadeddin el-Shazli, a retired general who was critical of Sadat's policies, saying that the removal of Sadat was a step forward for achieving their aims, as he was a big obstacle to establishing democracy. This suggests that there might have been political motivations beyond just religious opposition to Sadat's peace with Israel.

Another source mentions that Sadat's assassination was seen as a step towards removing a leader who was perceived as betraying Arab and Islamic causes. The assassination was met with mixed reactions internationally, with some Arab governments and organizations expressing approval or ambivalence, while others condemned it.

Overall, it seems that the primary motive for assassinating Anwar Sadat was opposition to his peace initiatives with Israel, which were seen as betrayal by many Arab nationalists and Islamists. Additionally, there may have been broader political ambitions, possibly including an attempt to overthrow the government and implement a more Islamic form of governance.

I need to think about whether there were other factors or if this was solely motivated by opposition to the peace treaty. For example, was there discontent with Sadat's economic policies or other aspects of his rule?

Looking back at the information, the Africa Report mentions that Sadat had arrested numerous opponents prior to his assassination, suggesting that there was widespread dissatisfaction with his rule beyond just the peace treaty. The arrests included figures from across the political spectrum, including socialists, Christians, and members of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Moreover, Sadat's policy of infitah, which opened up Egypt's economy to foreign investment and private enterprise, led to increased inequality and corruption, which may have contributed to public discontent.

However, the immediate trigger for the assassination seems to have been the peace treaty with Israel, as indicated by the perpetrators' statements and the context of the time.

I should also consider if there were any international influences or support for the assassination attempt. For instance, some sources mention connections to Iran following the Islamic Revolution, but I don't have specific information on that in the search results.

Additionally, the fact that the assassination was carried out by military personnel suggests that there might have been dissent within the armed forces, possibly over Sadat's policies.

I recall that Sadat was succeeded by Hosni Mubarak, who continued many of his policies but also cracked down heavily on Islamic extremism and opposition groups.

In conclusion, Anwar Sadat was assassinated primarily due to opposition to his peace initiatives with Israel, which were seen as betrayal by Arab nationalists and Islamists. The assassination was carried out by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and there may have been broader political goals, including attempting to overthrow the government. Sadat's other policies, such as economic reforms and suppression of opposition, may have also contributed to the climate of dissent that led to his assassination.
