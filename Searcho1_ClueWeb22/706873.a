As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and arguments related to the topic of cloning humans to help you form your own opinion.

Cloning humans is a highly debated topic in science and ethics. Cloning refers to creating a genetically identical copy of an organism, in this case, a human being. There are two main types of cloning: therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning involves creating embryos for the purpose of harvesting stem cells to treat diseases, while reproductive cloning aims to create a full-grown organism.

From a scientific perspective, cloning humans could offer several benefits. For instance, it could help infertile couples have genetically related children or allow parents to replace a deceased child with a genetic replica. Additionally, cloning could be used to produce organs for transplantation, potentially solving the organ donor shortage problem.

However, there are also significant ethical concerns associated with human cloning. One major issue is the potential for cloned individuals to face discrimination or be treated as less than fully human. There are also concerns about the psychological impact on clones, such as identity issues and the pressure to live up to expectations based on their genetic predecessor.

Moreover, the success rate of cloning in animals has been low, with many cloned embryos failing to develop properly or resulting in offspring with health problems. Applying this technology to humans raises serious questions about the welfare and rights of the clones.

In terms of public policy, many countries have already banned human reproductive cloning due to these ethical and safety concerns. For example, in the United States, federal funding for human cloning research is prohibited, and several states have enacted laws against it.

On the other hand, some argue that banning human cloning stifles scientific progress and denies individuals the right to choose how to reproduce. They contend that with proper regulation and oversight, the risks can be minimized, and the potential benefits realized.

In conclusion, whether scientists should be allowed to clone humans is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of both the scientific possibilities and the ethical implications. It's important to engage in ongoing dialogue and establish rigorous guidelines to ensure that any research in this area is conducted responsibly and ethically.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{No, scientists should not be allowed to clone humans due to significant ethical concerns and potential harm to clones.}} \]
