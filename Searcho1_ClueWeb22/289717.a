So I've got this question: "Can global pollution be considered an economic failure?" Hmm, interesting. At first glance, it seems like pollution is more of an environmental issue, but the question is linking it to economics. I need to think about how these two areas connect.

I guess I should start by understanding what constitutes an "economic failure." Maybe it's when the economy isn't functioning efficiently, or when there are market failures that lead to negative outcomes. Pollution might be one of those negative outcomes. So, perhaps pollution is a result of market failures where companies don't account for the costs their actions impose on society.

Let me think about externalities. In economics, externalities are costs or benefits that affect parties who did not choose to incur those costs or benefits. Pollution is a classic example of a negative externality because the costs of emitting pollutants are borne by society as a whole, not just by the polluters themselves. So, if companies aren't paying for the full social cost of their production processes, that could be seen as an economic failure.

But is it fair to label global pollution solely as an economic failure? Maybe not, because there are political and social dimensions to this problem as well. For instance, regulations might be insufficient or poorly enforced, which is more of a political failure. Also, consumer demand for certain products that lead to pollution plays a role, which is a social aspect.

Perhaps I need to look at it from different angles. From an economic perspective, if markets aren't internalizing the costs of pollution, then yes, it's an economic failure. However, economics also involves policy recommendations to address such failures, like imposing taxes on pollution or setting up cap-and-trade systems.

Wait a minute, maybe I should consider whether economic growth and environmental sustainability can coexist. There's something called sustainable development, which aims to balance economic growth with environmental protection. If economies are growing at the expense of the environment, that might not be sustainable in the long run.

Let me try to structure my thoughts better. First, define economic failure. Then, see how pollution relates to that definition. Consider different types of failures—market failures, regulatory failures, etc. Explore possible solutions from an economic standpoint.

Alright, starting over.

What is an economic failure? It could be when the economy doesn't allocate resources efficiently, leading to waste or inefficiencies. Market failures are situations where the allocation of goods and services is not efficient, often resulting in externalities like pollution.

Pollution is a negative externality because the polluter doesn't bear the full cost of the pollution they create. Instead, the costs are spread out among society in the form of health problems, environmental damage, etc. This mismatch between private and social costs leads to overproduction of polluting goods and activities.

So, in that sense, yes, global pollution can be considered an economic failure because the market isn't accounting for the full social costs of production and consumption.

But, it's important to note that this isn't just about markets failing; it's also about the failure of governments to implement proper regulations and policies to correct these market failures. For example, if governments don't enforce emission standards or don't provide incentives for cleaner technologies, that's a policy failure.

Moreover, there's the issue of international cooperation. Global pollution is a transboundary problem; emissions in one country can affect another. So, even if individual countries are addressing pollution within their borders, without global cooperation, the problem persists. This could be seen as a failure of international economic institutions and agreements.

Thinking about it from a different angle, some economists argue that growth and environmental protection aren't inherently contradictory. There's the concept of decoupling, where economic growth doesn't necessarily lead to increased resource use and pollution. If technologies improve and become more efficient, we can grow the economy without harming the environment as much.

However, in reality, we haven't seen complete decoupling on a global scale yet. While some countries have managed to reduce pollution while growing their economies, overall global pollution continues to rise.

Maybe I need to look into some data to support this. Let me consider searching for information on global pollution trends and economic growth.

The Effects of Economic Growth on Pollution
September 21, 2017
As an economy grows, so does pollution. However, the two don’t move in lockstep, as a recent Economic Synopses essay shows that pollution increases at a slower rate than economic growth.
An Environmental Kuznets Curve Ball
Research Officer and Economist Guillaume Vandenbroucke and Research Associate Heting Zhu’s conclusion contrasts with an older hypothesis in this literature called the “environmental Kuznets curve” or EKC.
The EKC variation posits that pollution increases with economic growth in the early stages of development. Beyond a certain level of development, however, the trend reverses, and economic growth improves environmental conditions by creating the resources to do so.
Vandenbroucke and Zhu noted that a 2004 paper found that pollution rises monotonically with economic activity. 1 “A 1 percent increase in economic activity raises pollution but at a slower pace. That is, pollution is increasing more slowly than GDP,” Vandenbroucke and Zhu wrote.
Three Kinds of Pollution
In the essay, the authors looked at three kinds of pollution typically generated by economic growth:
CO2 emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions overall
PM2.5 particulate matter emissions
CO2 and GDP per Capita
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, CO2 emissions—the most abundant greenhouse gas—increased at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent between 1990 and 2014, the authors noted. Meanwhile, GDP per capita increased at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent.
“Thus, the average person in the United States has benefited from relatively ‘cleaner’ goods and services produced with fewer emissions of CO2,” the authors wrote.
They noted that CO2 still rose over the period studied, and the impact on climate is beyond the scope of their essay. “The point here is that the increasing level of CO2, which is detrimental to well-being, coincides with an even greater increase in GDP per capita, which advances well-being,” Vandenbroucke and Zhu said. 2
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Between 1990 and 2014, greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.28 percent on an average annual basis, again lower than the 1.4 percent average annual increase in GDP per capita.
They also noted this pattern holds when the economy slows down: Greenhouse gas emissions declined at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent from 2005 to 2011, or the period encompassing the Great Recession, while both GDP and population increased at an average annual rate of 0.9 percent.
“Thus, GDP per capita was stagnant, while total greenhouse gas emissions decreased,” the authors noted.
PM2.5 Particulate Matter Emission
Vandenbroucke and Zhu then looked at another form of pollution: particulate matter. In particular, they looked at PM2.5, which measures the concentration of particles less than 2.5 micrometers in size in a given volume of air.
When looking at the relationship between PM2.5 and GDP per capita across countries from 1990 to 2015, Vandenbroucke and Zhu found a negative correlation. “In other words, one unit of GDP per capita can be produced with fewer particulate matter emissions in countries with high GDP per capita,” they wrote.
Pollutants and GDP
A nation’s economic growth can contribute to several different kinds of pollution, affecting health and motivating policymaking decisions.
“Our point is not to dispute the quantity of pollution, nor is it to argue about the effects of pollution on people’s health or the climate,” Vandenbroucke and Zhu said. “Instead, we suggest that the costs of pollution should be assessed relative to the benefit of said economic activity. If both economic activity and pollution are rising, one ought to ask whether the costs are rising faster than the benefit...or the opposite.”
In sum, “We find that pollution in the United States, measured by particulate matter or CO2 emissions, rises with economic activity, but at a noticeably slower pace,” they said.
Notes and References
1 Stern, David I. “ The Rise and Fall of the Environmental Kuznets Curve .” World Development, August 2004, Vol. 32, Issue 8, pp. 1419-39.
2 The authors noted that this does not imply that welfare increases just because GDP per capita increases faster than CO2 emissions. That is, welfare can either increase or decrease, depending on how the increases in GDP and CO2 affect it.

Does economic growth reduce pollution? | World Economic Forum
Future of the Environment
Does economic growth reduce pollution?
Over the past 30 years US GDP per capita has nearly doubled while pollution emitted by US manufacturers has declined. Ozone emissions are down 33%, nitrogen dioxide 60%, sulfur dioxide 81%, and carbon monoxide 84%. 1 Some analysts point to this cleanup as evidence that economic growth alone will automatically improve the environment. For example John Tierney wrote in The New York Times that “the richer everyone gets, the greener the planet will be in the long run.” Others caution that environmental improvement does not necessarily follow from income growth, but depends on environmental policies and institutions (Yandle et al. 2004).
Claims that richer countries pollute less typically cite the seminal paper by Grossman and Krueger (1993) demonstrating that many pollutants appear to increase with national income in poor countries, but decrease with national income in rich countries. A graph of this relationship – with pollution on the vertical axis and income on the horizontal – makes an inverted-U shape, and has come to be called an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). But EKCs are just correlations. They don’t demonstrate that income growth causes environmental improvement – at least not directly. Richer countries could pollute less because they enforce stricter environmental regulations or offshore the manufacture of pollution-intensive goods. Neither of these would represent a direct or automatic effect of income growth on global pollution.
To analyse the relationship between national income and pollution, economists decompose it into three components:
Increases in the overall size of the economy (scale),
Changes to the pollution intensity of production (technique), and
Changes in the overall mix of activities (composition). 2
Several recent papers have shown that most of the cleanup of manufacturing in developed countries has come from changes in production techniques. But of the remaining change in composition, a significant fraction comes from people in richer countries choosing to consume a less pollution-intensive mix of goods and services. 3 This leaves open the question of whether richer people choose less polluting goods, or richer countries pass regulations making polluting goods more expensive.
In Levinson and O’Brien (2015) we use Environmental Engel Curves (EECs) – or income expansion paths – to separate these two parts of the composition change in which residents of richer countries choose cleaner goods:
The direct and perhaps automatic portion coming from richer people’s preferences, and
The indirect portion due to economy-wide changes in richer countries.
Unlike EKCs, EECs are meant to be causal. They depict structural relationships between people’s incomes and the goods and services they choose, holding all else equal. 4
Figure 1 shows a set of EECs estimated for one representative local air pollutant – particulate matter less than ten microns (PM10). We begin by matching categories of household consumption in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to emissions intensities in the 1997 Trade and Environmental Assessment Model (TEAM). 5 Then for each household in the CEX we calculate the total amount of PM10 emitted while producing the goods and services that the household consumes. 6 We then separate the CEX households into 50 income groups and plot the average level of pollution associated with producing those households’ goods and services. The top curve in Figure 1 uses the 1984 CEX; the bottom curve uses the same 50 household income groups and production emissions intensities applied to the 2002 CEX.
Figure 1. Environmental Engel curves for particulate matter, 1984 and 2002
Notes: Income and consumption are adjusted for inflation using the core CPI. Food and energy consumption are adjusted separately using the corresponding CPIs. Pollution per household in both years is estimated using 1997 pollution intensity of production data.
Sources: Calculations based on the NBER extracts of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (www.nber.org/data/ces_cbo.html) and the Trade and Environmental Assessment Model (Abt. Associates, Inc.).
Three phenomena are apparent in Figure 1.
First, unsurprisingly, richer households are responsible for more pollution.
Second, EECs are concave, meaning that richer households consume less pollution-intensive mixes of goods and services.
Third, the EECs in Figure 1 shift down over time. Households represented in 2002 are responsible for less pollution than their 1984 counterparts with similar real incomes. This downward shift does not result from improvements in technology or abatement because we have fixed the pollution intensity of production for both years. Instead, the shift reflects a change in consumption due to some combination of changing prices, regulations, or other economy-wide effects.
EECs like the ones in Figure 1 can be used to disentangle the two parts of income growth’s effect on the pollution-intensity of household consumption:
The automatic part from richer people’s preferences and
The indirect part from richer countries’ prices or regulations.
Movement along concave EECs represents pollution changes due to innate preferences by richer households for less pollution-intensive mix of goods and services, holding all else equal. The downward shift in the EECs over time represents other society-wide changes such as prices or regulations. According to our estimates, these two effects each explain about half of the reduction in U.S. pollution that comes from shifts in consumption towards less pollution-intensive goods and services. Half of the change related to shifts in consumption comes from movements along concave EECs and half comes from shifting those EECs down over time.
So while there is evidence for some direct, automatic effect of income growth on pollution, that effect comprises only half of the household consumption composition change. And decomposing income growth into movements along and shifts in the EECs represents just one aspect of the environmental consequences of economic growth. The largest portion of the cleanup in the US has come from changes in production technology. Nevertheless, isolating the consumption-related compositional changes in pollution suggests that household-level composition changes have more than offset the increased pollution from growing household incomes, and this is due in roughly equal parts to a direct effect of income growth via consumer preferences and indirect economy-wide changes such as prices and environmental regulations.

Environmental Impact of Economic Growth – The Good Planet
Environmental Impact of Economic Growth
What is the environmental impact of economic growth?
The results of economic growth––increased output and consumption––can equate to detrimental effects on the environment. The impact includes global warming, potential loss of environmental habitats, higher levels of pollution, increased consumption of non-renewable resources, and more. Let’s take a look at some outcomes  in depth:
1: Higher Levels of Pollution
As economic activity rises, so does pollution, which is measured by CO2 emissions. Increased consumption of fossil fuels also leads to higher levels of pollution, resulting in poor air quality and soot. However, there are actions taken to limit the negative aftermaths; for instance,the Clean Air Acts limit the burning of coal in city centres.
Scientists have also stated that the accumulation of CO2 emissions contribute to global warming and turbulence. Moreover, the spread of pollution can damage land and seas as well as cause health problems.
2: Loss of Biodiversity
Economic growth leads to resource depletion and habitat transformation. Therefore, it can also lead to the loss of biodiversity.
3: Long-term Toxins
Economic growth generates long-term waste and toxins. An example of this would be plastic; economic growth has led to the increased use of plastic. Because plastic is a type of material that when disposed of does not degrade, it has a destructive impact on the seas––not just the habitat but also to the wildlife.
However, not all aspects of economic growth are harmful towards the environment. With a greater average income, individuals are more willing to spend resources to protect the environment and alleviate the influence of pollution.
There’s even a theory that up to a certain point, economic growth worsens the environment, but after that the economy can lead to a better environment. For instance, both the United States and the United Kingdom have reduced CO2 emissions since the 1980s.
Additionally, an economy with higher average incomes can promote cleaner technology that limits air pollution.
Overall, to answer the question, the economy can have both positive and negative environmental impacts. There are plenty of theories going around on the relationship between the two.

Water pollution can reduce economic growth by a third: World Bank

Water pollution can reduce economic growth by a third: World Bank
Fishing boats sit in trash-filled waters in Banda Aceh, Indonesia on July 16, 2019
Heavily polluted water is reducing economic growth by up to a third in some countries, a World Bank report said Tuesday, calling for action to address human and environmental harm.
The report relied on what the Bank said was the biggest-ever database assembled on global water quality using monitoring stations, satellite data and machine learning models.
"Clean water is a key factor for economic growth. Deteriorating water quality is stalling economic growth, worsening health conditions, reducing food production, and exacerbating poverty in many countries," said World Bank Group President David Malpass.
The report found that when Biological Oxygen Demand—an index of the degree of organic pollution and a proxy for overall water pollution—crosses a threshold of 8 milligrams per liter, GDP growth in downstream regions drops by 0.83 percentage points, about a third for the mean growth rate of 2.33 percent used in the study.
This is because of impacts on health, agriculture, and ecosystems and a "stark indication that there often trade-offs between benefits of economic production and environmental quality, and that the externalities... can be circular," the report said.
A key contributor to poor water quality is nitrogen, essential for agricultural production but which leaches into rivers and oceans where it creates hypoxia and dead zones, and in the air where it forms nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas.
The report said that early exposure of children to nitrates affects their growth and brain development, reducing their health and earning potential.
For every additional kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare, yields may rise up to five percent, but childhood stunting increases as much as 19 percent and future adult earnings fall by up to two percent compared to those not affected.
And increased salinity as a result of manmade pressures such as irrigation, stormwater runoff, leaching of fertilizer, and urban wastewater discharge is pushing down agricultural yields.
The report estimated enough food is lost to saline water each year to feed 170 million people, about the population of Bangladesh.
The authors divided their recommendations into three main areas: information campaigns to raise awareness, prevention efforts to stem some of the worst problems and investments to treat pollution once it has occurred, with more modern technologies like reverse-osmosis offering new pathways.

Environmental impact of economic growth - Economics Help
Environmental impact of economic growth
29 March 2021 by Tejvan Pettinger
Economic growth means an increase in real output (real GDP). Therefore, with increased output and consumption we are likely to see costs imposed on the environment. The environmental impact of economic growth includes the increased consumption of non-renewable resources, higher levels of pollution, global warming and the potential loss of environmental habitats.
However, not all forms of economic growth cause damage to the environment. With rising real incomes, individuals have a greater ability to devote resources to protecting the environment and mitigate the harmful effects of pollution. Also, economic growth caused by improved technology can enable higher output with less pollution.
Classic trade-off between economic growth and environmental resources
This PPF curve shows a trade-off between non-renewable resources and consumption. As we increase consumption, the opportunity cost implies a lower stock of non-renewable resources.
For example, the pace of global economic growth in the past century has led to a decline in the availability of natural resources such as forests (cut down for agriculture/demand for wood)
A decline in sources of oil/coal/gas
Loss of fishing stocks – due to overfishing
Loss of species diversity – damage to natural resources has led to species extinction.
External costs of economic growth
Pollution. Increased consumption of fossil fuels can lead to immediate problems such as poor air quality and soot, (London smogs of the 1950s). Some of the worst problems of burning fossil fuels have been mitigated by Clean Air Acts – which limit the burning of coal in city centres. Showing that economic growth can be consistent with reducing a certain type of pollution.
Less visible more diffuse pollution. While smogs were a very clear and obvious danger, the effects of increased CO2 emissions are less immediately obvious and therefore there is less incentive for policymakers to tackle. Scientists state the accumulation of CO2 emissions have contributed to global warming and more volatile weather. All this suggests economic growth is increasing long-term environmental costs – not just for the present moment, but future generations.
This graph shows CO2 emissions per capita. It shows a 66% rise in per capita pollution between 1960 and 2014. The total emissions are also higher because of population growth. 1960 to 2014 was a period of strong economic growth and despite the development of new technologies, has failed to halt the rise. The last few years 2011 to 2014 show a levelling – this is only a short time range, but could be due to improved global efforts to reduce pollution. (it was also a period of low economic growth in Western economies)
Damage to nature. Air/land/water pollution causes health problems and can damage the productivity of land and seas.
Global warming and volatile weather. Global warming leads to rising sea levels, volatile weather patterns and could cause significant economic costs
Soil erosion. Deforestation resulting from economic development damages soil and makes areas more prone to drought.
Loss of biodiversity. Economic growth leads to resource depletion and loss of biodiversity. This could harm future ‘carrying capacity of ecological systems’ for the economy. Though there is uncertainty about the extent of this cost as the benefit of lost genetic maps may never be known.
Long-term toxins. Economic growth creates long-term waste and toxins, which may have unknown consequences. For example, economic growth has led to increased use of plastic, which when disposed of do not degrade. So there is an ever-increasing stock of plastic in the seas and environment – which is both unsightly but also damaging to wildlife.
U-Shaped curve for economic growth and the environment
One theory of economic growth and the environment is that up to a certain point economic growth worsens the environment, but after that the move to a post-industrial economy – it leads to a better environment.
For example – since 1980, the UK and the US have reduced CO2 emission. The global growth in emissions is coming from developing economies.
Another example – In early days of growth, economies tend to burn coal/wood – which cause obvious pollution. But, with higher incomes, an economy can promote cleaner technology which limits this air pollution. However, in a paper “ Economic growth and carrying capacity ” by Kenneth Arrow et al. they caution about this simplistic u-shape. As the authors state:
“Where the environmental costs of economic activity are home by the poor, by future generation, or by other countries, the incentives to correct the problem are likely to be weak”
It may be true there is a Kuznets curve for some types of visible pollutants, but it is less true of more diffuse and less visible pollutants. (like CO2)
The U-shaped maybe true of pollutants, but not the stock of natural resources; economic growth does not reverse the trend to consume and reduce the quantity of non-renewable resources.
Reducing pollution in one country may lead to the outsourcing of pollution to another, e.g. we import coal from developing economies, effectively exporting our rubbish for recycling and disposal elsewhere.
Environmental policies tend to deal with pressing issues at hand but ignore future intergenerational problems.
Other models of a link between economic growth and environment
Source: “ Economic Growth and the Environment “. (March 2010) Tim Everett, Mallika Ishwaran, Gian Paolo Ansaloni and Alex Rubin
Limits Theory
This suggests that economic growth will damage the environment, and damage will itself start to act as a brake on growth and will force economies to deal with economic damage. In other words, the environment will force us to look after it. For example, if we run down natural resources, their price will rise and this will create an incentive to find alternatives.
New toxics
This is more pessimistic suggesting that economic growth leads to an ever-increasing range of toxic output and problems, some issues may get solved, but they are outweighed by newer and more pressing problems which are difficult if impossible to overturn.
This model has no faith that the free-market will solve the problem because there is no ownership of air quality and many of the effects are piling up on future generations; these future effects cannot be dealt with by the current price mechanism.
Race to the bottom
This suggests that in the early stages of economic growth, there is little concern about the environment and often countries undermined environmental standards to gain a competitive advantage – the incentive to free-ride on others’ efforts. However, as the environment increasingly worsens, it will reluctantly force economies to reduce the worst effects of environmental damage. This will slow down environmental degradation but not reverse past trends.
Economic growth without environmental damage
Some ecologists argue economic growth invariably leads to environmental damage. However, there are economists who argue that economic growth can be consistent with a stable environment and even improvement in the environmental impact. This will involve
A shift from non-renewables to renewables A recent report suggests that renewable energy is becoming cheaper than more damaging forms of energy production such as burning coal and in 2018 – this has led to a 39% drop in new construction starts from 2017, and an 84% drop since 2015.
Social cost pricing. If economic growth causes external costs, economists state it is socially efficient to include the external cost in the price (e.g. carbon tax ). If the tax equals the full external cost, it will lead to a socially efficient outcome and create a strong incentive to promote growth that minimises external costs.
Treat the environment as a public good. Environmental policy which protects the environment, through regulations, government ownership and limits on external costs can, in theory, enable economic growth to be based on protection of the environmental resource.
Technological development. It is possible to replace cars running on petrol with cars running on electricity from renewable sources. This enables an increase in output, but also a reduction in the environmental impact. There are numerous possible technological developments which can enable greater efficiency, lower costs and less environmental damage.
Include quality of life and environmental indicators in economic statistics. Rather than targetting GDP, environmental economists argue we should target a wider range of living standards + living standards + environmental indicators. (e.g. Genuine Progress Indicators GPI)

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let me go through them one by one to see what insights they offer on the relationship between economic growth and pollution.

First up, Doc 1 from the St. Louis Fed's On the Economy blog. It's titled "The Effects of Economic Growth on Pollution." The authors discuss how pollution increases with economic growth but at a slower rate. They mention that in the U.S., CO2 emissions and greenhouse gas emissions have increased slower than GDP per capita, indicating a relative decoupling of pollution from economic growth. They also note that during the Great Recession, greenhouse gas emissions declined while GDP and population increased, suggesting a negative correlation between economic activity and pollution levels.

This seems promising. It suggests that economic growth doesn't necessarily lead to proportional increases in pollution, which might contradict the idea that pollution is purely an economic failure. Maybe there's a way for economies to grow without causing as much environmental harm.

Next, Doc 2 from the World Economic Forum discusses whether economic growth reduces pollution. It references the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory, which posits that as countries develop, pollution increases up to a certain point and then decreases. The article argues that this relationship is more complex and that while some pollution metrics may decrease with higher income, others don't follow this pattern.

The authors introduce the concept of Environmental Engel Curves (EECs), which show how household pollution changes with income, holding other factors constant. They find that richer households consume less pollution-intensive goods, but also that there are economy-wide changes contributing to pollution reduction.

This suggests that there might be both direct and indirect effects of income growth on pollution, and that policies can play a role in shaping these outcomes. So, perhaps it's not just economic failure but also policy success or failure that determines pollution levels.

Doc 3 is from a website called The Good Planet. It lists several negative environmental impacts of economic growth, including higher pollution levels, loss of biodiversity, and long-term toxins like plastics. However, it also acknowledges that higher incomes can lead to greater willingness to spend on environmental protection and that some countries have reduced CO2 emissions despite economic growth.

This seems balanced, recognizing both the problems and potential solutions associated with economic growth and environmental sustainability.

Doc 4 is a news article from Phys.org summarizing a World Bank report on water pollution and its impact on economic growth. The report suggests that heavily polluted water can reduce economic growth by up to a third in some countries due to health, agriculture, and ecosystem impacts.

This flips the script a bit, showing that poor environmental quality can hinder economic growth, implying that protecting the environment can be essential for sustaining economic development.

Lastly, Doc 5 is another article from Economics Help, which delves into various aspects of how economic growth affects the environment. It discusses external costs, resource depletion, pollution, and global warming. The article also mentions the possibility of a Kuznets curve for some pollutants but notes that it may not hold for all environmental issues, especially those with global implications like CO2 emissions.

Furthermore, it explores the idea that economic growth can be compatible with environmental protection through measures like renewable energy, pollution taxes, and better environmental policies.

From these sources, I'm starting to see a nuanced picture. On one hand, economic growth often leads to increased pollution and environmental degradation due to higher consumption and production activities. This can be seen as an economic failure if the negative externalities aren't accounted for in market prices or regulated appropriately.

On the other hand, higher incomes can lead to greater demand for environmental quality and the ability to invest in cleaner technologies and better regulations. There's also evidence that as economies develop, they may become more efficient and less polluting per unit of output.

So, is global pollution solely an economic failure? Probably not. It's a complex interplay of economic activities, technological capabilities, and policy choices. Economic failure might be one component, particularly in cases where markets fail to internalize environmental costs, but it's not the only factor.

Perhaps a more accurate statement is that global pollution reflects a failure to achieve sustainable economic growth. It indicates that current patterns of production and consumption are not environmentally sustainable in the long run.

I think to fully answer this question, I need to consider the role of policies and regulations in managing the environmental impacts of economic growth. Maybe I should look into case studies where strong environmental policies have mitigated pollution despite economic growth, or conversely, where lax regulations have led to severe environmental degradation.

Alternatively, I could explore the concept of decoupling—where economic growth doesn't lead to increased resource use and pollution. Are there real-world examples of countries achieving absolute decoupling, where both the economy and environmental impact grow positively?

Let me consider searching for more information on decoupling and sustainable growth.

Eco-economic decoupling - Wikipedia
Eco-economic decoupling
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
For other uses, see Decoupling (disambiguation).
In economic and environmental fields, decoupling refers to an economy that would be able to grow without corresponding increases in environmental pressure. In many economies, increasing production (GDP) currently raises pressure on the environment. An economy that would be able to sustain economic growth while reducing the amount of resources such as water or fossil fuels used and delink environmental deterioration at the same time would be said to be decoupled. [1] Environmental pressure is often measured using emissions of pollutants, and decoupling is often measured by the emission intensity of economic output. [2] Examples of absolute long-term decoupling are rare, but recently some industrialized countries have decoupled GDP growth from both production- and, to a lesser extent, consumption-based CO2 emissions. [3]
In 2002, the OECD defined the term as follows:
the term 'decoupling' refers to breaking the link between "environmental bads" and "economic goods." It explains this as having rates of increasing wealth greater than the rates of increasing impacts. [4]

Importance of the issue of decoupling[edit]
Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow in size and prosperity, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators. [5] There is a concern that, unless resource use is checked, modern global civilization will follow the path of ancient civilizations that collapsed through overexploitation of their resource base. [6] [7] While conventional economics is concerned largely with economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources, ecological economics has the explicit goal of sustainable scale (rather than continual growth), fair distribution and efficient allocation, in that order. [8] [9] The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states that "business cannot succeed in societies that fail." [10]
In economic and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality.[9] [11] An economy that can sustain GDP growth without harming the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate.
In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. [12] The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year.
Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology. [13]
There are conflicting views on whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit GDP) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution. [14] [15] On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. [16] [17] Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., second law of thermodynamics) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions. [18] Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by Herman Daly and others in the ecological economics community.
The OECD 2019 Report "Environment at a Glance Indicators – Climate change" points out that the issue of diminishing GHG emissions while maintaining GDP growth is a major challenge for the forthcoming years. [19]
Policies[edit]
Policies have been proposed for creating the conditions that enable widespread investments in resource productivity. According to Mark Patton a global leading expert, Such potential policies include the raising of resource prices in line with increases in energy or resource productivity, a shift in revenue-raising onto resource prices through resource taxation at source or in relation to product imports, with recycling of revenues back to the economy, ... [20]
Technologies[edit]
Several technologies have been described in the Decoupling 2 report, including:
Technologies to save energy (technologies directly reducing fossil fuel consumption, saving electricity in industry, reducing fossil-fuel demand in transportation, ...)
Technologies saving metals and minerals (technologies reducing metal use, saving materials from waste streams, ...)
Technologies saving freshwater and biotic resources (technologies saving freshwater extraction , protecting soil fertility, saving biotic resources, ...) [21]
Documentation[edit]
In 2014, the same International Resource Panel published a second report, "Decoupling 2", [21] which "highlights existing technological possibilities and opportunities for both developing and developed countries to accelerate decoupling and reap the environmental and economic benefits of increased resource productivity." The lead coordinating author of this report was Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker .
In 2016, the International Resource Panel published a report indicating that "global material productivity has declined since about the year 2000 and the global economy now needs more materials per unit of GDP than it did at the turn of the century" as a result of shifts in production from high-income to middle-income countries. [22] That is to say, the growth of material flows has been stronger than the growth of gross domestic product. [22] This is the opposite of decoupling, a situation that some people call overcoupling .
Terminology[edit]
Relative and absolute decoupling[edit]
Tim Jackson, author of Prosperity Without Growth, stresses the importance of differentiating between relative and absolute decoupling:
Relative decoupling refers to a decline in the ecological intensity per unit of economic output. In this situation, resource impacts decline relative to the GDP, which could itself still be rising. [23]
Absolute decoupling refers to a situation in which resource impacts decline in absolute terms. Resource efficiencies must increase at least as fast as economic output does and must continue to improve as the economy grows, if absolute decoupling is to occur. [23]
Jackson points out that an economy can correctly claim that it has relatively decoupled its economy in terms of energy inputs per unit of GDP. However, in this situation, total environmental impacts would still be increasing, albeit at a slower pace of growth than in GDP. [23]
Jackson uses this distinction to caution against technology-optimists who use the term decoupling as an "escape route from the dilemma of growth." [23] He points out that "there is quite a lot of evidence to support the existence of [relative decoupling]" in global economies, however "evidence for [absolute decoupling] is harder to find." [23]
Similarly, ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly stated in 1991: [24]
It is true that "In 1969 a dollar's worth of GNP was produced with one-half the materials used to produce a dollar's worth of GNP in 1900, in constant dollars." Nevertheless, over the same period total materials by consumption increased by 400 percent.
Relative and absolute decoupling [25]
Relative decoupling
Absolute decoupling
Description
Decline in the resource intensity per unit of economic output
Resource use decline in absolute terms while economic output rise
Example
Increased carbon efficiency (but lower than economic growth)
Increased carbon efficiency higher than economic growth
Link with I = PAT
Carbon intensity decline (but ≤ population + income growths)
Carbon intensity decline > (population growth + income growth)
Evidence for carbon emissions
Yes: 34% decrease between 1965 and 2015 (CO 2 /$GDP)
No: 300% increase between 1965 and 2015 (absolute CO 2 emissions)
Evidence for resource extraction
No: resource use increases more than GDP (1990-2015)
No: resource use increases overall (1990-2015)
Between 1990 and 2015, the carbon intensity per $GDP declined of 0.6 percent per year (relative decoupling), but the population grew of 1.3 percent per year and the income per capita also grew of 1.3 percent per year. [25] That is to say, the carbon emissions grew of 1.3 + 1.3 − 0.6 = 2 percent per year, leading to a 62% increase in 25 years (the data reflect no absolute decoupling). [25] According to Tim Jackson:[25]
There is no simple formula that leads from the efficiency of the market to the meeting of ecological targets. Simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will allow us to stabilise the climate are nothing short of delusional. [...] The analysis in this chapter suggests that it is entirely fanciful to suppose that 'deep' emission and resource cuts can be achieved without confronting the structure of market economies.
On economic growth and environmental degradation, Donella Meadows wrote: [26]
Growth has costs as well as benefits, and we typically don't count the costs – among which are poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, and so on – the whole list of problems that we are trying to solve with growth! What is needed is much slower growth, very different kinds of growth, and in some cases no growth or negative growth. The world's leaders are correctly fixated on economic growth as the answer to virtually all problems, but they're pushing it with all their might in the wrong direction.
Resource and impact decoupling[edit]
Resource decoupling refers to reducing the rate of resource use per unit of economic activity. The "dematerialization" is based on using less material, energy, water and land resources for the same economic input. Impact decoupling required increasing economic output while reducing negative environmental impacts. These impacts arise from the extraction of resources. [27]
Lack of evidence for decoupling[edit]
There is no empirical evidence supporting the existence of an eco-economic decoupling near the scale needed to avoid environmental degradation, and it is unlikely to happen in the future. Environmental pressures can only be reduced by rethinking green growth policies, where a sufficiency approach complements greater efficiency. [28] [29]
According to scientist and author Vaclav Smil, "Without a biosphere in a good shape, there is no life on the planet. It’s very simple. That’s all you need to know. The economists will tell you we can decouple growth from material consumption, but that is total nonsense. The options are quite clear from the historical evidence. If you don’t manage decline, then you succumb to it and you are gone. The best hope is that you find some way to manage it." [30]
In 2020, a meta-analysis of 180 scientific studies notes that there is "No evidence of the kind of decoupling needed for ecological sustainability" and that "in the absence of robust evidence, the goal of decoupling rests partly on faith". [31]

Abstract
The argument that human society can decouple economic growth—defined as growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—from growth in environmental impacts is appealing. If such decoupling is possible, it means that GDP growth is a sustainable societal goal. Here we show that the decoupling concept can be interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and environmental impact. The simple model is compared to historical data and modelled projections to demonstrate that growth in GDP ultimately cannot be decoupled from growth in material and energy use. It is therefore misleading to develop growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is possible. We also note that GDP is increasingly seen as a poor proxy for societal wellbeing. GDP growth is therefore a questionable societal goal. Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural assets, but only by discarding GDP growth as the goal in favor of more comprehensive measures of societal wellbeing.

Introduction
The perpetually growing economy is generally regarded as a viable and desirable societal objective [1 – 4 ]. Whilst ‘infinite growth’ may not be the words used to characterize and exhort a perpetually growing economy, they are nonetheless an accurate characterization of the objective. The words in current fashion for defending the viability of a perpetually growing economy are phrases such as ‘green growth’, ‘dematerialization’, and ‘decoupling’ [5 – 9 ]. The decades old question ‘ Is economic growth environmentally sustainable ?’ remains contested despite its apparent simplicity. The Limits to Growth [10] was a seminal work that warned of the consequences of exponential growth with finite resources. The World3 models underpinning the Limits to Growth analysis were validated using actual data after twenty and thirty years [11,12 ]. A further independent evaluation of the projections of the World3 models showed that our actual trajectory since 1972 has closely matched the ‘Business as Usual’ scenario [13 ]. Increasing recognition of the causes and consequences of climate change have generated a great deal of doubt regarding the feasibility of simultaneously pursing economic growth and preventing and/or mitigating climate change [14 – 18 ]. Contemporary work in this broad area of assessing anthropogenic impact on the planet suggests that several ‘Planetary Boundaries’ have been crossed [19 ].
The question as to whether human society can decouple economic growth–defined as growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)–from environmental impacts has not been settled. The decoupling debate itself is polarized with a preponderance of neo-classical economists on one side (decoupling is viable) and ecological economists on the other (decoupling is not viable) [20 ]. The divide over the compatibility of economic growth and environmental limits extends into the general public [2] with substantial polarization in ideas of decoupling, dematerialization, and limits to growth.
Settling the debate has far reaching policy implications. Decoupling is increasingly being described in popular press as a viable policy objective [21,22 ]. Decoupling has been incorporated into international indicators of sustainable development [23] and policy objectives such as the United Nations’ ‘Sustainable Development Goals’ [24 ]. If decoupling is possible, then these policies are valid sustainable goals; however, if decoupling is shown to be nonviable then society will need to shift away from the current ‘infinite growth’ model.
Decoupling is defined as either ‘relative’ (aka ‘weak’) or ‘absolute’ (aka ‘strong’). Relative decoupling refers to higher rates of economic growth than rates of growth in material and energy consumption and environmental impact. As a result, relative decoupling implies a gain in efficiency rather than removal of the link between impact and GDP. Recent trends (1990 to 2012) for GDP [25 ], material use [26] and energy use [27] in different countries and regions exhibit different behavior (Fig 1 ). In China, relative decoupling has occurred as GDP (market prices, in current US$) increased by a factor of more than 20 over the 22-year period, while energy use rose by a factor of slightly more than four and material use by almost five. Germany, meanwhile, exhibited slower GDP growth than China, but at the same time reduced energy use by 10% and total material use by 40%. The OECD follows a similar story to Germany, albeit with flat rather than falling energy and material consumption. Although Germany and the OECD give hope that absolute decoupling may be achievable, at the global level we see only relative decoupling with energy and material use increasing by 54% and 66% over the 22 years, respectively.

Similar evidence to that in Fig 1, showing apparent decoupling of GDP from specific resources, has been shown throughout much of the OECD [28 ]. However, there are several limitations to the inference of decoupling from national or regional data. There are three distinct mechanisms by which the illusion of decoupling may be presented as a reality when in fact it is not actually taking place at all: 1) substitution of one resource for another; 2) the financialization of one or more components of GDP that involves increasing monetary flows without a concomitant rise in material and/or energy throughput, and 3) the exporting of environmental impact to another nation or region of the world (i.e. the separation of production and consumption). These illusory forms of decoupling are described with respect to energy by our colleague [29 ].
An additional mechanism of decoupling is associated with growing inequality of income and wealth, which can allow GDP to grow overall while the majority of workers do not see a real gain in income [30 ]. This growth in inequality can manifest as higher GDP without a proportional increase in material and energy flow (i.e. relative decoupling) when a wealthy minority of the population derives the largest fraction of GDP growth but does not necessarily increase their level of consumption with as much demand for energy and materials [31 ]. In such cases, at the aggregate level decoupling would be observed, but it is doubtful that such unequal sharing of growth in GDP represents an improvement in wellbeing.
At the World aggregate level, Fig 1 shows relative decoupling with a growing gap between GDP and resource consumption. In the context of reaching planetary boundaries and global environmental limits, however, relative decoupling will be insufficient to maintain a GDP growth-oriented human civilization. The only way to achieve truly sustainable growth would be via permanent absolute decoupling. Absolute decoupling theoretically occurs when environmental impacts are reduced while economic growth continues. While relative decoupling has been observed in multiple countries, absolute decoupling remains elusive [32 – 34 ]. According to one study [35] no country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50 years. Another study [36] reports that population growth and increases in affluence are overwhelming efficiency improvements at the global scale. They find no evidence for absolute reductions in environmental impacts, and little evidence to date even for significant relative decoupling.
It should be noted that technological advances can lead to absolute decoupling for specific types of impact [37 ]. It is possible, for instance, to substitute a polluting activity with a non-polluting activity, and notable examples have included the removal of tetraethyl lead from automotive fuel and CFCs from refrigerants and propellants. It is also possible to envisage a scenario in which GDP growth is decoupled from the use of fossil fuels and related CO 2 emissions by switching to 100% renewable energy, but this is not the same as decoupling GDP growth from energy use. In the context of this study, we are primarily interested in fundamental resources (matter and energy) as the foundations of economic activity.
In the current paper, we show that decoupling scenarios can be interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and environmental impact. The simple model was calibrated against published data derived from sophisticated predictive studies of decoupling, and used to develop a long-term prognosis of environmental impact under continued GDP growth. The results are then used to draw conclusions about the long-term viability of GDP growth as a societal goal.
Model Derivation
We use a simple mathematical model to develop insights into decoupling behavior. We start with the IPAT equation [38 – 40 ], which is a basic formulation of environmental impact I as a function of economic activity: (1) where P is population, A is affluence (GDP per capita in $/person/year) and T, as originally formulated, represents “technology”. More precisely, however, T should be viewed as the economic intensity of a particular resource or pollutant, and therefore both T and I will have different units depending on which resource or pollutant is considered. For energy, appropriate units for T may be joules per $ of GDP; for material use T may be kilograms per $ of GDP. The terms T and I can–and should–thus be evaluated separately, with appropriate units, for individual resources such as farming land, fresh water and energy resources, and/or pollutant emissions such as sulphur dioxide, lead, or carbon dioxide.
To test the hypothesis that continual GDP growth can be sustained, we only require a scenario in which GDP increases exponentially. The economy (as GDP) can thus be simplified to G = PA, leading to I = GT where I and T are the impact and economic intensity, respectively, of resource or pollutant j. A simple case is one in which both population (P) and affluence (A) are increasing exponentially, but other combinations (e.g. stationary population with rising affluence) could achieve the same result of rising GDP. There are, of course, scenarios that could lead to falling GDP (e.g. declining population with constant affluence, or both falling) but our investigation is directed explicitly at testing the sustainability of continual economic growth as a societal goal. As such, we assume G at time t is given by: (2) where G 0 is the initial GDP at time t = 0, and k is the growth rate per year. Hence, impact (for resource or pollutant j) over time is given as: (3)
If there is no technological change to reduce a particular impact (i.e. T = constant; no decoupling), the use of resources or pollutant emissions will rise exponentially, in keeping with GDP growth. For absolute decoupling from resource or pollutant j, T must decrease exponentially at the same rate as GDP growth such that I remains constant in time, i.e.: (4) where T ,0 is the initial level of economic intensity of resource or pollutant j.
Put simply, absolute decoupling from resource or pollutant j requires T to decrease by at least the same annual percentage as the economy is growing. For example, if k = 0.03 (steady 3% p.a. economic growth), T must reduce 20-fold over 100 years, 100-fold over 150 years, and 500-fold over 200 years, and continue this trend of exponential reduction as long as the economy is growing. If T were to decrease at a faster rate than GDP growth, the impact I would decline.
For non-substitutable resources such as land, water, raw materials and energy, we argue that whilst efficiency gains may be possible, there are minimum requirements for these resources that are ultimately governed by physical realities: for instance the photosynthetic limit to plant productivity and maximum trophic conversion efficiencies for animal production govern the minimum land required for agricultural output; physiological limits to crop water use efficiency govern minimum agricultural water use, and the upper limits to energy and material efficiencies govern minimum resource throughput required for economic production. Therefore a more appropriate formulation of Eq (4) is to allow T to decrease to an ultimate value, Tult ≥ 0, as follows: (5) where T,ult is the ultimate resource use intensity, and r is the rate of exponential decline, for resource or pollutant j. In cases where decoupling is occurring, T,ult < T ,0. However, cases where resource use intensity is increasing towards an upper limit can be accommodated with T,ult > T ,0.
The nature of decoupling behavior for different types of resource can be readily predicted from the relationships between r, k, T,ult and T ,0 as summarized in Table 1. It is only those resources or pollutants for which r > k and T,ult < T ,0 (i.e. efficiency gains are possible and can be achieved faster than the economy is growing) that a period of decoupling can be expected.

Model Application
A recent predictive study [41] concluded that Australia could–through adoption of specific policies– “achieve strong economic growth to 2050 … in scenarios where environmental pressures fall or are stable” (this study is referred to as “H-D” hereafter). That paper summarized the results of a significant project, the 2015 Australian National Outlook [42] published by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and represents a high-profile, contemporary study in decoupling. In all of their modelled scenarios, both population and gross national income per capita increased. In their strong abatement scenario (called “Stretch”), various forms of decoupling behavior were predicted. We will use the Stretch scenario from H-D as a case study in decoupling, and will use Eq (5) to further explore the behavior of energy and material use and implications for longer-term impact. The data used in H-D’s historical and projected scenarios are all available in their Supplementary Information files that accompanied their original publication. Likewise, the data and model results for the following analysis can all be found in the S1 File accompanying this paper.
We begin by calibrating the decline rate r from Eq (5) against H-D’s historical energy use (j = 1) and material extraction (j = 2). The term T for each resource is found by dividing GDP (G) by resource use (I) on a yearly timestep. For energy, units are MJ per thousand $AUD (2010). T 1,0 = 3.783, equal to the value of T 1 in the year 1980. The ultimate resource use intensity T 1, ult is unknown, and depends on future technological advances. To account for this uncertainty, three scenarios are adopted: high decoupling (T 1, ult = 0.25 T 1 (2010) = 0.704), medium decoupling (Tult = 0.5 T 1 (2010) = 1.408) and low decoupling (Tult = 0.75 T 1 (2010) = 2.113). Under each of the three T 1, ult scenarios, Eq (5) is used to predict T 1, and is calibrated by varying the single unknown parameter (the decline rate, r 1) to give the best fit between our T 1 (predicted) and T 1 (historical) derived from H-D’s data. The calibration was performed using the free statistical package “R” (https://www.r-project.org) with the in-built Non-Linear Least Squares function.
All three scenarios reproduce the observed downward trend in T 1. Calibrated declines rates with standard error (in brackets) were 1.24% (± 0.05%), 1.70% (± 0.07%) and 2.66% (± 0.13%) for high, medium and low respectively. The result is a simple calibrated model that can be used to project forward based on recent trends, for the purpose of comparing against the more complex modelling scenarios from H-D. The results are shown in Fig 2(A), with the modelled T 1 values projected to 2050. The decoupling predicted by H-D is also shown (taking T 1 as their predicted impact divided by their predicted GDP). Clearly H-D predict stronger decoupling than our strongest case. In terms of the simplified IPAT model, even for our most optimistic T 1, ult scenario, this implies a change to a greater decline rate than can be obtained merely by calibrating against historical trends.

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164733.g002
In the case of material extraction, T 2 has been increasing over recent years; in other words, according to H-D’s historical data, material use has not been on a decoupling trajectory in Australia. This is not unexpected, reflecting Australia’s strong dependence on its extractive industries. However, it means that in order to obtain a good fit to historical data, T 2, ult must be greater than T 2,0. The units of T 2 are tonnes of material extracted per thousand $AUD (2010), and T 2,0 = 1.091 in the year 1980. Three scenarios are adopted as an upper bound to future material intensity: low (T 2, ult = 1.25 T 2 (2010) = 1.513), medium (T 2, ult = 1.50 T 2 (2010) = 1.815) and high (T 2, ult = 2.00 T 2 (2010) = 2.420). As before, the model is calibrated by finding the decline rate r 2 for each T 2, ult scenario. The scenarios calibrate well in all three scenarios with r 2 = 2.75% (± 0.47%), 1.36% (± 0.22%) and 0.68% (± 0.11%) for low, medium and high T 2, ult scenarios respectively. Fig 2(B) shows the historical and modelled T 2 values, plus H-D’s projection to 2050. The profound deviation from long-term trends reflects the assumptions embedded within H-D’s Stretch scenario, which anticipates major policy changes and a shift toward very different forms of production.
The results of calibrating Eq (5) to historical data are inconclusive; uncertainty in T 1, ult and T 2, ult makes long-term projections unreliable. In any case, historical observations of decoupling at national levels are fraught, for the reasons articulated earlier. We conclude that simplistically extrapolating historical trends is not a reliable technique for projecting future decoupling behavior. Moreover, the sophisticated analysis of H-D suggests that deviations from historical trends in T may be plausible, as shown in Figs 2 and 3. Hence from here onward we will focus on the Stretch scenario from H-D and assume it is a plausible future of rapid technological development and proactive policy settings, which could lead to rapid decoupling from energy and material use.

Circles represent H-D values for T (taken as I / GDP) plotted every three years, and solid coloured lines represent T modelled by Eq (5 ), calibrating r and setting T,ult = 0.5 T (2050). Around each solid line is a coloured band (most visible for (a) energy) representing the 95% confidence interval for r. Dashed black lines represent modelled T when both r and T,ult are calibrated.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164733.g003
In order to re-calibrate Eq (5) to create a more useful long-term projection, we use the period 2015–2050 in H-D’s Stretch scenario. The scenario already contains embedded assumptions regarding strong efficiency gains (30% drop in energy intensity and almost 70% drop in material intensity by 2050). As with the historical calibration, T 1 and T 2 are taken as H-D’s predicted energy and material use, I 1 and I 2 respectively, divided by their predicted GDP. We adopt a single T,ult scenario for each resource, and arbitrarily assume resource use intensity can be reduced to 50% of the T attained by H-D’s model in 2050, giving values of T 1, ult = 0.881 MJ per thousand $AUD and T 2, ult = 0.139 tonnes per thousand $AUD. The decline rates r are calibrated in the same manner as above.
Fig 3 shows the calibrated model runs, with a projection to 2100. Calibrated decline rates are r 1 = 2.06% (± 0.12%) and r 2 = 5.59% (± 0.11%) for final energy demand and material extraction, respectively. A 95% confidence interval on each T prediction is obtained by performing additional model runs using upper and lower values for r (mean ± 1.96 × SE); this is included as a coloured band around each solid coloured line in Fig 3, but is only clearly visible on T 1, being too narrow to see on T 2. Finally, to check the appropriateness of our T,ult scenarios, a further calibration is performed by varying both r and T,ult. This allows us to estimate the ultimate resource intensity if technology followed the trend projected by H-D, giving calibrated values T 1, ult = 1.64 (± 0.05) and T 2, ult = 0.19 (± 0.01). From this we can see that our projection is more optimistic than the Stretch scenario of H-D (which was their most optimistic scenario), and we proceed on the basis that our modelled conditions must be considered extremely favorable to decoupling.
Fig 4 shows values of T inferred for current energy and total material use across a range of countries, in order to provide some context to the future decoupling scenarios being modelled. It is clear that by this measure, Australia is already one of the most energy-efficient economies in the world. H-D project that by 2050 Australia will improve further, to be on par with Denmark and Sweden today, and our chosen T 1, ult value assumes Australia can ultimately become more energy-efficient (per unit GDP) than any country on the planet today. With respect to material use, H-D project that by 2050 Australia will have completely transformed from being one of the most materially intensive economies today, to being one of mid-range material intensity (by current measures). Our assumption of a 50% further reduction in T 2, ult would place Australia's ultimate material efficiency at a level equivalent to high-income countries today that have relatively low dependence on extractive industries, such as New Zealand. These assumptions can indeed be viewed as an extremely optimistic scenario of future technological improvement.

The calibrated model can now be used to explore the potential future evolution of resource use under continued economic growth. For this projection, the growth rate k = 2.41%, which is the average GDP growth rate from 2015 to 2050 in H-D’s Stretch scenario. Fig 5 shows the modelled projection of impact I to 2100. Projected GDP at the end of the century is 7.7 times its 2015 level. Material extractions and final energy demand in 2100 are up 29% (95% confidence interval 28.4–30.7%) and 256% (95% confidence interval 241–273%) respectively, relative to 2015 levels. Considering the embedded optimistic assumptions for T,ult, this result is a robust rebuttal to the claim of absolute decoupling. Fig 5 also includes the projections for I using the model in which both r and Tult were calibrated (i.e. most closely reproducing the trends in H-D’s projections). Using that model, energy demand in 2100 would be five times higher than in 2015, and material extraction would rise by 71%.

Fig 5.
Projections to 2100 of (a) GDP, (b) final energy demand, and (c) material extractions. Circles represent H-D values for I at 3-year intervals, and solid coloured lines represent I modelled using Eqs (3) and (5) on a yearly time step, with r calibrated and T,ult set at 0.5 T (2050). Around each solid line is a coloured band (most visible for (b) energy) representing the 95% confidence interval for r. Dashed black lines represent modelled T when both r and T,ult are calibrated.

Importantly, as T moves towards a constant value (T,ult ), the growth rate of I approaches the economic growth rate k. Thus, whilst in 2015 the growth rates for material extraction and final energy demand (-1.87% and +1.47% respectively) are all less than the 2.41% economic growth rate, by 2100 these have changed to +2.16% and +1.89% and by 2150, both I 1 and I 2 exhibit growth rates close to the economic growth rate (2.42% and 2.21% respectively).
On the basis of this simple modeling, we conclude that decoupling of GDP growth from resource use, whether relative or absolute, is at best only temporary. Permanent decoupling (absolute or relative) is impossible for essential, non-substitutable resources because the efficiency gains are ultimately governed by physical limits.
Discussion & Conclusions
Our model demonstrates that growth in GDP ultimately cannot plausibly be decoupled from growth in material and energy use, demonstrating categorically that GDP growth cannot be sustained indefinitely. It is therefore misleading to develop growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is possible. However, we also note that GDP has been shown to be a poor proxy for societal wellbeing, something it was never designed to measure, and GDP growth is therefore a questionable long-term societal goal in any case. The mounting costs of “uneconomic growth” [43] suggest that the pursuit of decoupling–if it were possible–in order to sustain GDP growth would be a misguided effort.
Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural assets, but only by discarding the goal of GDP growth in favor of more comprehensive measures of societal wellbeing [44 ]. The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recently agreed to by all UN countries, represent a much broader conception of the goals of society. These goals include eliminating poverty and hunger, reducing inequality, protecting and restoring the climate, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Only one of the 17 goals mentions GDP growth, but it is qualified as “inclusive and sustainable growth”. Certainly, GDP growth over the last several decades has not been inclusive–inequality is getting worse in most countries. For GDP growth to be sustainable it would have to be decoupled from energy and material use and environmental impacts. We have shown that there is little evidence that GDP growth can be decoupled in the long-term (i.e. it is not sustainable).
If GDP growth as a societal goal is unsustainable, then it is ultimately necessary for nations and the world to transition to a steady or declining GDP scenario. We contend that it will be easier to start this transition now while there is still capacity for technological gains, rather than go down the path of decoupling and be forced to make a transition post 2050 when we are closer to the theoretical limits to technological efficiency gains. We argue that now is the time to recognize the biophysical limits, and to begin the overdue task of re-orienting society around a more achievable and satisfying set of goals than simply growing forever [44,45 ].

1. Introduction
Since the “Our Common Future” report was published in the late 80s (Brundtland, 1987 ), the close and inverse relation between the progress of humankind and the global environmental quality has been placed on the spotlight. The inefficient economic growth of the last century increased the anthropogenic pressures to the environment, negatively affecting the global climate (IPCC, 2018) as well as the provision of ecosystem services (TEEB, 2011) leading humankind to transgress several “planetary boundaries” (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015 ). Indeed, human development has brought several irreversible changes to the Earth system, determining that current geological age is called Anthropocene (Crutzen, 2002; Steffen et al., 2007 ). To tackle such unsustainable track, the United Nations (UN) developed as blueprint the Millennium Development Goals (UNDP, 2006) and, later, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015 ). The 17 SDGs address global challenges from food insecurity and poverty to innovation and climate action, with interconnected objectives and targets. Among them, achieving a sustainable production and consumption (SDG12) is one of the main goals towards facing environmental degradation and improving resource efficiency (UN, 2015 ). Moreover, target 8.4 of the SDGs seeks to “improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.”
In this context, the European Union (EU) adopted the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs to set the pathway for transforming EU production and consumption in “a low-carbon, climate resilient, resource efficient and circular economy” (EC, 2016a ). Besides, EU policies such as the 7 th European Environment Action Program (7 th EAP) (EU, 2013) and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) are driving the achievement of environmental targets. More recently, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan (EC, 2015) and the Bio-Economy Strategy (EC, 2018) have represented a shift of policy-making towards acknowledging more and more the need of an integrated approach of production and consumption when addressing environmental impacts. A responsible and sustainable production and consumption (SCP) (SDG12) would contribute to a more resource-efficient Europe, as proposed in the Roadmap, with an improved resource productivity that decouples the economic growth from resource use and associated environmental impacts (Sala et al., 2016 ).
1.1. The decoupling of economic growth from resource depletion and environmental impacts as a sustainable pathway
Pursuing a more efficient development, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) urged to decouple economic growth from environmental impacts (UNEP, 2011 ). Decoupling takes place “ when resource use or some environmental pressure either grows at a slower rate than the economic activity that is causing it (relative decoupling) or declines while the economic activity continues to grow (absolute decoupling) ” (IRP, 2017, p.23). Indeed, decoupling can take place at different levels: resource decoupling, environmental pressure decoupling or environmental impact decoupling (Fig. 1 ). Based on the specificity of the underpinning environmental processes, the environmental pressures (e.g. emission or resource use) may exert different impacts (e.g. the emission of two toxic substances may exert different ecotoxicity impacts). Hence, quantitative measures of decoupling may be performed by comparing the economic output (e.g. Gross Domestic Product, GDP) with indicators of resource use (e.g. Domestic Material Consumption, DMC), environmental pressures (e.g., CO 2 emissions) and environmental impacts (e.g., global warming potential). Furthermore, UNEP indicated that human well-being progress should also decouple from the environmental impacts, in line with some authors that proposed using the Human Development Index (HDI) for assessing the progress of environmental policy (van den Bergh and Botzen, 2018) or evaluated human well-being indicators against planetary boundaries to contrast human basic needs and global resource use (O'Neill et al., 2018 ).

Both resource and environmental decoupling have been largely evaluated in the literature, as detailed in the collection of studies in Table 1. While some authors kept a production approach where domestic and territorial flows are considered, a consumption-based approach is key for integrating the trade flows into the decoupling assessment, as embodied impacts due to imports usually displaced to developing countries can greatly contribute to the overall environmental impacts of consumption (Hamilton et al., 2018; Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018; Wood et al., 2018 ). The geographical scope of the studies in literature ranged from global (Bithas and Kalimeris, 2013; Schandl et al., 2016) to specific economic sectors (Li et al., 2017 ). Decoupling assessment was also employed to determine the efficacy of policy implementation, e.g. the Kyoto Protocol in Europe (Diakoulaki and Mandaraka, 2007) and in China (Wang and Yang, 2015 ).

At the global level, Giljum et al. (2014) stressed the need to focus on guaranteeing an absolute decoupling (i.e., decreasing trend of environmental pressures or impacts) that approaches dematerialization and green economy since relative decoupling (i.e., increasing trend of environmental pressures or impacts even if at lower pace compared to GDP) is linked to an increased resource consumption, even though the achieved higher material productivity during the last decades. Furthermore, assessing environmental impact decoupling is essential to determine how environmental policy affects the environmental quality beyond resource use intensity. Although some studies evaluated environmental decoupling, the assessment was usually focusing on environmental pressures only, namely addressing specific emissions, e.g., CO 2 emissions (Chen et al., 2017; Gierlinger and Krausmann, 2012 ), or specific economic sectors, e.g., energy (de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011; Wang and Yang, 2015; Zhang and Wang, 2013 ). Therefore, environmental decoupling was mainly studied for specific indicators and environmental pressures (i.e., energy consumption, CO 2 emissions) assuming to be a proxy of the overall effects on the environment (e.g., acidification, eutrophication, toxicity). However, addressing environmental impacts is crucial to comprehensively assess environmental decoupling. In the reviewed studies, the economic output was the driving force originating the environmental pressure: GDP (Chen et al., 2017; Gierlinger and Krausmann, 2012 ), income (GDP per capita) (Bithas and Kalimeris, 2018; Salahuddin and Gow, 2014; Schandl et al., 2016 ), or added value (when assessing specific sectors, e.g. industry) (Enevoldsen et al., 2007; Li et al., 2017 ). Finally, most of the studies quantified the environmental pressures through national statistics and Material Flow Analysis (MFA). Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) with environmental extensions (e.g., Exiobase) (Merciai and Schmidt, 2017; Stadler et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2015) as well as the Greenhouse gas protocol (WBCSD, 2004) were also employed in the literature. However, no studies were found using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA)-based approach to quantify the environmental pressures or impacts in the decoupling assessment.
In this context, this paper contributes to the decoupling literature in a number ofaspects:
•
The decoupling assessment is performed at both production (territorial/domestic) level and consumption level. The paper evaluates the decoupling of the environmental impacts of consumption in the European Union from GDP.
•
The environmental assessment is performed in terms of environmental impacts rather than limited to pressures. Multiple impact indicators are used, adopting the Environmental Footprint impact categories and models (EC, 2013 ). Impact indicators are also normalized and weighted in a single score footprint.
•
The decoupling assessment is complemented by the evaluation of the decoupling of the HDI from the environmental impacts (Fig. 1) to address aspects which are going beyond the mere economic growth assessed by GDP.
•
The influence of methodological decisions is addressed to unveil the effect of inventory modeling and normalization.
•
The consumption impacts are modelled, adding to the production impacts those of import and subtracting those of export. The trade footprint is calculated adopting two alternative approaches: a bottom-up approach (process-based LCA of representative traded goods) and a top-down approach (input-output-based LCA related to trade).

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the decoupling of the economic growth (in terms of GDP) from the environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption by employing LCA-based environmental indicators and exploring the methodological aspects that influence the decoupling assessment and resulting outputs. Specific objectives aim to address the following research questions:
- How has GDP decoupled from the environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption in the timeframe (2005–2014)? How is the environmental decoupling taking place in the different EU countries in the timeframe (2004–2011)?
-
Which are the environmental impact categories driving the decoupling? How have the EU environmental policies influenced the decoupling from environmental impacts?
-
To what extent does life cycle modeling and impact assessment affect the assessment of decoupling?
-
Which are the environmental issues missing in the current assessment?
-
How can decoupling be assessed beyond GDP?
2. Material and methods
The decoupling of GDP from environmental impacts due to EU-28 consumption was evaluated through the decoupling index (DI). The environmental impacts were quantified by adopting the LCA-based Consumption Footprint (CF) set of indicators (Sala et al., 2019a, Sala et al., 2019b ). The CF adopts the impact categories recommended in the Environmental Footprint (EF) life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method( EC, 2013 ). The following sections detail the calculation principles of the DI and the CF. Moreover, the resource decoupling has been as well performed to illustrate how this differs from the decoupling from environmental impacts. Finally, the sections presents the evaluation of decoupling beyond GDP by using the HDI indicator.
2.1. DDecoupling index
The decoupling can evaluate how resource use or environmental impact are linked to the economy by calculating a specific index, such as proposed by Tapio (2005) with the calculation of the elasticity between the changes along time of the two assessed parameters, e.g. transport volume and GDP. This ratio was later coined as Decoupling Index (DI) (UNEP, 2011 ), which has further been used in the literature (e.g., Wu et al., 2018 ). In this study, the DI is the ratio between the relative variation of environmental impacts (EI) and the relative variation of the economic output, in terms of GDP (Eurostat, 2018 ), for a defined timeframe. D I=Δ E I Δ G D P=(E I t+1 − E I t)E I t(G D P t+1 − G D P t)G D P t
The environmental decoupling was classified in:
-
Absolute decoupling: DI < 0, ΔEI<0, ΔGDP>0. The environmental impact decreases while the economic output keeps growing.
-
Relative decoupling: 0<DI<1, ΔEI>0, ΔGDP>0. The environmental impact increases although at a slower pace than the economic output.
-
Non-decoupling: DI > 1, ΔEI > 0, ΔGDP>0. The environmental impact increases more than the economic growth.
-
Stagnant: DI≠0, ΔEI<±0.1, ΔGDP≤0. The economic output remains stable or decreases while the environmental impact shows a small variation, suggesting that the decoupling is linked to the stagnation of the economy.
The classification has been adjusted from the one proposed by Wu et al. (2018) by including the category “stagnant”, which reflects e.g. the situation of some EU Member States with no economic growth or recession. The variation of environmental impacts to define a decoupling trend as “stagnant” (i.e., ΔEI<±0.1) was determined according to the observed trends in EU Member States with no economic growth or recession (i.e., Italy, Greece).
2.2. Consumption footprint: how the environmental impacts are assessed
The Consumption Footprint (CF) (Sala et al., 2019a) is an LCA-based set of indicators aiming at tracking the overall environmental impacts of consumption in the EU-28. LCA was chosen as the method for calculating the CF indicator due to its comprehensiveness, which allows not only assessing impacts along supply chains and diverse potential environmental impacts but also unveiling potential trade-offs (i.e. burden shifting from one environmental impact category to another or between different stages of the life cycle of products (Sala et al., 2016 )).
The CF takes into account both the impacts associated with domestic activities (within the territorial boundaries of EU) (Domestic footprint) and the ones associated with trade (i.e. embedded impacts of imports and exports) (Import and Export footprints).
The CF is calculated as: C o n s u m p t i o n f o o t p r i n t=I m p o r t f o o t p r i n t+D o m e s t i c f o o t p r i n t − E x p o r t f o o t p r i n t
The Domestic Footprint (DF) (Fig. 2) quantifies impacts stemming from both production and consumption activities taking place within the Member State's territory. This means that environmental impacts occurring in EU due to those activities comprised under economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, energy, mining and services were accounted for as ‘domestic’ component. Similarly, environmental impacts stemming from households and government's activities, such as food consumption or touristic services, were included as well in the ‘domestic’ component as they occur within the boundaries of a country.

Apparent consumption differentiates household consumption (white) and the consumption from governments and non-profit institutions (grey).
Concerning the trade component of the CF, two approaches were followed to build the inventory of emissions and resources related to import and export (Fig. 2 ):
•
Consumption Footprint Bottom-up (CF-BU): the DF was combined with trade impacts calculated based on the process-based LCA (ISO, 2006a, 2006b) of 40 selected representative products of the most imported products in and exported ones from EU-28 (Sala et al., 2019a ).
•
Consumption Footprint Top-down (CF-TD): the DF was combined with trade impacts calculated using sectorial-based Multi-Regional Input-Output Tables (MRIOTs), considering the Exiobase database version 3 (Beylot et al., 2019; Merciai and Schmidt, 2017; Stadler et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2015 ).
2.2.1. Inventory of environmental pressures: resource use and emissions
This section details the compilation of the inventory data for the DF, CF-BU and CF-TD.
Domestic Footprint (DF). The DF relied on a vast inventory consisting of data on emissions and resource extraction and use in EU-28 territory, as detailed in Sala et al., 2015 and Sala et al. 2019b. The inventory is built gathering data from: i) official statistics at national, European or international level (e.g., United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNCCC), Eurostat, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)); ii) emission models, which estimate emissions based on proxy indicators (Sala et al., 2019a ). The final inventory is composed by: (i) raw data, as provided by third parties (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions in UNFCCC reports); (ii) estimated data from emission models (e.g., total nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to water from wastewater treatment plants); (iii) extrapolated data, following a gaps filling procedure to complement original data sources. The DF compiled statistical data for up to 1,957 environmental flows for the EU. At the MS level, the number of flows considered depended on the specific country.
Consumption Footprint Bottom-up (CF-BU) in which the Trade is based on Bottom-up Footprints. The CF-BU built upon the above-described DF, combined with import and export inventories based on process-based LCA of representative products of traded goods selected from Comext statistics (Eurostat, 2017 ). The up-scale procedure adopted to complete the final inventory was based on 40 products that represented the most imported and exported product groups (according to the two-digits Harmonised System nomenclature) in terms of mass and economic value in the respective year (Sala et al., 2019b ). Around 1,500 environmental flows were individuated in the trade component of the CF-BU.
Consumption Footprint Top - Down(CF-TD) in which the Trade is based on Top-Down Footprints. The CF-TD built upon the above-described DF, combined with import and export inventories calculated using sectorial-based and environmentally-extended MRIOTs (Beylot et al., 2019 ). The hybrid version of Exiobase 3 was used to retrieve inventory data related to imports to and exports from EU-28 by differentiating the 28 EU Member States and 113 products and services. Additionally, all the results included investments (usually referred to as “capital goods” or “infrastructure” in LCA) attributed to import and export, since they were integrated within the MRIOTs. The environmental extensions distinguished 78 elementary flows: 36 mineral, metal and energy resources, 5 land occupation types, 3 water consumption types, and 29 substances emitted to air, 2 to water and 3 to soil.
2.2.2. Impact assessment: characterization, normalization and weighting
The EF LCIA (EF2017) method (EC, 2017) was adopted for the impact assessment phase. The assumptions made to map the environmental data of statistical sources (DF) or the emissions and resources of the environmental extensions of Exiobase v3 (CF-TD) with the list of elementary flows of the LCIA method applied, i.e. EF2017, was a key aspect in the quantification of the environmental impacts. Beylot et al. (2019) details this mapping for the CF-TD. The characterization factors were those of the EF reference package 2 (EF 2.0) (EC-JRC et al., 2018; Fazio et al., 2018 ). Although the 16 EF impact categories were assessed (ESM 1), only 14 out of them (i.e., excluding ozone depletion (ODP) and ionizing radiation (IR)) were considered for the general results due to limitations of the Exiobase database (top-down approach). The 14 categories assessed were Climate change (CC), Human toxicity, non-cancer (HTOX_nc), Human toxicity, cancer (HTOX_c), Particulate matter (PM), Photochemical ozone formation (POF), Acidification (AC), Terrestrial Eutrophication (TEU), Freshwater Eutrophication (FEU), Marine Eutrophication (MEU), Land use (LU), Freshwater Ecotoxicity (ECOTOX), Water use (WU), Resource use, Fossils (FRD) and Resource use, Minerals and metals (MRD). For sensitivity purposes, the relevance of adopting the 16 EF categories is later discussed, compared to the limited use to 14 EF categories when employing the Exiobase database. Regarding HTOX_nc, the characterization factor for the zinc emissions from USEtox (Rosenbaum et al., 2008) was reduced to 2%, according to the procedure adopted in the IMPACT World + method (Bulle et al., 2019 ). Characterized values were normalized at the global level, referring to global impacts calculated by Crenna et al. (2019), and at EU-28 level for sensitivity purposes, by using the CF-TD results as reference. The EF2017 weighting factors (Sala et al., 2018) were applied to obtain a single score CF.
2.3. Geographical and temporal scope
The geographical and temporal scope depended on the assessment approach and component (domestic, trade, apparent consumption) (Table 2 ). Data availability at the country level defined the geographical scope, while data robustness determined the temporal scope. Calculations were performed for the period 2000–2014, however two main limitations arose:
-
limitations of the top-down data collection: regarding top-down trade and consumption footprints, Exiobase data for 2000–2003 period showed multiple outliers in different impact categories while data were not available for the 2011–2014 period and were extrapolated (linear extrapolation excluding outlier years);
-
limitations of process-based data collection: concerning the bottom-up approach (both trade and consumption footprints), calculations were made for four distinct years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014). For the remaining years, the trade component was obtained based on interpolation according to the environmental results of the calculated total mass of imported and exported volumes (trade). The interpolated results were added to the calculated DF thereby obtaining an interpolated value for the CF-BU.

Therefore, the criteria to define the timeframe 2005–2014 for this study were:
a)
maximum inclusion of years available in both top-down (2004–2014) and bottom-up (2000, 2005, 2010, 2014) approaches to allow a comparative assessment;
b)
maximum time coverage of more robust data available at EU level.
As the top-down approach is dependent on external data sources for the trade component (i.e., EXIOBASE), years beyond 2015 cannot be included in the assessment as extrapolation methods should be used, as already applied for the period 2012–2014. In this sense, enlarging the time period would include further uncertainties to the assessment.
2.4. Resource decoupling
The decoupling of the economic output from resource use due to EU consumption was assessed in order to outline the differences between resource and environmental decoupling. The Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) indicator was selected for this purpose, considering the following aspects. First, DMC has already been used in the decoupling literature (Table 1 ). Second, DMC is an indicator adopted within the EU Resource efficiency scoreboard (EC, 2016b ). Third, although the Raw Material Consumption (RMC) quantifies the material footprint by considering the weight of materials extracted to produce them instead of the weight of the materials at the border (as in the DMC), the two indicators showed a similar trend along the time period evaluated (Eurostat, 2019) and resource decoupling results would be similar. When considering a territorial-based approach, the domestic extraction (DE) has been assessed.
2.5. Beyond the GDP: considering human well-being
Environmental decoupling has been mostly assessed considering the economic growth as reference (e.g., GDP), as indicated by the OECD (2002). However, some authors pointed out that overall sustainability, including further dimensions than the economic growth, should be considered (van den Bergh and Botzen, 2018 ). This is in line with the European Commission's “GDP and Beyond” Communication (EC, 2009b ), where new indicators that include environmental and social aspects but remain as clear and appealing as GDP were promoted. van den Bergh (2009) discussed the GDP paradox, where GDP is a dominant and widely used economic indicator although being severely criticized for not properly representing social welfare in terms of development. In fact, GDP is an indicator that measures the economic activity rather than the well-being (Costanza et al., 2009 ). Thus, while the lack of comprehensivness of the indicator is agreed, GDP is still relevant and influences policy and economic decisions, which are mostly seeking the perpetuation of GDP growth (van den Bergh, 2009 ).
Alternatives to GDP were presented and evaluated in the literature (Costanza et al., 2009; van den Bergh, 2009 ). van den Bergh (2009) categorized them in four groups: (a) adjustments of GDP (e.g., Genuine Progress Indicator, GPI (Kubiszewski et al., 2013 )); (b) sustainable or green versions of GDP (e.g., Sustainable National Income, SNI); (c) genuine savings (GS) (Bolt et al., 2002 ); and (d) composite indexes of relevant aspects of human well-being (e.g., Human Development Index, HDI). Among them, HDI is an alternative indicator with available annual data provided by the UN and worldwide coverage that can be employed in decoupling assessment. The employment of HDI as a human well-being indicator might be considered as a proper reference for evaluating decoupling, as already presented by UNEP (2011). Towards assessing the decoupling beyond GDP and considering human well-being, this study evaluated how HDI decouples from the environmental impacts of consumption.
3. Results
This section illustrates the evaluation of the decoupling related to the environmental impacts of EU consumption. In a first section, the decoupling assessment for the DF, CF-BU and CF-TD is reported. The resource decoupling is also assessed. Moreover, the environmental decoupling is analyzed at the country and impact category level. Finally, decoupling is assessed beyond GDP by employing the HDI indicator.
3.1. The decoupling of GDP from environmental impacts in the EU-28
The GDP showed decoupling from the environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption for the period 2005–2014 (Fig. 3 ). While the GDP grew by 8%, the single score CF had a variation between stable (−0.2%, CF-TD) to decreasing (−23%, CF-BU). Although the environmental impact decreased in both approaches (i.e., absolute decoupling), the CF-TD trend was close to stable (−0.2%) for this period, being in the limits of a relative decoupling. For all the indicators, the effect of the economic crisis can be observed in 2009, when the economic output (GDP = -4%) and the trade (imports = -22%, exports = -16%) decreased, in terms of single score. In general, the trade components had larger variations than the domestic one for the environmental impact indicators.

Fig. 3. Production-, consumption-based and trade decoupling of EU-28 (2005–2014): Variation of the environmental impact indicators in relation with economic (economic value, GDP, final expenditure) and mass (mass, DMC, domestic extraction) trends.
3.1.1. Production-perspective: the decoupling of GDP from domestic environmental impacts in EU-28
During the assessed period (2005–2014), the single score DF was reduced by 19% following a continuous decrease. Compared to a GDP increase of 8%, the single score DF showed an absolute decoupling between 2005 and 2014. This result indicates the environmental impacts resulting from the consumption in EU-28 were reduced within the borders of the EU, i.e. considering a production- and territorial-based perspective, for the assessed impact categories.
3.1.2. Consumption-perspective top-down: the decoupling of GDP from consumption-related environmental impacts in EU-28 (top-down approach)
The single score CF-TD showed a stable trend between 2005 and 2014 (−0.2%) (Fig. 3 ). Two different trends can be observed in this period: an irregular decrease between 2005 and 2009 (−7.5%) and a constant increase from 2009. This trend outlines the effects of the economic crisis started in 2008, where trade drastically decreased, as well as the potential increase of the environmental burdens of EU consumption if consumption patterns are kept beyond the assessed timeline (2014). Furthermore, the values from 2012 were extrapolated from the trends during the entire period, adding uncertainty to forecasting trends beyond the assessed period.
Assessing trade is crucial to understand the results since the environmental impact of DF showed a constant decrease during the evaluated period, contrarily to the increase of the environmental burdens of imports (+29%, single score) and exports (+40%, single score). In percentage, the exports had a larger increase than imports. However, the impacts of imports in the CF-TD were two times bigger than those of domestic and exports impacts, in absolute terms. Therefore, the increase of imports drastically affected CF-TD and compensated the decrease of domestic impacts and the increase of embodied environmental impacts exported from EU. Results in absolute terms are reported in the supplementary material (ESM 2).
3.1.3. Consumption-perspective bottom-up: the decoupling of GDP from consumption-related environmental impacts in EU-28 (bottom-up approach)
The economic growth decoupled from the EU-28 CF-BU in absolute terms, as the single score indicator of the environmental impact decreased by 23% while the GDP grew by 8% (Fig. 3 ). As for the CF-TD, single score DF decreased by 19% and the environmental impacts of exports increased (27%, single score). However, the environmental burdens embodied in imports were also reduced (−5%, single score), in constrast to the results obtained in the top-down approach (i.e., where the impacts of imports increased). The trends of these components all resulted in a decrease in the total CF-BU. An “export effect” was observed, where EU-28 mainly imported food products and raw materials and exported finished products with complex supply chains. This implies a higher impact per unit of product. Contrary to the CF-TD, the DF was the most relevant component of the total environmental impact of CF-BU in absolute terms. Compared to the single score DF, the environmental burdens of imports represented from the 56% (2005) to the 64% (2014) and the exports between 27% and 42%. Results in absolute terms are reported in the supplementary material (ESM2).
3.1.4. Resource decoupling
The resource use indicators domestic extraction (DE) and DMC were analyzed and both showed a decreasing trend between 2005 and 2014 (−13% and −17%, respectively) (Fig. 3 ). The behavior of these two indicators can be compared to the corresponding environmental impact indicators.
Both DE and DF decreased along the assessed period, however DF showed a higher decreased (−19%), outlining that the environmental decoupling was more intense than the resource decoupling. Although having a similar decrease between 2005 and 2014, the trend of both indicators varied along the period. While the DF followed a continuous decrease, the DE increased until 2007, drastically decreased between 2008 and 2010, as a result from the economic crisis, and presented an irregular decrease during the last period (2011–2014). In this sense, the DE had a relative decoupling until 2007 and an absolute decoupling for the rest of the period, apart from years of DE increase (e.g., 2011).
In the same line, CF-BU (−23%) showed an aligned behavior with the DMC (−17%) indicator as both decreased between 2005 and 2014, but this trend was more intense for the environmental impact than for the resource use. As well, while the CF-BU showed a decreasing trend along the entire period, the DMC increased during the first period (until 2009) and decreased from then.
The comparison of the pairs DE-DF and DMC-CF-BU unveiled a divergent trend between resource use and environmental impact indicators. This fact highlighted the contrast behavior of (a) single and composite indicators, and (b) resource depletion and environmental impact.
3.2. The environmental decoupling at country and impact category level
The EU-28 as a single entity had a positive trend towards environmental decoupling. However, EU countries showed different and contrasting profiles. Fig. 4 shows the environmental decoupling of the EU-28 countries for the DF and CF-TD weighted scores between 2004 and 2011. While most of the countries showed an absolute decoupling for the DF, a distribution between non-decouplers, relative decouplers and absolute decouplers was found in the CF-TD. Trade is therefore the component driving the decoupling. Regarding the spatial distribution of the decoupling, this was less intense for northern countries (DF) and central countries (CF-TD). When comparing environmental decoupling and resource decoupling (i.e., relation between DMC and GDP variation in Fig. 4 ), resource decoupling obtained more positive values (number of absolute decouplers) than environmental decoupling.

Midpoint indicators are ordered by descending decoupling rate (ratio of number of decoupling countries and non-decouplers) (*Croatia refer to the period 2006–2011 due to data limitations).
3.2.1. Consumption drivers for the different country patterns (2004–2011)
Examples of each decoupling group (i.e., absolute decouplers, relative decouplers, non-decouplers and stagnant) were evaluated to determine the drivers of the largest changes in the environmental impacts of individual countries. The consumption component, the flows, the economic sectors and the products leading the change in the environmental indicators were identified (ESM 3).
Absolute decouplers: Slovakia, Poland, Lithuania and Estonia. A decreased production of electricity from non-renewable sources (nuclear power, fossil fuels) (Lithuania), a variation in the domestic PM 2.5 emissions (Estonia) and a decreased trade of manufactured products - particularly with electronic parts (e.g., vehicles, both in import and export) (Slovakia) and of bio-based products (e.g., wood, cereals, meat where the impact from import decreases while impact from export increases) (Lithuania, Estonia) motivated the decreasing trends in the CF-TD of absolute decouplers.
Relative decouplers: Czech Republic. Changes in CF-TD of relative decouplers were produced by increased food exports, reduced hard coal consumption compensated by increased crude oil imports, and enlarged domestic emissions of CO and CH 4.
Stagnant countries: Greece and Italy. An improved energy mix and reduced food imports (Italy), improved wastewater treatment, decreased domestic SOx emissions and increased food imports (Greece) defined the impact trends of stagnant countries.
Non-decouplers: Luxemburg, Netherlands and Germany. An increased import of meat (Netherlands, Germany), increased import of metal manufactured products (Luxemburg) and increased imports of gold and other industrial minerals (Germany) were the main drivers towards a non-decoupling consumption.
3.2.2. Environmental impacts driving decoupling and the effects of EU environmental policy
Regarding the midpoint indicators, Fig. 4 shows the impact categories sorted in descending order of number of decoupling countries (both relative and absolute). There were more decoupling than non-decoupling countries for all the impact categories. The leading impact categories towards decoupling were ECOTOX, TEU, PM and MEU with the highest amount of decoupling countries. Contrarily, HTOX categories had the lowest contribution towards a global EU-28 decoupling. Regarding absolute decoupling, TEU, AC and MEU emerged as the leading impact categories with between 19 and 18 countries as absolute decouplers. Geographically, south-west EU-28 area showed larger presence of decouplers for the different impact categories.
CC, PM and MRD had the main role, contributing to between 49% and 57% of the CF-TD weighted score during the entire period. FRD, WU, LU and AC represented more than 5% each for the entire period. While for CF-BU, CC (26–28%), PM (19–20%) and FRD (18–19%) were the most contributing categories to the weighted score for years 2005 and 2010 (ESM 4). The relevance of these categories in the weighted score was also related to the weighting factors adopted in the EF2017 scheme (Sala et al., 2018) (ESM 1).
During the assessed period, the impact categories showed a decreasing trend (up to −30%, AC) for the CF-TD approach, apart from HTOX_c (+1%) and MRD (+127%). In fact, MRD was the only category that showed no decoupling from the GDP, which is in contrast with the reduction observed for the pressure indicator DMC. On the contrary, all the indicators followed an absolute decoupling trend for the CF-BU, ranging between −1% (LU) and −88% (HTOX_nc) (ESM 5). Furthermore, HTOX_c obtained negative values in the CF-BU, indicating that the embodied impacts in exports were higher than the domestic and imported ones. This is a clear limitation of the representative products currently modelled. Hence, results are illustrative of the possible methdological approach but are still not mature to be used to draw conclusions on the impacts trend.
Furthermore, the analysis of DF at the indicator level allows for assessing the possible effects of EU policies acting on the environmental aspects. The effect in the environmental burdens of some policies that entered into force within the considered timeframe or a few years before (EC, 2009a, 2008a; 2008b, 2006, 2003, 2001) was observed (Fig. 5 ). The foreseen reduction of certain types of emissions or a ban of a number of chemicals (e.g. active substances in pesticides) mainly contributed to a reduction in the impact, even if sometimes the reduction was not very significant. Along the assessed period, the effect of the global economic crisis of 2008 should be considered, which contributed to the decreasing trend. Most of the impact categories with flows associated to specific policies showed the highest decrease between 2008 and 2009 due to reduced trade and consumption levels. Among the impact categories, ecotoxicity was the one showing the lowest effect due to the economic crisis, contrarily to the human toxicity – cancer that had the largest effect.

3.2.3. Assessing decoupling beyond GDP
Concerning the assessment of whether human well-being decoupled from the environmental impacts of consumption and how the result varies from the GDP decoupling, Fig. 6 compares the environmental decoupling of the economic output (in terms of GDP) and the human well-being (in terms of HDI) from the CF-TD.

Fig. 6. Decoupling at the country level (2004–2011): Decoupling the economic output (GDP) and the human well-being (HDI) from the CF-TD weighted score. Bullet size represents country population (2010). Countries are classified in absolute decouplers (green), relative decouplers (yellow), non-decouplers (red) and stagnants (blue). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
When comparing the use of the two reference indicators (GDP and HDI), some trends were observed. In general, the environmental decoupling employing HDI was more dichotomic than when using GDP and countries were absolute decouplers or non-decouplers, apart from Hungary that showed a relative decoupling in both cases (i.e., the CF-TG growth of 2.1% was lower than the increase of both indexes: 5% - GDP - and 3.5% - HDI). The number of countries which are non-decouplers and absolute decouplers increased compared to the graph illustrating decoupling to GDP. Firstly, those countries with a decreasing environmental impact trend (between −7 and −80%) were absolute decouplers considering both the GDP and the HDI. Furthermore, the group of stagnant countries (Italy and Greece) disappeared and became absolute decouplers because, contrary to the GDP, the HDI increased for all the EU-28 countries along the assessed period. Secondly, as GDP had growing rates larger than the HDI, the non-decouplers showed the same behavior for GDP and HDI as the environmental impact growth was still higher (between 17 and 76%). Finally, most of the countries with relative decoupling when using GDP had a larger CF-TD growth (5.5–9.4%) than the HDI variation (2.9–4.2%), resulting in non-decouplers when assessing well-being. In this last case, the HDI increase was between 1.4 and 8 times smaller than the GDP one.
In terms of population, four out of the six most populated EU countries (i.e, France, Italy, United Kingdom, and Poland) were in both cases either decouplers or stagnant (Italy in the decoupling assessment with the GDP indicator). While Germany showed no environmental decoupling in both cases, the GDP of Spain had a relative decoupling from the environmental impacts but the HDI showed no decoupling. Similarly to Spain, some of the mid-populated countries (10–20 million inhabitants) changed from relative decouplers (GDP) to non-decouplers (HDI) (i.e., Belgium, Czech Republic), apart from Hungary which remained as relative decoupler in both cases. The rest of mid-populated countries revealed as specific cases: The Netherlands was a non-decoupler in both cases, Portugal was an absolute decoupler for both indicators and Greece changed from stagnant (GDP) to absolute decoupler (HDI). The least populated countries (<3 million inhabitants) showed absolute decoupling in both cases, apart from Luxembourg which resulted in non-decoupler (both GDP and HDI). In absolute terms, assessing the GDP decoupling from the environmental impacts of consumption identified a larger amount of population as decoupler or being stagnant (383 million inhabitants) than when considering HDI (353 million inhabitants). Such trend implied that for each inhabitant having a consumption pattern without decoupling, 3.25 inhabitants were having consumption patterns that showed decoupling when using the GDP as economic indicator and only 2.4 when considering the well-being indicator HDI.
4. Discussion
4.1. The environmental decoupling in the EU-28
The environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption showed decoupling during the last decades (2005–2014) as suggested by the literature for waste generation (Mazzanti and Zoboli, 2008) and for carbon footprint (Liobikiene and Dagiliute, 2016 ), as well as for the Ecological Footprint trends (Lin et al., 2018 ). These results are aligned with global assessments (Schandl et al., 2016; Wood et al., 2018 ), which indicated that relative decoupling takes place for some environmental issues while global absolute decoupling is only possible for some aspects (e.g. land use, Wood et al., 2018 ). However, country-level results varied from the literature. For example, Liobikiene and Dagiliute (2016) found that Croatia, Italy, Portugal and Spain were non-decouplers regarding climate change for the period 1993–2010, and only three countries were performing as absolute decouplers (Denmark, Estonia, Germany). In this assessment, while Croatia and Italy were non-decouplers for climate change, half of the countries (14) were behaving as absolute decouplers for 2005–2014.
The assessment stressed the relevance of consumption-based approaches in assessing the decoupling phenomenon as discussed in the literature (Hamilton et al., 2018; Wiedmann and Lenzen, 2018; Wood et al., 2018 ). DF decoupling was more intense than CF decoupling and, thus, the economic growth showed a higher level of decoupling from the environmental impacts in the territory than from those impacts taking place abroad. Therefore, EU-28 was a net importer of embedded environmental impacts in traded goods. Hence, environmental policies should address also trade products to integrate non-domestic environmental burdens. In the same line, the necessity to evaluate the decoupling from environmental impacts rather than resource use (UNEP, 2011) was also demonstrated. Although DF and DE as well as CF and DMC showed the same trend, the behavior of resource depletion varied from the environmental impact one. Furthermore, the study highlighted the differing results when employing individual impact indicators and a single weighted score.
4.2. Modeling the environmental impacts of consumption
4.2.1. Environmental modeling approaches
Input-output LCA and process-based LCA were contrasted by confronting CF-TD and CF-BU, respectively. In both approaches, the CF was higher than the DF and, thus, EU-28 was a net importer of environmental impacts. One of the main divergences between both approaches relied on the MRD impact category. MRD represented only 2% of the impact in CF-BU but was a major driver in CF-TD (from 13% to 24%) as the inventory was highly aggregated in Exiobase and different types of minerals were characterized with a singular characterisation factor, as discussed in Beylot et al., 2019.
The following differences between the two environmental modeling approaches arose as limitations of this comparison:
-
A DF based on statistical data was merged with a trade footprint calculated based on two different modeling approaches: process-based LCA (CF-BU) and input-output-based LCA (CF-TD).
-
The elementary flows coverage was not the same for these components in the calculation of the environmental impacts of consumption: around 2,000 (DF), around 15,000 (process-based LCA trade footprint in CF-BU) and 78 (input-output-based LCA trade footprint in CF-TD).
-
The top-down approach (CF-TD) with an input-output-based LCA trade footprint included the impacts of matter-less economic sectors (e.g., services), while these were excluded from the bottom-up approach (process-based LCA).
-
The top-down approach (CF-TD) was more correlated to monetary flows while the bottom-up (CF-BU) one followed the trend of mass flows. Regarding CF-BU, the decrease of the environmental impact can be related to the fact that more semi-finished materials or finished products are consumed in the EU. This could be the real issue at stake, i.e., the material footprint embedded is higher but the mass which is imported is less. This again my question the represenativness of the selected products.
Therefore, from an inventory perspective, a compromised solution combining the benefits of both approaches might provide with results better mirroring the reality.
4.2.2. Influence of life cycle assessment inventory modeling and normalization
The normalization and weighting of the characterised values and the inclusion of different midpoint impact categories can alter the single footprint outputs and the decoupling assessment. While previous literature showed no normalization steps and used single indicators, the sensitivity analysis of varying these aspects in LCA unveiled a considerable influence. The evaluated results followed a global normalization step to show the evolution of EU-28 environmental impacts compared to global environmental impacts, and included 14  EF categories. However, the assessment at the country level can be also performed applying EU-28 normalization factors to compare the countries with an EU reference. All the 16 EF categories can be assessed for DF (Table 3) (ESM 6).
Table 3. Decoupling assessment at the country level of the CF-TD and DF with different normalization and number of impact categories (2004–2011). Green: asbolute decoupling; yellow: relative decoupling; red: non decoupling; blue: stagnant.
The sensitivity assessment unveiled some divergences. First, global normalized results were more positive than EU-28 ones as the EU-28 share of the global environmental impacts was limited (<10%). Thus, while globally normalized DF results showed an almost-green map, absolute decouplers were more restricted in EU-normalized ones. Second, using EU-28 normalization sets the average EU-28 trend for a determined timeframe (i.e., average of the variations in the different EU countries) as the reference behavior, leading to potential opposite trends in the characterized and the normalized values. For example, although the AC impact of all EU-28 countries decreased following the policy implementation against related emissions, Luxemburg's decreasing rate (−4%) was lower than the EU average, resulting in an increasing normalized trend (+28%).
Third, the role of each impact category varied regarding the normalization type as the global share of EU-28 impacts depends on the midpoint category: EU-28 had more relevance in IR (68%), PM (12%), CC (9%) and FEU (8%), while a low effect to LU (3%) and MRD (2%) (ESM 6). Thus, the contribution of each country to the midpoint categories can result in a different decoupling output based on the normalization and the number of impact categories included in the assessment (Table 3 ). In particular, some countries showed a higher sensitivity to specific categories. For example, France was an absolute decoupler in all cases, apart from DF with global normalization and 16 indicators. Finally, IR and ODP had a relatively high weighting score compared to other impact categories in the EF weighting set, so they affected the single weighted score. See (ESM1) for the list of the EF weighting factors.
4.2.3. Temporal scope
Defining the temporal scope of a decoupling assessment can influence the results due to specific events (e.g., economic crises) Although the CF-TD showed a stable trend for 2005–2014, the annual decoupling assessment unveiled that decoupling occurred at the beginning (2005–2007) and ending (2012, 2014) years while non-decoupling took place along the period 2008–2011, due to the economic crisis and the decreased economic output, and 2013 (ESM 8). Regarding the midpoint categories, none of them followed the same pattern along the entire timeframe and the economic crisis severely affected 2009 and 2010. The categories that showed more years of absolute decoupling were FEU, CC and LU, antagonistically to HTOX_c. The assessment of the annual decoupling is common in literature (Chen et al., 2017; de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011; Wang and Yang, 2015; Zhang and Wang, 2013) and can show the effects of environmental policy programs and their implementation. However, annual assessments must be complemented with complete timeframe observations to understand the behavior of an economy as annual decoupling can be offset with non-decoupling behaviors in the following years (and vice versa).
Regarding DF, robust data was available for the period 2000–2014 (ESM 9), which showed slightly more absolute decoupling in EU-28. Italy and Greece were stagnant in both cases as GDP was stable (0%) or decreasing (recession). While both Finland and Estonia were relative decouplers for 2005–2014 due to an increase of MEU and MRD (Finland), and CC and HTOX_c (Estonia), only Latvia was a relative decoupler for the longer period (2000–2014) due to an increase in CC. Decoupling assessment of longer periods could provide information about the mid- and long-term effects of policy implementation. In this case, EU-28 is leading the development and implementation of environmental policies as observed in the absolute decoupling results for the DF, which were even better for a longer evaluation timeframe.
4.2.4. Environmental impacts and decoupling: uncertainties, limitations and missing aspects
The assessed environmental indicators (DF, CF-TD and CF-BU) encompassed multiple environmental pressures and impacts (at least 14 categories), thereby attempting a comprehensive accounting of the environmental impact of EU-28 consumption. This represents a clear novelty of this work compared to previous studies. In the literature, most of the analysis focused on a single environmental impact and the environmental modeling was very limited. For instance, some studies assessing climate change only accounted for CO 2 emissions with results indicating a very limited relative decoupling and, thus, the consideration of all GHG emissions could result in a non-decoupling behaviour (e.g. Zhang and Wang, 2013 ).
The extensive impact assessment conducted in this study was highly data demanding, and it relied on a wide variety of sources and models to populate the underpinning environmental pressures. For calculating the inventory of emissions and resources, data were retrieved from: public statistics, environmental modelling for data gap filling, life cycle inventories, multi-regional input-output databases, as detailed in Sala et al., (2019a). The complexity of the exercise (bringing together more than 3000 type of emissions and resources, over 15 years and for 28 EU Member States) and the use of models imply a degree of uncertainty in the results, which is difficult to estimate at this stage. This should be kept in mind while interpreting the results.
Besides, there is an increasing awareness of the level of impacts posed by current patterns of production and consumption, e.g. leading to an unprecedented decrease in biodiversity at global level (Johnson et al., 2017) and in biotic stock (e.g. fish declining) (Vasilakopoulos et al., 2014 ). This suggests that the current assessment of decoupling, despite covering 14 impact categories, should be further complemented in order to be able to better capture current trends in environmental impacts. In fact, although some attempts have been made to integrate missing aspects into the LCA framework, some environmental impacts related to consumption are not included in current LCA practice; e.g., noise (Cucurachi, 2014 ), marine litter, light contamination and some drivers of biodiversity loss (such as biotic resource overexploitation or detrimental effects of invasive species (Hanafiah et al., 2011 )). Moreover, even absolute decouplers might generate impacts which are far beyond the planetary boundaries (Sala et al., 2019a) and this supports the need of complementing, as well as with the evaluation of additional impacts currently missing. The paradigm of resource efficiency and environmental efficiency, underpinning the decoupling assessment, is not enough to assess the sustainability of production and consumption systems.
5. Conclusions
This paper evaluates the decoupling of GDP from the environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption by employing LCA-based environmental indicators and exploring the methodological aspects that influence the decoupling assessment and resulting outputs. The methodological approach and results contribute to the literature by adopting an LCA perspective that assesses environmental decoupling in impact terms rather than pressures, as well as using a set of multiple impact categories.
The environmental impacts of EU-28 consumption showed decoupling during the last decades (2005–2014), behaving as between relative (−0.2% change) and absolute (−23%) decoupler, depending on the environmental modeling approach taken. However, decoupling had a different intensity along the EU territory. Some countries showed higher decoupling levels compared to others, thereby displaying a heterogeneous map of the decoupling in the EU-28. In general, southern countries showed better results (i.e., higher amount of absolute decouplers) than northern countries, apart from water consumption.
Trade variation and the economic crisis of started in 2008 had a strong effect on the results. The CF was higher than the DF highlighting the role of EU as a net importer of environmental burdens. The imports of meat, minerals for manufacturing products, manufactured products, and non-renewable energy sources were the main contributors to increased environmental burdens in non-decoupling countries. The economic crisis severely affected trade patterns and the environmental burdens decreased during the following two years due to a lower consumption in EU countries. This positively affected the decreasing trend for the assessed period. Towards exploring the economic changes behind the trend of the environmental impacts, a decomposition analysis could shed light on whether structural changes, technology progress or trade patterns were the main contributors (e.g., Koh et al., 2016 ).
The decoupling of GDP from environmental impacts of EU consumption was led by acidification, particulate matter, land use, and eutrophication impacts. The results stressed out the need to assess decoupling from a consumption perspective towards including the environmental burdens taking place in developing countries where environmental policy is less strict. Accordingly, environmental policy could force changes beyond the EU-28 territory by considering traded products. This would broaden the current positive effect in the EU territory, according to the assessment of implemented EU policies and the trend of the affected environmental impact categories.
Methodologically, the top-down approach showed higher values of environmental impact in absolute terms and a stable trend along the assessed period. Input-output-based LCA considers all the economic activities, including the immaterial ones (i.e., services). However, the quantification of the environmental burdens is less accurate than in process-based LCA due to the constraints of the environmental extensions. On the contrary, the bottom-up approach showed better results and trade had larger relevance than domestic impacts. Process-based LCA excludes the services of the environmental modeling and it is based on representative products. Since both approaches show drawbacks, a more accurate accounting of the environmental decoupling might be situated between the top-down and the bottom-up approaches.
Furthermore, the way of modeling the environmental impacts was key in the assessment of decoupling and further improvements might be performed to better mirror the reality. In the same line, data availability and origin influenced the robustness of the calculations as different completeness of data added uncertainty to the results. On the other hand, the paper discussed how life cycle modeling and impact assessment can affect the results by observing the sensitivity to different normalization (global, EU-28), number of indicators (14, 16) and timeframe. EU-28 role in global environmental impacts as well as the weighting scheme of EF2017 were revealed as key aspects in the total outputs. As well, the impact assessment method employed (EF2017) missed some environmental impacts related to consumption (noise, marine litter, light contamination and some drivers of biodiversity loss). Further research might address the modeling of these missing environmental aspects related to consumption in life cycle assessment.
Following discussions about the relevance of GDP but the constraint vision of this economic indicator to track progress, the study employs HDI to evaluate the decoupling of human well-being from environmental impacts. Assessing decoupling beyond GDP allows exploring the environmental decoupling of human well-being by considering social sustainability aspects rather than exclusively economic development. While the HDI can be a useful indicator for this purpose with available annual worldwide data, the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) (Kubiszewski et al., 2013) would be an interesting metric when data are worldwide available in order to integrate further elements of sustainability in the consideration of human well-being.
However, to assess sustainability of production and consumption, the decoupling assessment is not enough. Understanding to which extent the impacts transgress planetary boundaries it is essential to ensure that the decoupling is not only a measure of eco-efficiency but an effective indication of an improved sustainability.

Report
Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts from economic growth
Humankind has witnessed phenomenal economic and social development in the past century. However, there are increasing signs that it has come at a cost to the environment and to the availability of cheap resources. Despite progress, there is still great disparity between the rich and the poor. The dilemma of expanding economic activities equitably while attempting to stabilize the rate of resource use and reduce environmental impacts poses an unprecedented opportunity and challenge to society. In this report, the International Resource Panel has sought to apply the concept of decoupling economic growth and human well-being from environmental impacts and resource use to address this challenge. The report provides a solid foundation for the concept of decoupling, clearly defining key terms and providing empirical evidence of escalating resource use. It shows that decoupling is already taking place to some extent, but is lagging far behind its potential. The scenarios show that we are facing a historic choice about how we use resources and the report scopes the potential of innovation, rethinking economic growth and the role of cities in building more resource efficient economies. Four case studies at the country level show how policy makers are implementing decoupling strategies. This report focuses on material resources, namely fossil fuels, minerals, metals and biomass and will be complemented by parallel reports of the IRP on land and soil, water, metals, cities and technologies to mitigate GHG emissions. These future reports will contribute to the International Resource Panel’s objective to build a better understanding of how to decouple environmental impacts from economic growth and improved human well-being. It is hoped that policy makers aiming to green their economies will greatly benefit from the contributions that the International Resource Panel is making through its work on decoupling resource consumption from economic growth.
