Alright, so I need to figure out how law firms have changed their practices with technology. Hmm, that seems pretty broad, but I guess I can break it down. First, I should probably understand what aspects of law firm practices have been influenced by technology. I mean, technology has touched pretty much every industry in some way, and law is no exception.

Let me think about this step by step. Maybe I can start by considering the day-to-day operations of a law firm. What do lawyers and support staff typically do? Well, they handle a lot of documents, conduct research, communicate with clients and other parties, manage cases, and so on. So, technology could potentially impact all of these areas.

First off, document handling. In the past, law firms had huge physical libraries and file rooms filled with books, case files, and paperwork. But with the advent of digital storage and document management systems, a lot of that has gone digital. I remember hearing about firms implementing document management software that allows for easy storage, retrieval, and sharing of files electronically. This not only saves space but also makes it quicker to access information.

Also, collaboration tools must have changed how lawyers work together, especially since many firms have attorneys in different offices or even working remotely. Video conferencing, shared drives, and real-time editing features probably make it easier for them to collaborate on cases without being in the same physical location.

Then there's legal research. Back in the day, lawyers would spend hours in law libraries poring over books and journals. Now, with online databases like Westlaw, LexisNexis, and others, they can access a vast amount of legal information with just a few clicks. This has to have sped up the research process significantly and allowed for more efficient case preparation.

I also recall hearing about artificial intelligence being used in law firms. AI can help with tasks like contract review, predicting case outcomes, and even assisting with due diligence in mergers and acquisitions. That sounds pretty advanced. I wonder how widespread that is.

Another area that comes to mind is client communication. With email, messaging apps, and client portals, lawyers can stay in touch with their clients more easily and promptly. This likely improves client satisfaction and keeps everyone on the same page.

Speaking of which, maybe technology has also changed how law firms bill their clients. I've heard of time-tracking software that automatically logs the time spent on specific tasks, which can make billing more accurate and efficient.

And what about cybersecurity? With so much sensitive information being stored digitally, law firms must have had to step up their security measures to protect client data from breaches and hacks.

Hmm, I also think about e-discovery in litigation. The process of collecting and producing electronic documents during legal discovery has become a big deal, and there are specialized tools and services for managing that.

Oh, and don't forget about automation. I imagine that repetitive tasks, like drafting standard contracts or conducting initial client interviews, could be partially automated using software, freeing up lawyers' time for more complex work.

Let me see if I can think of any other ways technology has impacted law firm practices. Maybe in marketing and business development. Law firms now have websites, use social media, and employ SEO strategies to attract clients. That's probably different from how they used to do things.

Also, remote work has become more prevalent, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Law firms had to adapt by providing their employees with the necessary technology to work from home securely, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and secure messaging platforms.

I should probably look into some specific examples or statistics to support these points. Maybe there are studies or articles that discuss how technology has transformed the legal industry.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should conduct some online research to gather more concrete information. I can look for articles, industry reports, or even blog posts from law firms themselves about how they've integrated technology into their practices.

Let me try searching for something like "how technology has changed law firm practices" or "impact of technology on legal industry."

7 Technological Breakthroughs That Might Change the Way We Practice Law In 2022 • LegalScoops
7 Technological Breakthroughs That Might Change the Way We Practice Law In 2022
Practice January 6, 2022 By Jacob Maslow
Many technological breakthroughs that might change the way we practice law in 2022 are not new. Some legal firms have readily embraced several technologies, while other firms were forced to adopt some to counteract the effects of having to work remotely during the pandemic. However, as we move into the post-pandemic world, these technological breakthroughs will significantly impact running a legal office.
#1.Virtual Conferencing and Hearings
In-person communications and hearings were how the law was practiced in the past. However, during the pandemic, all this changed. Meetings and trials were soon being conducted virtually, and many people have embraced this.
According to the 2020 Legal Trends report, 37% percent of legal clients don’t mind a virtual legal meeting for a first meeting or consultation. In addition, we have seen successful trials held entirely on Zoom in the courtroom, allowing courts to tackle the huge backlogs.
#2. Boosted Research and Background Searches
The success of any law firm depends on legal research and background searches of expert witnesses. These take time, and important details can often be overlooked, negatively impacting a case. Legal research tools give lawyers access to case law, regulations, case law, decisions, etc. Software that updates and retains witness information is also an invaluable addition to the modern law firm.
The face of legal research is changing through artificial intelligence (AI) implementation. ROSS Intelligence uses IBM Watson to do legal research automatically. This is conducted faster than current legal search engines are doing. AI is also used to create and review contracts a real-time-saver for lawyers.
#3. Secure File-Sharing Tools
The traditional way of sharing files in the practice of law, like sending them between offices and clients or sharing them by email, are not exactly secure.
Working remotely required more sophisticated and secure sharing solutions for communicating with clients, sharing case-related documents among colleagues, and getting signatures. Luckily, several solutions are available to law firms, including Dropbox and IBM Aspera. The best tools for a law practice offer flexibility, allow the revoking of access if needed, and offer regular and stringent security checks.
#4. Computer-Generated Evidence and Simulations
Software that can run all the possible scenarios of a car accident, crime scene, and ballistics calculations can help legal teams save time and money. In addition, these simulations and computer-generated evidence can replace expert witnesses, helping determine cases faster.
#5. Electronic Signatures
The technology that allows electronic signatures means that the legal office can now easily transition to going paperless. E-signatures are not legally binding in all situations (in some states, a will must still have a wet signature), but they make the completion of some documents fast and effortless. They save money and leave a smaller margin for human error. One of the most popular tools for e-signatures is the Clio Suite.
#6. Seamless Discovery Process
The discovery process and exchange of information between the parties involved in litigation usually means going through a significant amount of paperwork. The technology of eDiscovery makes it easier for a law firm to put the data together and share it. In addition, discovery software automates the process by filtering information while automatically scanning for viruses.
#7. Firm Profitability and Management
Productivity in a law firm is vital to ensuring it retains clients and turns a profit. Unfortunately, it is impossible to accurately track every lawyer’s time with clients and do the billing manually. Several legal tools offer automated features for tracking legal time and expenses, with automatic billing features.
Finally, every legal office can run more effectively if it takes advantage of the latest document automation tools. These streamline the process of preparing motions or writing letters, helping sync all the available information, and they store everything securely. For example, LawCloud and Clio Manage are tools for better legal office organization.
Last Word
These are just some technological breakthroughs that are changing the way we practice law while also helping with law firm growth. Others include mobile apps, accepting online payments, and CRM tools.
Every law firm can become more efficient, profitable, and client-centered, even if it just starts by using the essential tools before graduating to the more sophisticated ones.

How does technology affect the law?

How is technology affecting the law?
Maybe the question should be, how isn’t technology affecting the law? Technology seems to affect everything, and the “law” is part of everything.
Technology has certainly affected and improved law firm efficiency. Lawyers can now work from home, even before they get to their office. They can work from the road, on the way into work (yes, lawyers email and text while driving, although hopefully that is being reduced or at least being done by voice activation and dictation).
But perhaps more importantly, how is technology affecting cases and client matters? There are many answers to this query. First of all, clients now can contact their lawyers much more easily (whether the lawyer responds in a timely manner is another matter). But not only can a client now contact their attorney by email, voicemail, text or Facebook, there is something great about the ability for a client to express themselves and not simply have to leave a generic message with a receptionist and await a return phone call. Clients can now “get it off their chest” and leave specific details so that when the lawyer responds, the response can be helpful and not just “what can I do for you?” So in essence, one of the best ways technology affects the law is by improving lawyer-client communication.
And technology helps in many other ways. The ability to take depositions from out-of-state witnesses by video call, the ability to conference call lawyers, witnesses and judges in other states by phone or video, the ability to gather and transmit voluminous documents electronically instead of printing, copying, shipping, etc. are all ways technology has helped “the law."  Not only do these technological advances save us all time, they save us cost. We can now store millions of items without the cost of significant storage fees. We can save money on rent. If a lawyer does not need to have a place for lots and lots of documents, they can rent a smaller office, or in fact, can practice from home or even through a virtual office.
Technology helps the law, or lawyers in other ways too. Lawyers market via the internet and people searching for a lawyer now have much more access to information about the lawyer they are considering hiring. There are internet reviews and even the lawyer’s own website or Facebook page for the consumer to review before committing to a certain lawyer or law firm.
So in general, technology has made communication better, and information more accessible. And if the law’s true purpose is the pursuit of justice, and a prerequisite for finding justice is determining the truth, well, technology certainly is a tool — and provides tools — to help us all discover the truth, and to communicate it, and to communicate about it, much more easily. We have come so far just in my lifetime, and we have only scratched the surface. Worldwide video of almost everything seems to be on the horizon. I look forward to the next advances and am grateful as a lawyer and as a human being, to live in such a time of daily advances in technology.

Artificial Intelligence and Law
Merriam-Webster defines artificial intelligence as “an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence” and “the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior.” As a technology enthusiast, I spent much of my time in law school and subsequently in my career exploring the application of artificial intelligence to the analytical skills needed for successful lawyering. I am convinced that although “machines” may assist in significant and meaningful ways, they are not yet (and I am doubtful if they will ever be) able to fully replace the value of skilled lawyer involvement in the provision of legal services. Having said that, I admit that there are many areas of legal services lawyers have traditionally provided that a machine can very easily and will eventually replace.

Technology has truly affected Law, and still affecting it. In developing countries, d impact needs more statutory engineering in terms of legal backing for d operation of IT in Nigeria and other African countries. 
Also in do area of marketing and advertisement, IT has broken the barriers without necessarily diminishing the reasoning beyond non advertisement by Lawyers. It is a true business instrument for the growth of business of Law.

Randy Kessler, your post is apt and is in all fours with what Hugh Collins of the London School of Economics & Political Science said in the distant past: “Futurologists often describe worlds in which machines replace men- invariably they exaggerate the imminence of these technological developments. Yet even a cautious assessment of the likely impact on the legal profession of desktop computers linked by networks to complex software and large databases must acknowledge the probability of substantial alterations in routine legal practice”. In Nigeria we were witnesses to our inability to tender and make admissible computer generated evidence until the Nigerian Evidence Act 1945 was amended in 2011. For a fact, technology will continue to play a major role in commerce which will sometimes snowball into litigation. Where we delay in flowing with technology, litigants, lawyer and the judicial system suffers. We have no choice but to amend and flow with the tide. Indeed, ‘Technology seems to affect everything, and the “law” is part of everything’.

Could written interrogatories be submitted electronically, and, if so, then which measures could be taken to ensure the person interrogated is also the respondent?  Kind of like the I'm-not-a-robot test?  Or maybe such testimony remains of little legal effect.

How Technology Changes Legal Careers
Legal Careers Trends and Topics
Legal Technology and the Modern Law Firm
•••
By
Sally Kane
Updated on July 28, 2019
As advances in law technology revolutionize today’s legal landscape, the role of the legal professional has evolved. The automation of legal processes has prompted lawyers, paralegals, legal secretaries, and other legal professionals to become proficient at an ever-increasing array of word processing, spreadsheet, telecommunications, database, presentation, and legal research software. Law technology has impacted every aspect of the legal field, from the law firm and corporate practice to courtroom operation and document management.
Law Firm Technology
In law firms, electronic billing (“e-billing”) is gradually replacing traditional paper invoices. Technology has also become an important legal marketing tool and new law firm websites, and legal blogs spring up daily in cyberspace.
Electronic case management has also changed how documents are handled. Firms are now storing voluminous case files electronically and employing databases to track, edit, search, distribute, and archive documents.
Bickel & Brewer, a Dallas-based law firm, illustrates the extent technology has changed legal processes. “We image virtually everything that comes into the office…every single piece of paper, even a not then we send the images to our 24-hour staff in India,” says William Brewer, III, the firm’s co-founder, and co-managing partner. This system helps organize all firm data and provides a constant universal backup to the firm’s onshore docketing system.
Corporate
Technology is equally important in corporate legal departments. Computer programs exist for almost every corporate function, including filing trademarks and patents, tracking directors' stock holdings, preparing budgets, tracking subsidiary data, creating organizational charts, and monitoring outside counsel fees.
Technology in the Courtroom
E-filing - filing documents electronically with the court - has become commonplace and Federal and state courts are posting court filings on web-based databases, allowing counsel to access court documents remotely. A growing number of courtrooms are now equipped with all the bells and whistles of an electronic age. Built-in monitors and equipment facilitate the use of trial presentation software and other technology in the courtroom.
Legal Professionals
Lawyers, paralegals, and other legal professionals are using technology more than ever before, operating database applications specific to their practice area and using video conference tools and other electronic devices to complete daily tasks.
While law libraries are not extinct, electronic legal research prevails as the most common method of legal research. Legal professionals use a wide range of legal databases to perform research, verify case law, and track data. Westlaw and Lexis/Nexis continue to be among the most widely used legal research databases, although new software products are constantly entering the market.
E-Discovery
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enacted in late 2006 have further fueled the need for tech-savvy legal professionals. The new Federal Rules require parties in litigation to preserve and produce documents that exist only in electronic form (“e-documents”) such as e-mails, voicemails, graphics, instant messages, e-calendars and data on handheld devices.
The time-intensive process of reviewing and producing millions of pages of electronic information has spawned a new host of litigation database management tools. This database technology allows legal professionals to image, code, analyze, review, and manage the massive amounts of electronic evidence, a process called “electronic database discovery” (EDD).
E-discovery and the growing use of electronic litigation database tools have even given birth to a brand new profession, the litigation supports professional, to implement and manage these new technology tools.
Although the conservative legal industry has been slow to embrace technology, it now infiltrates every aspect of law practice. The American Bar Association’s legal blog directory provides more information on technology in the legal field.

Technology in law is the new norm
August 3, 2021
Technology is redefining the legal field. Online research databases have replaced law books, digital contracts have replaced physical copies, and countless other advancements have transformed the legal industry. These modern solutions help make a law firm’s routine tasks easier and more efficient for everyone. Since technology isn’t going away, it’s time to make sure you are investing in the right tech solutions that fit your firm’s current needs.
Law firms who invest in new technology reap many benefits, many of which are in our white paper: How technology drives law firm modernization. Before your firm invests in new products, it’s important to understand why you should spend the money on technology, and how to start incorporating it into your firm’s practices.
Why your law firm should invest in new legal technology
Although most firms already have some sort of technology, it’s important to continually reassess your firm’s needs and goals. Whether it’s giving clients a self-service portal or having a digital workflow for streamlined processes, new legal tech products can solve many problems your firm faces. Your firm can reach more of its goals due to the benefits that this type of technology provides, including:
Increased efficiency and productivity: Current technology can help you perform routine tasks quickly and easily. For example, you’ll complete a court document faster if you have a template to work off.
Optimized workflow: Lawyers need to communicate quickly and easily with colleagues and with clients, and they also need to work together to complete complex legal work efficiently. Using software to help manage your legal matters can help you build step-by-step processes, create easy-to-use checklists for routine tasks, and stick to key deadlines.
Better client service: Clients want to be involved, and it helps to have simple processes when working with them to keep them in the loop. A client portal can help here. Some solutions allow clients to send a completed form back to you at the click of a button.
The benefits of new legal technology products make the costs worth it. When lawyers are more efficient and processes are streamlined, you can focus on what truly matters: your clients. With clients at the center of your firm, it can help your organization’s reputation and quality of work.
How to start incorporating new technology in your law firm
You may feel overwhelmed when looking at legal solutions. Luckily, there are a few initial steps to take for those who want to update their legal technology. Some of the steps are:
Assess your needs: Make sure the technology fits your firm’s situation. Ask yourself: What do you do now at your law firm, and how? What is causing unnecessary stress? What could you do differently? What is your biggest priority?
Research legal solutions: There’s an overwhelming amount of legal technology options. Look at what technology is out there and get your network’s opinions on what they use. Talking to those who are in the know can provide better insight rather than solely getting product demos.
Plan: Investing and installing new legal technology is a big project. You may need external help to help your firm set up, run, and maintain the new solution. Consider hiring someone who can properly implement it and teach you how to use it.
Ensure people and processes can adapt: New technology requires administrative work to set up. Rather than only adding extra work to someone’s plate, make sure the solution has some benefit. Ensure everyone can adapt to the product by communicating what the new technology is, new processes or changes, and the benefits that come with the solution.
Taking into consideration these points will help guide you towards the right solution for you. It will also ensure the new legal technology gets implemented smoothly. Since these solutions can get expensive, you need to make sure you thoroughly prepare and execute the transition.
Technology is driving the legal industry more than ever before. By investing in newer solutions, you can be more efficient, increase your firm’s productivity, and better serve your clients.

5 Ways Technology Is Changing the Legal Profession - FirstLight
Home > Resource HQ > Blog > Blog >
5 Ways Technology Is Changing the Legal Profession
In an article published last year, Rachel Buchanan, a marketing executive at LexisNexis, called attention to how the law profession has embraced technology. Technology has enabled the law profession to automate processes and operate more like the business sector.
Part of what is spurring the technology revolution in law is the digitization of case law. Last year, the Harvard Law School Library announced the completion of its Caselaw Access Project (CAP), in which Harvard’s entire case law library was scanned, thereby digitizing 334 years of legal history. The CAP project makes state and federal decisions readily accessible to lawyers all over the U.S.
Technology makes lawyers’ jobs easier and improves the accessibility and quality of legal services while reducing costs.
Here are 5 ways technology is transforming the law:
1) Streamlining Lawyer/Client Communications
The 2017 Law Firm Flexibility Benchmarking Survey found that 64.7% of law firms allow their lawyers to telecommute. Setting up unified communication tools enable lawyers to work remotely while diversifying the ways they communicate with clients and each other.
By using these tools, lawyers are able to be more productive. Lawyers can communicate with clients wherever and whenever they are needed.
Unified Communication and Collaboration solutions allow lawyers and clients to communicate using instant messaging, email, voicemail, or web conferencing. Clients can talk with their attorneys over the Internet in lieu of traveling to a law office.
2) Automating eDiscovery
In preparing cases, lawyers need to spend many hours sifting through documents to find relevant evidence. Today, most of these documents are digital. Evidence could come from email, mobile devices, database archives, or IoT devices. eDiscovery tasks are often relegated to paralegals. Even so, the process can be costly to clients because of the time it takes.
eDiscovery automation software uses analytics to speed up the process. Advanced analytics can search for keywords and phrases. Automation also eliminates irrelevant documents, streamlining the process.
3) Simplifying Case Management
Digital business management platforms have been adapted to meet the needs of legal case management. The software allows lawyers to automate many of the processes associated with case management, including scheduling important dates, organizing contact lists, managing documents, and entering data for billing. All the relevant information is stored in a centralized database for easy access.
Digital case management makes it easier to share documents with other lawyers in the firm when necessary. Case management platforms may be web-based, making them accessible to lawyers who are working remotely on mobile devices.
4) Leveraging Analytics
Cognitive analytics help automate time-consuming and routine legal processes. Natural language processing can be used to examine textual threads and understand the context of complex statements in legal documents.
The tech startup LawGeex uses artificial intelligence to analyze contracts and automate the editing and approval process. The organization claims it can use analytics to reduce the cost of contract reviews by 90% and save law firms 80% of the time they normally devote to contract review tasks.
5) Creating Online Communities
Online communities can help disadvantaged and underserved communities gain access to pro bono legal advice, resources, and counseling. They also connect lawyers and law students so information can be shared and issues in the profession can be debated. The American Bar Association (ABA) has its own online community, LegallyMinded.
Social media is becoming more popular as a forum for lawyers to network and collaborate. LinkedIn is a logical choice for lawyers because of its focus on professional growth and networking. However, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube also have their benefits. Lawyers can participate in online discussions or post informational videos and links to articles.
Keeping Up With Technological Disruption
New software, platforms, and communications systems are transforming the law profession. Many law firms are embracing digital transformation. However, making this transformation requires the right technological foundation. Partnering with the ideal technology provider will give your organization access to the tools you need.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what they say.

The first document is from LegalScoops and it's about seven technological breakthroughs that might change the way we practice law in 2022. It mentions things like virtual conferencing, boosted research tools with AI, secure file-sharing, electronic signatures, and more. This seems pretty relevant.

The second document is from LinkedIn, written by Randy Kessler, who's a family law attorney and professor. He talks about how technology has improved communication between lawyers and clients, made processes more efficient, and even changed how lawyers market themselves. He seems positive about the impact of technology on the legal field.

The third document is from The Balance Careers, discussing how technology has changed legal careers and law firms. It mentions e-billing, electronic case management, and the shift towards electronic research databases like Westlaw and Lexis/Nexis. It also touches on e-discovery and the importance of litigation support professionals.

The fourth document is from Thomson Reuters' legal blog, emphasizing that technology is redefining the legal field and encouraging law firms to invest in technology to improve efficiency, workflow, and client service.

The fifth document is from FirstLight, a technology provider, listing five ways technology is changing the legal profession: streamlining communications, automating e-discovery, simplifying case management, leveraging analytics, and creating online communities.

From these sources, it seems like technology has impacted law firms in several key areas:

1. **Communication and Collaboration:** Tools like virtual conferencing, secure file-sharing, and client portals have improved how lawyers communicate with clients and collaborate with each other, especially important for remote work.

2. **Research and Analysis:** AI and advanced search tools have made legal research more efficient and accurate, allowing lawyers to access and analyze vast amounts of information quickly.

3. **Document Management:** Electronic storage and management systems have replaced physical files, making document handling more efficient and accessible.

4. **Automation:** Automation of routine tasks, like contract review and e-discovery, saves time and reduces the potential for human error.

5. **Client Service:** Technologies like client portals and electronic billing provide clients with more transparency and control over their legal matters.

6. **Marketing and Business Development:** Law firms now use digital marketing strategies, including social media and SEO, to reach clients.

7. **Cybersecurity:** With increased digitalization, law firms have had to enhance their security measures to protect sensitive client data.

These changes collectively aim to make law firms more efficient, cost-effective, and better equipped to serve their clients in an increasingly digital world.

I think this covers the main ways technology has changed law firm practices. If I need more specific information or examples, I might consider looking into case studies or speaking with legal professionals about their experiences with technology adoption in their firms.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Technology has transformed law firm practices in various ways, including improved communication and collaboration through virtual tools, enhanced legal research with AI and online databases, efficient document management with electronic systems, automation of routine tasks, better client service via portals and electronic billing, effective digital marketing strategies, and strengthened cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data.}} \]
