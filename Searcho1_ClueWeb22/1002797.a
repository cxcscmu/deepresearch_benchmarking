I'm trying to understand why birth rates are falling worldwide. This is a complex issue, and I need to consider various factors that might be influencing this trend. Let me start by gathering some information.

First, I should confirm whether birth rates are indeed falling globally. I recall hearing about population growth slowing down in many countries, but I need data to support this. Maybe I can look up statistics from reliable sources like the United Nations or the World Bank.

Let me try to search for some data on global birth rates.

Most of the additional 2.3 billion people will enlarge the population of developing countries, which is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050, and will be distributed among the population aged 15-59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries will decrease.
In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to change minimally, passing from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and would have declined to 1.15 billion were it not for the projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is projected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050.
The results of the 2008 Revision incorporate the findings of the most recent national population censuses and of numerous specialized population surveys carried out around the world. The 2008 Revision provides the demographic data and indicators to assess trends at the global, regional and national levels and to calculate many other key indicators commonly used by the United Nations system.

Alright, so from the search results, it seems that global birth rates are indeed declining. For example, the Macrotrends website shows that the world birth rate was 17.668 births per 1000 people in 2022, which is a decline from previous years. Similarly, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) dashboard indicates a decreasing trend in birth rates.

But birth rates are related to fertility rates, right? I think I need to understand the difference between birth rate and fertility rate. Maybe I should look that up.

Difference between Birth Rate and Fertility Rate
May 1, 2012 Posted by Naveen
Birth Rate vs Fertility Rate
Birth rate and fertility rate are very closely related terms that are very important in population biology. Despite their close relationship, the exhibited differences between them are important to consider, and those are prominent. From the definitions of the two terms, it would not be difficult to understand that birth and fertility rates have two focuses, but in the same population.
Birth Rate
The term birth rate could be defined as the rate at which the births take place in a population during a particular time or period. Since it is a rate, the involvement of time for the number of births is very important. Usually, the period is defined for a calendar year (from 01st of January to 31st of December of a particular year).
Births, deaths immigrations, and emigrations take place in any population. Along with these factors, the growth of the population is determined, and the birth rate is very important for that. For humans, the birth rate is determined through the universal system of registration of births, deaths, and marriages. Birth rate is also known as the Natality, and the death rate is known as Mortality. The birth rate has been derived into the Crude Birth Rate (CBR), which is the number of births take place per one thousand individuals in a population. Usually, the CBR is calculated to measure the human population growth.
Birth rate or natality is important for the resource partitioning, as the available resources will be divided among individuals in a population, but the share of an individual decreases when the number of births increase. Additionally, the intraspecific competition increases with an increasing natality. Therefore, there should be a measure to control competition; mortality and immigration are some of those control measures of population growth to reduce competition.
When humans are considered, the natality has always been increasing with lowering mortality, causing an ever-increasing competition among people, but there is no sign of halting so far; instead, human birth rate causes additional problems for other species as well as for its own kind.
Fertility Rate
Fertility rate, aka total fertility rate or period total fertility rate, is an individual-specific parameter of a female, which measures the average number of children / offspring a female could give birth to over her entire lifetime. The fertility rate has been defined for a female if she would be to experience the usual age-specific fertility rates throughout her lifetime and survives throughout her reproductively viable period.
Fertility rate is an excellent indicator of the population growth, as the number of individuals increase with the increasing fertility rate until there are enough resources. Fertility rate describes the capability of females to produce offspring during their childbearing years, which is 15 – 49 for the humans. Not all women have exactly the same potential to give birth to kids, but it varies significantly across a population. Therefore, the average number is calculated, which means that the fertility rate applies for a hypothetical female based on actual information.
The fertility rate varies significantly across different countries with developed nations have low rates (1 – 2 or 2 – 3 children per female) and developing nations have high rates with sometimes up to 7 – 8 children per woman.
What is the difference between Birth Rate and Fertility Rate?
• Birth rate is a parameter of the entire population, while fertility rate is a parameter of a group of individuals in the population.
• Fertility rate determines the birth rate but, not the other way around.
• Fertility rate applies for females in the reproductive age, but there is no such restriction for birth rate.
• Birth rate is expressed in relation to a time interval, while fertility rate is expressed in relation to the number of females in the reproductive age.

What is the Difference Between Birth Rate and Fertility Rate
December 8, 2019

6 min read
The main difference between birth rate and fertility rate is that birth rate is the total number of births in a year per 1,000 individuals in a population whereas fertility rate is the number of live births in a year per 1,000 women of reproductive age in a population. Furthermore, the birth rate of a population is not age-specific while the fertility rate is age-specific. Moreover, the birth rate is the less refined way to measure fertility while the fertility rate is the more refined way to measure fertility as it accounts for the fertility of women concerning different reproductive ages.
In brief, the birth rate and fertility rate are two measurements of population growth. Generally, they are determined by the number of births per 1,000 corresponding individuals in a year.

What is Birth Rate
The birth rate is the total number of live births per 1,000 individuals of a population in a year. However, this also refers to the crude birth rate. Here, the crude birth rate depends on the gender and age structure of the individuals of the population. It is higher when the population is rich in women of reproductive age.
Figure 1: Countries by Crude Birth Rate (CBR) in 2017
Typically, when the number of births remains relatively stable within a population, the crude birth rate decreases. It is mainly due to not having as many children as in the past. Furthermore, the crude birth rate also decreases when a particular population has a lower percentage of women of reproductive age. T he average global birth rate was 18.5 births per 1,000 total population in 2016.
What is Fertility Rate
Fertility rate (FR) is the number of live births per 1,000 women in the reproductive age, which is 15 to 49. Fertility rates differ with different reproductive ages of women. Generally, the most fertile age group of women is 25-34. However, the crude birth rate considers the percentage of women in different reproductive rates in the population, usually, between 15 to 49. Therefore, when measuring the fertility of a particular population, the fertility rate becomes the most refined method, allowing the measuring of fertility by different age groups.
Figure 2: Map of Countries by Fertility Rate (2018), According to CIA World Factbook
The age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) refers to the fertility rate at a particular age. Basically, women with increased maternal age tend to develop health problems affecting pregnancy, including high blood pressure, diabetes, preterm birth , fetal growth restriction, and low lying placenta. In addition to this, the total fertility rate (TFR) refers to the average number of children borne per women of child-bearing age. It was 1.67 children in 2001 but, nowadays, it is 2. That means; women today have, on average, two children during their lifetime. However, when the TFR is less than 2.1 children born per woman in a steady population, the size of the population declines. Some of the reasons behind declined fertility rates include the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, greater access to abortion, higher levels of education among women, higher participation rates in the labor force for women, unstable employment, increased urbanization, and economic instability.
Similarities Between Birth Rate and Fertility Rate
Birth rate and fertility rate are two measurements of population growth.
They are determined by the number of births per 1,000 corresponding individuals in a year.
The population of the given area has to remain stable during measuring the birth rate and fertility rate. Therefore, there is no immigration or emigration.
Difference Between Birth Rate and Fertility Rate
Definition
The birth rate is the total number of births in a year per 1,000 individuals in a population while fertility rate is the number of live births in a year per 1,000 women of reproductive age in a population.
Measurement Nowadays
Moreover, t he average global birth rate was 18.5 births per 1,000 total population in 2016 while today, the total fertility rate is 2.
Targeted Entity of the Population
The total number of individuals in the population is considered in the birth rate, while only women in the reproductive age in a population are considered in the fertility rate.
Relationship with Age
While the birth rate of a population is not age-specific, the fertility rate is age-specific.
Importance in Measuring Fertility
The crude birth rate is the less refined way to measure fertility because it measures fertility by taking total individuals in the population into account. In contrast, the fertility rate is the more refined way to measure fertility because it measures fertility by taking the different reproductive ages of women into account.
Conclusion
The birth rate is one of the measurements of population growth. Generally, it measures the total number of births per 1,000 individuals in a population in a particular year. In contrast, the fertility rate is another measurement of population growth, considering the number of live births per 1,000 women of reproductive age in a population in a particular year. However, the fertility rate is the most refined way to measure the fertility of a population as it measures fertility in different ages of women of reproductive ages. The highest fertility rate occurs in the middle of the reproductive age of women. Therefore, the main difference between birth rate and the fertility rate is the type of measurement and their importance in measuring fertility.

What is fertility rate? Definition and examples
Fertility rate is the average number of babies born to females during their reproductive years. In other words, the total number of children that would be born to each human female if she lived to the end of her child-bearing years. We get a country’s fertility rate by summing the single-year age-specific rates at a given time.
We can also use the terms total fertility rate (TFR) and absolute/potential natality.
TFR is the single most important factor in any country’s population growth. Another factor is, for example, in the advanced economies, immigration.
Life expectancy is also a factor that influences a country’s total population. In this context, life expectancy refers to how long we expect the people in a country or area to live.
By the end of this century, the global fertility rate will have declined considerably. (Data Source: United Nations)
Ideal fertility rate
For a country to maintain its population, women, on average, should have 2.1 children. Those children should survive to at least the age of fifteen.
The figure of 2.1 children assumes that there is no emigration or immigration.
The United States, United Kingdom, and other advanced economies can maintain their populations with relatively low TFRs. This is because they have high levels of immigration, i.e., many people come from abroad to live there permanently.
According to Britannica.com:
“[FTR is the] average number of children born to women during their reproductive years .”
“For the population in a given area to remain stable, an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is needed, assuming no immigration or emigration occurs.”
Birth vs. fertility rate
Do not confuse birth rates with fertility rates. Many online dictionaries explain birth rate with the same meaning as fertility rate – this is a mistake!
Birth Rate
Birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 women in the total population. We usually calculate this figure on an annual basis.
In 2016, the average birth rate globally was 18.5 births per 1,000 total population.
If a country has a very low birth rate, it has to deal with an aging population, i.e., a growing proportion of elderly people. Japan has the world’s lowest birth rate.
Fertility rate
TFR is the average number of babies that would be born to a woman during her fertile years. In other words, the number of babies, on average, born to women aged between about 15 and 49.
The rate only includes women who survive at least through the end of their reproductive lives.
Fertility on a personal level
On a personal level, a person’s fertility refers to their ability to reproduce.
In the United States, approximately ten percent of all women aged between 15 and 44 have difficulty either getting or staying pregnant. Problems with ovulation are the main cause of infertility among women. Fibroids, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory disease are other common causes. Fortunately, if you and your partner are unable to conceive, you can reach out to egg or sperm banks like Cryos International in order to make your dream of having a family come true.
Varicocele, when the veins in a man’s testicle(s) are too large, can affect the shape or number of sperm, leading to male infertility. A low sperm count and sperm that are not moving properly are the main causes of male fertility.
Couples who have fertility problems have a number of options, including IVF, surrogacy, and adoption. If you are thinking about undergoing IVF treatment, you first need to ask yourself: “ What is IVF ?”  Before deciding to undergo any medical procedure, you should first gain a better understanding of what it is and what it involves.
Fertility clinics usually use the term IVF success rate to talk about how successful treatment is. Live birth rate is considerd as the single most important IVF success rate. Finally, women have a baby through IVF, that is the most important outcome.

Fertility
There are a number of different ways, taking different factors into account, to measure fertility rate.
Learning Objectives
Examine the impact of fertility rates on society and the various ways fertility is computed and discussed
Key Takeaways
Key Points
There are a number of different approaches to measuring fertility rate —such as crude birth rate (CBR), general fertility rate (GFR), child-woman ratio (CWR), total fertility rate (TFR), gross reproduction rate (GRR), and net reproduction rate (NRR).
Fertility rates are influenced by a number of factors, including intentional measures such as contraception and major social events.
Demographers have posited a demographic-economic paradox, in which fertility rates decline as countries become more economically developed.
Almost universally, higher levels of educational attainment correspond to lower fertility rates.
Key Terms
fertility: The birthrate of a population; the number of live births per 1000 people per year.
contraception: The use of a device or procedure to prevent conception as a result of sexual activity.
fecundity: Ability to produce offspring.
In demography, fertility refers to the actual production of offspring, rather than the physical capability to produce, which is called fecundity. To estimate how quickly a population is growing, demographers must know how frequently people are added to the population by being born, so they measure fertility. There are a number of different approaches to measuring fertility rate—such as crude birth rate (CBR), general fertility rate (GFR), child-woman ratio (CWR), total fertility rate (TFR), gross reproduction rate (GRR), and net reproduction rate (NRR).
Period Measures
Crude birth rate (CBR) is the number of live births in a given year per 1,000 people alive at the middle of that year. General fertility rate (GFR) is the number of births in a year divided by the number of women of childbearing age (usually 15 to 49 years old, or sometimes 15 to 44 years old), times 1000. It focuses on potential mothers only, and takes the age distribution into account. Child-Woman Ratio (CWR) is the ratio of the number of children under 5 to the number of women 15-49, times 1000.
Cohort Measures
Age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) is the number of births in a year to women in a 5-year age group, divided by the number of all women in that age group, times 1000. The usual age groups are 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, etc.
Total fertility rate (TFR) is the total number of children a woman would bear during her lifetime if she were to experience the prevailing age-specific fertility rates of women and survive until the end of her reproductive life. TFR equals the sum for all age groups of 5 times each ASFR rate. The TFR is a synthetic rate, not based on the fertility of any real group of women since this would involve waiting until they had completed childbearing. The TFR represents the average number of children a woman would have were she to fast-forward through all her childbearing years in a single year, under all the age-specific fertility rates for that year.
Total Fertility Rate: This map shows countries coded by total fertility rates, with 0-1 children at the bottom of the spectrum and 7-8 at the top. A number of factors, such as development index and religious tradition, contribute to variations in fertility rates.
The TFR (or TPFR—total period fertility rate) is a better index of fertility than the crude birth rate because it is independent of the age structure of the population, but it is a poorer estimate of actual completed family size than the total cohort fertility rate. In particular, the TFR does not necessarily predict how many children young women now will eventually have, as their fertility rates in years to come may change from those of older women now.
Gross reproduction rate (GRR) is the number of girl babies who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates. It assumes that all of the baby girls will grow up and live to at least age 50. Like the TFR, the GRR ignores life expectancy. It assumes that all women will survive at least until the end of their reproductive lives.
Net reproduction rate (NRR) starts with the GRR and adds the realistic assumption that some of the women will die before age 59; therefore they will not be alive to bear some of the potential babies that were counted in the GRR. NRR is always lower than GRR, but in countries where mortality is very low, almost all the baby girls grow up to be potential mothers, and the NRR is practically the same as GRR.
Factors Impacting Fertility
Human fertility depends on a long list of factors, including physical health and nutrition, sexual behavior, culture, instinct, endocrinology, timing, economics, way of life, and emotions. Fertility rates vary among countries and cultures because these factors vary. Demographers study the factors that affect fertility in order to better understand fertility patterns and their variance. Three of the major categories they study are physical health and nutrition, sexual behavior and human fertility, and political issues regarding childbirth and childrearing.
Fertility Rate and Human Development Index: Fertility has been found to correlate to human development index, with more developed countries having lower fertility rates than less developed ones.
Population Control
The birth rate is an issue of concern for many governments and policymakers. Some, including those of Italy and Malaysia, seek to increase the national birth rate using pronatal measures such as financial incentives to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate, such as China’s former one-child policy.
In some places, government policies have been focused on reducing birth rates by improving women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights. Typically, high birth rates have been associated with health impairments and low life expectancy, low living standards, low status of women, and low levels of education. There are claims that as countries go through economic development and social change, birth rate declines. Indeed, demographers consistently find that one of the strongest predictors of fertility rates is women’s educational attainment. Almost universally, higher levels of educational attainment correspond to lower fertility rates.
Mortality
Mortality rate measures the number of deaths in a population over a given period of time.
Learning Objectives
Explain the various ways mortality is calculated, such as the crude death rate, infant mortality rate and life expectancy
Key Takeaways
Key Points
Like fertility, mortality rate can be measured in a number of ways.
Specific measures of mortality include the crude death rate, the infant mortality rate, and life expectancy.
Infant mortality rates measure the annual number of deaths of chldren less than 1 year old per thousand live births.
Life expectancy measures the number of years that an individual at a given age can expect to live, given present mortality rates.
Different causes of death become more or less prevalent as countries become more economically developed, and death rates vary between countries.
Different causes of death become more or less prevalent as countries become more economically developed, and death rates vary between countries.
Key Terms
Causes of death: The causes of death tend to vary between countries. For example, mortality due to malnutrition tends to be much higher in developing countries, whereas in developed countries, people are more likely to die of age-related diseases.
life table: In actuarial science and demography, a life table is a table which shows, for each age, what the probability is that a person of that age will die before his or her next birthday (“probability of death”).
crude death rate: the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people
Mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a particular population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit of time. Mortality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year; thus, a mortality rate of 9.5 (out of 1,000) in a population of 1,000 would mean 9.5 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. This measure is also called the crude death rate. As of July 2009 the crude death rate for the whole world is about 8.37 per 1000 per year according to the current CIA World Factbook.
Just as demographers measure fertility in different ways, they also measure mortality in various ways. Some of the more common demographic measures of mortality include the crude death rate (the annual number of deaths per 1000 people), the infant mortality rate, or the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per thousand live births, and life expectancy, which measures the number of years that an individual at a given age can expect to live, given present mortality rates.
Like fertility, mortality also depends on the age and gender distribution of a population. Older people are more likely to die, so countries with a higher proportion of old people may also have a higher mortality rate. Similarly, men and women may have different life expectancies; therefore, mortality rates can vary with the gender distribution of a population. Thus, for example, the number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite life expectancy being higher in developed countries due to better standards of health. This happens because developed countries typically have a completely different population age distribution, with a much higher proportion of older people, due to both lower recent birth rates and lower mortality rates.
To more accurately estimate mortality rates, demographers calculate age and gender specific mortality rates. These rates are compiled in a life table, which shows the mortality rate separate for each age group and gender. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.
Like fertility, mortality rates vary between countries, especially between developing and developed countries. Overall, developing countries tend to have higher mortality rates, higher infant mortality rates, and lower life expectancies. The causes of death also tend to vary between countries. For example, mortality due to malnutrition tends to be much higher in developing countries, whereas in developed countries, people are more likely to die of age-related diseases.
Sociologists have theorized that one of the best predictors of longevity, or a high life expectancy, is education, even when other factors are controlled, people with more education tend to live longer. A few additional years of schooling statistically corresponds to several additional years of life expectancy and vastly improved health in old age. The mechanism through which this works is not the schooling itself, but rather schooling’s influence on other health-related behaviors. Education tends to lower the likelihood of smoking and engaging in unhealthy and high risk behaviors. Education also increases the probability of engaging in healthy behaviors, like exercise.
Crude Death Rate by Country: The crude death rate is a measure of how many people per 1000 members of a population die each year. It varies between countries based on various economic, social, and environmental factors.
Migration
Migration is the movement by people from one place to another.
Learning Objectives
Discuss the types of migration in society and the various theories that explain migration
Key Takeaways
Key Points
Migration is the physical movement by people from one place to another; it may be over long distances, such as from one country to another, and can occur as individuals, family units, or large groups.
Lee’s laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavorable about the area that an immigrant is coming from; pull factors are things that attract the immigrant to the new location.
Types of migration include seasonal migration, urbanization, suburbanization, and forced migration.
International migration is known as immigration.
Sociologists use multiple theories to explain migration based on economic and social factors.
Key Terms
Seasonal migration: Movement from one place to another generally associated with agriculture and tourism; seasonal agricultural migrants follow crop cycles, moving from place to place to plant or harvest crops.
emigration: The movement of a person or persons out of a country or national region, for the purpose of permanent relocation of residence.
immigration: The passing or coming of a person into a country for the purpose of permanent residence.
Human Migration
Migration is the physical movement by people from one place to another; it may be over long distances, such as from one country to another, and can occur as individuals, family units, or large groups. When referring to international movement, migration is generally called immigration.
Lee’s laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavorable about the area that an immigrant is coming from; pull factors are things that attract the immigrant to the new location.Historically, migration has been nomadic, meaning people sustained movement from place to place over their lifetimes. Although only a few nomadic people have retained this lifestyle in modern times, migration continues as both involuntary migration (such as the slave trade, human trafficking, and ethnic cleansing) and voluntary migration within a region, country, or beyond. Specific types of migrants can include colonizers (who forcefully enter into a country or territory), refugees (who are forced to flee their country), and temporary migrants (who travel to a new place temporarily, such as business travelers, tourists, or seasonal farm workers).
Along with fertility and mortality, migration is one of three major variables studied by demographers to measure population change.
Types of Migration
Seasonal migration is generally associated with agriculture and tourism. Seasonal agricultural migrants follow crop cycles, moving from place to place to plant or harvest crops. Some countries, including the United States, allow special permits for seasonal agricultural workers to temporarily work in the country without granting full citizenship rights. Seasonal tourists seek out certain natural amenities, like snow-capped mountains for skiing and winter sports or desert sunshine for a break from oppressive winters.
Urbanization refers to migration from rural to urban areas. Since the 1970s, urbanization has become more common in developing countries, where industrialization has made agriculture more efficient and has increased the demand for urban labor. Previously, massive urbanization also took place in developed countries; beginning in Britain in the late eighteenth century, millions of agricultural workers left the countryside and moved to the cities.
Industrialization also sparked transnational labor migration that has further swelled urban populations. In the early twentieth century, transnational labor migration reached a peak of three million migrants per year. During this period, emigration rates were especially high in Italy, Norway, Ireland and the Guangdong region of China.
In the United States, industrialization also led to considerable internal migration (or human migration within a nation) of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North. From 1910-1970, approximately seven million African Americans migrated north to escape both poor economic opportunities and considerable political and social prejudice in the South. They settled in the industrial cities of the Northeast, Midwest, and West, where relatively well-paid jobs were available. This phenomenon came to be known in the United States as the Great Migration.
In many developed countries, urbanization has slowed and the population has begun to move out of cities — in some cases back to rural areas, but most frequently, to newly-built suburbs. The movement from cities to surrounding suburbs is called suburbanization and represents yet another form of internal migration.
Yet another kind of migration, forced migration refers to the coerced movement of a person or persons away from their home or home region. It has been a means of social control under authoritarian regimes, taking the form of ethnic cleansing, slave trades, human trafficking, and forced displacement.
Theories of Migration
According to neoclassical economic theory, labor migration is motivated primarily by wage differences between two geographic locations. These differences can usually be explained by differences in the supply of and demand for labor. Areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital will have a high relative wage, whereas areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital will have a low relative wage. Following neoclassical principles, migrants tend to move from low-wage areas to high-wage areas where their labor is in higher demand.
The new economics of labor migration theory criticizes neoclassical economic theory for its narrow focus on individual decisions. According to the new economics theory, migration flows and patterns cannot be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives. Instead, wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migrants may choose to move in order to reduce the social and economic risk that a household experiences as a result of having insufficient income. The household, in this case, needs extra capital, which can be attained by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad and send money back home as remittances. These remittances can also have a broader effect on the economy of the receiving country as a whole as they bring in capital.
World systems theory looks at migration from a global perspective.It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies. Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentives to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains.
Net Migration Rates by Country: Social, economic, and environmental conditions (such as unemployment, drought, or conflict) can drive large numbers of people to migrate across national borders, as shown by this map. Positive migration rates are indicated in blue; negative migration rates in orange; stable in green; and no data in gray.

Total fertility rate (TFR) in simple terms refers to total number of children born or likely to be born to a woman in her life time if she were subject to the prevailing rate of age-specific fertility in the population. TFR of about 2.1 children per woman is called Replacement-level fertility (UN, Population Division).

People also ask,  what is the replacement fertility rate?
“ Replacement level fertility ” is the total fertility rate —the average number of children born per woman—at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next, without migration. This rate is roughly 2.1 children per woman for most countries, although it may modestly vary with mortality rates.
Subsequently, question is,  what does replacement fertility mean? Replacement level fertility and future population growth. PIP: Replacement level fertility is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. In developed countries, replacement level fertility can be taken as requiring an average of 2.1 children per woman.
Also question is,  what is the difference between fertility rate and total fertility rate?
The general fertility rate is an age/sex-specific birth rate while the total fertility rate is an age/sex-adjusted birth rate. The TFR is an age-adjusted rate because it is based on the assumption that there are the same number of women in each age group.
How does total fertility rate affect population growth?
Generally speaking, when the TFR is greater than 2.1, the population in a given area will increase, and when it is less than 2.1, the population in a given area will eventually decrease, though it may take some time because factors such as age structure, emigration, or immigration must be considered.
When did China impose the one child policy?

What country has zero population growth?
According to the Population Reference Bureau, Austria and Russia had zero population growth rates in 2014. The following countries had growth rates within one tenth of zero: Slovenia, Spain, Italy, Greece, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovakia, Belarus, Monaco, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, and Taiwan.
How are fertility rates calculated?
The total fertility rate can be calculated using age-specific birth rates. The TFR is the calculation of adding up all the age-specific birth rates for a population and multiplying by five. (The sum is multiplied by five because the age-specific birth rates are in 5-year increments.)

Why are fertility rates decreasing?
The fall in fertility rate is not down to sperm counts or any of the things that normally come to mind when thinking of fertility. Instead it is being put down to three key factors: Fewer deaths in childhood meaning women have fewer babies. Greater access to contraception.
What affects fertility rate?
Some of the social factors that can influence fertility rates are: race, level of education, religion, use of contraceptive methods, abortion, impact of immigrantion, children as a source of labor (on family farms), children as support for couples at older ages, costs of raising children, female labor force
What is the replacement rate of births?
Replacement rates
Replacement fertility is the total fertility rate at which women give birth to enough babies to sustain population levels. According to the UN Population Division, a total fertility rate (TFR) of about 2.1 children per woman is called replacement-level fertility.
Are global fertility rates falling?
Fertility rates are in dramatic decline worldwide and world population may peak below nine billion by 2050 and then decline. If the birth rate exceeds 2.1, population numbers increase; if it is less than 2.1, population numbers decline. Birth rates below 2.1 have been common now since 1970.
How many babies does the average woman have?
So it makes sense that women can only have a fraction as many children as men. One study estimated a woman can have around 15 pregnancies in a lifetime. And depending on how many babies she births for each pregnancy, she'd probably have around 15-30 children.
How does mortality rate affect population?
Death in and of itself may or may not affect population change. Population growth, loss, and stagnation are functions of tallying up births and deaths worldwide. Some countries have very high infant mortality rates for a number of reasons, with not enough increase in births to compensate.
What country has the lowest fertility rate?
Taiwan
What is the meaning of fertility rate?
When we talk about fertility rate, we mean the number of live births in women over a specific length of time. Fertility rate is generally expressed as the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 in a calendar year.
How does fertility rate affect the economy?
On the one hand, total fertility rate has a negative effect on economic growth in the current period. On the other hand, economic growth appears at the beginning of the high fertility rate; with the acceleration of economic growth, the fertility rate declines.
How does birth rate affect population?
Growth through natural increase occurs when the birth rate exceeds the death rate. The rate of natural increase of a population depends on birth and death rates, which are strongly influenced by the population age structure.
Is low fertility really a problem?
Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard of living.

Okay, so from the search results, it's clear that birth rates are indeed falling globally. For example, the Macrotrends website shows that the world birth rate was 17.668 births per 1000 people in 2022, which is a decline from previous years. Similarly, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) dashboard indicates a decreasing trend in birth rates.

But I need to understand why this is happening. Maybe I should look into factors affecting birth rates.

First, I should clarify the difference between birth rate and fertility rate, as they seem related but distinct.

From one of the search results, I found that birth rate is the total number of births in a year per 1,000 individuals in a population, while fertility rate is the number of live births in a year per 1,000 women of reproductive age. So, fertility rate is more specific to women of childbearing age.

Probably, changes in fertility rate would directly influence birth rate. So, maybe I should focus on why fertility rates are falling.

Looking at the data, it seems that in many countries, fertility rates have dropped below the replacement level of about 2.1 children per woman. This suggests that populations in those countries are not replacing themselves, leading to a decline in population growth or even population decline.

But why are fertility rates dropping?

I recall that in more developed countries, women tend to have fewer children. Is this because of career choices, higher education, or perhaps the cost of raising children?

Maybe I should look into the factors that influence fertility rates.

What Factors Affect Fertility Rates?
By Staff Writer Last Updated March 24, 2020
The primary factors that affect a country’s total fertility rate include the significance of children as a member of the labor force and the cost of educating and rearing children, according to class notes from the Department of Geography at Hunter College. Other factors include urbanization, work opportunities for women and infant mortality rate.
Developing countries usually have higher fertility rates, particularly in rural places where children work at a young age by helping plant crops, says Hunter College. Developed countries often have lower fertility rates, because bringing up a child is considerably more expensive. Moreover, children in developed nations do not enter the workforce until they become teenagers or reach their early 20s. Urbanization is another factor that affects fertility rates, as people who live in urban regions can typically get family planning services more easily. In rural areas, people have bigger families because they need children to carry out essential tasks.
Total fertility rates are generally low in countries where women can get educational and paid employment opportunities, notes Hunter College. Women lacking educational attainment in developing nations often bear two more children than those who have a secondary school education. Places with low infant mortality rates commonly have low fertility rates, because the number of children who die young is fewer. Also, women who marry at the age of 25 or older mostly have fewer children.

4 Contributing Factors to Declining Fertility Rates: A Global Overview
Declining fertility rates are a trend nearly worldwide. Find out how factors like women's education and access to contraception have contributed to the change.

History
Fertility
Infertility
Declining fertility rates are a trend around the world. Since 1950, the total global fertility rate has dropped by half, according to The Lancet 's comprehensive Global Burden of Disease Study. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) points out that the U.S. fertility rate has been falling steadily since 2008, and has never returned to its recorded peak in 1958.
The fertility rate is defined as the average number of living children born to a woman who survives her reproductive years (ages 15–49). It is influenced by multiple factors, including economic and social change. The total fertility rate (TFR) is considered a measure of population growth. Globally, the population is growing while fertility rates continue to decline. This is because population growth is calculated based on fertility rate, death rate and migration.
But what are the primary reasons for declining fertility rates? The scientific community is not completely in agreement, but the following factors have a resounding impact.
1. Improved Educational Opportunities for Women
According to Oxford University's Our World in Data project, the social empowerment of women, particularly through increased education, has been shown to decrease fertility rates. Increased education also contributes positively to other factors that decrease fertility rates, such as higher use of contraception, better childhood health and women's participation in the workforce.
2. Lower Child Mortality
Historically, high child mortality — including infant deaths and deaths by early childhood illnesses — kept population growth low and fertility rates high. As child mortality rates have declined (dramatically in some countries) fertility rates have fallen.
3. Better Access to Contraception and Family Planning Advice
For some areas of the world, the sharpest declines in fertility rates have come from the introduction of safe, reliable access to contraception. This may include confidential access if local cultural norms or family members impede a woman's right to access birth control. The increased availability of sexual health education and family planning resources has also impacted fertility rates.
4. Increasing Societal Prosperity
U.S. News and World Report notes that high-income countries have experienced a steeper decline in fertility than low-income countries, but it's unclear whether confounding factors, such as increased educational opportunities, are responsible for this correlation.
A higher level of education fosters more prosperity and a lower number of children, according to The World Bank. However, Our World In Data speculates whether other factors such as career aspirations and changing cultural pressures around marriage might contribute to parents choosing to have fewer children — or none at all. People in many wealthier regions are getting married later in life, pursuing careers and choosing to have children later, according to The Week.
Predicting the Consequences of Lower Fertility Rates
With an aging population and a shrinking pool of younger workers, some analysts worry economic growth will decline in a way that will be difficult to overcome. Initially, as the birth rate declines, the economy grows; but when a tipping point is reached and fertility rates continue to fall, the imbalance between elderly and working-age people becomes unsustainable.
There may be beneficial impacts to the environment if the burden of population growth eases, but how that will happen is still unclear. Economists and population analysts don't yet fully understand how the social and economic consequences will play out.

population - Biological factors affecting human fertility | Britannica
Biological factors affecting human fertility
Reproduction is a quintessentially biological process, and hence all fertility analyses must consider the effects of biology. Such factors, in rough chronological order, include:
the age of onset of potential fertility (or fecundability in demographic terminology);
the degree of fecundability—i.e., the monthly probability of conceiving in the absence of contraception;
the incidence of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth;
the duration of temporary infecundability following the birth of a child; and
the age of onset of permanent sterility.
The age at which women become fecund apparently declined significantly during the 20th century; as measured by the age of menarche (onset of menstruation), British data suggest a decline from 16–18 years in the mid-19th century to less than 13 years in the late 20th century. This decline is thought to be related to improving standards of nutrition and health. Since the average age of marriage in western Europe has long been far higher than the age of menarche, and since most children are born to married couples, this biological lengthening of the reproductive period is unlikely to have had major effects upon realized fertility in Europe. In settings where early marriage prevails, however, declining age at menarche could increase lifetime fertility.
Fecundability also varies among women past menarche. The monthly probabilities of conception among newlyweds are commonly in the range of 0.15 to 0.25; that is, there is a 15–25-percent chance of conception each month. This fact is understandable when account is taken of the short interval (about two days) within each menstrual cycle during which fertilization can take place. Moreover, there appear to be cycles during which ovulation does not occur. Finally, perhaps one-third or more of fertilized ova fail to implant in the uterus or, even if they do implant, spontaneously abort during the ensuing two weeks, before pregnancy would be recognized. As a result of such factors, women of reproductive age who are not using contraceptive methods can expect to conceive within five to 10 months of becoming sexually active. As is true of all biological phenomena, there is surely a distribution of fecundability around average levels, with some women experiencing conception more readily than others.
Spontaneous abortion of recognized pregnancies and stillbirth also are fairly common, but their incidence is difficult to quantify. Perhaps 20 percent of recognized pregnancies fail spontaneously, most in the earlier months of gestation.
Following the birth of a child, most women experience a period of temporary infecundability, or biological inability to conceive. The length of this period seems to be affected substantially by breast-feeding. In the absence of breast-feeding, the interruption lasts less than two months. With lengthy, frequent breast-feeding it can last one or two years. This effect is thought to be caused by a complex of neural and hormonal factors stimulated by suckling.
A woman’s fecundability typically peaks in her 20s and declines during her 30s; by their early 40s as many as 50 percent of women are affected by their own or their husbands’ sterility. After menopause, essentially all women are sterile. The average age at menopause is in the late 40s, although some women experience it before reaching 40 and others not until nearly 60.
Contraception
Contraceptive practices affect fertility by reducing the probability of conception. Contraceptive methods vary considerably in their theoretical effectiveness and in their actual effectiveness in use (“use-effectiveness”). Modern methods such as oral pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs) have use-effectiveness rates of more than 95 percent. Older methods such as the condom and diaphragm can be more than 90-percent effective when used regularly and correctly, but their average use-effectiveness is lower because of irregular or incorrect use.
The effect upon fertility of contraceptive measures can be dramatic: if fecundability is 0.20 (a 20-percent chance of pregnancy per month of exposure), then a 95-percent effective method will reduce this to 0.01 (a 1-percent chance).
Abortion
Induced abortion reduces fertility not by affecting fecundability but by terminating pregnancy. Abortion has long been practiced in human societies and is quite common in some settings. The officially registered fraction of pregnancies terminated by abortion exceeds one-third in some countries, and significant numbers of unregistered abortions probably occur even in countries reporting very low rates.
Sterilization
Complete elimination of fecundability can be brought about by sterilization. The surgical procedures of tubal ligation and vasectomy have become common in diverse nations and cultures. In the United States, for example, voluntary sterilization has become the most prevalent single means of terminating fertility, typically adopted by couples who have achieved their desired family size. In India, sterilization has been encouraged on occasion by various government incentive programs and, for a short period during the 1970s, by quasi-coercive measures.
Mortality
As noted above, the science of demography has its intellectual roots in the realization that human mortality, while consisting of unpredictable individual events, has a statistical regularity when aggregated across a large group. This recognition formed the basis of a wholly new industry—that of life assurance, or insurance. The basis of this industry is the life table, or mortality table, which summarizes the distribution of longevity—observed over a period of years—among members of a population. This statistical device allows the calculation of premiums—the prices to be charged the members of a group of living subscribers with specified characteristics, who by pooling their resources in this statistical sense provide their heirs with financial benefits.
Overall human mortality levels can best be compared by using the life-table measure life expectancy at birth (often abbreviated simply as life expectancy), the number of years of life expected of a newborn baby on the basis of current mortality levels for persons of all ages. Life expectancies of premodern populations, with their poor knowledge of sanitation and health care, may have been as low as 25–30 years. The largest toll of death was that exacted in infancy and childhood: perhaps 20 percent of newborn children died in their first 12 months of life and another 30 percent before they reached five years of age.
Britannica Quiz
Which Country Is Larger By Population? Quiz
This quiz will show you two countries. Identify the one with the larger population. This quiz is based on Britannica’s list of the world’s populations, so review that before you start.
In the developing countries by the 1980s, average life expectancy lay in the range of 55 to 60 years, with the highest levels in Latin America and the lowest in Africa. In the same period, life expectancy in the developed countries of western Europe and North America approached 75 years, and fewer than 1 percent of newborn children died in their first 12 months.
For reasons that are not well understood, life expectancy of females usually exceeds that of males, and this female advantage has grown as overall life expectancy has increased. In the late 20th century this female advantage was seven years (78 years versus 71 years) in the industrial market economies (comprising western Europe, North America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand). It was eight years (74 years versus 66 years) in the nonmarket economies of eastern Europe.
The epidemiologic transition
The epidemiologic transition is that process by which the pattern of mortality and disease is transformed from one of high mortality among infants and children and episodic famine and epidemic affecting all age groups to one of degenerative and man-made diseases (such as those attributed to smoking) affecting principally the elderly. It is generally believed that the epidemiologic transitions prior to the 20th century (i.e., those in today’s industrialized countries) were closely associated with rising standards of living, nutrition, and sanitation. In contrast, those occurring in developing countries have been more or less independent of such internal socioeconomic development and more closely tied to organized health care and disease control programs developed and financed internationally. There is no doubt that 20th-century declines in mortality in developing countries have been far more rapid than those that occurred in the 19th century in what are now the industrialized countries.
Infant mortality
Infant mortality is conventionally measured as the number of deaths in the first year of life per 1,000 live births during the same year. Roughly speaking, by this measure worldwide infant mortality approximates 80 per 1,000; that is, about 8 percent of newborn babies die within the first year of life.
This global average disguises great differences. In certain countries of Asia and Africa, infant mortality rates exceed 150 and sometimes approach 200 per 1,000 (that is, 15 or 20 percent of children die before reaching the age of one year). Meanwhile, in other countries, such as Japan and Sweden, the rates are well below 10 per 1,000, or 1 percent. Generally, infant mortality is somewhat higher among males than among females.
In developing countries substantial declines in infant mortality have been credited to improved sanitation and nutrition, increased access to modern health care, and improved birth spacing through the use of contraception. In industrialized countries in which infant mortality rates were already low the increased availability of advanced medical technology for newborn—in particular, prematurely born—infants provides a partial explanation.
Infanticide
The deliberate killing of newborn infants has long been practiced in human societies. It seems to have been common in the ancient cultures of Greece, Rome, and China, and it was practiced in Europe until the 19th century. In Europe, infanticide included the practice of “overlaying” (smothering) an infant sharing a bed with its parents and the abandonment of unwanted infants to the custody of foundling hospitals, in which one-third to four-fifths of incumbents failed to survive.
In many societies practicing infanticide, infants were not deemed to be fully human until they underwent a rite of initiation that took place from a few days to several years after birth, and therefore killing before such initiation was socially acceptable. The purposes of infanticide were various: child spacing or fertility control in the absence of effective contraception; elimination of illegitimate, deformed, orphaned, or twin children; or sex preferences.
With the development and spread of the means of effective fertility regulation, infanticide has come to be strongly disapproved in most societies, though it continues to be practiced in some isolated traditional cultures.
Mortality among the elderly
During the 1970s and 1980s in industrialized countries there were unexpectedly large declines in mortality among the elderly, resulting in larger-than-projected numbers of the very old. In the United States, for example, the so-called frail elderly group aged 85 years and older increased nearly fourfold between 1950 and 1980, from 590,000 to 2,461,000. Given the high incidence of health problems among the very old, such increases have important implications for the organization and financing of health care.
Marriage
One of the main factors affecting fertility, and an important contributor to the fertility differences among societies in which conscious fertility control is uncommon, is defined by the patterns of marriage and marital disruption. In many societies in Asia and Africa, for example, marriage occurs soon after the sexual maturation of the woman, around age 17. In contrast, delayed marriage has long been common in Europe, and in some European countries the average age of first marriage approaches 25 years.
In the 20th century dramatic changes have taken place in the patterns of marital dissolution caused by widowhood and divorce. Widowhood has long been common in all societies, but the declines of mortality (as discussed above) have sharply reduced the effects of this source of marital dissolution on fertility. Meanwhile, divorce has been transformed from an uncommon exception to an experience terminating a large proportion (sometimes more than a third) of marriages in some countries. Taken together, these components of marriage patterns can account for the elimination of as little as 20 percent to as much as 50 percent of the potential reproductive years.
Many Western countries have experienced significant increases in the numbers of cohabiting unmarried couples. In the 1970s some 12 percent of all Swedish couples living together aged 16 to 70 were unmarried. When in the United States in 1976 the number of such arrangements approached 1,000,000, the Bureau of the Census formulated a new statistical category—POSSLQ—denoting persons of the opposite sex sharing living quarters. Extramarital fertility as a percentage of overall fertility accordingly has risen in many Western countries, accounting for one in five births in the United States, one in five in Denmark, and one in three in Sweden.

Economics influence fertility rates more than other factors

Summary:
Based on a recent study by an anthropologist, economic changes have the greatest impact on reducing family size, and thus slowing population growth, compared to other factors. Understanding the causes of declining birth rates may lead to improved policies designed to influence fertility and result in reduced competition for food, water, land and wealth.

FULL STORY
The world population could top 8 billion in the year 2023 if current growth rates remain constant, according to United Nations figures. However, if global fertility rates slow more quickly than expected, there could be up to half a billion fewer mouths to feed on Earth in 2023. Based on a recent study by a University of Missouri anthropologist, economic changes have the greatest impact on reducing family size, and thus slowing population growth, compared to other factors. Understanding the causes of declining birth rates may lead to improved policies designed to influence fertility and result in reduced competition for food, water, land and wealth.
"Improvements in economic development, such as higher educational attainment, increasing employment in the formal labor market, and the shift away from agriculture, seem to have a doubly-powerful effect because they not only raise individuals' standards of living, but also correlate to declining fertility rates, according to the results of our study," said Mary Shenk, assistant professor of anthropology in MU's College of Arts and Science. "Another important finding of our study was that intervention programs that made changes that really affected individuals achieved the best results. For example, although advertising campaigns encouraging lower fertility may reach a wider audience for less money, face-to-face intervention campaigns providing health services or access to contraception provide better results and are thus a better use of resources."
In their research, Shenk and her colleagues used data collected since 1966 from approximately 250,000 people in rural Bangladesh, along with detailed interviews of nearly 800 women from the region. Sixty-four factors related to family size were considered and organized according to three possible explanations for declines in fertility rates:
Risk and mortality -- Parents have fewer children when they have more hope that children will survive into adulthood, according to this explanation.
Economic and investment -- This explanation suggests that rising costs of children and higher payoffs to investing in self and children reduce fertility with the shift to a market economy.
Cultural transmission -- This explanation holds that social perceptions of the value of children, ideal family size and acceptance of contraception influence fertility rates.
Shenk's team used specially designed data collection and statistical methods to discern that "economic and investment" factors most clearly correlated to lower fertility. However, Shenk noted that the three possible explanations were interwoven. Although economic factors were significantly more influential, other phenomena such as mortality rates and health interventions also affect fertility decline in Bangladesh.
"Few studies have compared those three possible explanations for fertility declines to determine which had the strongest effect," said Shenk. "Population growth rates have fallen globally, starting in 18 th century Western Europe, but the exact cause was intensely debated because there are so many different explanations in the literature. Our study created a framework by which different explanations could be explicitly compared. Population data from any region could be analyzed using these methods to help researchers, government officials, health workers and others understand the key drivers of demographic change in that region."

Alright, so from the search results, there are several factors that influence fertility rates. Let me try to summarize them.

First, improved educational opportunities for women seem to have a big impact. Educated women tend to have fewer children, possibly because they prioritize their careers or because education empowers them to make different choices about family size.

Second, lower child mortality rates are linked to lower fertility rates. When more children survive infancy and childhood, parents may feel less need to have multiple children to ensure some reach adulthood.

Third, better access to contraception and family planning resources allows people to control when and how many children they have, which naturally leads to lower fertility rates.

Lastly, increasing societal prosperity seems to be associated with lower fertility rates. This could be because higher income levels allow families to invest more in fewer children, or because people delay having children to focus on their careers.

These factors make sense, but I wonder if there are other factors at play, like cultural norms or government policies.

Let me see. In some countries, there are policies that encourage or discourage having children. For example, China had the one-child policy for a long time, which definitely impacted fertility rates. Now, they've relaxed that policy, but the fertility rate is still low.

Also, cultural attitudes towards family size vary a lot. In some cultures, larger families are valued, while in others, smaller families are preferred.

I should look into how government policies and cultural norms affect fertility rates.

Abstract
We examine how strongly fertility trends respond to family policies in OECD countries. In the light of the recent fertility rebound observed in several OECD countries, we empirically test the impact of different family policy instruments on fertility, using macro panel data from 18 OECD countries that spans the years 1982–2007. Our results confirm that each instrument of the family policy package (paid leave, childcare services and financial transfers) has a positive influence on average, suggesting that the combination of these forms of support for working parents during their children’s early years is likely to facilitate parents’ choice to have children. Policy levers do not all have the same weight, however: in-cash benefits covering childhood after the year of childbirth and the provision of childcare services for children under age three have a larger potential influence on fertility than leave entitlements and benefits granted around childbirth. Moreover, we find that the influence of each policy measure varies across different family policy contexts. Our findings are robust after controlling for birth postponement, endogeneity, time-lagged fertility reactions and for different aspects of national contexts, such as female labour market participation, unemployment, labour market protection and the proportion of children born out of marriage.
Résumé
Nous examinons dans quelle mesure les tendances de la fécondité réagissent aux politiques familiales dans les pays de l’OCDE. En relation avec la ré-augmentation des taux de fécondité observés dans plusieurs pays de l’OCDE, nous testons l’influence de différentes mesures de politiques familiales sur la fécondité, sur un panel de 18 pays pour la période allant de 1982 à 2007. Nos résultats confirment que chaque mesure de cet ensemble (congé rémunéré, services d’accueil de la petite enfance et transferts financiers) ont en moyenne une influence positive sur la fécondité, suggérant que la combinaison de ces formes d’aides aux parents qui travaillent avec de jeunes enfants est susceptible de faciliter le choix d’avoir des enfants. Les différents instruments politiques n’ont toutefois pas le même poids : les prestations financières versées au-delà de la naissance et l’offre de service d’accueil pour les enfants de moins de trois ans ont une influence potentielle plus grande que les droits au congé et les aides financières associées à une naissance. De plus, l’effet de chaque mesure varie selon le contexte global constitué par les politiques familiales. Nos résultats sont robustes à différentes procédures testées pour contrôler les effets de recul de l’âge moyen à la naissance des enfants, traiter les problèmes d’endogénéité ou de décalage dans le temps de la réponse des taux de fécondité aux évolutions des politiques. Les variations de taux d’emploi des femmes, de taux de chômage ou de niveau de protection des marchés du travail sont aussi prises en compte.
Introduction
After decades of continuous decline, fertility rates have started to increase again in many OECD countries since the early 2000s. The overall rise is rather limited, with a total fertility rate (TFR) that reached a low of 1.63 in 1999 before rising to 1.71 in 2008, on average, in the OECD countries. However, many countries have experienced a more significant ‘rebound’, notably in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, Finland, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. This reversal is arguably one consequence of the ‘postponement’ of childbearing across cohorts: delayed childbearing among the younger cohorts brought down period fertility rates, but this trend was later reversed, mainly in countries where fertility increased significantly among women aged 30 and above and was not counterbalanced by a further reduction at younger ages (Goldstein et al. 2009 ).
This paper studies the extent to which the development of government policies towards families with children in the last decades has contributed to these fertility trends. Its main novelty lies in the effort to consider a comprehensive set of family policy instruments and to identify the respective influence of each item of in-cash and in-kind support on fertility by taking into account a country’s institutional context. The effect of paid leave entitlements, childcare services and financial transfers to families on fertility trends is analysed for the first time by putting together data on multiple policies for a large set of countries and for a period covering almost three decades. An original dataset has been elaborated for this purpose, covering 18 OECD countries and a period from 1982 up to 2007—the year preceding the ongoing economic crisis. Data series were obtained from combined OECD sources (mainly the family and social expenditures databases).
There is considerable evidence that family policies can influence the timing of births (for a survey, see Sleebos 2003; Gauthier 2007; Thévenon and Gauthier 2011 ), but less evidence that family policies help to significantly raise completed family size. Some cross-national studies investigate the isolated impact of money transfers, leave and childcare policies and expenditures for families on fertility rates (Gauthier and Hatzius 1997; Adsera 2004; D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole 2005; Hilgeman and Butts 2009; Kalwij 2010 ), but none of them take into account these dimensions all together (the details of these studies are presented in the last section as we confront their results with our own findings presented in the next sections).
Against this background, we assess the contribution of five different family policy instruments to variations in fertility. The panel structure of our data gives more information, variability and efficiency in comparison to time series or cross-sectional data, as it allows us to study the dynamics of adjustment and to distinguish between within-country and between-country variation.
Our contribution is threefold. First, we have broadened our scope with respect to the previous findings by considering three main types of policy instruments (cash transfers, parental leave and childcare), whereas earlier studies mostly concentrate on only one or two aspects. Two types of in-cash benefits are distinguished to separate the support granted around childbirth and the support provided later to cover the cost of raising children. Childcare is divided into spending and coverage. Thus, we can analyse the influence of different types of family support that supposedly respond to families’ needs for time, money and services at childbirth and during the childrearing period. In addition, efforts are made to filter out possible effects on fertility of birth postponement and a country’s institutional context (women’s emancipation, unemployment, labour market protection, cultural childbearing norms and the general Welfare state setting).
Second, we update previous results by focusing on a time period that covers the recent upswing in fertility rates. A key issue was thus the extent to which policies have contributed to this reversal of fertility trends.
Third, we apply panel data estimation methods that allow controlling for country- and time-invariant variables which is not possible in time series or cross-sectional studies. Most importantly, the data structure allows us to disentangle the ‘causal’ impact of policy changes from country-constant characteristics that may affect fertility levels by identifying within-country variations. Moreover, advanced estimation methods for panel data allow us to apply several robustness checks in order to control for potential endogeneity, non-stationarity, omitted variable bias (OVB) and for dynamics of adjustment.
We find that fertility trends are influenced by the long-term support parents receive in-cash but also in-kind, with the provision of childcare services that help parents (especially women) to combine work and family life. Our results confirm the positive influence on fertility of a mix of in-cash and in-kind support and suggest that the development of childcare services has a more significant impact on fertility trends at the aggregate level than policies extending leave entitlements. An increase in fertility seems, thus, to be happening as a by-product of better opportunities to combine work and family.
The second section presents theoretical arguments on why policies might matter by focussing on economic determinants of fertility, while the third section sheds light on cross-national differences in public spending on families and fertility in OECD countries since the early 1980s. The fourth section presents our empirical strategy, the fifth section discusses our results and the concluding sixth section puts our results into perspective.
Why Policies Might Matter for Fertility
Can family policies explain why in some developed countries, fertility is re-increasing? To understand the potential impact of family policies on fertility, this section presents the main economic determinants of fertility that exist in the theoretical literature. 1
First of all, increases in income that come along with economic development affect fertility behaviour, but the impact is ambiguous. An increase in income might alleviate parts of the budgetary constraint that may prevent households from having their desired number of children. Thus, children get more ‘affordable’ with increasing income, which speaks in favour of a positive income effect on fertility (Becker 1960 ). At the same time, when income increases go hand in hand with increases in individual investments in human capital, families may find it optimal to have fewer children, as to provide each child with a higher level of human capital (quantity/quality trade off; Barro and Becker 1989; Doepke 2004 ). In addition, economic growth is also likely to increase women’s education and wages (Galor and Weil 1996 ). Women might thus substitute childrearing against market labour participation due to increasing opportunity costs of staying at home (negative substitution effect, c.f. Mincer 1958 ). Consequently, higher wage earnings for women can be a causal factor of fertility decline (Blossfeld 1995; Hotz et al. 1997 ). The fertility decrease occurs all the more when the possibility to substitute maternal care by goods or purchased services is limited (Day 2004 ).
Family policies potentially contribute to re-increases in fertility as they can reduce the costs of fertility, either in monetary terms or in terms of opportunity costs. In this case, family policies would facilitate the income effect to dominate over the substitution effect.
In highly developed countries, GDP per capita increases might be associated with fertility increases, as parents not only can bear the costs of children more easily but countries are also more likely to invest in family policies such as public childcare infrastructure, childcare subsidies, in-cash benefits, parental leave, etc.
This prediction meets the empirical findings that economic development (or income increase) reduces fertility only up to a certain point. Beyond a certain GDP level, further economic development is found to stimulate a slight increase in fertility rates (Myrskylä et al. 2009 ). Luci and Thévenon (2010) show that the fertility rebound, which can be observed even after controlling for birth postponement, has been steeper in those highly developed countries where women’s labour market participation has also risen significantly over the last decades. This suggests that the impact of economic development on fertility can be positive if accompanied by better opportunities for women to combine work with family life (Ahn and Mira 2002; D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole 2005; OECD 2011 ). Thus, fertility trends are likely to depend on the extent to which family policies help households to combine work and family life.
Family policies provide parents with cash and in-kind resources and/or with possibilities to care for their children (due to parental leave). By these means, these policies support families’ standard of living, help parents to cope with work and care responsibilities, and may thus help parents to realise their fertility intentions. On the one hand, family policies are able to reduce the direct, i.e. monetary costs of children (housing, education) by the help of financial transfers. On the other hand, policies that enable parents to combine work with childbearing (due to childcare services, parental leave) reduce the indirect costs of children caused by forgone wage opportunities (Willis 1973; Hotz et al. 1997 ). Hence, in a context of increasing aggregate income coming hand in hand with increasing women’s emancipation (especially in terms of labour market participation), employment-protected leave entitlements after childbirth and public childcare services are likely to play a key role in re-increasing fertility rates (Rindfuss et al. 2010; McDonald 2006 ). These work–life balance policies can encourage mothers to continue working, encourage fathers to take a baby break from work and thus enable parents to share their family roles more equally (Gregory and Miller 2008 ). Therefore, these policies have a strong potential to reduce the gender wage gap. By this means, work–life balance policies are able to reduce opportunity costs for women, which can encourage fertility (OECD 2011 ).
Family Policies and Fertility in OECD Countries: Data and Trends
To estimate the impact of family policies on fertility trends in developed countries, we use five family policy measures as exogenous variables in our empirical analysis. Policy variables were constructed for 18 OECD countries, 2 for which information is available over the years 1982–2007. Three of the five family policy variables measure public expenditure per child. The first two concern benefits paid to families, divided into two categories to separate the support granted around childbirth from that received at a later stage:
Spending per birth (in percentage of GDP per capita), including maternity, paternity and parental leave benefits as well as birth grants
Spending on cash benefits per child under age 20 (in percentage of GDP per capita) (tax transfers and spending for childbirth not included)
Footnote
3
Spending on childcare services per child under age three (in percentage of GDP per capita)
Footnote
4
Two further family policy variables are used to capture leave and childcare policies:
The number of paid leave weeks, adding maternity leave weeks and the number of parental leave weeks that women are entitled to take after maternity leave per se
Childcare enrolment of children under age three (as a percentage of the total number of children of this age group)
For most of our empirical analysis, we use Total Fertility Rates (TFR) as endogenous variable. The TFR by year and country is the best available measure to compare fertility trends between countries. However, TFR are likely to be biased measures of fertility, as they are sensitive to changes in women’s mean age at childbearing. Birth postponement is likely to lower this period measure even if the completed family size stays unchanged. In order to control for changes in the timing of childbirth, we control our regression results for increases in mothers’ age at childbirth. We also use tempo-adjusted fertility rates (adjTFR) besides general TFR as endogenous variable. Table 1 gives an overview of all variables used in our empirical analysis.
Table 1 Summary statistics for 18 OECD countries, 1982–2007
Full size table
The deployment of family policy instruments varies with each country’s approach to policy objectives, in which fertility issues may or may not play a part (Thévenon 2011; OECD 2011 ). Nevertheless, global spending for families with children has increased considerably over the past three decades in most OECD countries as a result of growing concerns on the part of governments to promote families’ well-being and to reconcile work and family life. Figure 1 shows that the share of GDP spent by governments for families—disregarding expenditures on compulsory education—rose from an average of around 1.6 % in 1980 to 2.0–2.4 % in 2007 in the OECD. Yet, cross-country differences in the total amount transferred to families remain large, with Denmark, France, Iceland and the United Kingdom spending over 3.5 % of GDP for families, compared with just over 0.5 %, for example, in Korea.
Fig. 1
Public spending on families Note: Countries are ranked in decreasing order of total family benefit spending in 2007. Expenditure includes child payments and allowances, parental leave benefits and childcare support (e.g. spending on childcare and preschool services for children under school age). Spending on health and housing support also assists families, but is not included here. For additional details, see data source. Data source OECD (2011)

The breakdown of spending into broad categories of policy instruments also varies greatly across countries. Overall, cash payments are often the main group of expenditures, representing 1.25 % of GDP on average. Child-related tax breaks are also quite widespread among OECD countries. Only 6 out of 32 OECD countries do not grant any specific tax deductions to families. Tax-related transfers for families include tax allowances on earned income, tax credits or tax deductions for services such as childcare. As Fig. 1 shows, a large majority of OECD countries provide such tax breaks, but their relative weight in overall support to families varies quite widely. They are the main levy to support families in the United States and represent a large share of the overall money transferred to families in France and Germany.
Some OECD countries have favoured developing in-kind benefits over cash transfers and education spending. Nevertheless, at almost 0.9 % of GDP on average in the OECD, in-kind expenditures for pre-school children still represent no more than 1/3 of total expenditures for families. Denmark, France, Iceland, Finland and Sweden are the ‘big’ service providers with total in-kind expenditures of over 2 % of GDP, i.e. more than twice the OECD average. A detailed description (and illustration) of variations over time and across countries of each of our five family policy variables can be found in Luci and Thévenon (2012 ).
Note that there are many different types of leave entitlements after childbirth in OECD countries. First, working mothers are entitled to a period of maternity leave (or pregnancy leave) around the time of childbirth which protects the health of the working mother and her children and guarantees that she can return to her job within a limited number of weeks after childbirth. Fathers are also entitled to specific paternal leave at the time of childbirth, but these entitlements cover a much shorter period. Then, parental leave entitlements allow employed parents to benefit from additional weeks of ‘parental’ and/or ‘childcare’ leave if they want to continue caring for their child beyond the standard period of maternity or paternity leave. Parental leave payment (all kinds of publicly paid parental leave and birth grants) is a key determinant of parental leave uptake. However, as leave payments (lump-sum benefit or wage substitution 5) never fully replace the leave-taker’s salary, and since women very often earn less than their partners, they are more likely than men to take all or the majority of the leave entitlement. Differences in duration and payment conditions of parental leave lead to substantial variations in the amounts of public transfers per child in terms of parental leave in OECD countries.
Childcare coverage for children below age 3 is increasing in most OECD countries, but differences in coverage and spending are still large. In Denmark, about 2/3 of under-3-year-old children have a place in day care centres, whereas in Austria, care services cover only 12 %. The most noticeable is also the relatively high enrolment rate of children in the US, despite the comparatively low public spending in this country. The development of the private sector explains this figure. This points to the absence of a strict linear relation or implication between the level of government spending and the coverage rate. This is not surprising since public investments depend not only on coverage rates, but also on parameters such as quality of services and the number of care hours available.
To sum up, OECD countries have considerably increased their expenditures to support families over the past decades. All types of support have been expanded to some extent: in-cash transfers towards families with children have been increased in many countries since the early 1980s, but the relative share of GDP per capita invested per child has grown at a slower rate since the mid 1990s or has decreased in some countries. Overall, remarkable differences still exist across countries in the way policy instruments are combined to provide support to families. Differences especially concern the extent and form of support provided to working parents with children under age three (Thévenon 2011 ). In that respect, Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) outdistance the other OECD countries, providing comprehensive support to working parents with very young children (below 3 years of age). English-speaking countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom New Zealand and the United States) provide much less in-time and in-kind support to working parents with very young children, while financial support is greater but very much targeted on low-income families and on preschool children. Continental and Eastern European countries form a more heterogeneous group with a more intermediate position. Two exceptions are France and Hungary, which provide relatively generous support for working parents compared with other countries of this group.
Figure 2 shows that in parallel to the fertility upturn in several OECD countries, average public expenditures for families in OECD countries increased over the same period.
Fig. 2
Total fertility rates and average government spending for families TFR (left-hand scale) and public spending (right-hand scale) Geographical areas are defined as follows: Anglophone (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States); Nordic (Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden); Continental (Belgium, France, the Netherlands); German-speaking (Austria, Germany); Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain). Government spending per child includes expenditures on family benefits, childcare services, leave and other payments made around childbirth. The average is calculated for 18 countries for which data are available, including Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, France, New Zealand, Belgium, United States, Italy, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Finland, Germany and Austria

However, a steep decline in TFR can be observed in Japan, Korea, German-speaking countries and in southern European countries, where fertility still remains low. By contrast, fertility rates have recovered strongly in countries of Continental and Nordic Europe, and in English-speaking countries. In some cases, this rise in public expenditures for families started to accelerate slightly before the fertility rebound.
In the following, we empirically assess the influence of these policies on fertility trends in OECD countries. Our empirical analysis aims at answering whether and how far the development of family policies is able to contribute to increases in fertility.
Empirical Procedure
We empirically estimate the linear impact of family policy variables on fertility while using information at the country level as well as on the time period level. 6 Several methodological issues are important to deal with in order to obtain accurate estimates of the influence of policy instruments. Potential bias due to the omission of explanatory factors that can be correlated with policies is addressed here notably by using a two-way Fixed Effects estimation model which helps controlling for unobserved fixed country characteristics as well as for time effects. Since these period effects can vary across countries, we also include in our specification country-specific time trends that capture idiosyncratic changes in national contexts. To distinguish between within- and between-country variations, we compare the results of the model with fixed effects with those of a Between Effects model.
Besides the control for potential methodological problems, we also test different specifications in order to control for birth postponement and other side effects that might influence fertility besides family policies, such as women’s economic emancipation and a country’s labour market characteristics. Last but not least, the influence of policies might vary across countries and more profoundly across Welfare States. These variations will then be scrutinized by measuring the influence of policy instruments conditional to the variations in family policy patterns.
In the following we describe the different steps of our empirical analysis in more detail, starting with the equation summarising the estimated model:
f_{\text{it}} = \alpha_{\text{i}} + \beta *p_{\text{it}} + \lambda X_{\text{it}} + T_{\text{t}} + c_{{{\text{i}}}} t + \varepsilon_{\text{it}}
(1)
where f_{\text{it}} stands for fertility and p it stands for our policy variables. X it denotes other time-varying factors. T t stands for period-specific fixed effect and ci t denotes country-specific time trends, \alpha_{\text{i}} stands for country fixed effects and \varepsilon_{\text{it}} stands for country and time-specific random shocks.
The introduction of country fixed effects produces the same effect as when performing regressions in deviations from country means, i.e. it eliminates unobserved country-specific variables that are constant over time. The FE estimator thus reduces the risk of OVB and also controls for the fact that fertility can be set at different levels across countries. By cutting out country heterogeneity, the FE estimator disentangles the impact of policy changes over time from country-constant characteristics that affect fertility.
Reverse causality can also create biases in the estimation of the influence of family policies on fertility trends. Measures of public expenditure per child are, in principle, not affected by increases in fertility, which limits (but does not eliminate) potential endogeneity problems. To further limit potential biases caused by endogeneity, a Two-Stage Least Squares model using time-lagged exogenous policy variables as instruments has been also carried out, of which results are shown in the Annex. Finally, we apply a System GMM estimator which controls for reverse causality, omitted variable bias, non-stationarity and dynamics of adjustment at the same time.
In the next step, we control the Two-Way FE model for birth postponement by adding mothers’ age at first childbirth to the regressors, and by substituting the endogenous variable TFR with tempo-adjusted fertility rates (adjTFR). The tempo-adjusted fertility rate is intended to measure fertility levels within a given period in the absence of postponement (Bongaarts and Feeney 1988; Sobotka 2004 ). By weighting TFR by changes in women’s mean age at childbirth, this adjusted measurement focusses on the quantum component of fertility changes. 7
We compare the two-way FE model to a between effects and a random effects model (Hausman test, significance, goodness of fit) and find the FE model to be superior.
Next, we introduce a series of control variables among the regressors to our preferred estimation model, the country and time fixed effects estimation with country-specific time, as policy settings and fertility can also be influenced by the economic and institutional context. We control for female employment rates (women aged 25–54) and also add female average working hours to compensate for the fact that women’s full-time equivalent employment rates are not available for large parts of our sample. We control for these variables, as the measured impact of family policies on fertility risks will be biased if policies affect female employment and women’s working hours, which are correlated with fertility. For the same reason, we add unemployment rates (ages 25–54) and a measure for employment protection, which allows controlling for the labour market context. We also add the share of non-marital births as a proxy for changes and differences in gender and family norms. 8
A final issue we look at is whether the effects of policies are the same in all countries, or dependent on their overall ‘welfare state’ context. In the models estimated so far, the effects are indeed assumed to be the same across countries, which is debatable as it suggests that policy measures have the same effective influence in all countries. It might be the case, however, that the effect of policies varies with the broad context of Welfare States which assign different roles to men and women and to public policies in providing welfare to families (Esping-Adersen 1999; Thévenon 2013 ). In order to investigate such possible heterogeneity, we run regressions that include interactions with country clusters taken from the categorization of family policy regimes provided by Thévenon (2013 ). Country dummies are thus replaced by dummies for four different patterns identified from the combination of a large range of key dimensions of family policies (English-speaking, Southern European, Nordic and Continental Welfare States as explained in the previous section), and then interacted with each of the policy variable. 9 The estimation model now takes into account multiplicative interaction between family policy variables and their context of implementation.
Fertility is now modelled as follows:
f_{\text{it}} = WS_{\text{i}} + \beta_{2} p_{\text{it}} WS_{\text{i}} + \beta_{1} X_{\text{it}} + T_{\text{t}} + c_{{{\text{i}}}} t + \varepsilon_{\text{it}}
(2)
where the marginal effect ( \beta_{2} WS_{\text{i}} ) of policy variables p it is now assumed to be conditional on countries’ Welfare State context (see Brambor et al. 2006 for more information on this type of models).
Regression Results
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2 show the regression results for the OLS and the two-way fixed effects model, both with country-specific (linear) trends.
Table 2 The impact of family policies on fertility for 18 OECD countries (1982–2007)
Full size table
The OLS regression explains 35 % of the overall variation (without time trends). The FE regression obtains a goodness of fit of 14 % (without time trends and dummies), i.e. 14 % of the variations can be explained by between-country variations.
Even though within-country variations of family policies and fertility are smaller than overall variations, the fixed effects model produces more significant coefficients of policy variables, indicating that variations of policies over time within a country are important to explain the fertility variations in our dataset. The null hypothesis stating no impact of family policy settings on fertility can be rejected for three of our five policy variables: The FE results suggest a positive impact on fertility of income support over childhood, as measured by spending on cash benefits per child. This is also the case for spending per birth around childbirth (leave and birth grants) and childcare enrolment. Expenditure on childcare per child has no significant impact on fertility when both childcare variables are included simultaneously in the regression. Regressions not reported here, which show that the two childcare coefficients do not change in sign or significance when either childcare enrolment or childcare expenditure are included separately.
Due to the higher significance of the estimated coefficients, we consider the fixed effects model as more appropriate for the purpose of our analysis in comparison to the OLS model. Moreover, as the FE model captures only within-country variations, this model is more appropriate than the OLS model for disentangling the ‘causal’ impact of policy changes over time from country-constant characteristics. Finally, the FE model reduces a potential OVB by eliminating country-specific variables that are constant over time.
We now control the Fixed Effects model for birth postponement. We add the mean age of mothers at first childbirth as control variable (column 3), and we substitute the endogenous variable TFR by tempo-adjusted fertility rates (column 4). Column 3 shows that within-country increases in the mean age of mothers at first childbirth goes hand in hand with decreases in TFR. At the same time, all significant policy variables keep their significance level and their positive sign even when controlling for birth postponement, suggesting that a combination of financial transfers and work–life balance policies is likely to encourage fertility. Similar results are obtained when substituting the mean age of mothers at first childbirth by their average age at childbirth when all their children are considered. The policy variables keep their sign and significance. However, the coefficient of mothers’ average age childbirth, all children considered, is insignificant (results available on request). When TFR is substituted with tempo-adjusted fertility rates, childcare enrolment and spending per birth around childbirth lose significance. However, it would be imprudent to conclude that childcare coverage influences the timing of births more than the fertility ‘quantum’, because the use of tempo-adjusted fertility rates as endogenous variable considerably reduces the number of observations, since for 7 out of 18 OECD countries this variable is not available. As this concerns countries in which the recent fertility rebound has been quite large (such as France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Belgium or the UK), estimation results based on tempo-adjusted fertility rates have only limited explanatory power.
Results for the Between Effects-, the 2SLS- and the System GMM-model are presented and discussed in the Appendix.
We now add further control variables to our FE specification. These control variables account for important factors of fertility besides family policies (women’s emancipation, the labour market context and societal norms 10 ). Table 3 presents the regression results.

For all specifications, all significant policy variables turn out to have a positive impact on fertility. Columns 1 and 2 present estimates of the impact on family policies while controlling for women’s labour market participation. These estimates actually give the most important insight into the drivers of fertility presented in this paper. Column 1 shows that employment rates for women (aged 25–54) are positively correlated with TFR, while childcare enrolment is barely significant. Once we add women’s average working hours to the control variables (column 2), however, childcare enrolment becomes a lot more significant, and childcare expenditure and the number of paid leave weeks also becomes significant. At the same time, financial transfers lose their importance for fertility. The fact that women’s working hours are negatively correlated with fertility reveals that work–life balance policies such as childcare services and parental leave are important for fertility once women enter paid work. Even though financial transfers seem to be less important in comparison to work–life balance policies for women who work and want children at the same time, they are still relevant. This suggests that a mix of different family policies is the most efficient way to support families with children, as the needs of parents and children are very heterogeneous, not only between countries, but also between groups within countries.
Finally, adding further control variables to the exogenous variables does not change our conclusions. A mix of work–life balance policies and financial support is confirmed to be the most effective strategy to enable parents to realise their fertility intentions. Labour market insecurity, as measured by unemployment, has a significantly negative impact on fertility. This suggests that most households require financial security and a predictable future to start a family or to have more children, as underlined by Adsera (2011) and Sobotka et al. (2011 ).
Labour market protection and the share of non-marital births are both found to be insignificant. Both coefficients become significantly positive after female employment and female working hours are dropped, while the significance of family policy parameters does not change (results available on request).
Finally, Table 4 reports the results of regressions where Welfare State dummies are introduced and interacted with policy variables. We use TFR as endogenous variable, the five policy variables interacting with Welfare State dummies as endogenous variables, and we control for female labour market participation and women’s average working hours. Here, coefficients of family policies measure the influence of family policies conditional to each Welfare State context. Variations in the association between policy variables and the TFR reveal the role of idiosyncratic characteristics attached to the different Welfare State contexts which seem to affect the effectiveness of policies.

The effect of coverage of childcare services for children under age three on fertility rates is found to be positive and strong in all welfare states except in the English-speaking countries. Nevertheless, the positive association fades when women’s labour force participation is controlled for in Southern Europe, which suggests that an increase in childcare coverage has not been strong enough to boost both fertility and female employment rates at once. By contrast, the coefficient on childcare coverage gains in magnitude and statistical significance for Nordic countries once the variables on female labour market situation are included in the estimation. This suggests that fertility rates are, in these countries, raised by a greater coverage of childcare services regardless of women’s situation in the labour market.
Then, spending on cash benefits appears to be more important for fertility in Nordic than in the other areas where the related coefficient is not statistically significant. This suggests that the provision of support in-cash is especially effective in countries where the living costs are relatively high. 11
The impact of spending per birth around childbirth on TFR appears to be positive in Continental countries, while the association between the two variables is either not statistically significant or negative in South Europe when controlling for female employment. Weeks of paid leave appear to also have a very weak role everywhere, but a negative association with fertility rates seems to hold in Southern countries, where only few weeks of maternity leave are paid even though they can be prolonged with a period of unpaid parental leave (not accounted here). A possible explanation of these findings is that the increases in spending on leave and birth grants, as well as in the duration of paid leave, may reflect the higher opportunity cost that working women have to bear when they have children in these countries where the development of childcare facilities started much later than in most others and where the lack of labour market flexibility makes the returns to work after a childbirth more difficult (Pissarides et al. 2005 ). By contrast, working women on leave receive earnings-related payment for a longer period in Nordic countries, where children are also more likely to be covered by childcare facilities upon the expiry of parental leave. Such a context makes it more likely for a lengthening of paid leave to have a positive incidence of fertility rates, as suggested by the positive (but weakly significant) coefficient obtained with the estimation controlling for female labour market situation.
Discussion
How do our results corroborate previous findings? In order to answer this question, we compare our findings to those of recent cross-national key studies which provide some assessments of the impact of family policies on fertility trends in economically advanced countries. 12 The findings of these studies differ for reasons such as the use of different fertility indicators and different policy variables, as well as different geographical and period coverages. Since we use a comprehensive range of policy markers, our results help to understand some of the contradictory results obtained by the former studies. The interpretation of our result is limited, however, by the fact that variations in TFR are a consequence of both changes in fertility timing and in the total number of children, and tempo-adjusted fertility rates provide debatable estimates of variations in fertility ‘levels’. Comparing our results to those of other studies using other measures gives a clearer picture of the scope and limits of our own results. By doing so, some general conclusions on policy effectiveness can be drawn.
Table 5 summarises the key results of the most recent cross-national studies analysing the effect on fertility patterns of family policies in the areas of financial support, parental leave and childcare. 13
Table 5 Comparison of results of cross-national studies
Full size table
Three studies—Gauthier and Hatzius (1997 ), Adsera (2004) and D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005 )—are directly comparable to our study as they use the same measure of fertility—TFR. Hilgeman and Butts (2009) use a different fertility measure, the number of children ever born for women aged 18–45. Kalwij (2010) uses retrospective data on fertility history to differentiate the influence of policies on the timing of births and completed family size.
Family policy characteristics are also captured with different indicators. A first difference lies in the way the generosity of financial support for families is measured. D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005) use the difference in net disposable income of a single earner family with two children and average earnings compared to those of a childless household with same earnings to approximate the financial support received by families. This covers family support provided by tax allowances as well as by cash benefits (although variations across different household types are not accounted for). By contrast, both Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) and Kalwij (2010) only consider family cash benefits. Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) measure the generosity of family benefits as a percentage of average wages, while Kalwij (2010) considers the average amount of public expenditures per child below age 16 for employed women. In our study, we use both approaches and obtain similar results for both measures of financial support.
Besides our study, three other studies consider the duration of paid leave entitlements (Gauthier and Hatzius 1997; D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole 2005; Hilgeman and Butts 2009 ). Hereby, D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005) as well as Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) consider maternity leave only, whereas our study also takes into account the number of weeks of maternity and parental leave. Leave payment conditions are also assessed differently: replacement rates during maternity leave are taken into account by Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) and D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005 ). Kalwij (2010) considers only the average leave-related expenditure per child below age one, while in our study we sum the annual expenditures per child for maternity and paternity leave, for parental leave and for birth grants.
Finally, only three studies include information about childcare services. Kalwij (2010) includes childcare expenditures (consistent with his expenditure-based approach), while Hilgeman and Butts (2009) test the impact on fertility of enrolment of children below age 3 in formal childcare. Our study includes both childcare expenditure and enrolment.
The results of the cited studies are quite diverse but some general conclusions can be drawn. The present study, like those of Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) and D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005) but conversely to Kalwij (2010 ), finds that cash transfers have a positive effect on fertility. We also find that the average amount of cash benefits granted in the period after the year of childbirth has a large positive impact on TFR. This impact is confirmed when adjusted-tempo fertility rates are taken into account to control for changes in the timing of births, suggesting that these cash benefits impact not only the timing of births but also have a quantum effect on fertility.
Results regarding the influence of leave entitlements also vary across studies, which is not unexpected given the potentially ambiguous effect of these entitlements on fertility. On the one hand, these entitlements support household income and labour market participation around the time of childbirth, which has a positive effect on fertility. However, as entitlements are often conditional on employment, they encourage men and women to postpone childbirth (which has a negative effect on overall fertility) until they have established themselves in the labour market. This ambiguity is likely to explain the variable results reported in Table 3. Similar to Adsera (2004 ), we find that an increase in paid leave duration has a positive impact on fertility rates once we control for female employment and female working hours. Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) find a similar positive but not statistically significant result. Controversially, D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005) find a negative impact, but their model does not control for the development of childcare services for children below 3 years of age. However, leave duration tends to be longer in countries where the provision of childcare services, which parents can substitute for parental care, is less developed. In these circumstances, it is very likely that the identified negative impact of leave duration captures partially the impact of a shortage of childcare services for very young children. In all, we find that the effect of the duration of leave entitlements is small.
The income received for childbirth in the form of payments associated with leave or birth grants also affects fertility behaviour, as pointed out by the different studies. D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005) find a positive impact of maternity leave payments on fertility rates, while Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) find an insignificant impact. Our study, which combines a comprehensive measure of different kinds of payments received for childbirth, finds a small positive effect of leave payments on fertility. This small influence on TFRs (but not on the tempo-adjusted measures) is likely to illustrate a timing effect on childbearing, as suggested by Kalwij (2010) who finds that leave-related expenditures impact the timing of births but not completed fertility levels.
Evidence from cross-country and national studies almost invariably points to a positive effect of formal childcare on fertility patterns. Kalwij (2010) finds that childcare subsidies have no effect on the timing of births, but do have a positive effect on second and higher-order births and completed family size. Hilgeman and Butts (2009) find a significant effect of childcare enrolment on the total number of children ever born for women aged 18–45 in the early 2000s. 14 We also find a strong positive effect of childcare provision on fertility. This highlights the important role of childcare services in avoiding a conflict between childbearing and labour market participation for mothers. We find that not only family policy instruments but also female employment is positively correlated with fertility. The finding of a negative impact of female working hours on fertility suggests that possibilities to combine work and family life play an important role in women’s decision to have children once they are actively participating in the labour market.
Moreover, when combining family policies with female employment and women’s working hours, we find that all policy instruments (paid leave, childcare services and financial transfers) have a cumulative positive influence on fertility, suggesting that a continuum of support, especially for working parents, during early childhood is likely to facilitate parents’ choice to have children. Nordic European countries and France are examples of this mix. Policy levers do not have similar weight, however. We find that in-cash and in-kind benefits covering the 1st year after childbirth have a larger potential influence on fertility than leave entitlements and benefits for childbirth.
Certain unobserved factors influence fertility behaviour by enhancing the effectiveness and coherence of the family policy mix (Thévenon 2013 ). Our results suggest that the effect of each policy measure on fertility varies with the Welfare State contexts which provide a more or less comprehensive support to households making the decision to have children and/or to combine work and family life. It also suggests that the relative influence of policy variables will vary all together, with for example, the provision of childcare facilities for children under age three having a larger influence in the continental area where the support in-cash is relatively advanced. Similarly, fertility rates are more sensitive to the duration of paid leave in Nordic countries where female employment rates and the provision of childcare services are higher than in most other countries. Other factors which are not identified may also have a role if they ensure that policy instruments support effectively parents’ work–life balance, for example by avoiding a gap in the sequence of support between the expiry of leave entitlements and the provision of childcare services, by providing childcare services that match parents’ working hours, or by guaranteeing a stability of policies over time.
Last, the results obtained when controlling for change in the timing of births and with tempo-adjusted rates of fertility suggest that policies can have quantum effects on fertility, i.e. parents do not only change the timing of childbirth, but they actually decide to have more children. However, the controls for birth postponement applied in this paper are imperfect. More accurate controls are necessary to be able to identify the pure quantum effect of family policies. Combining macro data with individual observations facilitates these controls. Micro data can reveal when, in a life cycle perspective, family policies encourage parents to have (additional) children. How family policies are linked to age-specific fertility is left to future exploration.
Notes
Family policies might influence fertility not only because they affect the economic determinants of fertility, but also because they impact and reflect the institutional and normative setting of a country and a society. However, a detailed discussion of cultural norms and institutional determinants beyond economic factors is outside the scope of this paper.

The amount spent per child is calculated on the basis of the total number of children under age 20. Since the age limit of children for which a family can receive family benefits varies across countries, it has been set at age 20 to obtain a comparable population basis. Moreover, the levels of family and child benefits are likely to be higher in richer countries, i.e. countries with higher GDP per capita. For this reason, the generosity of support can be more usefully measured by comparing the relative effort made by countries to support families with children, which is given by the proportion of income per capita that countries devote to child benefit. It is also likely that fertility will respond to changes in this relative-to-average income measure over time.
Expenditures per child are calculated on the basis of the total number of children under age three, whether or not they are enroled in childcare. A more accurate measure would be to consider only those children covered by childcare services, but time series on the number of children enroled in childcare services are not available.
Overall, two types of leave schemes can be distinguished. First, countries which were pioneers in introducing parental leave entitlements provide comparatively long periods of leave (up to 3 years) with flat-rate payments, which make a return to the labour market difficult, especially for low-qualified women. Second, countries where leave entitlements were introduced later and/or reformed recently offer shorter periods of leave, often combined with earnings-related payments and special incentives for fathers to take up parental leave (Nordic countries, Germany). This second type of leave scheme promotes a combination of work and family life for both parents and encourages mothers to participate in the labour market before and after childbirth. Overall, a polarization between countries can be observed between the two leave schemes over time. Only Germany has radically changed its leave policy scheme from the first to the second type, resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of paid leave weeks from 2007 on (a period not covered in the present study).
Preliminary checks of data properties were done to verify that regression results are affected by potential non-stationarity or cross section dependence of data series (see Luci and Thévenon 2012 for details). Stationarity tests for individual country time series as well as panel unit root tests were, therefore, carried out. The results show that nonstationarity of fertility and policy variables in levels cannot be ruled out. However, the assumption of stationarity of first difference variables is not rejected in most cases by individual country and panel unit root tests. This suggests that System GMM estimations, which includes first differences as instruments might be an accurate way to control for non-stationarity of data series (Blundell and Bond 1998 ). Then, a Pesaran (2004) test of cross section dependence provides strong evidence for the presence of cross section correlation within the sample. The two-way fixed effects transformation eliminates cross section dependence in the data if policy parameters and the influence of the unobserved common factor(s) are identical across countries.
However, adjTFR only corresponds to a pure quantum measure of fertility on the assumption of uniform postponement of all stages, i.e. an absence of cohort effects (Kohler and Philipov 2001 ). Consequently, adjTFR only controls imperfectly for tempo effects.
The addition of control variables certainly causes multicollinearity problems. A correlation between exogenous variables implies that interpreting the estimated coefficients becomes difficult, as we cannot ascribe the change in the endogenous variable to a certain determinant. However, we are primarily interested in the sign and significance of the estimated coefficient of our five policy variables and not in quantifying the estimated impact of our control variables on fertility. As we consider the economic context, women’s emancipation and societal norms as important factors for fertility, we prefer to reduce the risk of an omitted variable bias (OVB) by putting up with multicollinearity. At the same time, we abstain from introducing further control variables (one might think, for example, of access to and costs of housing and health care as other important determinants of fertility) to not further increase the problem of multicollinearity (and endogeneity) as well as to not further reduce the number of observations.
Another approach to investigate heterogeneity consists in running estimations for each category of countries separately. However, the small sample size of each category leads to insignificant parameters which prevent us from showing the results. In this context, a more convincing approach is the one described above with dummies for types of welfare states replacing country dummies (and not complementing them in order to avoid over-specifications). Country-specific linear time trends are also dropped to avoid over-specification.
We also add the log of GDP per capita (measured at purchasing power parity in constant 2005 US $) and its squared term to the five policy variables. This procedure allows controlling for a convex impact of economic development on fertility, as suggested by Luci and Thévenon (2010 ). GDP per capita turns out to have a convex but insignificant impact on TFR, as family policies seem to capture most of the fertility variations (results available on request).
Kurkowiak (2012) shows that price levels indexes for household final consumption are comparatively higher in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland than in most other European countries.
We review here only studies based on cross-national data, but many micro-level studies for single countries are available. For a more complete review, see Sleebos (2003) or Thévenon and Gauthier (2011 ).
The list of key contributions could easily be extended if our aim was to survey the literature, which is beyond the scope of the present paper. In general, the evidence suggests that while family benefits do significantly reduce the direct and indirect costs of children, their effect on fertility per se is limited. Furthermore, while family benefits have an effect on the timing of births, their effect on the final fertility choices of individuals is contested (Thévenon and Gauthier 2011 ).
National studies for Nordic countries corroborate the positive effect of childcare on fertility rates (Rindfuss et al. 2010 ). They also find that reductions in the cost to parents of affordable good-quality childcare can have a substantial effect on fertility rates, especially when childcare provision is widespread (Mörk et al. 2009 ).

Appendix
Robustness Checks
We compare the Fixed Effects model to a Between Effects (BE) and a Random Effects (RE) model. Results of the Between Effects model are presented in column 1 in Table 6. Results of the Random Effects model are available on request. We use a Hausman (1978) test to invalidate the hypothesis that the unobserved country effects are not correlated with the error term in the RE model. The test suggests that the fixed effect specification is better than a random effects specification for controlling for unobserved country heterogeneity. The BE estimation obtains insignificant coefficients for all policy variables. The insignificance along with the high R ² and the relatively low adjusted R ² indicate that unobserved country-specific effects explain most of the fertility variance in the Between Effects model. We, therefore, consider the BE model to be inappropriate for our empirical analysis and conclude that the country and time fixed effects estimation with country-specific time trends (column 2 of Table 2) is best suited to capture the impact of family policies on fertility. This means that variations of policies over time within a country are most important to explain fertility variations in comparison to between-country and overall variations.
Table 6 The impact of family policies on fertility: robustness checks
Full size table
Subsequently, we control our fixed effects model for endogeneity. Therefore, we introduce time-lagged exogenous variables, i.e. we instrument childcare expenditure and childcare coverage with its time-lagged levels, which also takes into account time-lagged adaptations of fertility to changes in a country’s childcare context. One-year as well as 5-year lags are applied and results are presented in columns 2 and 3 of Table 6 (a discussion of the methodology is presented in the appendix). The results confirm a significant impact of spending on cash benefits; spending per birth and childcare enrolment when controlling for potential endogeneity. The estimated coefficient of childcare enrolment is higher for the model with 5-year lags than for the model with 1-year lags and the FE model presented in table, suggesting a considerable time-delayed response of fertility to changes in the supply of childcare facilities. This time delay seems to exceed 1 year, which is rather intuitive as fertility changes take at least 9 months to be realised.
The last column in Table 6 presents results of a System GMM estimation, which not only controls for endogeneity (along with OVB and non-stationarity), but also for dynamics of adjustment (by introducing a lagged endogenous variable among the regressors). Accounting for these dynamics is important as the impact of family policies on fertility is likely to depend on the countries’ initial fertility level, as assumed, for example, by Gauthier and Hatzius (1997) and D’Addio and Mira d’Ercole (2005 ). In order to significantly reduce the number of instruments, which is necessary to avoid an over-identification of the model, the GMM estimation is based on data containing observations for every 5 years (1985–2005). The System GMM results confirm a positive impact of spending on cash benefits and childcare enrolment for fertility.
Between Effects Estimation (Column 1)
The between effects estimator is based on time averages of each variable for each country and, therefore, focusses on between-country variation, i.e. the BE estimator allows answering the question if and how far policy differences between countries explain differences in fertility between countries. Estimation with a mean group estimators (MG) also capture the heterogeneous influence of policies on fertility trends across countries (Pesaran and Smith 1995 ). However, since our panel is relatively short and especially unbalanced, the standard errors obtained with this procedure are quite high and probably overestimated (Coakley et al. 2001 ). T statistics might be affected, while the pooled and fixed effects estimators have an efficiency advantage over the mean group estimator in small T samples. For this reason, we do not report the results of MG estimation. They are available on request.
2SLS Estimations (Columns 2 and 3)
The use of lagged exogenous variables lessens the risk of obtaining biased and inconsistent estimators due to reverse causality between the endogenous and the exogenous variables. For example, TFR observed in 2007 cannot impact childcare expenditure in 2006. At the same time, it is likely that variations in fertility resulting from changes in childcare expenditure appear time-lagged. Of course, the use of time-lagged variables represents only a ‘second best’ option for controlling for endogeneity, as this procedure cannot completely rule out a potential estimation bias caused by reverse causality. The best option would be to substitute each family policy variable by a proper instrumental variable that is highly correlated with the family policy variable but not correlated with fertility. As variables which meet these requirements are not available, we put up with lagged observations as instruments for current policy observations. At the same time, the use of lagged exogenous variables allows us to account for possible time delays in fertility responses to policy changes. We, therefore, estimate our models with 1-year lags as well as with 5-year lags to see how far the timing of policy implementation corresponds to the timing of fertility change.
System GMM Estimation (Column 4)
Besides capturing the dynamics of adjustment (lagged TFR as exogenous variable), the System GMM estimation helps to control for endogeneity and omitted variable bias, and limits the risk of spurious regressions due to non-stationarity (Blundell and Bond 1998 ). To do so, the System GMM estimator combines a set of first-differenced equations with equations in levels as a ‘system’, and uses different instruments for each estimated equation simultaneously. This involves the use of lagged levels of the exogenous variables as instruments for the difference equation, and the use of lagged first differences of the exogenous variables as instruments for the levels equation. The use of lagged exogenous variables is useful to limit inconsistencies raised by possible endogeneity, while difference variables control for omitted (time constant) variables as well as for non-stationarity. Our analysis of time properties of the data (Appendix) suggests that all time series are difference stationary, implying that System GMM controls for non-stationarity by the integration of first-differenced equations. The controls are imperfect; however, as lagged levels are likely to be poor instruments for differences, and differences are likely to be weak instruments for levels. Moreover, the use of so many instruments produces a risk of model over-identification. In order to reduce the number of instruments, we apply the System GMM estimator to reduced data which contain only observations of every 5 years (1985–2005), highlighting long-term variations. Column 4 shows that lagged levels of fertility capture most of the fertility variations, i.e. the control for dynamics of adjustment lessens the informative value of the model intending to capture the impact of family policies on fertility. Moreover, the relatively small p values of the Sargan tests (not significantly higher than 0.05) suggest that our model still risks being over-identified. Hence, we prefer to continue robustness checks (Table 3) with the Fixed Effects specification.

The Impact of Social Policy and Economic Activity Throughout the Fertility Decision Tree
Phillip B. Levine
Working Paper 9021
DOI 10.3386/w9021
Issue Date June 2002
This paper considers the impact of changes in abortion and welfare policies along with economic conditions  over the 1985 to 1996 period  at each stage of the fertility decision tree, including sexual activity, contraception, pregnancy, abortion, and birth.  Examining the impact of policy at each stage of the decision tree represents a useful approach because consistent findings provide stronger evidence of a causal link than focusing on just one stage.  The abortion policies considered are parental involvement laws and mandatory waiting periods; welfare policies include benefit generosity as well as state-level welfare waivers as a whole and the 'family cap.'  State-level data over this period are used to examine abortion, birth, and pregnancy outcomes, while microdata from the 1988 and 1995 National Surveys of Family Growth are employed to examine sexual activity and contraception.  For those policies that target certain subgroups of the population, estimates are provided separately for each group and compared to help further identify causality.  I find that parental involvement laws increase contraception use among minors, leading to fewer pregnancies and, therefore, fewer abortions; teen births do not rise in response.  Evidence regarding welfare policies does not consistently support any impact throughout the decision tree.

To What Extent Can Governments Control Birth Rates?
by Soukeyna Gueye, Kensington School,
Barcelona. April 9th 2006
Many countries are experiencing the problems of a youthful or ageing population
and have taken measures to try to influence their birth rates since these affect
their economy and standard of living. Some measures have been more effective
than others, but ultimately government incentives may have little long term
influence.
The carrying capacity of a country is important in determining its optimum
population. Countries such as China, Singapore and Sweden are trying to bring
their population levels back to ones which are neither too large nor too small
to be supported by the resources available. If this is then achieved, their
people will have a better quality of life due to an increase in services,
infrastructure and incomes.
China, in the 1950s and 1960s had been experiencing high birth rates and a
decrease in death rates due to improved food supplies and medical care which
caused a fall in infant mortality. This resulted in a rapid natural increase as
people at that time believed that having more children to work the land meant a
higher guarantee for security in old age. But from 1958-1961, there was a 30%
fall in the birth rate with 35 million deaths caused by a catastrophic famine.
This was brought about by the communist leader Mao who introduced the policy,
'the Great Leap Forward', with the aim of industrialising the country. However,
he paid little attention to farming and millions of peasants were made to work
in factories. Low agricultural production, with few farmers working on the land,
led to severe famines and a natural decrease in the population.
However, from 1963 China experienced a baby boom. Every three years its
population increased by 55 million which helped the recovery of its economy.
Attempts to control the population growth began in the 1970s as the government
was concerned that the carrying capacity of China might not be sufficient to
support a population growing at such a fast rate in the future. Measures such as
family planning and delaying marriages only succeeded in reducing family size to
three children which was still too many. A more drastic policy had to be
implemented in order to reduce the population growth rate even further and so
the 'one child policy' emerged. To convince families to only have one child,
parents were offered a 5-10% salary incentive for limiting their families to one
child. Their child would receive free education; they would have priority
housing, pension and family benefits.
China: phasing out its
one-child policy
But if they did have more than one child they would be given a 10% salary
reduction or they could even lose their jobs. In addition they could receive a
fine large enough to bankrupt the family and their 'extra' child would not be
given a 'household register' (school, jobs). The 'Granny Police' were in charge
of checking on couples of childbearing age and they would make sure that
families under their charge didn’t break the rules. Contraception and abortion
was widely used to reduce pregnancies. However, it has resulted in a population
imbalance, with fewer girls than boys due to selective abortion and the dumping
of girls. Girls are less useful in rural areas for working in the fields and
they do not bring any long term benefit to their parents as they move to live
with their husband's parents when they marry. Many married couples did follow
the one-child policy which resulted in a decrease in birth rates in the 1970s to
1980s. However, since the 1990s, the crude birth rate has fallen so low that the
population is ageing and if nothing is done China's population will shrink.
Therefore, the policy has changed to a 'two child policy' in rural villages. In
urban areas, women prefer keeping their career instead of bringing up a family.
Furthermore, raising a child has also become more and more expensive. The
problem of the ageing population in China has made the government consider a
'three child policy' to maintain a low-cost workforce.
Singapore is experiencing a decline in population and in fertility rates. This
is a problem since there are now less and less people available to support the
increasingly ageing population. This means that there is a strain in the
production of resources for health care and other social services. In the late
1950s to the 1970s, there had been population growth of 4% per year. The
government convinced people to have fewer children with the slogan 'two is
enough'. But in 1984 the government reversed this policy, and started
stimulating fertility as the population of the Island was decreasing
dramatically.
Singapore: all aboard for the love boat
The population growth was below replacement levels. The most successful
achievement at that time was Singapore’s 'baby bonus' packages which included
financial incentives to encourage couples to have two or more children. Parents
were given a tax relief for having a third child. However, by the 1990s there
was only a 1.6% growth in population which was still not high enough. To try to
encourage couples to have children, married couples who had children before the
age of 28 were offered a 7000 pounds tax break. Several additional measures
included government-sponsored matchmaking efforts through a Social Development
Unit. Its aim was to 'romance Singapore'. A month-long festival in the Valentine’s
period was introduced to try to bring people together. Other measures included
rock climbing for couples, a love boat river race, and a vertical marathon
called 'lovers’ challenge'. Tango parties, spa packages, and weekend getaways
like a 'love boat cruise' to a luxury resort were also included along with
numerous other activities. However, these schemes have yet to show any real
success.
Sweden today, is experiencing a decline in population, a recurring problem for
much of the twentieth century. Its birth rate in 1939 was below replacement
levels of 2.2 children per couple. The government needed to take action. A new
law prevented employers from dismissing women because of marriage, pregnancy or
childbirth. This helped push up the birth rate, as more women were able to
marry, have children and keep earning money. In the mid-1940s, a general child
allowance was introduced resulting in a peak of 2.5 children per couple.
However, this did not last for long as there followed a sharp fall in the birth
rate to 1.5 children per woman. The government decided to give increasing
support to parents and benefits to families with children, hoping to reverse the
trend because an ageing population could bring serious economic challenges.
Economic expansion in the 1960s gave increasing opportunities for schooling and
higher education, and well paid jobs. Women were able to combine family life and
a career. The birth rate as a result increased to more than 2.5 children per
woman but this was only temporary since many women found it difficult to balance
a full-time job with taking care of the home and children. The birth rate fell
in the 1970s to 1.6 children per woman. The early 1980s brought more economic
expansion and the birth rate increased to 2.1. Generous parental benefits and
improved child care conditions, allowed working women to combine child rearing
with work.
However, the shift from economic boom to deep recession and high unemployment in
the 1990s put an end to all of these reforms. Efforts to restore the economy led
to cuts in almost every area of the welfare system, including parental benefits.
The birth rate fell back to 1.5 children per woman at the end of the 1990s, the
lowest ever recorded. In the last few years of the decade, child allowances and
parental leave benefits were increased. Female employment remained high but
fewer women wanted start a family, as they felt uneasy about their economic
future. Meanwhile, the population continues to age and both women and men in
Sweden want first to work and earn an income of their own before raising a
family.
Thus in many countries governments have realised that it is very important to
control their birth rates to avoid the problems of over or under-population. In
the past, China (1970s), Singapore (1950s-1970s) and Sweden (1960s and 1980s)
were experiencing high birth rates which put a strain on education, food
supplies, health services and available accommodation. It also meant the risk of
a lack of jobs in the future. Today, these same countries are trying to increase
birth rates as they face the problems of a growing ageing population and
workforce shortage. China's rigid imposition of a one-child policy was
ultimately the most successful, allowing an emerging low-cost female workforce
to aid its rapid industrialisation. Despite recent efforts to halt the decline,
China's birth rate continues to fall. The link between China's industrialisation
and declining birth rates, together with the experiences of Singapore and Sweden
suggests that the economic situation of a country appears to be more important
than government incentives when it comes to families deciding to have children.
Spain adopts baby bonus scheme
By: Niu Yi Qiao, Barcelona, April 23 2006
A recent Five-Year Plan (2006-2010) has been established aiming to solve the
population problem.
In rural areas, couples above 60 who stick to the One/Two-Child-Policy are
eligible for a certificate of honour, as well as 600 Yuan (about 130$) annually
for the rest of their lives. This award system has been implemented in 14
provinces and the municipality of Chongqing. The policy has worked to keep
population growth down from 26 per cent in 1970 to 7.9 per cent in 2005 and
total fertility rate from 5.81 in 1970 to 1.77 in 2002.

Overview
Australia's fertility rate is below the level required for population replacement, despite government initiatives and public views. This paper provides an overview of fertility trends and their potential implications for Australia, as well as key current government policies and schemes designed to increase the fertility rate. Some international comparisons are included. The paper also presents findings from the Fertility Decision Making Project, a 2004 survey which explored the factors that individuals report as affecting their fertility decisions, such as financial constraints and preferred family size. The paper concludes that a range of policy approaches are required in order to raise fertility levels.

During the last several decades, the health of Americans overall has steadily improved. However, many low-income, poorly educated or disabled Americans, as well as people of color, have not benefited from many of the recent health gains for the population as a whole. Across the board, these groups are disproportionately more likely than others to struggle with diabetes, heart disease, cancer and obesity. Some groups have higher death rates from unintentional injuries and suicide than the general population, and others tend to report more anxiety, pain, sleeplessness and days of depression.
Recognizing the magnitude of health inequalities in the United States, one of the goals of the Department of Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities. The document, which sets national goals and objectives designed to improve the public health, is part of a long line of attempts by the federal government to address inequalities. Beginning in the 1960s, initiatives such as the 1964 U.S. Civil Rights Act and the establishment of Medicare, Medicaid and community health centers were focused on reducing disparities, in relation to poverty and legal rights, as well as health care.
In the field of sexual and reproductive health, three government initiatives stand out as case studies of policies and their impact on disparities. The first examines the federally funded family planning program, which was a conscious attempt to ensure that any woman—regardless of her age, marital status, income or health insurance status—has access to the contraceptive services she wants and needs. The second highlights the Hyde Amendment, in which the government has abdicated its responsibility to poor women faced with an unintended pregnancy. And the third focuses on a Medicaid eligibility expansion for pregnant women that revolutionized how pregnancy-related care is paid for in this country. Each of these case studies presents a starkly different portrait of government policies and the lessons that can be learned about addressing inequalities in the United States.
Family Planning Program
The 1960s was a period of rapid social change, marked by the civil rights and women's rights movements, which in themselves were focused on reducing disparities and expanding human freedoms and opportunities. Many in the civil rights and women's rights communities recognized family planning as fundamental to the drive for equality and social justice. Martin Luther King Jr. for one, lauded family planning for improving the lives of African-Americans and offering them "a fair opportunity to develop and advance as all other people in our society."
The impetus for government involvement in subsidized family planning services in the 1960s clearly reflects these social movements, as well as new developments specific to the field of sexual and reproductive health. The oral contraceptive burst onto the U.S. market in 1960 and was almost immediately adopted by millions of American women who wanted a reliable method of family planning that did not interfere with the spontaneity and pleasure of sex. Moreover, over the course of the 1960s, there was increasing recognition among researchers, advocates and policymakers that enabling women and couples to better control the number and timing of their children would play a role in closing disparities in three key areas: poverty and government dependency, public health and human aspirations. First, numerous studies at the time documented the substantial and far-reaching economic consequences that unintended pregnancy could have—particularly for teenagers—by increasing a woman's risk of living in poverty and reducing her ability to participate in the workforce or complete an education. (Notably, the first federal family planning grants were made by the Office of Equal Opportunity, as part of the Johnson administration's signature War on Poverty.) Second, researchers provided evidence that closely spaced births and childbearing very early or late in the reproductive years could lead to adverse health outcomes for both mothers and their children. And, third, groundbreaking research showed that, although women at all income levels wanted about the same number of children, lower-income women continued to have more children than they desired because they lacked access to affordable and effective contraceptives (see chart).
GAPS IN FAMILY SIZE
In 1965, all women wanted about the same number of children, regardless of income level; however, the lower their income, the more children they had.
Note: In 1965, the poverty level for a family of four was $3,130; therefore, a family income of $5,000 corresponded to about 160% of poverty (or $33,920 today), and a family income of $10,000 corresponded to about 320% of poverty (or $67,840 today).

These concerns over disparities and social justice fed into the establishment in 1970 of Title X of the Public Health Service Act, the only program devoted solely to the provision of family planning services on a nationwide basis. Introduced with bipartisan support and signed into law by President Nixon, Title X was designed to make contraceptives available to all who want them and requires that services be provided to poor clients at no cost and to other clients at a fee based on their ability to pay. The new program sought to fulfill Nixon's historic 1969 promise that "no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition."
Policymakers at the time recognized that publicly subsidized contraceptive initiatives can be a double-edged sword, with a potential for both liberation and oppression. The ability to decide if and when to have a child can be a central source of empowerment for individual women and couples. But history—including U.S. history—is replete with examples of deliberate campaigns to limit the fertility of women of color, low-income women and women with disabilities, using fertility control as a tool of social control. Recognizing that there needed to be a standard of care for the ethical delivery of services, the Title X statute from the beginning included key patient protections to ensure that participation was truly voluntary. Notably, it provides a requirement that clients must be offered a broad range of contraceptive methods from which they can make a choice; a guarantee that they would not be coerced into accepting a particular method; and an express prohibition on conditioning the receipt of government assistance on the acceptance of any contraceptive method.
Title X spurred the development of a nationwide network of clinics that has come to serve as a primary source of high-quality, affordable contraceptive services for low-income women. Family planning clinic sites—which number nearly 7,700—are located in 85% of counties in the United States and serve approximately seven million women annually, according to a 2001 Guttmacher study. (Title X, according to the most recent program data, supports roughly 4,400 of these clinics, which together serve nearly five million women.) Another Guttmacher study indicates that nine in 10 family planning clients have family incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. They are predominately white, yet because poverty status is closely linked with race and ethnicity in this country, women seeking subsidized family planning services are disproportionately women of color.
Publicly subsidized family planning services have helped millions of women avoid unintended pregnancies and the births, abortions or miscarriages that inevitably would follow. According to a 2008 Guttmacher study published in the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved, in 2004 alone, women attending publicly funded clinics avoided an estimated 1.4 million unintended pregnancies—600,000 of which would have ended in abortion (related article, page 24, ). The program also played a key role in nearly equalizing contraceptive use between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. Earlier Guttmacher research indicates that, over this period, women of all racial, ethnic and income groups became more likely to use contraceptives, and the overall rate of unintended pregnancy dropped 18%.
PROGRESS STALLED
Contraceptive nonuse among poor and low-income women and women of color has decreased since 1982, but the newest data show these gains are in jeopardy.

The newest data, however, show that these gains are in jeopardy, and, in fact, some key groups now appear to be losing ground. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nationwide proportion of women at risk of unintended pregnancy who are not using a contraceptive method fell from 12% in 1982 to 7% in 1995, but then rose to 11% in 2002. And nonuse has risen more sharply among poor women and women of color—those most likely to have an unintended pregnancy—than among more affluent and white women (see chart). Moreover, unintended pregnancy is becoming increasingly concentrated among poor women. According to Guttmacher research, between 1994 and 2001, the unintended pregnancy rate rose 29% among women living below the poverty level, but fell 20% among more affluent women. The disparities by race did not change over this same period. Nonetheless, black and Hispanic women continue to have higher rates of unintended pregnancy than white women, and as a result, higher rates of unintended birth and abortion (related article, page 2 ). In short, the individual, societal or structural influences that had been working to close disparities between the early 1980s and mid-1990s are no longer having that effect.
Public Funding of Abortion
The effort to make abortion legal in the United States was driven in large part by a concern with disparities, because poor women and women of color were always disproportionately affected by the criminalization of abortion. Even in states where abortion was illegal, women with financial means often had access to a safe, although clandestine, procedure, whereas less affluent women—who disproportionately are minorities—had few options aside from a dangerous, back-alley abortion. According to a series of studies on abortion in New York City in the 1950s and 1960s, the incidence of abortion was much higher among patients with private physicians than among women without their own doctor, and low-income women were more likely than more affluent women to be admitted to hospitals for postabortion care following an illegal abortion. Furthermore, one of every two childbirth-related deaths among women of color in New York City in the 1950s was due to abortion, compared with one in four among white women.
It is ironic, then, that soon after the nationwide legalization of abortion in 1973 (the year the Supreme Court handed down its decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton ), poor women became pawns in the congressional debate over the procedure. After failing to overturn Roe by persuading Congress to pass a "human life amendment" to the U.S. Constitution, abortion opponents focused on restricting poor women's access to the procedure, by withdrawing public funding for abortion under Medicaid. "I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman," said then-Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL) during a congressional debate over public funding in 1977. "Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the…Medicaid bill."
The Hyde Amendment, enacted in 1977, bans the use of federal funds for abortion services in all but the most extreme circumstances: The current version of the amendment, established in 1997, allows federal funding for abortion only in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment. It primarily affects women enrolled in Medicaid, who amount to more than seven million women of reproductive age, or 12% of all U.S. women in that age-group. In addition, over the past two decades, Congress has enacted bans similar to the Hyde Amendment that affect the health care of other disadvantaged women, including low-income residents of the District of Columbia, federal prison inmates and Native Americans. Importantly, 17 states currently have a policy to use their own funds to pay for all or most medically necessary abortions sought by Medicaid recipients, ameliorating the problem for poor women living in those states, but not for those living in the rest of the country.
The Hyde Amendment has had a real-life impact on poor women and their families. Various studies have shown that most poor women in need of an abortion manage to obtain one; however, many have to postpone their abortion. This delay can be substantial: Studies conducted over the last three decades show that poor women take up to three weeks longer than other women to obtain an abortion. Little wonder that, according to a Guttmacher study published in a 2006 issue of Contraception, 67% of poor women having an abortion say they would have preferred to have had the procedure earlier.
When asked why they were delayed after deciding to have an abortion, poor women are about twice as likely as more affluent women to report having difficulties in arranging an abortion, usually because of the time needed to come up with the money. According to Guttmacher research, poor women are often forced to divert money that would otherwise be spent on rent, utility bills, food or clothing for themselves and their children. Exacerbating her difficulties, the cost of an abortion increases the longer a woman waits to have the procedure. In 2006, the median charge for an abortion was $430 at 10 weeks' gestation, but jumped to $1,260 at 20 weeks. Such delays also can have health implications, because the risk of complications increases exponentially at higher gestations.
Perhaps the most significant result of the funding restrictions, however, is that a substantial proportion of Medicaid-eligible women are forced to forgo their right to abortion and bear children they did not intend. Studies published over the course of two decades indicate that 18–37% of women who would have obtained an abortion if the government had paid for it instead continued their pregnancies. Perhaps the best such study, published in the Journal of Health Economics in 1999, examined abortion and birthrates in North Carolina, where the legislature created a special fund to pay for abortions for poor women. In five instances between 1978 and 1993, the fund was depleted before the end of the fiscal year, leaving women whose pregnancies occurred after that point to fend for themselves. During those times when funding was not available, the researchers found, more than one in three women (37%) who would have obtained an abortion if the state had paid for it instead carried the pregnancy to term. As then-Sen. Birch Bayh (D-IN) observed in 1977 during one of the early congressional debates on the Hyde Amendment, "Those who do not have the financial resources have the constitutional right [to choose abortion], but a right without the ability to use it is absolutely worthless."
Pregnancy-Related Care
It may be hard to believe today, but until the late 1970s, private insurance plans in the United States often did not cover pregnancy-related care, including basic prenatal and delivery services. Indeed, it took enactment of a federal law—the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which requires all but the smallest employers' health plans to cover pregnancy-related care—to change the situation. And change the situation it did: The number of workers in groups with more than 25 employees who had policies that covered pregnancy-related care jumped from 41% in 1978 to 99% in 1986, according to the Health Insurance Association of America.
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act played a major role in ensuring that those with private insurance had coverage for pregnancy-related care, but left a gap in coverage for the lowest income Americans, who rarely have access to employer-sponsored insurance. According to Guttmacher research published in 1987, nearly 15 million women of reproductive age had no insurance for pregnancy-related care, and many low-income pregnant women faced a host of financial obstacles to care that could easily turn what is supposed to be a happy event into a period of extraordinary stress. Congress and state governments moved to close the gaps by progressively increasing the income level at which women become eligible for Medicaid-funded prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. By 1989, Congress had set a national floor for Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women: States are required to provide coverage for pregnancy-related services for women with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level—far above most states' regular Medicaid eligibility ceilings. At their option, states can include women with incomes up to 185% of poverty and even beyond.
The Medicaid eligibility expansion revolutionized how pregnancy-related care is paid for in this country. Today, fully 44 states and the District of Columbia have set income eligibility levels beyond the minimum required. Enrollment of pregnant women under Medicaid has increased dramatically under the expansions, and since 1985, the proportion of all births financed by Medicaid has soared (see chart). As might be expected, this policy change in Medicaid improved early initiation of prenatal care among disadvantaged women. The Urban Institute reported in a 2001 issue of Health Services Research that the proportion of women initiating prenatal care after the first trimester declined between 1980 and 1993, falling more sharply during the period of the Medicaid expansions (1986–1993) than in the pre-expansion period (1980–1986). Moreover, the downturn is most pronounced among both whites and African-Americans with low levels of schooling. According to the authors, because income and education are closely aligned, the pattern of these changes is consistent with one of the major goals of the Medicaid eligibility expansions: to reduce delayed initiation of prenatal care among poor and near-poor pregnant women.
MEDICAID BIRTHS
Changes in Medicaid policies in the late 1980s revolutionized how pregnancy-related care is paid for in this country, and the proportion of births paid for by Medicaid increased dramatically.

On its own terms, then, the Medicaid eligibility expansion has been a great success, and today, the nation is approaching universal access to coverage for pregnancy-related care. Nevertheless, the hard truth is that this policy change has not had an impact on gaps in maternal and newborn health. According to the CDC, the maternal mortality rate dropped significantly between 1950 and 2005, from 83 to 15 deaths per 100,000 live births. Yet, in 2005, the maternal mortality rate for black women was roughly three times the rate for white women—a gap that has remained relatively constant since the early 1950s, notwithstanding the Medicaid eligibility expansion or other government policies.
In addition, there is little evidence that the Medicaid eligibility expansion has had an effect on birth outcomes, and large differences in low-birth-weight births by socioeconomic group remain. In fact, according to the Urban Institute's study, for African-Americans, rates actually increased over the period of the Medicaid expansion, as did the gaps between whites and African-Americans. Today, the risk of low birth weight among black infants is more than twice that among white infants. Clearly, more research is needed to better understand what is behind the disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes.
Closing the Gaps
One thing is clear: It is easy for the government to do harm when it wishes to do so. The "success" of the Hyde Amendment shows this quite well. By making abortion more costly, restrictions on coverage of abortion block substantial numbers of women from obtaining an abortion quickly and early in pregnancy—if at all. Moreover, these restrictions fall hardest on young and poor women and women of color.
In contrast, the Title X family planning program and the Medicaid eligibility expansion for pregnant women demonstrate how targeted government policies can have a positive impact on inequalities in reproductive health. But even the best of these have their limits. Publicly funded family planning clinics serve millions of low-income women each year, providing a range of critical preventive services and enabling women to avoid unintended pregnancies and the abortions that would inevitably follow. And the Medicaid eligibility expansion has transformed how pregnancy-related care is paid for in this country, enabling low-income women to begin prenatal care as early in pregnancy as possible in order to improve their chances of having a healthy baby. But although these policy initiatives have reduced some of the disparities faced by many disadvantaged women, they have not eliminated disparities altogether.
These and other targeted government initiatives have a limited impact on sexual and reproductive health disparities in part because they are, indeed, targeted. Rather, achieving reproductive health equity would require a multidisciplinary approach that recognizes the many problems related to access and quality of care that have affected numerous health issues, including diabetes, obesity, heart disease and cancer. Some of these barriers are financial in nature: Low-income Americans and people of color lag behind others in terms of income, employment and insurance coverage—all of which greatly affect access to health care. Other barriers relate to knowledge, history and culture: Low-income Americans and people of color are more likely than others to have low levels of education and literacy, to report a lingering mistrust of the medical community and to speak a language other than English. Still other barriers are related to the performance of the U.S. health system, such as time and cost-control pressures on health care providers, differences in geographic availability of services and gaps in medical research.
The root causes of these disparities are manifold: a long history of discrimination, too few educational and professional opportunities for disadvantaged groups and unequal access to safe, clean neighborhoods, just to name a few. There are no easy solutions to these complex challenges. Innovative strategies—looking at empowering individuals, ongoing cross-cultural education of providers, access to and quality of care, and efforts to reduce entrenched poverty and improve education—will all have to be part of the longer-term approach.
The bottom line is that even as advocates press for targeted initiatives to reduce sexual and reproductive health disparities, they need to give greater attention to the larger forces that drive disparities. Addressing social and economic disparities is critical to reproductive health. At the same time, empowering women and couples to decide if and when to have a child and enabling them to have a healthy pregnancy and baby are critical to achieving social justice.
