I've been hearing a lot about vaccines and their effectiveness, but recently, I came across some claims that suggest vaccinated people are dying more than unvaccinated ones. This really puzzled me because I thought vaccines were supposed to protect us from diseases. So, I decided to look into this and see what the facts are.

First off, I need to understand what these claims are based on. Are there specific studies or data that support this idea? Maybe it's just a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statistics. I think the best way to approach this is to look for reliable sources that can provide accurate data on vaccine efficacy and mortality rates.

I should start by considering the context in which this claim is being made. Is it about a specific vaccine, like the flu vaccine or the COVID-19 vaccine? Or is it a general statement across all vaccines? Since COVID-19 has been a major focus recently, I'll assume that's what this is referring to, unless told otherwise.

Next, I need to think about how such data is collected. Are there tracking systems in place to monitor vaccine effectiveness and safety? I recall that health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) closely monitor vaccine outcomes. So, their websites might have the information I need.

It's also important to consider the population being studied. For example, are there age differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups? Older people might be more likely to be vaccinated due to higher risk categories, but they also have higher mortality rates overall due to age-related health issues. So, perhaps the data is being misinterpreted because of confounding variables like age or underlying health conditions.

Moreover, I should think about the time frame being considered. If the data is from the early stages of a vaccine rollout, there might not be enough time to see the full effects. Vaccines take time to show their protective benefits, and short-term data might not accurately represent long-term outcomes.

Another angle to consider is the possibility of reporting biases. Maybe vaccinated people are more likely to be tested for the disease, leading to higher reported cases among vaccinated individuals. However, if they are getting milder cases or asymptomatic infections, that would still suggest the vaccine is working to some extent.

I also need to be cautious about the source of the information. Is it coming from a reputable organization or a biased source? Misinformation can spread quickly, especially on social media, so it's crucial to verify the facts.

Let me try to find some concrete data. Maybe looking at specific countries or regions where vaccine uptake varies can provide some insights. For instance, comparing areas with high vaccination rates to those with low vaccination rates and seeing how mortality rates differ.

Alternatively, perhaps there are clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance data that can shed light on this issue. These studies are designed to measure the safety and efficacy of vaccines in large populations.

I should also consider the concept of herd immunity. If a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, it can protect those who are unvaccinated by reducing the spread of the disease. So, in theory, even unvaccinated people could have lower mortality rates in a highly vaccinated population.

On the other hand, if there are breakthrough cases among vaccinated individuals, it's possible that some of them could still get severely ill or die. But, compared to the unvaccinated population, the rate should be lower if the vaccine is effective.

Wait a minute, maybe the claim is referring to a specific situation or a particular time period where vaccinated people had higher mortality rates. Perhaps there was a variant of the virus that the vaccine wasn't as effective against, leading to more severe cases among vaccinated individuals.

Alternatively, maybe there was an issue with the vaccine batch or some other anomaly that caused adverse effects in vaccinated people.

I need to approach this systematically. First, define the population and the time frame being referred to. Then, look for official statistics on vaccine coverage and mortality rates in those populations.

Perhaps I can look for peer-reviewed studies or reports from health authorities that compare mortality rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, adjusting for confounding variables like age and pre-existing conditions.

It's also important to consider the overall numbers. Even if there are more deaths in the vaccinated group simply because there are many more vaccinated people, the rate of mortality per capita should be lower if the vaccine is effective.

Let me try to find some actual data. Maybe start with the COVID-19 vaccines, since that's what's most relevant right now.

I'll need to search for something like "vaccinated vs unvaccinated mortality rates COVID-19."

Let me try that.

Data from the California Department of Public Health show the huge disparity in COVID-19 related deaths in September between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.
The California Department of Public Health publishes data on the vaccination status of people who test positive for coronavirus as well as people who are hospitalized with, and die from, COVID-19. Their data shows that the death rate among unvaccinated Californians aged 16 and older soared in early September, reaching a peak of 13 average daily deaths per million on Sept. 6.
In contrast, the average daily COVID-19 death rate for fully vaccinated Californians peaked at just under one in a million in late August. By Sept. 6, it had declined to 0.75. COVID-19 death rates for both vaccinated and unvaccinated Californians have dropped since September, and are now averaging 0.26 and 5.8 deaths per million per day, respectively.
The gap in deaths between vaccinated and unvaccinated people exists across the U.S. A study published in early September by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracked over 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July, found that unvaccinated people were over 10 times more likely to get hospitalized with the disease and 11 times more likely to die from it.
In the CDC study, unvaccinated people were 5 times more likely than vaccinated ones to test positive for coronavirus. In California as of late September, unvaccinated people were about 7 times more likely to test positive than vaccinated ones.
This data shows that the vaccine is not quite as effective in preventing overall infection by the delta variant as it was against earlier strains; another study published by the CDC in August found that once delta became the dominant coronavirus strain, vaccines went from being 91% effective at preventing infection to 66% effective.
However, it also shows that vaccinated Americans have remained strongly protected from serious disease and death in the latest surge. Through at least the end of August, vaccines remained about 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations, according to the CDC.
CDC data also shows that, as of Oct. 7, states with higher vaccination rates have lower death rates on average than less-vaccinated states.
It’s also likely that these statistics don’t fully capture vaccine efficacy, because vaccinated people are older on average than unvaccinated ones, and thus are more likely in general to get seriously ill from, and die of, COVID-19.
Even for unvaccinated Californians, COVID-19 death rates have dropped off dramatically since early September. The state’s average death rate is currently the lowest of any U.S. state, at just 0.3 daily deaths per 100,000 people according to the CDC. Its weekly case rate is also the lowest of any state, at 66 new cases per 100,000.
California’s current low death rate is likely due to a combination of increasing immunity driven by high earlier case rates, plus strict public health rules and above-average statewide levels of vaccination. As of October 6, 61% of all Californians are fully vaccinated, compared to 56% of Americans overall.

Viral Facebook post: COVID-19 death rates in England are higher among vaccinated people than unvaccinated.
PolitiFact's ruling: False
Here's why: Referencing one chart in a 30-page report while omitting important context, bloggers falsely claimed in an article that COVID-19 death rates in England are much higher among vaccinated people than unvaccinated.
The article included the headline, "COVID death rates 4 to 1, vaccinated to unvaxxed." It was shared on Facebook in a post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
The claim makes a statistical error. The ratio it cites is based on raw numbers of deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. It does not compare death rates, which would take into account the size of each group.
The claim references a chart in a UK Health Security Agency report that indicates during a three-week period in October and November, England had 3,430 deaths from COVID-19. Of those deaths, 2,822 were people who had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 587 were unvaccinated people. The rest were people whose vaccination status was not known.
The article linked in the claim doesn’t include those specific data points, but cites the ratio between them — 4.8 to 1 — as evidence that "The vaccine is deadlier than the virus."
However, "it’s not a valid comparison," said Luke Weeks, senior communications officer for the UK Health Security Agency, which recently replaced the agency known as Public Health England.
"Well over 90% of the adult population is double vaccinated, so the vaccinated cohort is over nine times the size of the unvaccinated cohort," Weeks said, "A very small percentage of a large population is still more people than a higher percentage of a very small one."
The same vaccine surveillance report the blog post cites provides the statistics in this context. During the three-week period, it says, England had 54.9 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people among those who were vaccinated and 125.4 deaths per 100,000 among those who were unvaccinated.

DENVER (KDVR) — The risk of death from COVID-19 remains much lower for those who are fully vaccinated, but health experts still encourage booster shots for many.
According to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, 189 unvaccinated people died from COVID-19 in August, compared to 60 vaccinated individuals. The median age among vaccinated people who died from the virus was 81 years old and 75 for the unvaccinated deaths.

Serious breakthrough cases are no longer rare but remain uncommon, according to Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention with UCHealth.
“I’d say two-thirds of our hospitalizations of individuals who are fully vaccinated are over the age of 60 and have underlying co-morbidities; whether it’s diabetes or obesity. The age is really an important distinction,” said Barron.
Barron said the remainder of vaccinated, hospitalized patients are not necessarily young, and typically have underlying health conditions. She said the trends they’re seeing highlight the importance of booster shots for vulnerable populations.

“To have that extra protection — nothing of course is 100% but certainly, looking at the numbers it suggests that we could potentially. prevent that cohort from being hospitalized,” Barron said.
Colorado has administered nearly 270,000 additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to those who are eligible.

Alright, so I've got some search results here. Let's see what they're saying.

The first document is from the San Francisco Chronicle, and it's about the stark difference in COVID-19 death rates between vaccinated and unvaccinated people in California. It says that unvaccinated Californians were between 15 and 20 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than vaccinated ones when deaths peaked in early September. That seems pretty significant. The article also mentions a CDC study that found unvaccinated people were over 10 times more likely to get hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to vaccinated people.

So, this suggests that vaccinated people have a much lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people. But the original claim I'm investigating is that vaccinated people are dying more than unvaccinated people. There's clearly a contradiction here.

Moving on to the second and third documents, both from Yahoo News and MSN, they're fact-checking articles about a claim that COVID-19 death rates in England are higher among vaccinated people than unvaccinated people. The PolitiFact article says this claim is false. They explain that the claim is based on raw numbers of deaths without considering the size of each group. In other words, even if there are more deaths among vaccinated people, that could just be because more people are vaccinated.

The article provides specific numbers: in a three-week period in October and November in England, there were 2,822 deaths among vaccinated people and 587 among unvaccinated people. But when you look at death rates per 100,000 people, it's 54.9 for vaccinated and 125.4 for unvaccinated. So, actually, the death rate is higher among unvaccinated people.

This reinforces what the first article said—that vaccinated people have lower death rates. So, the claim that vaccinated people are dying more than unvaccinated people seems to be incorrect based on these sources.

The fourth document is another fact-checking article from MSN, which is essentially the same as the previous two, confirming that the claim is false.

The fifth document is from KDVR, a news station in Denver, discussing the COVID-19 death rates in Colorado. It states that in August, 189 unvaccinated people died from COVID-19 compared to 60 vaccinated individuals. It also mentions that the median age for vaccinated deaths was 81, compared to 75 for unvaccinated deaths. The article emphasizes that serious breakthrough cases are uncommon and highlights the importance of booster shots for vulnerable populations.

Again, this shows that even among vaccinated people who die, many are older and have underlying health conditions. So, while there are some deaths among vaccinated people, the overall risk is much lower compared to unvaccinated people.

From these sources, it's clear that vaccinated people have significantly lower death rates from COVID-19 than unvaccinated people. The initial claim seems to be misrepresenting the data by ignoring the different sizes of the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations or perhaps misinterpreting raw numbers without considering rates per population size.

I should also consider whether there are any situations where vaccinated people might have higher death rates. For example, if a particular vaccine is ineffective against a certain variant, or if there are issues with vaccine quality or administration. However, in the sources I've looked at, there's no indication of such problems leading to higher death rates among vaccinated people.

Additionally, it's possible that in certain age groups or with certain health conditions, vaccinated people might have higher mortality rates, but this would likely be due to their underlying health status rather than the vaccine itself.

I should also think about the possibility of data reporting errors or delays that could skew the numbers. For instance, if deaths among vaccinated people are being reported more accurately than those among unvaccinated people, that could affect the statistics. However, health agencies generally have standardized procedures for reporting vaccine status in relation to COVID-19 outcomes, so I doubt that's a significant issue.

Another angle to consider is the timing of vaccinations and infections. If someone gets infected just before getting vaccinated, they might be counted as vaccinated when they actually weren't yet protected. But again, this wouldn't likely reverse the overall trend of lower mortality among vaccinated people.

In conclusion, based on the available data and the sources I've consulted, it's clear that vaccinated people have lower death rates from COVID-19 compared to unvaccinated people. The initial claim appears to be false or misleading.

\boxed{\text{No, vaccinated people are not dying more than unvaccinated people.}}
