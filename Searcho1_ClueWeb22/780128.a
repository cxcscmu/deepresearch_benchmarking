As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can certainly help you understand why managers should pay attention to informal groups within an organization. Let's think this through step by step.

First, what are informal groups? These are social gatherings or networks that form naturally among employees, often based on shared interests, friendships, or common goals, independent of the formal organizational structure. They're not officially sanctioned by the company but play a significant role in the workplace environment.

So, why should managers care about these informal groups? Let's consider a few reasons.

1. **Information Flow and Communication:** Informal groups often have their own channels of communication, which can be quicker and more efficient than official channels. Managers who are aware of these networks can leverage them to disseminate information faster or gauge the pulse of the organization.

2. **Employee Satisfaction and Morale:** These groups can significantly influence employee satisfaction and morale. Positive relationships outside of work duties can make employees happier and more engaged. Conversely, negative dynamics within these groups can lead to dissatisfaction and turnover.

3. **Innovation and Creativity:** Informal interactions often foster creativity and innovation. Employees sharing ideas freely in a relaxed setting can lead to breakthroughs that might not occur in formal meetings.

4. **Resistance to Change:** On the flip side, informal groups can also resist change. If a group is content with the status quo, they might oppose new initiatives or reforms. Managers need to be aware of such resistance and address it appropriately.

5. **Leadership and Influence:** Informal leaders within these groups can have a substantial impact on their peers. Identifying and engaging these leaders can help managers implement policies more effectively.

6. **Conflict Resolution:** Understanding the dynamics of informal groups can help managers anticipate and resolve conflicts before they escalate.

7. **Knowledge Sharing:** These groups can serve as repositories of tacit knowledge and organizational memory. Recognizing their role can help preserve and share valuable insights.

In summary, while informal groups are not part of the formal organizational structure, they play a crucial role in various aspects of organizational life. Managers who pay attention to these groups can harness their positive effects and mitigate potential negatives, leading to a more effective and harmonious workplace.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Managers should pay attention to informal groups because they influence communication, employee satisfaction, innovation, resistance to change, leadership, conflict resolution, and knowledge sharing within the organization.}} \]
